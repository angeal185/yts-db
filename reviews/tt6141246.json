[{"title":"True Events?","rating":2,"date":"22 December 2019","review":"Two men made this flight, not a man and a woman. Women made a lot of incredible contributions, but this wasn't one of them. There are many true stories about amazing women waiting to be told without changing the person's sex. It's like Hollywood doesn't believe there are stories about women worth telling, so they switch msle characters to female. Apple made a series about the space race with women inserted where there were all men.\nI suppose this gets kudos in Hollywood, and the independent film circuit, but most viewers of historical movies get excited and take their friends when it's the actual story of what took place.\nFilmakers have so much hubris they think their version of history is better than what actually happened.\nFilmakers are obviously free to make any story they want, but if you claim to be telling a true story try using a little truth.","user":"fleck05-485-208981","rank":[256,345]},{"title":"A Truly Disgraceful Rewriting of History for Political Reasons","rating":1,"date":"7 December 2019","review":"As should hopefully now be general knowledge, this new film 'The Aeronauts' is presented as a historical biography of James Glaisher, an early balloonist, as he breaks the world record for altitude in the 1860s, yet the filmmakers have completely removed his solitary flight companion, Henry Coxwell, the man who ensured the success of the mission and saved both of their lives, and instead inserted a completely fictional female character, \"Amelia Rennes\", who takes over the proceedings and even narrates the damn film.<br><br>At the conclusion, Glaisher stands before the Royal Society and thanks his (fictional) Indian friend and (fictional) Rennes, saying he couldn't have done it without them, even though neither of them existed, and it ends with an implied romantic relationship between him and Rennes, even though the real life Glaisher had been married for over 20 years by this point, to Cecilia Belville, an interesting woman here edited out of history altogether.<br><br>Even without this shameful and insensitive mockery of real people's lives, the film is ridiculous on just about every other level too, and for the most part is just two TV-level actors prancing about in front of a green screen for an hour and a half. The script is awful, the acting is cringe, the CGI is obvious and dull.<br><br>All the disastrous changes mentioned above were made for purely ideological reasons, to meet some 'diversity' agenda, and with the no doubt loudly stated aim of inspiring young girls to go out and... I don't know, do the vital work of ballooning or something.<br><br>I get why some spinally-challenged people might want to leap on board that virtue-signaling express and go woo-woo, but I need it explaining to me how making up history and lying to little girls is supposed to spur them on to greatness.<br><br>A shameful blot on not only aeronautical but cinematic history, this is a new low for the ideologues hell-bent on making the world in the image of their own fantasies, no matter how many untruths they have to tell to get us there.","user":"Fiahm","rank":[592,831]},{"title":"Historical revisionism and lies","rating":1,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"OK, here we go again, and again, and again...<br><br>The film is a major disservice to history of science and to the real people involved in this fascinating episode in the development of balloning.\nThe fact is that the omission of Henry Tracey Coxwell the lad who was Glaisher's copilot is another shameful act by Hollywood.\nA film that claims to be based on \"true events\" should at least give credit where is credit is due.\nIf writers and directors continue this trend, I will not be surprised if, for instance in a film depicting the D-Day invasion of Normandy we see the American army composed entirely of women.","user":"jonasatmosfera","rank":[402,559]}]
