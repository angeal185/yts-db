[{"title":"Back to my childhood. Good for me!","rating":7,"date":"24 March 2014","review":"When I was a little kid I used to watch both Scooby-Doo and WWE on TV. Now, it's a pleasure for me to be able to watch a movie which contains those two things. Apparently, I'm not a child anymore, but that does not mean that I can not watch an animated movie mixing my favorite TV shows as a small fry. If I had seen that movie those past years, I would definitely be excited. However, even as an (almost) adult I watch that kind of films gladly! I bet you'll be delighted too.<br><br>Sometimes, I love travelling back in the past and that movie is a first-class ticket for that trip, don't you think so? Watching John Cena as a cartoon exploring with Saggy and Scooby the WWE City, that's cool. I didn't get bored at the whole movie, even if its length is 80 minutes. I mean that the Scooby-Doo episodes on the TV used to be like 30 minutes, but that's OK, I don't mind. Nevertheless, it could be shorter, and that means better.<br><br>If you remember the Scooby-Doo episodes, the movie is exactly like those: There's a strange monster and Scooby-Doo's clique has to chase it and catch it. At that particular film, they got help by WWE superstars, like John Cena, Sin Cara, Triple-H etc. I like it! So, people, give it a chance, it's totally worth it. You won't regret it (unless you are expecting to watch a masterpiece).","user":"akiskanaris","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"A cross-over of Scooby Doo and WWE done excellently","rating":8,"date":"17 May 2014","review":"Not the best Scooby Doo film or among the best, but still great entertainment from start to finish. Some of the story can feel over-stretched, the film could easily have been shorter and still be effective, and the final solution did feel over-complicated, a lot goes on but some of the explanation is rushed. The animation is top-notch however, there is so much detail in the backgrounds that has a uniquely interesting style, all the characters look great and the colours are warm and vibrant. The soundtrack is still groovy with some very catchy moments, and the writing, a vast majority of the story and characters hit the spot excellently. The writing is goofy but of a endearing and hilarious kind that is remarkably true to that of the classic Scooby Doo, and there is a lot of heart. The story never feels dull and the mystery is a good one apart from some padding and an over-complicated final solution, plenty of suspense and the clues as ever are very fun to spot. The ghost bear is a solid and initially scary villain that could have been utilised more, though you do know straight away from the usual formula that it is a person behind a mask, unlike some people here the culprit wasn't that obvious to me. The cross-over of Scooby and WWE worked excellently, I'm a huge Scooby Doo fan if not so much wrestling but the smart dialogue, chemistry between characters and colourful characterisations really worked. The Scooby Doo characters don't disappoint, Shaggy and Scooby have the lion's share of the funniest moments and the best bits are hilarious, but their friendship has a lot of heart to it. Velma(whose personality since the Sander-Schwatz outings has taken some getting used to), Daphne and Fred are likable and do things that are interesting and different to one another. The WWE characters are a huge amount of fun with their personalities as colourful as in real life without being exaggerated yet don't swamp the gang too much, the balance between the two are just right. The voice work doesn't disappoint, Matthew Lillard and John Cena standing out particularly but it is great from all the voice actors and is actually one of Wrestlemania Mystery's strongest assets. All in all, lots of fun and excellent as a cross-over. 8/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Scooby-Doo is Back With A Bang","rating":8,"date":"27 April 2014","review":"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br><br>Rating: 3.9/5 stars<br><br>Fantastic nostalgia all the way through. Fans of the old Scooby-Doo animated series will love this. It has all favorite mystery solving gang back in familiar pseudo-ghost territory, doing what they always do best. And keeping them company are everybody's favorite WWE stars â€“ past and present. This makes it a combined trip down memory lane.<br><br>But make no mistake, this is a Scooby vehicle all the way and the WWE stars are present only to add additional chutzpah to the proceedings (after all its a combined Warner Bros. and WWE Studios production). It has all the ingredients of the classic animated show we grew up with and came to love so dearly. Everything from the mystery van, to the archetypal character traits of Scooby and his pals, to outlandish plots and villains masquerading as diabolical urban legends are there to make it a fun-filled adventure ride.<br><br>What's more, these elements are presented with careful development, madcap planning, and precise execution, reminiscent of some of the crime busting gang's most famous TV episodes. The Director, \"Brandon Vietti\", and the writer \"Michael Ryan\", merit special praise for this. Even the gang's most famous dialogues such as \"Jinkies!\", \"Nice work Scoob!\", \"Zoinks!\", \"Let's split up gang\", and \"Scooby-Doo, where are you?\" are thrown in for added measure. Yet, the characters themselves take a few amusing digs at some of the more obviously silly parts of the show, like how they never change their attire. Along with the brilliant scripting and direction, the animation flows seamlessly considering the constraints of a direct-to-video feature.<br><br>In true Scooby-Doo fashion, I'll sign off by saying that this is one of the mystery gang's \"grooviest\" adventures yet, and while it's a must- see for all those who enjoyed the show, even neutral fans are bound to enjoy this full-length, animated, direct-to-video feature to the hilt.","user":"DareDevilKid","rank":[3,3]}]
