[{"title":"I don't get Talia al Ghul's character","rating":5,"date":"24 January 2016","review":"First of all, I have watched the previous movie Son of Batman and Talia al Ghul was a different character compared to this movie. I just don't get her motive here. In the previous movie, she would risk her life for her son and her beloved(Batman), and after watching this movie, I am baffled and curious to what happened to her that made her decide to make a clone of her son Damian and recruit a gang of villains and try to kill her family? I'm like, why would Talia kill her family that she loves and tried to protect in the first place? She said \"not even our child could bring you to my side. I know now, I will never have you in this life\". I don't get it. In the previous film, she chose to leave them and went back to the League of Assassins and she made Damian go with his father so that he can be trained so I don't have a clue with what she thinks. And then, she kills the Damian's clone(Heretic) coz he tried to steal Damian's mind coz he fell in love with her. That death scene was stupid. Onyx, who seemed in love with Heretic, saw that and got her revenge by killing Talia during their escape. Overall, the movie was suppose to be good until Talia's stupid storyline.","user":"warayklan-46-505187","rank":[39,47]},{"title":"Meet the family","rating":7,"date":"22 January 2016","review":"While on a routine patrol of Gotham City, Batman (Jason O'Mara) encounters a mysterious new villain known as Heretic (Travis Willingham). However during his investigation of this new evil, Batman goes missing and Batwoman (Yvonne Strahovski), a new addition to the Bat tree, was the last one to see him alive. Due to the absence of Batman, Gotham plunges into chaos and Alfred is forced recall both Damian (Stuart Allan) and Nightwing (Sean Maher). In order to fill the void of the Bat and restore order to Gotham, Nightwing must wear Bruce's mantel. In addition to temporarily being Batman, Dick must not only solve the mystery of his former mentor's disappearance, but keep his crime fighting family cohorts together.<br><br>Though Batman was fairly absent throughout this movie, I thoroughly enjoyed the new roster of crime fighters added to the roster. As many of us know, Batman's vast universe is constantly evolving as well as expanding and Jay Oliva masterfully presents us with a daunting dangerous universe that requires more then just the presence of Batman. That being said, it would be nice to see a future Batman movie that primarily centralizes on just Batman. A great area to focus on for such a project would be the Arkham atmosphere portrayed in the video games. In the end, the story, animation and music of Batman: Bad Blood made this animated Bat film an excellent addition to the DC animated film series.<br><br>7 stars.","user":"crimson_knight_7","rank":[46,69]},{"title":"The New 52 has finally killed the DCU animated universe","rating":1,"date":"4 February 2016","review":"DC had the best animated films. Especially the Batman stuff but now.. we get pure garbage. After Flashpoint Paradox (which is one of the best DCU films), it has just been going downhill and not stopping. There was a little bit of hope with Batman Vs Robin and even the animated Suicide Squad movie but after watching this trash.. after watching Batman Bad Blood, I am officially giving up on all upcoming DC animated films. They can wait for Cartoon Network for all I care.<br><br>I guess my main issue is Batwoman. She takes up the majority of this film and makes it nearly unwatchable. The people marketing this lame piece of trash knew they couldn't call the movie \"Bat-woman: Bad Blood\" because no one would buy it. Batwoman is a painfully one dimensional character and boring as all heck. <br><br>She is just upset off all the time and seems to only care about herself. In the beginning of the film her lack of training nearly gets Batman killed and thought dead by everyone. When discussing Batman's death, she doesn't seem to care much. On top of that, this stupid movie forces us to watch Batwoman's dating life and her relationship with her father and other things unrelated to the plot whatsoever. And we get to she her lame origin story and it is laughably awful.<br><br>Basically, she walks home drunk from a nightclub and almost gets jumped by a few guys but is saved by Batman. After she doesn't thank Batman for saving her, she sees the Bat Symbol in the sky and gets inspired. I wish I was making this up. The last thing I have to call BS on about Batwoman is her fight at the end of the movie with Talia Al Ghul. She goes toe to toe with Talia Al Ghul without missing a beat. Normally, I would have no problem with this but at the beginning of the film we literally see Batwoman having trouble with C-list villains. So I guess that must make Talia Al Ghul, one of Batman's deadliest villains a C-List enemy. Man I hate this movie.<br><br>I guess I should actually review this piece of trash, given the fact I wasted my time watching it but I just wanted to give you a little introduction about my history with DC's animated film universe. Anyway, it is hard to pick just one thing that makes this film hard to watch. <br><br>This review is getting too long and honestly there is a ton of things to complain about. The pacing of the movie just terrible. The action is okay but the storyline makes you not really give a care. <br><br>One last thing, PLEASE STOP GIVING BATMAN A GUN!!! What the heck is wrong with DC nowadays???? We all know they give Batman a freaking gun just for the stupid shock value but OMGoodness IT IS GETTING OLD! I was laughing my booty off when it happened but it was at the end of the movie and I already pretty much given up all hope.<br><br>I had to edit the living daylights out of this review because of all the prohibited words used. This freaking movie..","user":"TheOneThatYouWanted","rank":[41,63]}]
