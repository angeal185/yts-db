[{"title":"Joshua Tree 30212","rating":4,"date":"5 April 2015","review":"Writer with mental problems alone in an isolated house. Things go bump in the night and a dark secret is slowly revealed.<br><br>Solid story that builds creepiness, then turns promisingly weird at 45 mins. But it falls into the class of psychological thriller using ghosts to beef up the tension.<br><br>The acting is good, but the heroine is a dull character. Insomnia, alcohol dependency, sleep paralysis, prescription pills - something seriously wrong with her, but the screenplay shows no quirks, flamboyance, humour. Flat effect, and the dialogue really doesn't help.<br><br>In the end her character has nothing to do with it - she was just an accidental conduit. And yet she has the blood of two innocent men on her hands - who cares? <br><br>The pace and music are good, but the final sequence is hectic - like they're trying to rush the unsatisfying ending off the stage. And of course another plot that gets the implausible cops-will-be-here-any-minute treatment - always a sign of weak story-telling.<br><br>Overall, good build up but it missed the chance to go full ghost and deliver on the weirdness. Make the heroine the villain and you have good horror.","user":"begob","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"Not so much horror, but an interesting and visually stunning movie with just the right amount of supernatural elements","rating":8,"date":"8 April 2015","review":"Frankly I did not expect much when I came across this film, as I was drawn to watch it merely for the fact it is shot in Joshua Tree, which is one of my favorite spots to visit. I must confess I enjoyed this movie a lot and it kept me on the edge of my seat, although it is not packed with horror which I expected. The movie is rather a thriller with supernatural elements, which is more my personal taste anyway so this wasn't a disappointment to me. The performances were surprisingly decent, although I at times found it hard to believe the romantic relationship between the two lead characters. In the first half hour of the movie the pace was is bit slow, but the visuals really makes up for this and then it turns into a great story with a few nice twists.","user":"henrythomsen1978","rank":[17,31]},{"title":"Great cinematography, promising story, excellent setting, irritating characters.","rating":5,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"After the movie ended, I struggled to reason why I hated it. I loved the first half (the slow mood-setting buildup and thick atmosphere), but once the action started happening, I started getting irritated. The action itself was well paced and unpredictable enough, but the characters' reactions (in particular the bizarre amoral yet judgmental attitude of the main character Anna) were what killed it for me, and I found myself not caring about her or anyone in the story.<br><br>For example, Anna commits a heinous act, possibly while under the influence of heavy medication and or supernatural forces. When she realizes what she has done, there's no hint of remorse but instead she immediately shifts into criminal mode, deftly covering her tracks like mob boss, even using sex as a manipulative tool, but then in the next scene she's hypocritically freaking out at her boyfriend for daring to show concern about her pill popping. Also in that scene she does the WORST clich√© of a lover's quarrel: she smacks him out of nowhere, and HE apologizes. The film lost about 2 points right there.<br><br>The 2nd half of the film is rife with moments like that. She continues doing awful things while treating her boyfriend like he's the villain and she's the victim. Oh throw in a bizarre ghost who was also a horrible person in life but now on a righteous revenge mission, and we have a bona fide amorality tale where we're supposed to sympathize with characters who don't deserve a drop of sympathy.<br><br>It's a shame that the characters (mostly Anna) weren't developed more consistently, or at least in a likeable way, because as I said up front, the cinematography and mood setting was masterfully done. The setting was striking as well: set in the gorgeous vast, barren landscape of Joshua Tree in a remote glass house with no curtains. And the story had a ton of promise.<br><br>Instead this film is an unfortunate example of how everything can be working for a movie, but if you don't like the characters the whole thing will fall apart.","user":"rooprect","rank":[2,2]}]
