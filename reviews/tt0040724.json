[{"title":"Classic Western","rating":30,"date":"30 October 2000","review":"Red River(1948) is a film that gets better with age.  This was the first of five Howard Hawks/John Wayne features.  Red River(1948) was Howard Hawks third straight gem right after To Have &amp; Have Not(1944) and The Big Sleep(1946).  John Wayne had come a long way from his low budget Lone Star film days.<br><br>\nThe film is considered a Western take on The Mutiny on the Bounty.  The relationship between Tom Dunson and Matt Garth is deeply complex.  Although they're prepared to kill each other, deep down they still respect for one another.  This relationship is based on control, idealism, respect, and trust.<br><br>\nIt takes a fascinating look at the cattle drive during the Wild West.  The film shows the responsbility that went with driving cattle across country and the different road blocks that many riders were faced with.  Red River(1948) shows that the cattle drives were a cowboy's main source of work.  City Slickers(1991) would do a wonderful homage to this Howard Hawks classic.<br><br>\nTom Dunson, Ringo Kid, and Ethan Edwards to name a few are some of the best characters played by the duke.  He exhibits here that he was a great actor as well as a great Hollywood star.  Its a shame that his best performances were overlooked by by many people during his lifetime(he's definitely a superior actor compared to the likes of Stallone, Arnold, and Willis combined).  It was actually filmed during 1946 but was shelved for two year due to a legal battle with Howard Hughes.<br><br>\nMontgomery Clift stands out on his own as Matt Garth in acting next to John Wayne.  Walter Brennan is excellent in the role of Tom Dunson's sidekick. Red River(1948) was one of the best film to come out of 1948.  Red River(1948) contains a trademark flirtious man-woman relationship between Matt Garth and Tess that also evident in some of the director's other works...I.E., His Girl Friday(Walter &amp; Hildy), Ball of Fire(Potts &amp; O'Shea), To Have &amp; Have Not(Harry &amp; Slim), The Big Sleep(Phillip Marlowe &amp; Vivian Sternwood), and Rio Bravo(John T. Chance &amp; Feathers).","user":"eibon09","rank":[50,62]},{"title":"A film which is spectacle at its best , although spectacle is by no means all of it...","rating":9,"date":"21 November 1999","review":"From 1939 to 1948, two major Westerns done with taste and skill and with an eye to beauty could be mentioned: John Ford's \"Stagecoach,\" and Howard Hawks' \"Red River.\" <br><br>\"Red River\" is a great adventure Western considered as the very best among all Westerns... But could we compared it to Ford's splendidly filmed \"Wagon Master\"? John Ford maintains his shooting eye at a certain distance while Howard Hawks keeps it nearby... But both are skilled directors of a bunch of great movies<br><br>Ford is closer to Western movies, and Hawks to other genre... Ford treats his Western characters as people behave... Hawks displays it in vivid adventure... In \"Red River,\" \"Rio Bravo,\" and \"The Big Sky\" Howard Hawks is far from the magnitude of Ford's \"The Searchers.\" Under Ford's instruction, John Wayne is fluent and moderate, refined in conduct and manners as in \"The Quiet Man.\" With Hawks, Wayne's character prevails differential tendency toward passion and fury...<br><br>It is soon evident that the cattle boss is tough to the point of obsession It could be argued that only men of this spirit could have handled and survived the first pioneering cattle drives One of the drovers (John Ireland) wants to make for Abilene but gets no change out of Wayne When the cattle stampede Wayne goes to 'gun-whip' one of the hands, Clift intervenes It was then evident that Wayne was going to drive his men just as hard as he intends to drive the cattle<br><br>\"Red River\" is a Western just as much concerned with human relationships and their tensions as with spectacle and actiona hallmark of Hawks' films and this element is introduced when the pair meet up with a boy leading a cow The boy confirms the wagon-train massacre, and the boy and the cow from then on are included in the partnership This is not only a key-point of the narrative but also a highly symbolic moment<br><br>For some years Garfield was the only screen rebel... But in Clift's appearance in \"Red River,\" another rebel was born In \"Red River,\" Clift plays the adopted son who opposes his father's domineering attitudes and behavior towards himself and also towards the cowhands who work for them on the drive to market The struggle between father and adopted son, compels delighted interest... Dunson's unfeeling hardhearted style remembers us Captain Bligh in \"Mutiny on the Bounty.\" In the beginning of the film we had admiration for Wayne's persona... We concluded finding him unfriendly, unconscious, unacceptable and faulty... Clift wins our sympathy! <br><br>Clift was the withdrawn, introverted man who quietly maintains his integrity as he resists all pressures These qualities were summed up in the words of Private Prewitt in \"From Here to Eternity\" probably Clift's finest rebel role! <br><br>\"Red River\" will remain a film with a unique flavor It has, and will continue to have, its own special niche among honored Westerns <br><br>With two Academy Award Nomination for Writing, splendid music score by Dmitri Tomkin and excellent acting including the supporting cast, the film had all the concepts of Howard Hawks' quality: vigor in action, reality as opposed to emotions and a faculty of scale...","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[59,75]},{"title":"\"Let's Take 'Em to Missouri.\"","rating":10,"date":"18 May 2005","review":"In the pantheon of great performances by John Wayne, Red River ranks as one of the great ones, probably in the top five of his films. It's what the publicity folks mean when they talk about epic westerns. <br><br>John Wayne is a driven man, he's got to get that gigantic herd of cattle to market in Missouri or face ruin. He's not going to be selling them in Texas at carpetbagger prices so he's putting together the biggest, longest cattle drive on record to get to the railroad terminus in Missouri. He does it with the able assistance of his stepson Montgomery Clift newly returned from the Civil War.<br><br>A prologue to the main film shows what happened to Wayne years before. He left a wagon train going to California with good friend Walter Brennan and later that train is massacred with Wayne's fiancé Coleen Gray along with it. On the way to Texas, Wayne and Brennan pick up Mickey Kuhn who is playing a younger version of Monty Clift. They settle in Texas and Wayne puts together the biggest cattle ranch in the state which is where the main film starts.<br><br>Wayne and Clift play beautifully off against each other. Father and surrogate son, first working together and then having a big difference of opinion on the cattle drive. Clift started a film career in Red River playing sensitive people who you can only trod on just so long before they take action. You can see the inner workings of such later Clift roles as Robert E. Lee Prewitt and Noah Ackerman. Monty made a grand screen debut. And it was his debut, Red River was filmed first, but held up in release and Clift's The Search was released first to the public.<br><br>John Wayne had one of the best faces for movie closeups ever. In his best performances, top directors like John Ford, Howard Hawks, and Bill Wellman realized this. He has a few in this film and they tell the audience more about what's going on inside this man than ten pages of dialog. <br><br>With Joanne Dru, Howard Hawks tries to repeat the magic he had with Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not. Joanne is no Bacall, but she's good and had a pretty good career on her own. Her scenes with both Wayne and Clift have some of the same bite that Bacall's do with Bogey.<br><br>Dimitri Tiomkin's score deserves star billing right up there with the human cast. It is one of the great movie scores of all time period. let alone in the western genre. For me I've always noticed the similarity with the cattle drive beginning with the great use of Tiomkin's music and what Cecil B. DeMille did in the sound version of Ten Commandments as Charlton Heston tells the Hebrew children, he's takin' 'em to Canaan with Elmer Bernstein's score in the background as DeMille's cast of thousands moves out. I've often wondered whether DeMille copied Hawks, or Hawks was influenced by DeMille's silent Ten Commandments.<br><br>Red River is a must, for John Wayne fans, for Monty Clift fans, for fans of both and of great movie music like I am.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[80,105]}]
