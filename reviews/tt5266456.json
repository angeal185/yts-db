[{"title":"WONDERFUL STORY & PERFORMANCES !!","rating":9,"date":"4 April 2018","review":"Really enjoyed this film and highly recommend it. It was a good story &amp; told well , well cast with excellent performances. and It kept me wanting to find out what happens next. A true thriller with some great twists &amp; turns. Good cinematography with an excellent score. I agree with another reviewer that it kept my attention! I don't usually write reviews, but I really enjoyed this film &amp; looked it up. And saw the good reviews which I agreed with. And then I saw a couple reviews that seemed intentionally spiteful &amp; were not an honest assessment of this film. This is a good &amp; enjoyable independent film. I definitely recommend it.","user":"guccinowu","rank":[7,13]},{"title":"What a surprise!","rating":10,"date":"29 March 2018","review":"I just watched Moving Parts on Amazon and it was the quirky poster that drew me in and I must say I am happy I did.\nThis film has a retro fresh feel and what I loved the most was the plot twists!\nIt's the kind of movie you need to put your phone way while you watch or you'll quickly get lost.\nI love these kind of movies where you just don't know what's going to happen!","user":"motorcitymma","rank":[7,13]},{"title":"Awful beyond comprehension","rating":3,"date":"1 April 2018","review":"From the very off with the fight scene on the bridge and the utterly awful acting - Oh my goodness you know what you are in for so better just switch off and watch Coronation Street instead.<br><br>Bottom of the barrel - nothing more I can say , words fail me!","user":"omendata","rank":[8,17]}]
