[{"title":"Pitbull","rating":8,"date":"31 August 2018","review":"Enjoyable movie to watch with subtitles. Good acting and plenty of vodka going around for men and women.","user":"ahussain110","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Polish dog","rating":7,"date":"19 August 2018","review":"After the last part of the pit bull series I thought that this title falls to the bottom. But I'm pleasantly surprised by the production. The whole film is kept in a good gangster and police tone. Eternal struggle between good and evil where good is always achieved by specific means. Dorota Robaczewska found herself in the role of mafia mother, which also refreshed the story a bit.","user":"rafiz1","rank":[8,13]}]
