[{"title":"An overlooked gem","rating":8,"date":"23 March 2020","review":"Director: Michael Stevantoni and Writers: Michael Stevantoni and Tim Rousseau have created a nice gem of a story put to film.<br><br>Brian and Ramona have what appears to be a quite life with a charming child. But still waters run deep and a rift between them causes concern for their future and dreams. The Salton Sea becomes a symbolic picture of their current relationship. Can it be saved?<br><br>The story, dialog, and acting is believable and spot on for each character. The ending was a bit odd for me.","user":"cekadah","rank":[0,0]}]
