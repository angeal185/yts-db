[{"title":"Olympian Gaze","rating":6,"date":"29 September 2000","review":"Fascinating to watch during the Sydney Olympics this presumably official record begins with a brief history lesson about how the ancient Greeks began the Olympic movement, then on to the Winter Games in Switzerland where, surprisingly enough, all the events including ice-hockey and ice-dancing took place outdoors.<br><br>About half an hour of sport in the snow then to London for the summer Olympics of 1948, much of which took place in the famous Wembley Stadium. Distances were posted on the scoreboard in both imperial and metric but times were only to the tenth of a second. (Only?!) Good coverage of cycling, equestrian, the regatta, swimming &amp; diving etc., but most emphasis was on athletics. What's new?<br><br>The pole-vault looked most graceful but the jumpers landed rather uncomfortably in a sandpit, and the women sprinters competed both on the flat and over hurdles. These events were dominated by a tall Dutch woman called Fanny Blankers-Koen who won four Olympic titles. Interestingly there was never a mention of gold or any other colour medal. Rain didn't appear to dampen the enthusiasm of the huge crowds attending many events but it did make the running track distinctly boggy-looking.<br><br>The problem with the film is the totally pedestrian presentation, moving from event to event by the numbers with a camera pointed at competitors and the usual cutaways to spectators applauding. However it is in colour though we expect to see sports film of this vintage (50+ years old) in black and white.<br><br>Sports fans should see this if they get a chance.<br><br>N.B. The title - The Glory of Sport comes from the Olympic Oath, which we see an athlete taking.","user":"eddie-83","rank":[6,6]}]
