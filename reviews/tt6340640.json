[{"title":"Weird, yet intriguing till the end (and thought-provoking)","rating":8,"date":"14 November 2017","review":"It's sort of avant-garde fantasy with moral layers. Weird film, but intriguing till the end. Then I grasped how convincing it really is into its being truly thought-provoking. <br><br>An open mind is a necessity (plus it's french, lol). Several artistic references are there for who can recognize them.<br><br>I feel the black&amp;white scenes really add to the story. The island seems amazing. The cast and directing are excellent! Certain scenes stay with you quite some time. Oh, and there is a fake ending and a little extra for who sits till after the end titles.","user":"wimpers","rank":[31,45]},{"title":"Avant garde and not for all","rating":8,"date":"31 December 2018","review":"\"The Wild Boys\" (Les Garcons Sauvages) is an entirely original film and plays out like an expansive moody metaphor with superb acting, tight and well-crafted script, an original mix of production techniques, excellent photography and sound, and sensitive insightful direction. It will especially appeal to those with an interest in homoerotica and/or class-gender sociology. To say any more would be to spoil it.<br><br>This is a movie that has stayed with me long after the viewing. Fortunately for me, I knew nothing of the 'twist' towards the end and was able to put together the pieces myself.","user":"hobbittall","rank":[13,18]},{"title":"A fantasizing, interesting and unique experience.","rating":9,"date":"13 October 2018","review":"This is a beautiful film, which explores sexuality, gender and beauty in strange things. \nThe whole film is presented in such a visually pleasing way, and offers a new experience of cinema, with the vibrant colours, and the adventurously experimental characters and interactions.","user":"JSVoid","rank":[21,33]}]
