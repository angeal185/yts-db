[{"title":"Black history in a nutshell","rating":10,"date":"8 February 2019","review":"The interaction between Kevin and 'his' daughter felt stiff, but the overall reenactment and pace of the story was interesting and informative. There are going to be lots of negative or 1 star reviews because you know, America, but do not mind that. If you like history and reeanctment in an short comedy-style, you should watch this!<br><br>I am from Europe and knew most of the people mentioned, but now I know other not so well-known people. Yes, I did learn today!","user":"wuyata","rank":[38,67]},{"title":"It's not about Black History, it's about African-American History...","rating":5,"date":"17 February 2019","review":"The show and most of anything (that is made by Americans) that is titled 'Black History' seems to forget that the US wasn't the only country to have black people. The show doesn't mention anything about non-American black people which is amazing. To add (and I'm black), the show skips over making the point that violence (or unfounded hate) against white people today is wrong. Love Kevin Hart, but the writings kinda trash as well.","user":"milesbb-19969","rank":[17,29]},{"title":"Black History told with smiles and giggles. Loved it!","rating":10,"date":"15 February 2019","review":"Comedic, entertaining stories of Black excellence. See it with the entire family! Through funny reenactments and a puppet show viewers learn that Black people in America have made wonderful contributions for the greater good that go far beyond slavery.","user":"nicoleworthy","rank":[10,17]}]
