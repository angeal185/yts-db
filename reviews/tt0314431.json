And it also isn't terribly funny...<br><br>However, there's a certain endearing charm about it.  This movie is more 'small town' romantic than 'hollywood' romantic.  While there are elements that could have used a bit of work (A LOT of work if you ask many posters here), you're not left unfulfilled at the end of this film.<br><br>All I'm saying is: If you happen to be renting movies for a quiet night in with your significant other, make this a THIRD movie pick if you got the time.<br><br>It's kinda like a toddler  drawing a mural on your wall in crayon... a bit of a mess, but in the end, it's still pretty cute.  7 out of 10","user":"da_flipboy","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"It's not without its charm","rating":6,"date":"13 January 2007","review":"Colin Ware (Colin Firth) finds that his fianc√©, Vera (Minnie Driver) is going to marry someone else.

That is until Vera re-emerges with a little surprise for Colin.<br><br>There are better romantic comedies than this one, it's a little bit generic and struggles to do anything fresh or truly hilarious, but it was enjoyable and it certainly wasn't without its charm.<br><br>Firth, Graham and Driver all deliver fairly typical performances, playing character types that they have portrayed before; and the direction is perfectly OK for a film of this type, all in all its a decent film that is mildly amusing, entertaining and heartwarming enough.<br><br>6/10","user":"mjw2305","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Very Funny!","rating":9,"date":"21 August 2004","review":"I read through many of the comments on this movie and decided that I had to see what all the fuss was about. I rented it expecting to hate it as much as everyone else seems to, but found just the opposite. These days, it's rare to find a movie that really makes me laugh, but I found myself actually laughing out loud throughout most of this one. I agree that the scene with Heather Graham bouncing around in her underwear was indeed absolutely ridiculous... but it was still funny! I have yet to see Colin Firth in anything that I didn't absolutely love, and this was no exception. I think it's wonderful that an actor of his caliber doesn't take himself too seriously, and still goes for the fun stuff once in a while. Making a quick buck, you say? If so, what's wrong with that? It's entertainment! I think the problem is that too many people these days expect every film to be a work of art, and have forgotten that the very idea behind making movies is to entertain us. I believe that this film was meant to be pure and simple fun, and it pulled it off beautifully. As far as comedies go, I give this one at least 9/10!","user":"laynagirl","rank":[40,51]}]
