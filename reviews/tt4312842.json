[{"title":"Not worth it","rating":5,"date":"1 November 2018","review":"Okay, I really gave this movie the benefit of the doubt but I just didn't know where it was headed the entire time. The music is overly distracting and in some cases unnecessary.","user":"junaid-47018","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Worst ever","rating":1,"date":"5 January 2019","review":"The background music! The ghostly effects! The storyline! Everything is bad! This movie is a waste of time other than for the lead actress who is hot!","user":"wchowdhry","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Not the worst but not good either","rating":4,"date":"27 October 2018","review":"The movie didn't make a lot of sense and the ending is just silly.<br><br>I'll be honest,the lead actress is beautiful and a big part of why I managed to finish the movie and her acting was not bad either.<br><br>The script tho is all over the place,the effects went from pretty good to really bad very often.<br><br>I'm not sure who to recommend this movie to..maybe people who like indie horror movies.","user":"Zucroh","rank":[4,6]}]
