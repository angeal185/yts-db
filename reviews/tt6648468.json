[{"title":"Accent Molehill","rating":5,"date":"16 January 2019","review":"To donnagray519\nI disagree with you about the accents matter.\nThere are some people born elsewhere who live in USA, whether because they go to school in the States, have family there, have found a better job. Of course they would not speak English with a Yankee accent unless perhaps they acquired it after many years. One need not assume that any and all characters in a film set in the USA are American nationals. Or, that an explanation in the story is needed to tell the audience where any \"foreign\" sounding character is from. The USA is a cosmopolis.","user":"moturn","rank":[1,2]},{"title":"Hire a Voice Coach","rating":1,"date":"19 December 2018","review":"Marcus is supposedly grew up in the US. Finally after hearing the actor's numerous stumbling pronunciations, I checked the actor's bio and learned he is from the UK.<br><br>Then the actress playing Laura has a thick eastern Euro accent and I checked her bio out also. Yugoslavian born. At least Marcus tries to hide his accent but this actress is beyond hope-or talent.<br><br>I like accents but when actors speak with them and there is no good explanation such as the characters attending boarding schools abroad, worked overseas, or even a canker sore that impedes speech, the entire film lacks credibility.","user":"donnagray519","rank":[3,17]}]
