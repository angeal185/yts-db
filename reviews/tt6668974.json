[{"title":"Misses the mark","rating":6,"date":"2 March 2019","review":"I went to a screening followed by Q&amp;A with the Director and others, but didn't bother to stay for the Q&amp;A -- after seeing the movie, I just wasn't interested to know more. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good (hence my 6 out of 10 rating). The camerawork was often tediously jerky: probably intended to be \"edgy\", but instead just felt amateur. I enjoyed the wide shots evoking the flat East Anglian landscape, but there were too many road movie clich√©s (e.g. a succession of road signs to chart our heros' progress northwards). It felt like it could have been made in the 1960s or '70s. The frequent close-up POV to-camera shots were straight out of _Peep Show_ (which also has two male leads, pretty female sidekicks, internal monologues, and so on).","user":"JdePierre","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Gripping Road Movie","rating":9,"date":"5 March 2019","review":"Great road movie with a gripping story. Stirring scenes and great POV camera-work, plus music to boot! Get the album too.","user":"gm-02253","rank":[7,21]},{"title":"Dark and atmospheric","rating":9,"date":"12 March 2019","review":"Loved this film. Perfect English classic 3 people pushed forward into darker and darker story by events. Very engaging and unusual POV camera from original director of Peep Show. Great acting by the 3 main characters that seem lost and yet somehow guided by events.\nLovely sound track by Justin Adams amplifies the beautiful English landscape.\nPlenty of drugs references - echoed Withnail and I in some respects.","user":"markdunnell-14129","rank":[6,18]}]
