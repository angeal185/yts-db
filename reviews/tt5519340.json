[{"title":"I liked the new story line!","rating":7,"date":"22 February 2020","review":"To everyone who had not seen this show yet you don't know what you have missed!!!! This review is for everyone who has already seen this movie!!! If you have already watched this movie on Netflix you have to watch it again!!! It is totally different!!! Well same movie but they have changed all kinds of scenes!!!! All the little side dialogue scenes have completely different dialogue from the regional showing of this movie on Netflix !!! It's like a completely alternate telling of the same story but with more detail of the telling of the story ! If you've watched this movie already watch it again!!! It's like watching it for the first time they made it totally redone and more enjoyable and completely open to a sequel! I would be truly disappointed if there is never a sequel to the show !!!!!","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[44,47]},{"title":"Awesome film. Compelling story, well cast. The critics got this one wrong.","rating":10,"date":"22 April 2019","review":"After watching this movie, I was quite shocked by the professional critics, who had little good to say. I don't know what exactly they were expecting, but it seems they just didn't understand this movie.<br><br>I'm pretty picky when it comes to stories and acting, very picky in fact, but this was top of the line on both counts. I enjoy very much being thrown into an unusual storyline, unapologetically and without excessive \"set up\"... and being demanded to accept an odd new world, as it is, on face value. That's exactly what this movie does, and does it well. The story is fascinating, compelling, and weaves a great tale. Joel Edgerton is awesome as Jakoby, and the rest of the cast are naturals, eminently believable. The action is well-suited and not over the top. I'm not a huge Will Smith fan, but he did a great job here too.<br><br>I've watched it and rewatched it. You should too. Wish there was a sequel or series!","user":"sam-102","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"BOY, did the critics get this one wrong! WATCH and ENJOY!!","rating":8,"date":"22 December 2017","review":"I honestly don't get what the critics wanted from this movie! Especially that one guy who called this the \"worst movie of 2017\". REALLY? That's a huge lie...what about The Emoji Movie or The Snowman, or Al Pacino's movie, The Hangman??? Anyway, if you're expecting Suicide Squad...STOP. It's nothing like Suicide Squad, in terms of the acting, the action, the emotional/serious moments and the overall quality. It's much, much better than that movie, for anyone who was comparing to that movie. Now, It's not Hacksaw Ridge or The Godfather type quality, it's a typical buddy-cop set-up in a twisted, yet fun, fantasy environment. Think Lethal Weapon/Training Day/End of Watch meets Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit. Sounds weird, but you'll be pleasantly surprised.The chemistry between Will and Joel is great, the action is great and pretty much anytime Will and Joel have serious moments those are basically some of the most memorable ones out of the whole movie. There are very minor flaws, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyment of the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed Bright and I think audiences will too, I mean, go ahead and google the audience reviews. It's a Netflix movie, if people can enjoy bad movies and shows on Netflix, then people will definitely like this one. It's clearly a \"people's movie\", not a \"critic's movie\". WATCH IT and ENJOY!","user":"dfoxxc","rank":[811,1]}]
