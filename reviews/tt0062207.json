[{"title":"Definitely captures the mood of 60s underworld London","rating":15,"date":"15 September 2004","review":"Robbery is for me a semi-documentary / thriller based on the Great Train Robbery of 1963. The location of the actual heist, on a bridge crossing a country lane bears similarity to the real robbery. The film moves around much of 60s London in the first part, during which time the gang are robbing to gain funds, plus planning the main robbery. <br><br>The gangs' meeting on the terraces during a Leyton Orient match is well screened; Stanley Baker becomes so heated during their discussion he misses a great run and shot against the crossbar shown from the pitch! <br><br>As for the central characters, Stanley Baker superbly plays \"Mr Big\" Paul Clifton, who is a character that the viewer never quite gets to know the limits. For example he tells the gang \"we don't need guns, the police don't carry them\"; later his wife finds his revolver at home, when quizzed he says \"the gun is because I not going back inside (prison)\".<br><br>William Marlowe cleverly plays Clifton's \"number 2\" Dave Aitken, who is clearly \"nice cop\" versus Clifton's \"bad cop\" in terms of running the gang.<br><br>As with the real train robbery, the gang make a successful robbery; however mistakes made during hideway contribute to their eventual capture. Not least when their contact who \"cleans up\" the getaway vehicles is apprehended at an airport leaving the UK with about Â£50K stuffed up his coat - his capture enables the police to set up a successful trap for the rest of the gang.<br><br>The ending of the film is probably a slight movement forward from many 1950s movies where the gang are all caught - the ending to Robbery slightly leaves the viewer guessing. This is a film for enthusiasts of films of past years, who may like to spot London landmarks.","user":"richard-payne-2","rank":[20,20]},{"title":"Tightly done, no nonsense caper, Yates style","rating":7,"date":"17 June 2009","review":"This movie is well made, with a typical trade mark approach by the crime picture craftsman Peter Yates was. There's no big bang, no unnecessary violence, just the pace that tells the story. This method Yates used successfully in his Hollywood years building up a plot without too much distraction from standard story fillers, which produced great films such as \"Bullitt\" and \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\". In this one Yates gives the audience just enough to paint a picture of a big time robbery, with minimal character development but enough to serve the purpose. <br><br>A must see for the fans of this classic director, not great but rather good crime movie that they don't make any more.","user":"mim-8","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Best British crime film ever...","rating":10,"date":"11 July 2002","review":"This is true British gangster filming at its best.<br><br> The opening robbery and car chase, from Hatton Garden around central London and out to Maida Vale, is utterly brilliant and that's years before the French Connection or anything like that.  Peter Yates was brilliant.  In fact, if they re-make any British gangster film these days it should be Robbery, not Get Carter or anything like that.<br><br> The music is utterly brilliant, too.  Johny Keating should be up there with the likes of John Barry, John Williams, etc.  He seems to have done virtually nothing after this film.<br><br> Even the faked scenes of the train robbery itself are great despite the London-Glasgow express train really being another train on a branch line travelling at about 30 mph.<br><br> They could've made a sequeal to this, too, with the legendary and fantastic Stanley Baker shown in the New World.  Same goes for the late Barry Foster.","user":"frankiehudson","rank":[16,19]}]
