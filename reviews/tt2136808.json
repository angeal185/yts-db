[{"title":"Anything can pass as a movie apparently...","rating":2,"date":"26 July 2012","review":"Right, \"Celebrity Sex Tape\" is definitely not meant for an audience that I am part of. This is one of the most boring and ridiculous movies I have had to suffer through. Well, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, as I gave up half way through the movie. I gave up out of sheer boredom and because the movie was nothing more than an outlet to show off nudity and stupid sex scenes.<br><br>I am sure that if you are about 18 years old and just coming of age, then you might think this is a great movie, for for anyone just a tad more grown up and mature, this is nothing more than a waste of film reel.<br><br>The story is about a group of young people who make a sex video of some semi-famous celebrity. It gets uploaded to the internet and becomes and overnight sensation. The manager of the celebrity shows up and blackmails the young guys for $500.000 which is due in 30 days. What do they do in order to raise the money? Find washed-up has-been celebrities and promise to revitalize their careers if they have sex on video.<br><br>Well, I wasn't amused one bit by this storyline, and to be honest I found it super boring and immature.<br><br>I will say that for the acting, then the people they had cast for the roles were doing good enough jobs. But the Asian stereotyping was just offensive to everyone, even non-Asians.<br><br>I just simply gave up just before halfway through the movie. And if you are a fan of proper cinema, then avoid this movie at all costs. It is perhaps your kind of movie if you are in high school or college, or if you just think these no-brainer movies qualifies as entertainment.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[35,47]},{"title":"Horrible acting not sure about the other reviewers...","rating":1,"date":"2 August 2012","review":"I watched some of this and was unable to get past the first 20 minutes sadly, the acting was extremely over the top and horrible. I could not stand any of the characters introduced besides maybe the short haired stoned looking kid which spoke about 2 times that I saw. I honestly just could not get passed the ridiculous storyline and the Z movie acting, me and my friends could have filmed a better movie if we had some hot girls showing boobs easily with a $300 budget(would not be hard to get some girls from my college to do something like this for some money). Also the plot hole is obvious from the start as another reviewer stated about cocaine.","user":"rcwells86","rank":[19,27]},{"title":"Politically incorrect and sexist entertainment.","rating":6,"date":"31 July 2013","review":"The Asylum's Celebrity Sex Tape is the most offensive, politically incorrect and sexist film I've seen in some time. It's clear that the filmmakers set out to make an offensive film and they succeeded in spades. That said, it's not bad provided you watch it in small doses.<br><br>5 young men of various races (including a Chinese boy who has all his dialogue subtitled) somehow get a washed-up celebrity to bed one of them and they record it and put it online. It becomes a sensation and this causes some shady boss to threaten them with extortion. They have to earn $500,000 in a month or else he'll press charges. They create more sex tapes and the boss then tells them they will have to accept only \"his\" clients.<br><br>All but one of the boys partake in these videos, the exception is one boy who wishes to lose his virginity to his girlfriend and not some stranger.<br><br>CST is chock-full of female nudity. So much so it borders on overkill. The script is very weak, relying on profanity 50% of the time and it has that low-budget look that The Asylum movies always strive for. Regardless, it serves as an indictment for our celebrity driven society and how the famous can't live life without said fame once it's gone and will do anything to stay in the spotlight. There's even a wicked twist ending to boot.<br><br>Certainly not for everybody but if you're looking for raunchy fun, it's worth checking out at the home for The Asylum's product.","user":"BlackJack_B","rank":[5,7]}]
