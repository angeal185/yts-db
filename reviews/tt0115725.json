The people he was closest to in his former life were the French magician and his wife/partner. Therefore it made sense that his imaginary friend was like them.  I loved the movie and though Harriet seemed to change suddenly in some people's opinion, I think she was changing throughout the movie.  The looks she gave and the thoughts that seemed to be going through her mind, were very evident of that fact. GÃ©rard Depardieu was excellent in the part of Bogus, the evidence between him being so big and the boy so small.  How many times have we as adults wished for someone big and strong to take us up and give us comfort?  I loved the ending where he wandered away to help another child. Sometimes in my life, I wish for someone like him. He also has a lovely smile.  Good movie for that time when you are wanting something different.","user":"MEEdmo42","rank":[18,19]},{"title":"This movie was in it's casual style and it doesn't need to be changed...","rating":10,"date":"10 August 2003","review":"I can't believe there are bunch of people saying this movie is not really good. I thought it was original and its casual self. It didn't need to be changed in any way. It was funny, bright, happy, and a crowd-pleaser. It can make anyone smile and there was never a chance I would say this movie is bad. It has imagination, reality, and everything mixed in. The ingredients are good and well done the actors were really good and had a sense-of-humnor. You can tell nobody forced them to be like that and you can actually see they are their own self. Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg (Ghost) does a good preformance and Haley Joel Osment, future Oscar nominee (The Sixth Sense) was also really good. And whoever played Bogus, Gerand .... was also really good and I find him funny and would like to know more about him cause he's got talent and I bet he knows it! I like this movie and this is actually a very fresh and funny film for family movie night and it's a very good selection. When you go to Blockbusters someday, try to look for Bogus!","user":"lovable_always","rank":[22,24]}]
