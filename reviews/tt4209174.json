[{"title":"thriller plot, realistic stuff, outstanding cinematography","rating":9,"date":"18 March 2019","review":"Plot has layers, it is a thoughtful movie that raises questions on life, family and how far you would go to save them, science is real and possibly near future stuff, cinematography and framing of the scenes is outstanding, loved watching the movie","user":"SHR-11102","rank":[44,54]},{"title":"Recommended, especially for sci-fi geeks.","rating":9,"date":"18 March 2019","review":"My only issue with this indie feature was that its dialogues were a bit too scientific and the jargon went over my head. However, the film is very good especially the set pieces and pacing. Mr Haemms who wears the triumvirate hat of writer/producer/director is a man to watch out for in the future. Recommended, especially for sci-fi geeks.","user":"danielrachael","rank":[27,34]},{"title":"This is one of 2019's finest offerings.","rating":8,"date":"18 March 2019","review":"Chimera Strain: A great indie film, made (probably) on a miniscule budget. Chimera Strain is a gem of a sci-fi movie and will remind you of the great high concept films of the past such as Mike Nicholl's Gattaca and David Cronenberg's The Fly. For lovers of science fiction this is one of 2019's finest offerings.","user":"sarakurtis","rank":[21,26]}]
