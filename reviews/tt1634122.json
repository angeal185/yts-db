[{"title":"Mr. Bean turned spy. Good fun!","rating":7,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"Johnny must redeem himself in a plot against the Chinese Premier. He's back and Johnny English Reborn is actually one of those sequels that outshines the original. While he's older and much of the comedy still is at it's very basic, Mr Bean as a spy, it works a lot better in this film. The plot seems simpler, the idiocy seems to be kept more 'in-check' and it just made the film that bit more enjoyable rather than annoying.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[38,40]},{"title":"Britain's Next Favourite Spy Is Back","rating":20,"date":"20 January 2012","review":"Britain's beloved spy is back in Oliver Parker's new spy adventure 'Johnny English Reborn'. Needless to say, the film spoofs the spy action thriller genre (the first titles that pop in mind are those James Bond flicks) and does an excellent job in doing so. And of course, Atkinson is playing the lead so one can expect at least some laugh out loud moments (and there are many of them). The script is funny and the amusing action sequences are remarkably shot. The title role was obviously written for Rowan Atkinson and he performs all guns blazing, tickling you to the bone. Very few can pull off slapstick as well as he does. He is accompanied by two smoking hot beauties, Gillian Anderson (who does a very impressive fake British accent as she stresses and stretches each word) and Rosamund Pike (as a professional behavioural therapist who inadvertently happens to know hypnotherapy). Dominic West does a good evil villain.<br><br>With a solid balance of story, dialogue, action and humour, 'Johnny English Reborn' is a terrific sequel. One doesn't have to have watched the first film to fully enjoy this one. I was enjoying it so much that I found myself wanting more when it finished.","user":"Chrysanthepop","rank":[29,34]},{"title":"Zero Expectations","rating":6,"date":"23 September 2011","review":"A friend of mine warned me to go in with zero expectations. So I did. I read a few reviews around the internet about the movie, going on about how the audience weren't roaring with laughter. <br><br>Well that simply wasn't what I just been through. There was a scene or two where the audience even started applauding! <br><br>Frankly speaking, this movie is a vast improvement over the first one, with heightened unpredictability and more genuine gags. <br><br>I think what you'll have to remember, if you're gonna catch it, is that Atkinson is best known for his slapstick (+silent) comedy, and not hilarious lines like Adam Sandler. <br><br>If you're expecting a deep plot and clever dialogue, you won't find it in this movie - though I must say that the move has gotten the balance of plot, dialogue, and comedy, quite right.","user":"adrian-limch","rank":[126,178]}]
