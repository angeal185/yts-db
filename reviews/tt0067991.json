[{"title":"a boy's best friend is his rats.","rating":10,"date":"5 August 2005","review":"A truly memorable 1971 thriller that has became a bit of an underground classic.<br><br>Handsom, shy Willard Stiles doesn't have an ideal life. He lives with his domineering widowed mother, is bullied by his boss, and doesn't have any friends. That is, until he befriends the rats in his garden and learns that he can make them do his bidding! <br><br>Highlighted by a touching and sympathetic performance from Davison, Willard is a different kind of \"nature-strikes-back\" film. It's a rare occasion where the human characters, rather than the animals, drive the film to its intense climax. There's plenty of twists and turns to be had, as well as a few moments of skin-crawl, especially for those who aren't fond of rodents! The movie also has a bit of a darkly humorous side to it. It's a bit of a rare movie to find these days, but seek it out and hope for a much-needed DVD release of this B movie classic.<br><br>Followed by a rather dark remake in 2003<br><br>*** 1/2 out of ****","user":"Nightman85","rank":[21,24]},{"title":"Rodents Galore!","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2000","review":"A mousy, introverted young man befriends and teaches rats basic commands. Soon his home and life are preoccupied with this rodent infestation, coming particularly close to two rats, Ben and Socrates.  Willard is played with great skill by Bruce Davison, communicating to the audience his despondency with family life as well as with his job.  He has a love-hate relationship with his dotty, doting mother, played with the usual charm only Elsa Lanchester can exude.  His relationship with his mother's friends is distant, and with his employer Martin, disastrous.  Martin is played with relish by Ernest Borgnine, making the audience feel little sympathy for his fate.  Naturally, Willard trains the rats to do \"bad\" things and this leads to a battle of wills between Willard and the main rat Ben(the lead character in the film's sequel BEN).  Overall, the film is rather slowly paced, but well-acted and rewarding in the end.","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"RATMAN'S NOTEBOOKS","rating":8,"date":"30 March 2002","review":"Made the mistake of reading the book before seeing the movie; the movie, as a consequence, couldn't possibly live up to my expectations. Nor did it. But that's not a put-down. While there were some things that irked me (the mother rat's humble \"thanks\" at one point, the rubber rats all too much in evidence at the birthday party, etc.), Bruce Davidson and Ernest Borgnine deliver solid performances that help keep one focused on the twisted relationships that are the core of this film. (Elsa Lanchester as Willard's mewling mother also deserves mention.) I don't know how this one would hold up today, but, back in 1971, it was a must-see.","user":"poe426","rank":[12,14]}]
