[{"title":"Unsympathetic characters","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"This is a totally missable LMN look into the world of seedy nightclubs. A rather unlikely looking teacher goes undercover to investigate the death of her sister a waitress in a night club -maybe the 2 actresses should have switched roles.<br><br>There is an implausible twist and after that just lost any sympathy for the characters. <br><br>Don't bother with this one.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Not good!","rating":2,"date":"17 October 2018","review":"The movie fails to keep your interest.It doesn't worth your time","user":"ChrisStavroulis","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"How does one get to be a bottle girl?","rating":2,"date":"18 October 2018","review":"Rachel (Rachel Hendrix) kills herself in the first scene. Her sister Zoe (Kate Mansi) who is a teacher goes Nancy Drew and works at the nightclub where her sister worked. She wants to work her way up from cocktail waitress to a bottle girl without washing her hair. Add alcoholic mother, PLOT SPOILER sex trade, bad acting, lame soundtrack, and an improbable plot and you got yourself a candidate for a LIfetime film.<br><br>Not sure why anyone would go through all the trouble to import exotic women and drug them so rich guys can have sex with them when it would be cheaper and easier to hire escorts. The film was idiotic.<br><br>Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[1,1]}]
