[{"title":"A moving and thought provoking romance outside ordinary reality","rating":9,"date":"27 February 2017","review":"I saw this film on holiday in Bangkok recently and it was so much better than I thought it was going to be. I didn't have too much trouble working out the 'twist', truth is the title is a spoiler anyway. But that didn't stop the enjoyment, in fact it made you think more about the situation the two lead characters were in and the consequences that would mean to them.<br><br>In fact my only regret is that this won't get seen by a wider audience, or perhaps worse still it will get remade into a version much worse than this one. For now all I can say is see it, it will make you realize how much more complicated life could be.","user":"aurora121","rank":[33,36]},{"title":"Torment","rating":7,"date":"17 August 2019","review":"Nana Komatsu is Hawt, but this movie is torture.\nImagine you hit her up, make a pass and she says YES! bingo a glorious moment who gets a chick that pretty and thin to say yes. Then she shows up on time, cooks too and lets you enter her. Super fantasy!<br><br>But there is a twist. There always is. No she does not take her clothes off for the man to find she is tattooed, has a tramp stamp or has a snake on her calf or whatever!! It is a twist that is drastic because she remains beautiful yet....","user":"karsansocrates","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"one of the best romantic movie I have seen in ages","rating":10,"date":"23 February 2017","review":"I think this movie didn't get much reputation that its deserve outside Asian; I would highly recommend you to give it a chance the story is well written and the logic of it is debatable. it might be hard to get at first but they have an interest transition to make you understand. the problem is that they might not be an English dub anytime soon due to its popularity. still give it a try.","user":"pattarapon-47762","rank":[19,22]}]
