[{"title":"Artistic Exploration of Sexuality","rating":7,"date":"26 February 2005","review":"Sang-soo Hong has done it again: he has made another controversial film that deals with the in-depth investigation of human sexuality, this time focusing solely on it from the perspective of two old friends meeting up again, one a successful college professor and the other a struggling film-maker.<br><br>From beginning to end, Hong lures you into the film by showing provocative sexual scenes and events, and really laying before us just how chaotic and disturbing sex can be, as well as how fulfilling it is. In between comical exchanges between the main characters, there lies a great deal of tragedy. Like many Korean films, it bended genres.<br><br>The acting was always as realistic as Hong aimed for in previous films like Power of Kangwon Province, and the story just as equally real -- focusing on very real dialog and very real occurrences. One can feel a close relationship to every character in the movie from start to finish. The mood is very real, and the soundtrack that accompanies it was very appropriate.<br><br>A uniquely artistic film that encourages the viewer to connect the dots, and a very real 'slice-of-life' film, I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys artistic film in general, or who has an interest in tackling some major issues about sexuality. It was another well-done piece by Hong, and I look forward to seeing more work by him in the future.","user":"jmverville","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Quietly Engaging, An Authentic, Heartfelt Look at Matters of the Heart","rating":7,"date":"5 September 2006","review":"It's been a while since I watched the amusingly titled \"Woman is the Future of Man\" at the Quad. More than a year and 2 Hong Sang-Soo films later it remains among my favorite films.<br><br>While it's always refreshing and welcome to see films depart from the pyrotechnics of the Hollywood school of film-making, some films' subtlety and quietness are rather oppressive (Tsai Ming-Liang immediately comes to mind). I think I have a longer attention span than the average film-goer, however, I have to admit that I can't sit through all kinds of slow films. Some are worth the challenge, others end up embodying the stereotype of the inaccessible art film. Hong's film would've looked like art house snobbery in action if not for the fact that it's made in a very straightforward manner focusing mainly on the most basic of emotions (and the complicated situations emanating from them). The style of film-making is so cinema verite, so unobtrusive, it's a joy to go beyond being a member of the audience and feel like an actual passerby. The best, most memorable celluloid stories stay in your mind as films but \"Woman\" is a story so well-told it feels more like snippets from somebody's life told by a close friend.<br><br>Hong Sang-soo's \"Woman is the Future of Man\" is yet another great addition to the impressive national cinema of South Korea and one that pushes me to continue exploring more of this body of work. It's raw, naked jealousy, regret, love, lust, and longing. It's a bittersweet reminder for anyone who's ever experienced romantic love and its many variations and deviations. This is it how it happens and somehow Mr. Hong has captured it through the magic of cinema.","user":"gonzagaext","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"A slice of life","rating":5,"date":"9 May 2005","review":"I enjoy these outtakes of real life films very much, if they are done right it feels like you can watch and watch for hours on end without feeling bored, another Korean example of this type of film is 'Nakta dul' which I think is better.<br><br>The actors are good and fit their respective roles well and its a realistic portrait of these people. That is for the situations they are in as well. The role sex has here makes me a bit embarrassed to be a male, the guilty mood is created by sexual desire and the lenghts they take to fulfill it. \"We don't have real culture, people are only thinking of sex\" or something along the similar lines was uttered in the caf√©, somehow it sums it up.<br><br>Its an OK movie that I give a 5 of 10.","user":"Atavisten","rank":[7,11]}]
