[{"title":"Just more crap.","rating":1,"date":"3 February 2019","review":"I no longer have faith in the IMDB viewer rating system. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. It is a movie comprised of a few worn out comedy formulas that only someone born after 2010 isn't tired of. Barely worth commenting on except to save someone else from making the same mistake clicking on it.","user":"jessicalmiller","rank":[28,37]},{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"19 June 2019","review":"This got boring and annoying very quickly.
