[{"title":"Okay i guess","rating":5,"date":"6 September 2019","review":"The film is a french rom-com that sometimes hints at being some kind if neo-noir, but none of the build up is ever well payed. It has some interesting choices, but it's cinematography is dull. The characters have a lot of hateful characteristics but you end up kind of understanding their point of view, maybe even liking them a little bit. There are a lot of questions made by the film thatyou could argue at never getting an answer. It's not bad, it's not great, it's okay, you can whatch it if you really like french movies","user":"chorizovillella","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Slightly more than a rom-com...","rating":7,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"On the face of it, this is just a simple romantic comedy. The three leading characters all engage in a bit of swapping and sharing. The writing has all the depth of a puddle and there isn't much unpredictable for us here. It does, however, have something about it - there is a dynamic between them and the plot is oddly believable in a mischievous sort of way. It makes for a perfectly watchable hour and a quarter, and leaves you afterwards thinking if perhaps you could suggest your partner were to go live with someone else who fancies them.... Perhaps not!","user":"CelluRob","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"!5 minutes in and you will be hooked","rating":9,"date":"7 October 2019","review":"When I started watching this movie my first impression was 'oh, another pain &amp; angst love story'. But after !5 minutes into the film I was hooked and had to see it to the ending.<br><br>There is a sudden and unexpected statement from one of the main characters that captured my attention at about the 15 minute mark and I was hooked on what was going to happen to Abel, Marianne, Eve, and Joseph!<br><br>This movie will leave you guessing and wanting more at the end. Louis Garrel did a superb writing/directing/acting job here and kudos to him!","user":"cekadah","rank":[6,8]}]
