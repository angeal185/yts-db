[{"title":"But the first movie was so bad!!","rating":1,"date":"23 October 2019","review":"Don't waste ya money, not scary, and kinda lame. I watched it and I laughed. I could say everything that was wrong with it but I'd go on forever. It's a good idea (I guess) but the delivery of the plot and cast was just laughable. it was a waste of time in my opinion the first one was not to good but a lot better compared to this one, no one will remember this movie in a few years. The first film was bad, but at least it tried to be original. I don't even know why I wasted my time. The film is sooooo horrible, avoid it.","user":"MajidMsa","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Generic, Bland, Done to Death.","rating":3,"date":"16 October 2019","review":"It's a really slow movie, quite a few jump scares but ones that you'll see coming from a mile away.<br><br>Barely cohesive story; the play from the first movie has become an online challenge (yet somehow nobody is noticing that EVERYONE dies from it.) Not impressed by these movies that try to millenial-ise the story by making it social network-based, it does nothing for the story and it's already been done a million times.<br><br>Not many deaths, not much explanation or reasoning behind anything, just \"reading this kills people.\" Crappy characters with some SEVERELY first world problems. (Oh no, not enough youtube followers for my family to love me!)<br><br>Better off wasting your time other places.","user":"dan_da_man-60288","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Main actress will get on your nerves really fast...","rating":1,"date":"10 November 2019","review":"Pretty generic and actually boring, if I'm being honest. Liked the first film, but this is just lame, I guess. Main characters are cookie cutter and pretty annoying. You definitely will not want to watch this more than once.","user":"kwilhelmi","rank":[11,14]}]
