[{"title":"its not the best, but","rating":6,"date":"27 June 2019","review":"It will survive in the land of b-movies. its a revenge/vigilantish flick that happens in and around the metropolitan area of los angeles,ca. usa. its a gang conflict over territories that goes totally wrong and collateral damage appears as a youn girl and her mothers gets shot. the husband sitting back goes grim of revenge, and tries in a very spontanious attempt to kill the culprits blinded by the rage, but he fails and gets arrested as the gang of gangsters had already called the police. in jail he goes and mamy the story tell the rest by itself,so have a look.<br><br>its a b-movie, and the acting showing signs of very inexperienced acting, and some of the sewing of the editor could have been better done, but there are some relly good fistfights,without any limbs lost or beheadings done,and just a tiny little bit of reallike looking blood to spice up the hot dog. there are some good shootouts too as the title hollow point says.<br><br>the filmography and especially the ''night''filming are brilliantly done, and the score are pretty original and quite invigorating. so the grumpy old man thinks that if you wanna see a tough semi pro movie at your night off,then have a look at this.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[17,30]},{"title":"Worst movie ever","rating":1,"date":"9 July 2019","review":"Wow this film blows, hammy acting, terrible story line and terrible production and directing, not sure who let this pooch of a film get released but they should be jailed, I struggled to think of worse movie than this....
