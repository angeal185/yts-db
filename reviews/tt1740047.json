[{"title":"Intelligent males on screen without Explosions or Gas!","rating":19,"date":"19 November 2011","review":"You can read the story synopsis elsewhere on these pages. My review is all about how thoroughly enjoyable it was to see two intelligent men on screen. It's something rare in American male testosterone driven films which are aimed at the teeny bopper male group. This film ran a gamut of references fro Coleridge to ABBA and never missed a beat.<br><br>I really just want to salute the movie as a triumph that says you don't need bombs, explosions or farts to make a film enjoyable. The conversations ran so smoothly. One would have thought them natural as in a cinema verite...........I knew nothing of the stars nor their UK experience and CV.............I just enjoyed listening to them without any prior historical context...........it also made me want to visit northern England to enjoy the food, scenes and outdoors. Worth a watch on a nice quiet peaceful American night. Maybe it will rub off on us.","user":"josephlord-1","rank":[52,59]},{"title":"All I can say is HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","rating":9,"date":"26 July 2012","review":"If you have 2 minutes to waste reading this review, I suggest instead you go to Youtube, search \"the trip michael caine\" and watch it. If it makes you laugh, expect more of the same in this movie. If it doesn't do anything for you, then don't bother watching the film. Although I can't imagine any human with a pulse not being tickled by that great scene.<br><br>\"The Trip\" has no real story. As explained in the first 10 seconds of the film, it's simply about Steve Coogan (played by Steve Coogan) who reluctantly invites his quasi-friend Rob Brydon (played by Rob Brydon) in on an assignment reviewing restaurants in northern UK.<br><br>What follows is 172 minutes of bizarre, awkward and painful humour which, like in the \"Michael Caine\" clip, centers around the 2 quirky characters and their polite antagonism of each other. If you haven't already seen the Coogan-Brydon schtick (as in \"Tristram Shandy: A Cock &amp; Bull Story\") I can only describe it as classic. It's almost a throwback to Laurel &amp; Hardy or Abbot &amp; Costello but with intelligence rather than slapstick. Coogan plays the somewhat superior egotist while Brydon plays the clown (who always gets the better of his counterpart).<br><br>\"The Trip\" was originally a 6-part series that aired on BBC in 2010, strung into a feature film released in 2011. The whole show was largely improvised, and in the excellent bonus features on the film DVD we can see the evolution of their routines as well as some other gags that didn't make it to the final version (such as the hilariously surreal \"C-NT SONG\" and accompanying dance choreography).<br><br>The pacing of the film is somewhat slow, but that works to its advantage. It makes the whole experience flow realistically, not contrived. The gags are like islands of hilarity in a sea of Coogan's otherwise dreary life. Also note, even though I said there's no story, there actually is if you read between the lines. Ironically, it's a rather heavy story touching on the themes of loneliness, dissatisfaction and Shakespearean \"sound and fury signifying nothing\". I was extremely impressed that director Michael Winterbottom could make such a funny film within such a bleak premise.<br><br>Watch it closely and you'll be both entertained and affected. Films I'd compare this to are \"Tristram Shandy\" (another excellent Coogan-Brydon-Winterbottom collaboration), \"Coffee and Cigarettes\" (also featuring Coogan in a stylish, artistic comedy by Jim Jarmusch) and some of the Christopher Guest films, such as \"A Mighty Wind\" and \"Best in Show\".","user":"rooprect","rank":[25,30]},{"title":"Watch the TV Series Instead","rating":9,"date":"2 June 2011","review":"The Trip, the television program, is a poignant, rambling, beautiful little series, starring comedians Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as fictionalized versions of themselves.<br><br>The Trip, the film, which I was able to catch at a packed SIFF screening, is an edited version of the television show. The six episode series clocks in at about 180 minutes, and the film, at 107 minutes, feels truncated and rushed comparatively. Both follow these hilarious gents as they review restaurants in the English countryside, but with those seventy-so minutes edited out, much of the nuance and poignancy is lostâ€”the tone shifts from somber (but funny), to seemingly desperate for laughs. The film does often get those laughs (Coogan and Brydon, in their largely improvised conversations, are very humorous), but it fails to really make much impact beyond providing entertainment. The more melancholy scenes retained from the television series often feel tacked-on, and the transition between jokes and sentiment clunky, with quiet moments and breathing time largely cut out.<br><br>Audiences looking for droll popcorn fare will not be disappointed, but those wanting to be genuinely moved should skip the flick and instead seek out the superlative television series, using whatever means they can.","user":"pontoffelpock","rank":[61,80]}]
