[{"title":"Principal Crazy","rating":4,"date":"8 February 2015","review":"Greetings again from the darkness. If you have been looking for proof that there is a difference between \"crazy in love\" and \"crazy and in love\", this first feature film from director Luke Matheny (God of Love, Live action short film Oscar winner in 2011) should end your search. It's also a return to the big screen for Matt LeBlanc, who, despite an extremely successful TV career (\"Friends\", \"Episodes\"), has never quite clicked with movie goers.<br><br>Mr. LeBlanc stars as Charlie Darby, an energetic elementary school principal beloved by his students and liked by everyone  except those with whom he falls in love. In what comes across as a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde syndrome, Charlie's charms and romantic notions make it easy for him to connect. But once he falls, a psychotic reaction occurs within his brain and he becomes sociopathically jealous and paranoid and worried sick about things that might happen and things he has imagined to have happened. Charlie's love reactions are played for laughs, but there is also a sense of sadness and danger that is left unexplored.<br><br>Writer Dean Young (\"King of the Hill\") goes for the conventional approach despite Charlie's unconventional affliction. The laughs are small rather than guffaws, and LeBlanc's genuine likability makes us pull for him to break free from this socially crippling behavior. Adam Rodriguez (\"CSI: Miami\") plays Jason, Charlie's very supportive best friend, and the narrator of the story. His character provides what little insight we get into what happens to Charlie. Ali Larter plays Molly, the most recent object of desire for Charlie. Larter and LeBlanc are very good together, but that doesn't ease the awkwardness of Charlie's reactionary ways.<br><br>Other supporting work is provided by Chevy Chase, as Charlie's lonely porn-addicted neighbor (a glimpse at Charlie's future?); Kristen Johnston as an ex-girlfriend and counselor trying to help; the always funny Rachael Harris as a vile and disgusting Charlie date; and the wonderful Connie Sawyer as Nana Bebe. If you are unfamiliar with Ms. Sawyer, she recently turned 102 years old and has appeared as Mrs. Sullivan in a couple of \"Ray Donovan\" episodes, plus most every seminal TV series since the 1960's (except, ironically, \"Friends\").<br><br>Most will find the movie likable  just like its star. It's best if you not expect a story with an edge or any real insight into human nature or relationships. The screwball musical score is enough to remind us that the film is not taking a serious approach to Charlie's psychotic affliction, yet it does remind us that we all go a bit crazy when we fall in love – let's just hope that it's not a Charlie-type crazy.","user":"ferguson-6","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"A movie I did like and was a little more than your typical run of the mill rom-com.","rating":6,"date":"15 May 2015","review":"\"We all go a little crazy when we fall in love.\" Charlie Darby (LeBlanc) is a well liked principal but has troubles when it comes to falling in love. The minute he thinks he is in love he becomes instantly jealous and his mind messes with him. Any little thought makes him nervous and sets him off. He decides to never fall in love again, but when he meets Molly (Larter) his plans change. This isn't a terrible movie and I did like it. Like most romantic comedies it follows the cookie cutter formula but this one actually has a little something different to make it seem fresh. It takes aspects of many well known rom-coms and adds a little twist to them making it funny, heartfelt and stressful. Overall, a movie I did like and was a little more than your typical run of the mill rom-com. A good date movie. I give this a B.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Very good example to the jealous people out there","rating":8,"date":"11 February 2015","review":"This Movie is a perfect example how you don't have to act when you are in relationship. It relate perfectly to the really jealous people, who can't get over their fear of disappointments when in love. Every person once in a while got its suspicions that maybe the love one is in a affair, and goes to the limits to prove his believes. Eventually everything goes back to its place and all the suspicions disappear. The Movie is mixed with twisted sense of humor and big dose of the reality nowadays. It shows the long way we have to go in order to understand the situation and move on. The point is to trust each other more and not to get into neurotic jealousy that will destroys our relationship.","user":"hrisito","rank":[16,24]}]
