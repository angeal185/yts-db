[{"title":"All up to you now.","rating":6,"date":"17 August 2017","review":"Growing up Ellie (Erin Marie Hogan) and her sister River (Devanny Pinn) would see a creature, one that eventually would take their mother's life (Josie DiVincenzo). 16 years later Ellie wants closure with her mother and wants to contact her....so she purchases the Amara House which is known to be haunted. Along with her is her husband Gavin (Mu-Shaka Benson) and niece Izzy (Abigail Mary) who has her mother's gift of second sight. River is institutionalized.<br><br>The character introduction was light. The Amara house was briefly introduced thru a newspaper clipping during the credits and not by any single act which would have been better. I didn't like the piano sound track, but loved it when they played the drums. The drama scene in the bedroom between our couple was a flop. Everything in the film has been done before, so for seasoned horror film watchers this may be a yawn...the secret room, the mirror, the doll, the little girl.<br><br>Ellie reads her packed away occult book for what seemed like the first time. Izzy was okay as the little girl and might be outstanding with the right coaching. The film wasn't bad, but definitely needing some tweaking and a couple of more scenes.<br><br>Guide: no swearing sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Boring","rating":2,"date":"11 January 2020","review":"Low budget, slow go of a movie. Acting was terrible. Horror movie? Physiological thriller with a couple \"scares\" thrown in is a more suitable description. I suppose it was a nice try but falls well short of being good.","user":"royeighmey","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Genuinely creepy","rating":7,"date":"16 November 2019","review":"With a plot and setting that is far from original, \"Dwelling\" is able to inject a healthy dose of creepiness that makes up for most, but not all, of its flaws.<br><br>Mostly devoid of gore and jump scares, this film relies heavily on suspense and glimpses of terror. Those solely looking for gruesomeness will be sorely disappointed, but fans of the supernatural should find enough scares to make this worth a watch. I'll even give the film some credit for having more depth than most in the horror genre.<br><br>Now for the bad: the dialogue could not have been worse. I'm not convinced that the acting was all that bad, but the script left quite a bit to be desired. Plus, there were a few head scratching plot points that undoubtedly detracted from the film.<br><br>Despite the flaws, of which there were plenty, the evil did just enough to overcome and earn a respectable score. 6.5/10","user":"hlebov","rank":[1,1]}]
