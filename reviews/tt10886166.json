[{"title":"Positive views aren't fake?","rating":10,"date":"7 April 2020","review":"People rating this badly are very vanilla, clearly. This is definitely a very well set out movie that satisfy the type of people that don't like just a straight forward soppy love story. There is a bit of push and pull between the male and female character and the female character is very strong minded which many people love. If you don't like this type of movie then why watch it and rate it badly? Why should us females be shot down because this is the type of romance we like? I personally think it is better than 50 shades of grey.","user":"barkera-13584","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"positive reviews are all fake single use accounts. Lead male character has all the sex appeal of Harvey Weinstein.","rating":2,"date":"2 April 2020","review":"Seriously I am not politically correct woke or outraged person.<br><br>But the idea that a scumbag mafia guy, is going to sexually assault his way into a woman's heart is just absurd. The sopranos was good, but Christopher Moltisante's \"Cleaver\" script within it was there to be mocked and it appears that that the makers of this film are so stupid as to not realize this.\nExactly what attributes does this mafia leader have? He has brutishness, but he has no cunning, no leadership skills, and is not credible as someone who would rise through the ranks in anything, including organized crime.\nHe is about as sexy as a toad.<br><br>The acting, dialogue, plot and cinematography are just amazingly bad and cringe-worthy. The makers of this spent more time shilling the review section here than they did writing this junk.","user":"random-70778","rank":[39,57]},{"title":"True Erotic","rating":10,"date":"8 April 2020","review":"It's Garbage if you're looking for great storyline but if you want to enjoy pure erotic romance yes it is a consummate time pass for you.","user":"sh_rabat88","rank":[16,21]}]
