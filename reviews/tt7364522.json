It is quite different in its tone and the way it plays throughout. Not what one expects from beginning to end...it is more like real life. A full gamut of emotions splashed on the screen in front of you. When it ends I found I just sat quietly with my thoughts.","user":"kq999","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"ENGAGING, ENTERTAINING AND WORTH WATCHING","rating":6,"date":"4 February 2020","review":"My wife and ii enjoyed this movie. It was poignant, sad and funny. The acting was good, the protagonist was engaging and the overall cast should be commended for an engaging story of loss and love. We had,no expectations of this movie and that's the best way to approach it. Recommended.","user":"oaklep","rank":[3,3]}]
