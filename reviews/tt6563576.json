[{"title":"Worst children's film ever made","rating":1,"date":"2 June 2019","review":"It only gets 1 star because I can't five it a lower score than that!<br><br>I have no idea why any actor would put their name to this.<br><br>Good children's films entertain children whilst adding in a modicum of humour for the parents to smirk at. This film simply contains adult humour that is inappropriate. Melania Trump talking about the size of Donald Trump's baby-maker is not child friendly in the slightest. What makes it worse, is that it's not funny, at all.","user":"antony-69","rank":[56,89]},{"title":"Save money","rating":2,"date":"26 February 2019","review":"Just went to this movie today, but the first 10 min didn't caught me. The storyline sucked and jokes for the adults are bad. My son wanted to sleep because he got bored. Never had this with a movie in a loooong time.","user":"euromaster1984","rank":[58,95]},{"title":"some good laughs","rating":6,"date":"17 May 2019","review":"Some funny jokes and a cute queen gave me good laughs...I didn't expect more, so I couldn't be that dissapointed. The animation is quite good for a european movie and the queen and his husband look hilarous :)","user":"tonimanganelli","rank":[24,36]}]
