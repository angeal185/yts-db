[{"title":"This film is well worth a look – to see Paxton in his last major role – and for the overall quality of the movie itself.","rating":7,"date":"19 March 2017","review":"The American-Canadian thriller \"Mean Dreams\" (R, 1:48) is one of two posthumous film releases for Bill Paxton (in addition to 2017's \"The Circle\", in which he has a small role). When Paxton died suddenly of complications from heart surgery at the age of 61 early in 2017, celebrity expressions of sorrow struck one consistent chord, well represented by Arnold Schwarzenegger's tweet that Paxton \"could play any role, but he was best at being Bill – a great human being with a huge heart.\" In Paxton's most famous roles, he was an ordinary, basically decent guy caught up in extraordinary circumstances (as he was in \"Apollo 13\", \"Twister\", \"Titanic\" and \"U-571\"). He was also very good at playing tough and/or morally ambiguous characters (as he did in \"Aliens\", \"A Simple Plan\", \"Edge of Tomorrow\" and his award-winning HBO series \"Big Love\"), and some of his best work was as a basically bad person (as in \"Weird Science\", \"True Lies\", \"Frailty\" (which he also directed) and \"Training Day\", the TV series he was acting in when he died). \"Mean Dreams\" is another great example of Paxton playing against his true personality.<br><br>In this film, Paxton plays Wayne Caraway, a rural Michigan police officer and single dad, who is pretty bad at both roles – and a pretty bad person in general. When local boy Jonas Ford (Josh Wiggins, the star of 2015's \"Max\") starts seeing Wayne's teenage daughter, Casey (Sophie Nélisse, who played the title role in 2013's \"The Book Thief\"), Wayne is pretty mean about shattering Jonas' dreams of getting closer to Casey. Mostly it's because Jonas isn't shy about trying to protect Casey from Wayne's abuse, and because Wayne doesn't want Jonas nosing around and discovering any of his other... activities.<br><br>After Jonas fails to get his father (Joe Cobden) or Wayne's boss (Colm Feore) to intervene on Casey's behalf, he takes matters into his own hands. When he witnesses an example of just how bad a man that Wayne is, Jonas steals some money, grabs Casey and hits the road. Of course, Wayne comes after his daughter – with a (literal) vengeance. As Jonas and Casey struggle to get away from Casey's dad for good, they confront the harsh realities of life on the run (especially as it pertains to two teenagers in the middle of nowhere), break some laws and put their safety and the safety of others at risk along the way.<br><br>\"Mean Dreams\" is a small, but entertaining coming-of-age movie. The two teen protagonists aren't quite Bonnie and Clyde, but their saga is engaging and their love story is affecting. Nélisse and Wiggins are two rising young stars whose emerging talents shine through in sympathetic roles and Paxton does his usual expert work as one really bad dude. The script (by Kevin Coughlin and Ryan Grassby) and the direction (by Nathan Morlando) keep the action and dialog both unusually grounded and fairly unpredictable, especially for this kind of film. The score and the cinematography (filmed creatively and beautifully in northern Ontario and Sault Ste. Marie) are also very good, especially for a movie made on a small budget. The film is a bit lacking in gravitas, but it's worth a look – to see Paxton in his last major role – and for the overall quality of the film itself. \"B+\"","user":"dave-mcclain","rank":[21,28]},{"title":"Well-acted indie thriller with an amazing landscape.","rating":8,"date":"17 March 2017","review":"As a low-budget thriller/drama, I came into this film with modest expectations. I was very delighted to be treated to a well-acted film with an incredible landscape (filmed in Ontario).<br><br>The acting was perfect. Sophie Nelisse has the makings of a world-famous box office smasher someday. Josh Wiggins was superb in his lead role. And the late great Bill Paxton played his role flawlessly.<br><br>I will not include any spoilers as to why I'm \"only\" giving it an 8 out of 10, but I will say that this indie thriller is definitely worth watching.<br><br>Rest in peace, Bill Paxton.","user":"NeonDisguise","rank":[22,30]},{"title":"one of his Paxton's last and finest","rating":7,"date":"29 March 2017","review":"Greetings again from the darkness. It was one month to the day since the shocking news that Bill Paxton had died when I sat down to watch one of his final two movies (the other being The Circle, which hits theatres in a few weeks). His searing performance in this low-budget drama made me realize just what a gaping hole he leaves in the film world  and how fitting that his character is the antithesis of Paxton's real world nice guy persona.<br><br>Director Nathan Morlando opens with a shot of a peaceful stroll through rural prairie land, providing no indication of the quietly intense misery that is coming. Jonas (Josh Wiggins) is a teenage boy working daily on the family ranch when he meets Casey (Sophie Nelisse), the new girl in town. The two quickly hit it off, and connect in a way neither has before. Jonas soon realizes that Casey's cop dad (Paxton) abuses her, and spontaneously can shift between country charm and frightening intimidator.<br><br>Writers Kevin Coughlan and Ryan Grassby do a nice job of using minimal dialogue and subtle interactions to round out these characters. Paxton plays a corrupt cop who is an alcoholic and abusive dad, and a man overly protective of his daughter and distrusting of outsiders. Casey is played by Sophie Nelisse, who was so good in The Book Thief (2013). She is a smart girl who fears not just her father, but also a life that may prevent her from ever seeing the ocean. Josh Wiggins plays Jonas as a strong-willed young man who believes people should do the right thing, especially for their loved ones. Wiggins made a terrific film debut in 2014's Hellion.<br><br>There is a lot going in this little independent feature. It's a coming of age story, and a reminder of the anxiousness of youth and the power of first love. It's also a disturbing story of a rotten-to-the-core man who has lost his way (if he ever had it). Lastly, it's a chase movie that features a blend of beautiful and harsh scenery – filmed mostly in Sault Ste. Marie in Ontario. There is a tremendously tense sequence shot with the limited perspective offered by the covered bed of a pickup truck; and it's a contrast between two youths trying to escape their situation, and two bad cops with little redeeming value. Maybe we've seen similar type movies, but never one with two excellent young actors and a menacing performance from the late great Bill Paxton.","user":"ferguson-6","rank":[17,24]}]
