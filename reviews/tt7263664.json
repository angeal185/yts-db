It could've happened, just like it's being told in this movie. Every single thought presented makes sense in this day and age.

Through Kenny, the port-a-loo entrepreneur, the chubby chap that many of us Aussies had enjoyed on the musical stage was brought to broader knowledge. <br><br>I may have misunderstood the attractions of 'stars' - not just that their role will be convincing, more that their presence says 'This must be OK or I wouldn't have signed up.\"<br><br>It's somewhat like that with 'Brothers' Nest', but more so. Shane and his real life big brother Clayton have the relationship in this family muck-up story that cannot be acted - it just has to be innate and honed over decades of brotherly rivalry to work this well. The setting, in a western Victorian farmhouse, shot mostly at dusk, overnight and dawn looks the real deal it is.<br><br>The story is about family relationships - intense, marginal, commonly held and individual, stemming from not so happy families, divorces, new unions, strengths but mostly weaknesses. It isn't pretty, and if your family isn't like this, you'll probably be thankful, but it really does have a lot to say.<br><br>It's a small cast, and the two bothers plus Kim Gyngell as their step father leave little space for the others, but all click satisfyingly. They are all believable in their roles.<br><br>The billing was 'black comedy' but I'd allocate this to the thriller category. Few laughs, personally or in our cinema, and virtually none out loud. But it seriously held my attention.<br><br>Give it a go - it's good.","user":"manders_steve","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Slow start, great ending.","rating":7,"date":"15 October 2018","review":"The movie's slow start, even close to midway through had me quite bored, up until about 30 some minutes left of it. Turned out to be a pretty decent movie. I was impressed.","user":"renonguttsu","rank":[6,7]}]
