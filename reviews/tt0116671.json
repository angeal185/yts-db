[{"title":"It's SUPPOSED to be bad!","rating":10,"date":"8 December 1998","review":"I'm glad that users (as of this date) who liked this movie are now coming forward. I don't understand the people who didn't like this movie - it seems like they were expecting a serious (?!?!?) treatment! C'mon, how the hell can you take the premise of a killer snowman seriously? The filmmakers knew this was a silly premise, and they didn't try to deny it. The straight-faced delivery of scenes actually makes it FUNNY! Yes, there are times where the low budget shows (such as that explosion scene), but I think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie! So if you like B-movies, and the goofy premise appeals to you, then you'll certainly like \"Jack Frost\".","user":"Wizard-8","rank":[30,39]},{"title":"\"Gosh. I only axed you for a smoke!\"","rating":31,"date":"31 December 2002","review":"Don't confuse this flick with the 1998 Michael Keaton film of the same name. This particular Jack Frost movie IS NOT for children, but it sure is hilarious.<br><br>One of my favorite scenes is where Jack Frost requests a smoke from a guy, then kills the guy with an axe, and says: \"Gosh. I only axed you for a smoke.\" That line never fails to crack me up.<br><br>If you're looking for a good B-movie to watch, this is a good choice. But remember, to use Jack Frost's own words, it ain't f**king Frosty!","user":"4-Kane","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"twisted in the most wonderful way","rating":10,"date":"1 August 2000","review":"This is one of the funniest movies that I have seen this year. The people that made it must be so incredibly whacked and twisted. It is a beautiful thing. There were a lot of quality one-liners. This movie blew Uncle Sam out of the water (it was made by tha same people, i think)","user":"clearsky47","rank":[15,19]}]
