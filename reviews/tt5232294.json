[{"title":"Ugh","rating":1,"date":"13 June 2018","review":"They make you dislike all of the characters within the first few minutes of this movie. Next, they make it worst by having thin characters with B movie acting. The story is obvious and it's dragged out for way to long in what is actually a short movie. Its listed as a drama, but its so bad at times you think they meant it to be a comedy. Do yourself a favor, move on to another movie.","user":"carnold-52156","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"Bad film","rating":2,"date":"5 April 2019","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was a waste of time downloading and watching it. Full of \"religious values\" but lacking everything else.","user":"randycope10","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Hard to watch...","rating":2,"date":"22 February 2019","review":"At the time of writing this review this movie currently has a 7.0 rating. I think that's a very generous rating probably from people that only watch religious films.\nThe acting in this is almost unwatchable. The writing and dialogue between characters is the kind of talk you never hear among people in real life. It becomes very cringe worthy and hard to watch.\nCamera work isn't that great either but not bad enough to really harp on.","user":"Nathanie1","rank":[3,4]}]
