[{"title":"'This town is too small for secrets'","rating":23,"date":"23 March 2019","review":"This is not so much a love story about a \"forbidden\" love, but it is also about a child who slowly discovers how things work in the adult world.<br><br>This film has a slow start (after about 30 minutes the pace picks up), but my patience is well rewarded at the end. An ending that raises some questions. Yet I didn't feel it had a very strange ending. Only after talking to someone about it for half an hour did I find out why the ending felt good to me. So does the aforementioned quote get a completely different meaning in the end. I think the filmmakers intended to make a film that makes you think.<br><br>The acting is very good. Especially Gregor Selkirk, who plays the son, is excellent. I have seen few young actors acting so convincingly and realistically.\nI had to get used to Anna Paquin, who plays Dr. Jean Markham, because she reminded me a bit of BBC Kate Bliss (Bargain Hunt, Flog it !, Put your money where your mouth is). If you would say that Kate Bliss and Anna Paquin were sisters, I would believe it. I had to suppress a chuckle when Jean said she didn't have any teaspoons. Kate Bliss being the silver expert.\nI think I have seen Steven Robertson before in the detective series \"Shetland\" and I had wondered if his accent was realistic. In this film the Scottish accent feels to me more realistic than the one he had in \"Shetland\". (But I'm not Scottish so it's just a feeling of someone who's second language is English).<br><br>Apart from a scene with too many bees (which looks almost surreal), I think this is an excellent film.","user":"Anti-HeroAnnie","rank":[39,49]},{"title":"Well-acted, moving account of real issues...","rating":8,"date":"28 May 2019","review":"I'm a Conservative, Straight guy, but this movie tugged hard at my heartstrings. The acting of the three principal players was exceptional throughout the entire film.\nThe storyline was completely believable and powerful. I don't want to say too much about the plot, but I really emphasized with the players.\nThe love shown was real and palpable. That is significant.","user":"faaus72","rank":[38,48]},{"title":"A graceful and touching drama","rating":3,"date":"3 May 2019","review":"Tell It To The Bees, is a beautiful film set in a time that those, who gave this film one star, possibly wished would return. A time when to choose who we loved was considered a vile act, but to act vilely to those that did was expected behaviour. The film tells its story with grace, leaving the audience to decide who, if anyone in particular, are the victims. Special mention for Gregor Selkirk who is captivating as the young son, caught in the middle of the storm. Even though several have seemingly chosen to make a moral judgement in their score (for a film that isn't really that contentious) I will simply give what I hope is a more reasoned assessment. An excellent film and well worth your time.","user":"FilmMatinee","rank":[40,52]}]
