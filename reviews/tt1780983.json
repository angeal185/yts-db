[{"title":"Horrendous!","rating":2,"date":"15 July 2012","review":"This is a poorly written, poorly directed FEMME NIKITA knock-off, like a poor, unattractive Bulgarian little sister to the French original. Sutherland and Slater have no business in this film. The votes it received as a \"ten\" have to be from production folks or PR people - it's a 2 at best. This movie features bad direction, lousy writing, horrendous action sequences, a pathetic \"reveal\" and it doesn't build to anything but a limp, predictable end. If you're looking for an action movie, this isn't it. If you want good acting, keep looking. If you like looking at open toed shoes with shiny pantyhose, this could be the film for you. Don't bother and don't get taken in by the bait-and-switch trailer - it isn't worth it!","user":"mame-7","rank":[85,107]},{"title":"a kid can make a better movie. What's with the bellydancing!?!","rating":1,"date":"7 August 2012","review":"Just imagine a kid trying to make his first \"foreign-place action movie\" who has no idea about the world and cultures and has it all mixed up in his head and this is what you get. Amazingly inaccurate and confusing settings and like everyone said, dumb story. What does Bulgaria or Sofia have to do with this? And what time in the future or past is it taking place because that country and city have never looked or sounded like that. Why are American and British folks chilling in bellydancing and shisha bars?? If they said it was Turkey or middle east it would be slightly more accurate. All that arabic music in the background is hilarious! You don't hear arab music in Europe unless you go into an ethnic restaurant. So amazingly inaccurate. I can't believe there is an actual American director who mixed up cultures and countries like that. This is like making a movie in France but having Italian music in the background while people speak Spanish but actually looking like German. Total parody of a movie! Makes for decent laughs!","user":"jumpmang8","rank":[53,75]},{"title":"Sorry, this movie is not for you","rating":6,"date":"10 August 2012","review":"As a Bulgarian I sometimes watch the horrible Stallone/Lundgren action flicks that get filmed in my country. I first saw the rock-bottom IMDb rating and reviews for this one, and prepared for one more night of cringing self-embarrassment. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.<br><br>Sorry, guys, but no way you will ever get this movie. Hint: check the credits - it was primarily created by Bulgarians and half the time people in it speak in Bulgarian. This movie really was made for a Bulgarian audience and features all sorts of coy little inside jokes in the plot, poking with self-irony at bad American action films and cultural misunderstandings between our two nations. And, it actually paints a decent picture of Bulgaria and Sofia, our refined Oriental folk establishments and fine police force - sadly now we even have terrorists. <br><br>I am not saying it is a great film at all. It is at the level of good TV productions in Bulgaria and is actually very enjoyable to a Bulgarian who watches it as precisely that. How and why this was ever marketed to bloodthirsty action flick fans and sold overseas I can't say, but I kind of hope it diverted some cash from the awful Stallone stuff. Yet, you got your fair warning - just don't watch it.","user":"adyankov","rank":[46,68]}]
