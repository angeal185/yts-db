But by the time I saw the scene I was watching the movie for (about 10 minutes in) I had been introduced to some engaging characters and pulled into a weaving story who's end I found myself gradually more invested in. A crime drama with more fascinating characters and philosophical nuance than I'm used to. And it's free on Amazon... Pleasantly surprised!<br><br>Keep your clothes on, Erik!","user":"matt-hansen1","rank":[10,22]}]
