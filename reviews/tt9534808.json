[{"title":"Just awful","rating":3,"date":"8 November 2019","review":"No doubt, Mr. Lundgren is a mediocre actor. But some of his actions films, you can watch just to pass the time. This one combines only the bad of everything. Bad acting, bad directing and a bad story. A real cheapy.","user":"iliasalk","rank":[34,48]},{"title":"Ugh!","rating":2,"date":"7 February 2020","review":"Scriptwriter was in a hurry may be! Pointless action and lame shooting, no actual storyline... Bored as hell.","user":"chirkut","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Bad, just bad","rating":2,"date":"8 December 2019","review":"I don't know how this got such a high rating. It's a 3/10 at best. No suspense, acting bad and the fake gun flashes just make the case.\nIf you're looking for a movie to fall asleep to, this is the one.","user":"jeffsmee","rank":[8,12]}]
