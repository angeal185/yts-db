[{"title":"Harmless Fun","rating":8,"date":"8 April 1999","review":"It's Fun. It's as simple as that. The premise is not actually to far fetched. Who hasn't thought about going into space? And in this the kids get to do it. There are a few \"you did it because you're a team\" slushy American moments but otherwise it's a great harmless rainy day movie. 8/10","user":"Fraser-5","rank":[22,26]},{"title":"A good romp","rating":6,"date":"14 November 1999","review":"I just rented it again.  I just ignore the plot porcupines and enjoy the adolescent romp.  Perfect family viewing; some action and suspense, no violence, and just one kiss. For those of us that will be forever planet bound, it is sometimes nice to dream.","user":"agulledg","rank":[24,29]},{"title":"A callback to a more optimistic age","rating":7,"date":"21 May 2014","review":"Impossible? Of course it is, but 'Space Camp' is a good 'ol piece of wide-eyed, optimistic 80s feel-goodery. God, I miss it. But revisiting it turned out to be more than a mere nostalgia trip. 'Space Camp' is a well made, well acted, adventure film that deftly mixes comedy, drama and thrills.<br><br>Featuring a cast of talented and likable actors that you will recognize from better known films, top notch special effects and a rousing score by the great John Williams, 'Space Camp' is the type of film that today's kids need to see. Its message? Work hard, dream big and reach for the stars. It's a lesson they're not getting from our popular culture today, and it's one they desperately need to hear.","user":"Fluke_Skywalker","rank":[12,14]}]
