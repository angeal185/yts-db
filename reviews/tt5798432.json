[{"title":"A low-budget lovecraftian horror","rating":7,"date":"25 March 2018","review":"So what we have here is a lovecraftian horror set in an old school arcade console repair shop. We have a small cast involved, mainly consisting of four people, two of which share the majority of screen time. There's Oz, the young quiet loner working repairing consoles for his kind boss Jerry until an attractive yet somewhat quirky and forward young woman named Tess comes in to look at what they have in stock. Jerry later excuses Oz and tells him he needs to get out and have a little fun and to go have some drinks at the local bar where he meets Tess once again who sparks up a conversation. Due to her outgoing nature they somewhat hit it off and plan to meet up later which becomes the beginning of a relationship that spans the rest of the movie. <br><br>Shortly after a mysterious package arrives at the shop holding a chip board which Oz installs into an empty stand up arcade console. Upon playing this mysterious game Oz experiences a loss of time and becomes violently ill. Meanwhile a creepy homeless man repeatedly appears on the outskirts of the story observing Oz and Tess. Time goes by, Tess and Oz become closer, and the ominous game begins to affect our two protagonists in dangerous ways leading to mind altering body horror sequences commonly seen in Lovecraft inspired horrors. <br><br>What I liked about this movie is all the special effects were real world common sense effects with little to no CGI. Good old fashioned disgusting special effects based on gooey melting bits and loads of slime and fluids. The story while bizarre is tight and paced well. The relationship between Oz and Tess seems rushed but they have pretty good chemistry. This movie won't be for everyone, some will find it confusing as it doesn't have a well outlined explanation for the events going on, but it's not meant to. Anyone familiar with Lovecraft themes should be able to appreciate it as well at those who enjoy the body-horror genre. I would definitely recommend it to these two groups with a soft recommendation to more mainstream horror fans.","user":"terrencepatrix","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"I wanted to like it more than I did","rating":5,"date":"25 May 2018","review":"Oz (Chase Williamson, John Dies at the End) is content to be alone with the ancient video games - fixing them, playing them, creating them - in his boss Jerry's arcade. Everything in his life is thrown for a loop in one day: the arcade is closing, he meets a girl named Tess (Fabianne Therese, John Dies at the End) and a strange new game shows up unannounced.<br><br>What follows is a Cronenberg-esque body horror odyssey with sexualized video game controls being manipulated, bodies being distorted to add circuits and time loops where multiple versions of Oz can exist. It's also a love story.<br><br>The game, when shown, looks like what Polybius has been described as. It gradually takes over Oz's reality until he decides that the only person who made the rules for his game is himself.<br><br>It's an interesting effort from actor/writer/director Graham Skipper, who starred in Almost Human and directed the film Space Clown. It's an obvious tribute to Videodrome, but where that film had volumes to speak about culture, violence and the intersection of both, this movie doesn't have nearly as much to say. I was kind of hoping for Oz to have more of a redemptive journey after he argued with Tess, telling her that he may have always been the person that he has become post video game freakout.","user":"BandSAboutMovies","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Don't play it","rating":5,"date":"17 October 2017","review":"Not talking about the movie of course, but a game within. Of course as a viewer we are sometimes ahead of the main characters, giving them advice on what to do or not to do. Then again, if they'd always listen, we wouldn't have a movie. Still some things may seem to convenient or too easy (especially considering the way the woman behaves, kind of is stretching and probably just to get the story going).<br><br>Apart from that, the effects are really good and there is value for money to be seen. So if you're after that, you are going to be served quite well. Script has some issues, but you wouldn't or shouldn't expect anything in particular. Characters serve the really out there story, that some may actually get a feel for (where it's heading that is). It's a mind thing - and it's also a taste thing. If you are into this, there is stuff to enjoy and enough suspense to go around","user":"kosmasp","rank":[10,14]}]
