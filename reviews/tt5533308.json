[{"title":"Epic Historical Biopic","rating":10,"date":"3 June 2019","review":"Watched 'I am Duran' recently. Having not known much about Roberto Duran, I was blown away by his story. The film is brilliantly crafted with an intense soundtrack and amazing archive footage throughout. It also has some brilliant interviews with people such as Mike Tyson, Ricky Hatton, Sly Stallone and Robert De Niro. It even features the late general Noriega. It is much more than a generic sporting biopic, the filmmakers use Duran's story to contrast with the wider social/political situation between Panama and the USA throughout the backend of last century. It's a rich and fascinating story and the final fight scene will stay with you for a long, long time. Definitely recommend this movie!!","user":"thpmagnus","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Best Boxing Movie of our time","rating":10,"date":"4 June 2019","review":"Stand aside 'When we were Kings', there is a new greatest boxing documentary of all time. That documentary is 'I am Duran'. I don't want to spoil this for masterpiece for anyone, so just darn well watch it. You can thank me later. Mat Godson, the director deserves an Oscar. Thank you for making this film.","user":"jasonmonkfish","rank":[3,9]},{"title":"Exceptional documentary.","rating":9,"date":"4 June 2019","review":"Roberto Duran will forever be in my top 5.\nHe would've been a top fighter in any era of boxing.<br><br>I have been a fan of his for almost a decade now.
