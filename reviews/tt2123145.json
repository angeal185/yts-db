[{"title":"Pretentious tripe","rating":1,"date":"5 March 2017","review":"AND HERE NO DEVIL CAN HURT YOU is a terribly bad attempt at an art-house horror film focusing on a couple of lovers having an affair in an apartment which may or may not be haunted. Other than some ominous music and scenes of a masked figure lurking about, this has zero horror content and is otherwise a shockingly pretentious piece of tripe.<br><br>The film is badly acted and really boring, with static camera-work and a general sense of repetition in scenes of the two actors making out which go on endlessly time and again. No effort seems to have been made whatsoever. The single memorable thing about this is the ending which has some eye-popping male nudity and is the cringiest thing I've ever seen; what the heck were they thinking?","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"um... um... What did I just watch?","rating":5,"date":"2 August 2016","review":"This movie wasn't bad nor was it good. More than anything I was left wondering what was going on and what the point was. The movie was very slow to start, the first half was very very slow. I am not sure why I rated it as high as I did. I would watch it again, but mostly to try and understand what happened in the movie.<br><br>Plot: I think the movie bounced back and forth in time (although I am not sure about that). If the first half of the movie had been thrown out and it started at the second half I think it would have had a stronger plot. <br><br>Characters: There were only two characters and eventually you get to find out some things about them, but more is left unsaid than was said. It could have used more development of the characters.<br><br>Acting: I did not have any issues with the acting. The actress had very little emotion, but that seamed to be the character and not the acting.<br><br>Intangibles: The movie has no female nudity, there are a few sex scenes but she is either partially clothed or it is filmed so that you don't see anything. On the other hand there is a 3-5 minute scene of the guy naked where every thing is shown for an extended amount of time. Thisis not a sexual scene and is at the very end of the movie. I did not hate this movie nor did I love it and honestly I am not sure why. There was something about it that kept me watching.","user":"travislhendrix","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"If you like indie + open ended.","rating":4,"date":"16 October 2018","review":"Movies with a four rating for me are those kind of movies that even if they are boring or lack clearly quality-production or dialogue are poor-you can see the whole thing without doing a big effort, if any. That is what happened here.<br><br>The movie is kind of mysterious because it seems that there is not a lot of things explained, yep, it is that kind of movie although it has some sort of closing. I can not say I did not like it but I found that as I said on the first paragraph it lacks a little quality everywhere.<br><br>I think that maybe with it could use a remake with a better script and budget.","user":"gimailito","rank":[1,3]}]
