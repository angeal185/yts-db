[{"title":"Great heartwarming movie","rating":10,"date":"3 June 2019","review":"Continuation of first part, 'A DOG's PURPOSE'. It will definitely make you cry, and that too several times. A really great movie filled with love, positivism and cuteness. Great cast, awesome dogs, fantastic story.\nA must watch, not just for dog lovers, but for everyone!","user":"www-aktomer","rank":[112,118]},{"title":"Loved it!","rating":10,"date":"30 May 2019","review":"I'm so glad I watched this!

We all three had some tears at various points in the story. Just made me want to hug my family. Great story, good acting, well done. Thank you to the producers, writers and everyone else involved. Might just go read the book now.","user":"kryzhan","rank":[83,91]}]
