[{"title":"An insult to real Lineman","rating":1,"date":"27 May 2016","review":"As a past linesman (lineman) and instructor for trainee linesmen, I was intrigued to watch this movie and then appalled at the portrayal of these workers as hard ass, boozed-up bar brawlers. It can be a hazardous job, but I had a four year traineeship and the linesman I worked with were highly trained and not gung-ho rednecks as portrayed in this movie. How a guy that seemingly had just attempted suicide was allowed to just drive home from work afterwards - seriously!! The final scene was ridiculous on so many levels and anyone with even a basic knowledge of power systems would know that (i) you don't power up a city via an isolating switch; (ii) when JT jumped on the switch and pushed it closed would have created a short circuit that would have taken the line protection out, not restored power; and (iii) the guys in the control room cheering as if Bruce Willis had just saved the world in Armageddon - SAVE ME! I think this movie makes a mockery of highly trained safety professionals and does not celebrate their memory at all. Just goes to show how out of touch Hollywood actors are with the real world. But if Lineman in the United States are a bunch of redneck, boozy, bar-brawlers (and I seriously doubt that) then they would love it.","user":"cooperms","rank":[73,86]},{"title":"A little realism would be appreciated","rating":2,"date":"6 January 2018","review":"I realize this is a movie, but some level of realism is expected to make it believable. Not only does the movie show all kinds of ridiculous electrical mistakes with the grid / system, but of course...because linemen are blue collar workers, they have to be portrayed as drunkards and complete idiots. To top it off, the producers can't even attempt to get the geography close to what is supposed to be portrayed in the story. Trust me, there are no oceans, massive lakes, or mountains around Lubbock. And, any major storm coming in off the Gulf of Mexico would take at least a day to make it halfway across Texas. Again, I realize it is a movie, but at least TRY people. Don't pay to watch this film, rather watch it on Amazon Prime or some way you get to see it for free. It's okay to watch on the couch one day when you aren't feeling well...it is at least better than reality-TV...but not by much.","user":"spencer_hamons","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"Like Playing Jenga with Movie Clichés","rating":3,"date":"24 May 2016","review":"If they missed a single clichés for drama movies then I probably missed that because I was fast-forwarding. This movie looks like an expensive teaching tool for a film school basic class on screen writing. The grizzled old veteran and the young punk trying to make a name for himself are just two of the tired, over-done themes dealt with on screen. There are dozens more so be prepared for the worst.<br><br>It got so bad that at one point I lost track of which John Travolta direct-to-DVD movie I was watching. The terrible thing is that I actually like him as an actor but he makes such stupid movies these days. Does he have an agent? Does he have a pile of gambling debts that require him to take every piece-or-crap role offered to him?<br><br>If you are looking for even a moment of originality then this just isn't the film for you.","user":"leftbanker-1","rank":[28,37]}]
