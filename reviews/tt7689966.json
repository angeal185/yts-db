[{"title":"New Footage & Interviews Headline This Doc","rating":8,"date":"20 July 2018","review":"Recently, I've noticed a particular pattern that HBO Documentaries tends to use for their productions: They aren't afraid to tackle an already-covered subject (like Andre the Giant or Robin Williams), and along with hitting all the important beats they somehow uncover new footage and conduct really impressive interviews.<br><br>This is exactly what happens in \"Come Inside My Mind\". Since his death in 2014 (and probably even before), Robin Williams has been the subject of many a documentary piece. This one covers maybe 70% of the same ground, but that other 30% is the key. In \"Come Inside My Mind\", I saw footage of both him and his work that I had never seen before. The interviews with his contemporaries are also riveting and seem to add new perspective rather than hit the same old beats.<br><br>The bottom line here is that it is tough to make a really good, original Robin Williams documentary these days, but HBO pretty much manages to nail it here. While a scene or two here or there might feel a bit derivative, for the most part this is a very well-produced look at Williams both in front of and behind the cameras.","user":"zkonedog","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Can't say enough....","rating":10,"date":"19 July 2018","review":"The man, the myth, the legend. Robin Williams touched millions across the world. This funny and at times sad documentary really gives a great inside look at the man who brought so much joy into this world. Ever since I was a child I've Loved and enjoyed Robin's films. He has a way to speak to any man, woman, or child. Such an incredible talent lost to soon. We should not weep for him but weep In gladness that such a man existed.","user":"Mrbigham13","rank":[28,32]},{"title":"Ugh....
