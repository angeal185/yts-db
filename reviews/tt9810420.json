One of the best so far.","user":"cassmc03","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Watch This movie","rating":10,"date":"18 December 2019","review":"What a great movie. From start to finish it kept you watching .

But the fluidity of this was constantly RUINED by framing too close so we can't see the full body; then adding insult to injury, they would go into split screen so we had TWO gymnasts at the same time: both of them framed badly. I remember MTV and all the quick cuts. But WHY? Is everyone on Ritalin now?<br><br>Who shot this? Someones cousin on their cellphone? pull back man. And slow down. More long shots, more slo mo.\nThis was a disservice to the girls.\nAdding to the irritation was the \"music\" which was loops played over and over, samples you could trigger with one finger. Silence would be better.\nThe \"actors\" are amateurs so I guess this is low budget. Less is more kids.\nPredictable plot too: gosh, let's see. Snotty city kids put down country kids. O gee I wonder....?? will the underdogs come back to win?\nWish I could answer that (except to be willing to bet they DO, of course!).\nI turned it off midway.","user":"philalethes-85721","rank":[1,1]}]
