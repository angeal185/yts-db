[{"title":"An excellent original story","rating":10,"date":"11 September 2015","review":"As you can see from the credits, Stan Lee plays himself. That's very, very cool. The story is original in all respects. The characters are all original. The story depicts how Stan Lee came up with his ideas about some of his stories about superheroes. It also slyly comments about some of the problems Stan Lee has experienced over the years getting his publisher to print his work.<br><br>Unfortunately the excellent story is marred by less than stellar animation. Nearly every scene, even many scenes that were in the dark, had a white haze effect swirling around for no apparent purpose. It was as if a camera was aimed with the sun at the edge of the picture. The detail in the drawings lacks clarity. <br><br>That said, it is still very worthwhile to watch it.","user":"grafxman","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"If only there was an actual series!","rating":9,"date":"30 March 2016","review":"This movie was brilliant! I watched this yesterday on TV and noticed Lady Lightning's voice sounded like Amy from The Big Bang Theory, so I came here to double check. I also thought it would be a good idea to write a review about this fantastic movie!<br><br>The plot is great and loved the team of superheroes and their powers! I also loved how Stan Lee was playing himself and writing comics about the 'Mighty 7' (although I didn't really like how Stan Lee was appearing in the movie very rarely, considering this is STAN LEE's Mighty 7 - I also thought maybe they would've gave Stan Lee a super power like, I don't know, flying? I don't know, something legit to make the movie even more awesome!).<br><br>This movie was great and really recommend it!<br><br>~ Maciek","user":"crazyplayerialeks","rank":[0,0]}]
