[{"title":"perfect little indie movie","rating":7,"date":"23 May 2019","review":"This movie fits the \"indie movie\" mold. Short, sweet, leaves you wanting more of these characters. Amy Seimetz is excellent, and a very believable older sister to Ellen Page. This movie had me crushing on Kate Mara to the point that I immediately followed her on Instagram.","user":"FIoret","rank":[22,26]},{"title":"Powerful","rating":10,"date":"2 January 2020","review":"This is one of those movies that has so many layers it becomes profound.<br><br>The romantic relationship of the two main characters areas important as the family struggles with the death penalty, but none of the story lines takes away from the other, if anything they complement each other to make a beautiful movie.<br><br>In a world were most movies are remakes and reboots, it is refreshing to see an original movie with a great story, amazing performances from the cast.<br><br>I was mesmerized.","user":"GomezAddams666","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"A sweet, sad but original idea","rating":9,"date":"17 May 2019","review":"Anything with Ellen Page in it is worth a watch, this movie included. She absolutely nails it. I like that this movie is not a remake of anything or based on any books.. It's an original idea and an interesting one too and not one you'd have seen before. The 2 main characters have a good chemistry and are generally sweet together, even though a maybe slightly funny match. I guess some people might find this film boring but I think it's definitely worth a watch.","user":"Hit-Girl93","rank":[33,44]}]
