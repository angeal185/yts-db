[{"title":"Being Flynn looks at the thin line between madness and genius","rating":29,"date":"29 July 2012","review":"Most people are unaware that some of the best performances actors deliver are in the smaller budgeted lesser seen films. Being Flynn is one of those that got limited release and was getting some good reviews, but kind of just came out of nowhere. Sporting a great cast including Paul Dano, Robert DeNiro, and Julianne Moore, could this be another of those rare gems that get lost on the shelf or will it be one that's clear to why it got such a limited release.<br><br>Being Flynn follows a father and son who haven't been in contact with each other in years. When the father reaches out to his son, he realizes he cannot outrun his fate and realizes that he has the chance to make a life for himself as well as for his father. This drama is filled with some interesting characters and great performances, most notably DeNiro who seems to be letting it all out in one of his strongest performances in some time. Paul Dano does a great job carrying his own weight alongside DeNiro playing off of each other to bring this troubled relationship to life. The story takes a deeper than expected journey into human emotion and the thin line of genius and madness. Everyone gives great performances delivering a powerful film that works really well. The biggest issue is the pacing. At times it comes off as really slow and long, and others will keep you interested. With an emotional film like this it's important to maintain a sense of cohesion so the heavier moments don't get lost in a sea of useless moments. That's not necessarily the case here; it just runs a bit longer than it feels it needed too.<br><br>While not a film that will really deliver anything all that new, it does sport a great performance from DeNiro that is worth checking out. This film does sport some drug use and racist moments that while nothing you haven't seen are necessary due to the direction of the film. If you decide to give this film a shot, just make sure you are prepared for some heavy content.<br><br>http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey","user":"rgblakey","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"Intense and compelling","rating":7,"date":"5 October 2012","review":"Again, I find it a challenge to write a review after reading the one by David Ferguson (ferguson-6); don't want to copy another reviewer. Read his review, hopefully after mine. I agree with David about the non traditional Hollywood ending. I also did not have the pleasure of reading the book by Nick Flynn and I don't plan to; I've had enough of the movie's realism to quench that thirst. The performances by De Niro and Dano are captivatingly dark, gripping and absolutely discomforting, when they are the most believable. You must understand the storyline before considering watching the movie.<br><br>It's hard to tell if De Niro is overplaying the character or if the real Flynn was that bad of a drunk; either way that makes the veteran of the screen's performance a memorable one. I tend to believe the performance of Robert De Niro here, and like to think he does portray what Jonathan Flynn must have been like, as it feels too real not to be. Anyone who's known a problematic alcoholic knows the De Niro's role was very demanding. I have a soft spot for movies with narration and the one delivered by Paul Dano, playing Nick Flynn to perfection, was both well done and required, in the context of the story.<br><br>The ending, after a roller coaster ride of the life of an author with unyielding self confidence, was guaranteed to bring a sigh of relief and it won't surprise me a bit if you exclaim 'son of a bit**' as I did. If I was an actor, I'd want to have played a part in this movie. It's not for everyone, but I recommend it for movie-lovers who crave intense performances now and then.","user":"JohnRayPeterson","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Surprisingly enjoyable","rating":7,"date":"24 December 2013","review":"Being a bio, i must definitely say that it's a very interesting film about really interesting characters. Yeah, some will claim that a film without interesting characters is not an interesting film, which is true anyways. But fine: back to the main subject, 'Being Flynn' is an above average bio in my opinion.<br><br>The story about characters without any hope and saddened by the life and the consequences of it, is a thing that happens everyday with . The situation and the why people turns to be homeless is a subject explored and showed in a clever and entertaining way, without any distortions to make it look more 'interesting' for the viewer. <br><br>The editing, though very inconsistent in simple scenes, played a big part in the film's conception. The film wouldn't be as half as interesting without the good job done in that aspect.<br><br>I loved Paul Dano and Deniro's performances. Both were very good. Deniro as the grumpy old man and Dano as the character without direction in his life.<br><br>Overall, a flawed film, specifically the last twenty minutes or so, that really prejudiced a then fine film. Still, a solid 7.0/10","user":"jackasstrange","rank":[7,7]}]
