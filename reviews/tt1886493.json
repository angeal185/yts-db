[{"title":"What a mess...","rating":3,"date":"2 December 2011","review":"Bad, bad, bad... It was a waste of time. The only thing that deserves attention is Forest Whitaker's play (versus the disappointing old Willis). But it wasn't enough to save the movie. The impression left is that this is trying to be a smart/modern/atypical movie. It kept on trying' all the time but, unfortunately, it never succeeded.<br><br>There are a lot of much better movies full of blood and empty of mind.<br><br>After the disaster named \"The Evil Woods\",it seems that Aaron Harvey tried to save his career as a director. He fails. And for me it's enough to avoid him and his...\"operas\" in the future...<br><br>It's such a pity that actors like Willis or DeNiro haven't played in a good movie for so long time...<br><br>Be smart and avoid this mess.","user":"traianracu","rank":[94,122]},{"title":"Jeebus, What A Mess","rating":3,"date":"1 December 2011","review":"I can only assume that the principles involved needed a paycheck, and the producers had enough on hand to have Forest Whitaker and Bruce Willis climb on board this train wreck. What began to sour me was the obvious Tarantinoesque use of banter, only between vapid Southern Cal airheads, and also the constant flashbacks, to try and set a sort of moodiness. Attempt to get through the obnoxious dialog in the first half hour without rolling your eyes and you're a far more stout film goer than I am. Seiously, repeatedly do a scene 3 times? Now I'm a forgiving kind of movie watcher, but something happened along the way here that completely derailed this train, and I don't think anybody quite knew what they were doing by two thirds of the way through. I'm watching this effort online about three weeks before it's even released in theaters. In DVD quality. Somehow I don't believe it's being distributed to Academy members for Oscar consideration next spring. It looks like it was all meant to enhance Malin Akerman's career.<br><br>The only reason it gets a few stars is Whitaker's energy. Extremely pathetic project. Avoid.","user":"messiercat","rank":[76,107]},{"title":"lose all hope","rating":1,"date":"1 December 2011","review":"I am only thankful that I have the option of turning off a film when my eyes begin to bleed. I have the feeling that Bruce Willis is either contractually obligated to make these films, or that he is desperate for work. I have been a big fan of Forest Whitaker for a long time and his performance is the only aspect of this nightmare on stilts that is not contemptible to the nth degree. Giving nothing away, let me just say that watching three airhead bimbos acting like tough guys for an hour and a half is an objective and honest summation of this \"film\". Willis has very minor scenes-where he is \"less\" than usual- and the rest is a haphazard mix of of terrible acting on the parts of our three \"heroines\". The actresses are all snotty and so dumb that it seems like the producers deliberately made a bloody gangster film for angry teenage drama queens. I do not mind ultra-violence, but targeting children - the way this movie seems to do- is reprehensible. Where are all the good writers. Why cant we put the art back into \"blown apart\"?","user":"tomgprs","rank":[87,131]}]
