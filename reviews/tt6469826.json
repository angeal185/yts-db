[{"title":"Do not be misled","rating":3,"date":"10 May 2018","review":"Over the recent years, I have noticed a trait with underground horror film: they mislead you with their clever cover art. With a title like tempus tormentum, you would expect a lot of torture going on in this movie, am I wrong? I strongly caution you not to be fooled. This is a very low budget movie that just feels like the film camera is doing more stalking then the villians are. The camera just pans the same victim around, as he goes to various places for safety, each time getting predictably foiled by his plan. Clocked in at a running time of barely 77 minutes, we find the victim finally strapped down for some....torture...at about the 45 minute mark, after countless acts of boring boredom. At about the hour mark, we find the victim embedded inside a wire cage being dragged across the road by a chain attached to a vehicle, and actually I was hoping he would just die right there and then, just so the movie would end. The torture, by the way, finds him getting out alive and unharmed, and just a bit spooked by a bizarre incident ( which is never explained.) The real torture that occurs to him the final ten minutes of the movie, its just mental torture. So instead of showing us the cool, clever, spooky, screwed up cover art that this has, how about showing a man running away from pounding blue and pink smoke? Eh? Oh, that's right, because then people wouldn't be interested in watching your piece of crap festival, right? That's where reviewers like me try to protect viewers from wasting 77 minutes of their time. If they wanted to watch crap, they would just watch their dog for 77 minutes, eventually, it will happen. For me, the main torture of the film is the viewer, just painfully watching this garbage mess of a film. 3 out of 10 stars! Be warned, and I cannot say this enough, this is a \"is anyone here?\" movie.","user":"tdrish","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Tempus Tormentum:","rating":3,"date":"22 April 2018","review":"Overall a crappy movie, bad camera angles, lack of emotional attachment to characters and overall lack of context and motive. Missing major aspects of a true suspense movie. What doesn't a horror movie need? colorful smoke and flood light shadows. What did this movie have an overabundance of? colorful smoke and flood light shadows. You never feel the fear that the protagonist feels, you're never given a solid backstory to form a connection to either the main character or the people hunting him. Pointless attempts at cheesy/trippy scares that just didn't end up working. The typewriter could've had a way bigger role but ended up being a redundant addition. Would give a 3/10 for effort.","user":"egcarden","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"More dreck","rating":2,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"TEMPUS TORMENTUM is another slice of indie dreck, this time from Canada. The dark story often veers between horror and thriller but fails to convince as either. The story sees a drifter prowling the streets one night, confronted by masked psychos who proceed to play mind games with him. This has a dark, nihilistic edge but very poor production values and almost no story at all; the director's far more interested in his imagery than any concrete storytelling.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[0,0]}]
