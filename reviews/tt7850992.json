[{"title":"This is not a movie, its an essay!","rating":1,"date":"14 January 2019","review":"At no point of the movie does the narrator actually goes out an proves something. Its just a movie made by a bunch of nerds interested in Sumerian Archeology. The movie goes on for long translating names into English or syllables.<br><br>The movies has such bad sound. The background music and the voice of the narrator are not well balance and 90% of the movie is filmed against a cgi fire in the background!","user":"neoanderson12","rank":[14,18]},{"title":"Leaps of imagination and of logic!","rating":1,"date":"16 June 2018","review":"What a flake. The leaps of logic are only matched by the incredible leaps of imagination that is required to tie any of this \"information\"/\"proof\" together! Presented as factual information, without any single shred of actual meaningful data. Poorly written and directed, as well as just a plain waste of everyone's time altogether. I thought this was a fictional movie... not a extremely bad documentary. <br><br>I sometimes enjoy these ancient alien tropes, as I find them generally and laughably entertaining. In this case, not even a grin crossed my lips. Just too darn boring, and inane to even laugh at for me.<br><br>I find Giorgio Tsoukalos a laugh riot. Philip Gardiner is noTsoukilakialalaos. I call him (Giorgio) that, as I will learn to actually pronounce his name when he can be bothered to pronounce the word extraterrestrial. Since he must say extraterrestrial a few hundred times on camera every outing, you would think he would put forth the effort wouldn't you? Nope. We get \"essata-estial\". Even your German (English is my second language) cult leader says it better than you do. <br><br>I digress. Anunnaki is just a terrible film by any measure. A poor IMDB rating, and this is the one and only review (as of this writing) should tell you something.<br><br>Stay far, far away.","user":"profsmichael","rank":[31,48]},{"title":"Vanity Project","rating":3,"date":"7 August 2018","review":"This film seems to base most of its ideas on a very flimsy platform of pattern recognition of vague or similarities and a boatload of personal opinion. Too many of the views are given without scholarly source attribution. Not only that, the logic used to connect seemingly disparate bits and pieces of historical events, many of which contain gaps measuring thousands of years, is simply jaw-dropping and would be savaged in scholarly debate. I was surprised to discover the listed production date listed as 2017-the tone and graphics seem more suited to the 80s.","user":"caledonia-16031","rank":[13,21]}]
