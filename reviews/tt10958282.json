[{"title":"IMPECCABLE, IMMACULATE, TIMELESS","rating":10,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"This film portrays the \"banlieu\" in the most perfect way, from the conversation to the action scenes and I could not find a single flaw in this film. If you are not from the project then you will not be able to enjoy or relate but with only this film you can learn everything. This film touches every subject, from the lack of involvement of the state to the individuals responsibility of it own choices and much more. You laugh in some parts and cry in others but in the end you will feel fulfilled but you will still want more. All applauds to the writers, actors and directors, THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!","user":"navywaberi","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Just an amazing movie","rating":10,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"Finally Kery James gets the opportunity to produce his award winning script, and what a script that is!

It's not Always done without ankwardness, but it's a honest piece of work. The true life I guess, but I repeat, we Don't know what we see here, a crime movie or a social study. But worthy. I would have guessed to find Doudou Masta here. A mobster character would have fit him like a glove. Or even Kaaris...","user":"searchanddestroy-1","rank":[3,4]}]
