[{"title":"Night Sights: Heavily shilled nonsense","rating":2,"date":"7 June 2018","review":"Let's get something clear, this being written by a 17 year old is fairly impressive so good job to the young fella.

If a film is so bad that I either walk out of the theater mid-film, or shut it off on my home screen, THAT is an awful film. I gave NIGHT SIGHTS a chance because of 2 reasons. One, Supperchillin.com showed that IMDb.com gave it a 6.3 rating, which I see now wasn't true. Two, the film's poster appeared to have a couple of award emblems which indicated at least a couple of respectable entities associated with critical review considering the film worthy of some acclaim...however, the poster art does not exist in a high enough resolution to read what the award emblems state. For all I know one could say \"Thompson Family's Favorite Film of 2011\" or the other one \"El Cid Best Pic of 2011\". I give the young writer and director (Matt Thomspon) ample credit for seeing the production through, raising at least some of the money on Kickstarter, and not abandoning his vision for the story. My most constructive criticisms would be in the area of the film's audio track. Too often, the voice of one actor in a scene would be WAAAY hotter than another. I would have to turn up the volume for one scene, then get blasted through the wall by the levels of the next scene. The acting was high school level. Come to find out the film was made as an advanced film making high school summer projectâ€”so no foul there. Another thing that I found distracting was that Jonathon Lamer was too dead pan and looked a bit like Jason Sudeikis's lesser-known brother on Prozac. I realize that this film isn't too bad considering what I found out post viewing. But still, even youth shouldn't be an excuse. I see plenty of outstanding short films made by young independents on Vimeo. Mastering After Effects, acquiring some 3d animation skills, and making sure your audio is clean and well mastered would be a few things I could suggest. But FWIW, I didn't shut it off. Consider me IMDb's version of Simon Cowell.","user":"tim-arnold777","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"This requires two ratings - the 2*s is for the movie","rating":2,"date":"16 May 2018","review":"Apparently, this was written and directed by a teenager. If so, it needs two reviews - one for it as a movie and one for the fact that the writer/director (already a warning) was so young.<br><br>It's a bold stab at a simple but interesting idea but the inexperience shows through everywhere. Add the fact that he also edited it and that explains much about the shots and the pace. And that's what you're most likely to notice and keep wishing the story would just get a move on.<br><br>But watch it knowing it was, apparently, created by a teenager and you have to marvel at his amazing abilities. However, impressive as they may be, they still don't manage to pull a good movie together but bear that in mind as you watch it and you may be forgiving enough to enjoy it.","user":"iantrader","rank":[2,2]}]
