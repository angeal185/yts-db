Worth watching","rating":8,"date":"3 September 2017","review":"I liked the movie. It was realistic action and the story was entertaining enough to not get bored during the movie. Even though it wasn't released in theaters it was done high quality compared to other Hollywood blockbusters. It was kind of reminded me of a mix between taken and the transporter. Don't know why others hated on it. It was a good movie. Better than a lot of the other action movies I've seen that are super cheesy. It was better than I expected","user":"jonrivera420","rank":[44,60]},{"title":"Okey movie if you can handle a kid that is a complete moron...","rating":4,"date":"21 February 2019","review":"I could've given this movie 1 or 2 more stars. Sam Worthington does a good job.\nProblem is that the girl being so idiotic that I couldn't give the movie more then a 5. I know that's the writers fault and not hers.. Her acting was actually good.","user":"trnod","rank":[12,14]}]
