[{"title":"When A Russian Mole Worships Israel","rating":20,"date":"20 March 2019","review":"And a convicted felon caught breaking the laws of the lands returns the favor to the don this film happens.<br><br>It is an absurdist comedy that is not funny. Comparing Ivanka's loverboy to Lincoln is like comparing a Jeep to a Porsche. Let's get real. The dissonance is too much.","user":"inmandj","rank":[112,152]},{"title":"Transfer mechanism","rating":1,"date":"17 March 2019","review":"This is the film equivalent of the military industrial complex. You know how the Pentagon exists not to protect the country, but to transfer public money to military/armament/war companies? Films like this and Fox News et cetra exist to take money from the tricked and stupid and hand it over to rich billionaire financiers. In exchange, they get more snake oil to hate themselves and demand more tax cuts for already rich corporations and billionaires like Trump!<br><br>In the meanwhile there is as much truth here as anything that comes out of the Sarah Sanders' mouth, but hey if there were any truth it would not serve the interests of the powerful. Gotta keep the stupid masses entertained...","user":"lacesoka","rank":[102,139]},{"title":"Heil Trump","rating":2,"date":"22 March 2019","review":"This is a Heil Trump movie.<br><br>\nWith just lies and tackiness all around and nothing beyond that, this film looked every bit of any nepotistic actor/director from Bollywood's film. This film is a scene to scene, glamorous ode to an already corrupt elitist America and a cabinet and family of swamp dwellers.","user":"moritzdontay","rank":[120,165]}]
