[{"title":"A fascinating look at mental illness and how it affects families","rating":8,"date":"1 February 2020","review":"While the topic of mental illness has been portrayed countless times in cinema I think this is one of the better films that I have seen about the illness. Some may take hope as the silver lining in the movie but I see it a little bit different. With a little bit of help and a lot of empathy it seems that we could be helping people in real and meaningful ways. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and got a bit teary-eyed in the last acts.","user":"ihatebadmoviescom","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Motherhood gets another chance","rating":4,"date":"14 November 2019","review":"Based on the novel of the same name by Joan Clark, this movie tells the story of Maura Mackenzie has it all - beauty, talent and a career as a concert pianist. But with a husband who is never there and the demands of being a mother, all of the stress of life gets to her. Her husband takes their daughters and she has a full-on nervous breakdown on the eve of her American tour. Can she get her life together or is this it?<br><br>Obviously, this isn't the type of movie we cover here all that often, but that doesn't mean that it isn't any good. This tale of dealing with depression and discovering a second chance at motherhood is poignant. It's not a life that I will ever live, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth exploring.<br><br>That said - I don't often watch movies where women try to decide if they want to be a mother or allow the ghost of their own mother to talk them into drowning themselves before falling in love with a trucker in Newfoundland.","user":"BandSAboutMovies","rank":[0,0]}]
