[{"title":"Worth a Watch?..I think so","rating":6,"date":"29 October 2018","review":"How this gets such a low review is very surprising. It's not a bad movie. Good pace, some good acting and some of the scenes are very well put together. The music dubbing is not the best in parts but don't let that put you off. It's quite a watchable movie.","user":"minipcshelp","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Tango but tangled","rating":6,"date":"30 March 2018","review":"Nice work with the credits, the story was unfolded but some scenes were not understandable. Also the sound mixing was not all that great. But going forward, the acting was great as well as the direction.","user":"Otuoacheampong97","rank":[7,27]},{"title":"Tango 0ne/3","rating":6,"date":"30 March 2018","review":"The whole story was not understanding. The flaw lies not only in that but also the sound mixing. But going forward, the acting especially from Campbell was great. Nice movie by the way.","user":"Otuoacheampong97","rank":[3,26]}]
