[{"title":"Great Entertainment","rating":10,"date":"19 January 2004","review":"This is by far one of the top 10 martial art movies of all time.<br><br>This movie has beautiful scenery and atmosphere.  It transport me back to a place long ago and far away where life is cruel and government officials are corrupt but all is not forsaken for heroes are out there with heart of pure goodness, body of iron armor, and spirit of courage and valor. This movie made me believe in this world where human can train their body and mind to do inhuman feats like leaping onto roof tops and shattering cement blocks two feet thick.  It invoked memories of my childhood dream of becoming a martial art master able to kick butt but also the restraint and pathos for helping those less fortunate.  Both  Dr Yang and  Wong Kei-Ying plays a martial art hero that possess these traits.  They are well rounded individuals that posses other admirable skills.  Dr Yang for example is a highly skilled doctor, a flashy cook, and a musician.  I love one of the breath taking scenery in which he was playing this Chinese instrument out in the court yard on a golden autumn day.  It's very nostalgic for me for some reason.  Orchid, Dr Yang's assistant is wonderful in this movie as well. She brought beauty and depth to this movie.  The young Wong Fei-hung character was great as well.  These wonderful characters on top of the amazing fight sequences makes this movie transcend martial art movies and rival any movies genre ever produced in terms of sheer entertainment value. I have read review about the bad/simple plot or fake wire-fu in this movie. That's not the point, the mastery of mood and texture in this movie is sheer enjoyment.  How much plot can one develop in a 90 minute martial art movie?...or any movie really...it's all about the human conditions some more complex than other often recycled over and over through the years and placed in a different setting and different context.  Great movies capture the human imagination and touches a spectrum of human emotions.  Great movies also flow smoothly and do not go into a lull. For me this movie did that and more.   Hopefully you'll want to watch it again and again like I did.","user":"lu_morning","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Awesome Monkey","rating":9,"date":"1 May 2005","review":"Version: Universal Studios / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD release. Cantonese / English subtitles.<br><br>I first saw 'Iron Monkey' on an old, poor-quality VHS release with dodgy English subtitles placed underneath really big and bright Chinese subtitles that took up half of the screen space. You know the type I'm talking about. Even then, my immediate reaction was \"AWESOME WOW AWESOME\".<br><br>The corrupt officials of a Chinese province find themselves the target of Iron Monkey (Rongguang Yu), a sort of Chinese Robin Hood. When Wong Kei Ying (Donnie Yen) and a young Wong Fei Hung (Sze-Man Tsang) arrive in town, Kei Ying is forced to help the corrupt authorities track down Iron Monkey. Naturally, things get complicated when a group of Shaolin rebels arrive in town. Led by Hin Hung (Yee Kwan Yan) these evil Shaolin Monks and Nuns have been paid take out our heroes, leaving Iron Monkey, Kei Ying, Fei Hung, and Miss Orchid (Jean Wang) to kick many an evil-doers arse.<br><br>The story in 'Iron Monkey' serves only as a device to allow for more fighting. Things that might usually be kept secret are revealed nearly straight away, just to avoid any major plot twists and allow for more kung-fu time. In fact, in 'Iron Monkey', kung-fu time occurs much more frequently then plot-development time, and whenever a plot-development moment comes along, it usually accompanied by kung-fu time. Awesome.<br><br>We all know that Donnie Yen and Rongguang Yu are awesome. They spend a good deal of time putting on some awesome fight scenes. Jean Wang and Sze-Man Tsang (who, in Monkey Magic style, is actually a girl) pull of some really cool action sequences. Granted, most of it is grounded in fantasy, much like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and friends, but it still looks really cool, and a few of these fights are easily some of my favourite fight-scenes ever. Also, the technique names rule. I wish I could perform a no-shadow kick or a King Kong palm.<br><br>'Iron Monkey' is nearly nothing but martial arts fantasy. Fans of Hong Kong wuxia movies will get a kick out of this, as will action fans in general. Fans of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', 'Hero', and 'House of Flying Daggers' should see this to see how wuxia should be done, but they may not like it. Fantastic action movie - 9/10","user":"AwesomeWolf","rank":[23,26]},{"title":"Yuen Woo Ping on speed","rating":10,"date":"19 June 2002","review":"I have three words for this movie: Yuen Woo Ping.<br><br>This movie is action packed with Ping's trademark unique fighting sequences. Whether it's bodies slamming through tables, hopping from roof to rooftop, there's so much action, then story, then more action!!! Donnie Yen's martial arts is impressive and his character is very straight to the point, but very noble.  Guang as Dr. Yang is heroic as well and plays his dual role very well.  Most of best battles have both men sharing the screen with lightning speed quickness!!  Tsang is good as young Wong Fei Hung and the beautiful Jean Wang is visually pleasing to watch as Miss Ho (who can also whoop butt).  Master Fox provides  funny moments too.<br><br>Overall, the main emphasis here is the martial arts.  The bad guys are very bad (including one deadly renegade monk) and the action is intense.  Besides \"shadowless kicks\" and \"King Kong fists\", weapons used vary from staffs &amp; swords to umbrellas, benches, and very sharp tacks (OUCH!)  The finale is mind-blowing and is like nothing I've ever seen before.","user":"InzyWimzy","rank":[20,24]}]
