[{"title":"I love music but this score is horrendous","rating":1,"date":"30 December 2018","review":"Well I tried to watch the movie even with it's bad acting but I couldn't due to the horrendous score. Do you have to play such atrocious music in the back ground like throughout the whole movie. But if you did you wouldn't want it to overplay so the viewer can at least experience the movie not the horrible music. And the lead actress - what a terrible acting. How you tried to be sexually appealing but ...... I don't ever do reviews so I'm gonna keep it short. Movie bad , music worse and acting is under sub par.","user":"chinhnguyen-43517","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Did you kill Frank?

The soundtrack was loud and drowned out the dialogue. The track was over dramatic and designed for a 1950's American film and didn't fit the film we were watching. Comically bad at times.<br><br>Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Kirsten Varley)","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[0,1]}]
