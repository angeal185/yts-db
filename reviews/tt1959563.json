[{"title":"Exactly what's expected.","rating":7,"date":"23 April 2018","review":"A lot of good action, a lot of bad language and a few laughs. I guess I expected maybe a few more laughs, but this movie is fun, just very typical. Sam Jackson seemed like he was having a great time. An interesting/fun role for Salma Hayek as well.","user":"funtasticfour","rank":[51,64]},{"title":"Silly, funny, fun.","rating":8,"date":"14 April 2018","review":"Don't expect clever conversation, or a thoughtful plot line. It's just funny, action and it really works.","user":"s_launder","rank":[50,63]},{"title":"Reynolds and Jackson were born for this moment","rating":9,"date":"9 August 2017","review":"Wow, I was so impressed with this movie. I will admit that the first 20  minutes were pretty generic for me and I found myself thinking, \"This  is pretty much what I expected, but it's a free screening so just enjoy  it.\"   However, once Reynolds and Jackson team up on the screen the entire  chemistry of the movie changes and it ended up being one of the funnest  \"buddy cop\" movies I've seen in quite a while. (I know it technically  isn't a buddy cop movie, but it really is for all intents and  purposes.)   The movie doesn't take itself seriously (were you really expecting that  with Reynolds and Jackson?!), and just like any modern action/comedy  the plot isn't meant to be something like Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy.   This movie is 100% worth spending the cash to go see in the theater  with a group of people. I can also tell you this, the atmosphere  leaving the theater was great; this movie is a lot of fun!","user":"allstarrunner","rank":[280,408]}]
