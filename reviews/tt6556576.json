You're not really sure for the first 30 minutes, who these rich people are. It's obvious that something's off about them, but you'll have to wait and see. I won't bother going into the plot, as it's basic without adding spoilers. Not really sure why this only got 5 stars. Compared to some of the mainstream blockbusters I've recently watched, this was probably better than 90% of the garbage I've watched this year. It's bloody, messy, crazy, original, and great fun for those who love the gore genre.","user":"flowerstardust1979","rank":[19,29]},{"title":"Entertaining horror flick!","rating":10,"date":"3 December 2018","review":"This film is a must watch! It's incredibly entertaining and non-cliched! The performances by well-known actors like Julian McMahon, Virginia Gardner and Erin Moriarty, to name a few, are solid all the way around. Definitely not your typical horror flick. The director does a great job at building up climax while maintaining elements of suspense throughout the film. If you are a fan of the genre you will definitely enjoy the crazy kills! And if you are not a horror film fan you should still give this film a shot. Highly recommended.","user":"saoryb-78851","rank":[24,39]}]
