[{"title":"Not gold, but not trash as some are making it out to be","rating":6,"date":"12 July 2009","review":"Now the way I'm reading all these comments on IMDb, people are acting like this was absolutely the worst movie of all time. Honestly, I love you Beth Cooper is not going to be one of those high school movie classics by no mean, but I didn't feel like my time was wasted watching it. As predictable and silly as it was, I still think this was a decent enough movie that got a few good laughs. I mean, who hasn't wanted to go all out on their high school class and just mock them on the last day of school? Not to mention get the hottie of their dreams in the same night that has them just living life to it's fullest. I think that over all the film worked, there were certain things that were flawed in the movie like the script could have used a few touch up's here and there and the cast did seem a little off. Paul Rust, it's kind of disturbing that he not only looks but is 28 years old and then you have Hayden Panettiere who looks 12 years old, it was a little well, you get the idea. But still I think I love you Beth Cooper had it's moments enough to make you just sit back and forget reality for 95 minutes.<br><br>When a geeky high-school valedictorian throws caution to the wind by expressing his love for a popular cheerleader during his graduation speech, life finally starts to get interfering for Denis Cooverman who may have brains to spare; it's guts that he lacks, or at least, he did until today. Stepping up to the podium to deliver an inspirational speech to his graduating class, Denis decides that the time has finally come to call out his classmates on their peccadilloes and declare his love for the prettiest girl in school, Beth Cooper. Much to Denis' surprise, Beth responds by accepting an invitation to a party at his house later that day. But Beth's meat head boyfriend Kevin is none-too-pleased that his high school prize is mingling with the biggest dweeb in school, and when Kevin shows up at his house and tears the place apart in a fit of rage Denis, his best friend Rich, Beth, and her friends Cammy and Treece all pile into Beth's car and flee for their lives. For four long years Denis sat silently behind Beth in class, pining for a way to make his love known. Now, over the course of one long night, Denis will finally get to know the girl of his dreams better than he ever thought possible. If he manages to survive until morning, it's sure to be the story of a lifetime.<br><br>There were times that I absolutely laughed out loud like when Beth's psycho boyfriend kept going after Denis and just beating the heck out of him each time. Also seeing how Denis was reacting to all of Beth's \"flaws\" as a law breaking crazy party girl that he never imagined, only the sick fantasy as he has her picture blown up and taped over his bed. I think just the cast, the script and the characters needed work in order for this to be a great movie and that's why everyone is freaking out and saying how this is the most horrendous movie ever, either that or they're taking it too seriously. I think if you just let go and have a good time, you'll get a few laughs out of this movie, it's all in good fun and sometimes we need those silly high school flicks to either fantasize or bring us back to the good old days where getting a pimple at prom seems to be your scariest problem in the world. I love you Beth Cooper is worth the watch but more so wait for the rental vs. theater, it's just an average teen comedy.<br><br>6/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[68,98]},{"title":"not the worst but lead is problematic","rating":5,"date":"21 November 2014","review":"Valendictorian Dennis Cooverman (Paul Rust) gives the craziest of all graduation speech. First he proclaims \"I love you, Beth Cooper\". Beth (Hayden Panettiere) is the hot popular cheerleader. That's before his speech makes enemies. He even declares that his best friend Rich Munsch (Jack Carpenter) is gay. He invites her to his graduation party. It's only him and Rich but then surprisingly, Beth shows up with her girlfriends Cammy (Lauren London) and Treece (Lauren Storm).<br><br>This movie really struggles with Paul Rust as the lead. He's a geeky looking guy but not nearly adorable enough. He's quirky but not that funny. The character really demands to be played by a faux-geek rather a real nerd like Rust. Hayden Panettiere's character is not somebody on a pedestal. She's a little bit complicated and that's a good thing. The problem is that she's not the lead. Rust is the lead and he can't carry the movie.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Surprisingly Bad & Unfunny","rating":4,"date":"11 July 2009","review":"After seeing a trailer that seemed to have promise I was rather surprised at how much this film lacked any laughs. This fault lies with the directing and editing. The actors seemed to give performances up to that of any other teen comedy, but the timing of the whole movie was off.....and in comedy, timing is everything! The fact that the story has little character set-up and uses every cliché stolen from numerous comedies before it does not help the ill paced scenes.<br><br>I managed to leave the theater without requesting my money back, but you know when people in the audience are having full conversations during a film, it is hardly holding anyone's attention.<br><br>Pass at the B.O. and only rent it on DVD if you have an unlimited plan and are running out of things to see.","user":"prodbabies","rank":[72,110]}]
