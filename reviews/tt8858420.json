[{"title":"nowadays everyone can record video and call it a film...","rating":1,"date":"2 October 2019","review":"This was a painfull experience watching those non actors, 'acting'...\nwooden acting, without a screenplay, terrible 'one liners' dialogues, a lot of swearing and gore, bad, bad bad, even funny sometimes, so bad:)\nold unattractive and ugly 50 something girls, with handsome lads, kinda more like England or Germany, not Poland, where usually in life it's opposite...\nThe casting was also terrible, for example 'pantadeusz', the only pro actor in the team, who plays a mafia boss, and looks like sweet priest from small town:), he tries to be tough, but one look at his face and you see that sweet boy, it's good actor, but he simply cannot play bad character, it's kind of like imaging Woody Allen playing vicious mafia boss...the only good thing about it is camera work, nice pictures and good edits, the rest is low level vhs market;\navoid, I warned you!","user":"filipmail","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"A decent plot with strong acting and witty dialogue","rating":7,"date":"27 February 2019","review":"This movie is 100% \"vegan\". If you liked previous movies by Patryk Vega, you will like this one, too. If you hated his style before, you will hate this movie as well. The action is fast-paced and shot in several regions of the world. The plot is complex and multilinear but converges in the last act quite neatly. I have the impression that the plot was much more consistent than in Vega's previous movies and builds towards the climax. Some scenes were pretty funny, with the audience laughing out loud several times. Some scenes offer excessive gore. This movie received strong acting from prominent Polish actors and an outstanding performance by Angie Cepeda. This surely is a must-see for all fans of gangster movies. However, I am not sure whether it has much to offer for an international audience. Moreover, I do not think that this movie has some deeper message. It is just pure entertainment.","user":"lkacz1","rank":[6,19]},{"title":"Action","rating":8,"date":"28 December 2019","review":"It was alright action movie...different at the good way.","user":"happybaddi","rank":[2,4]}]
