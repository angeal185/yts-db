[{"title":"Small fluff of a movie, decent entertainment in the French wine country.","rating":19,"date":"19 April 2019","review":"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. Strangely about 20% of the IMDB votes are \"1\" which is bogus. While it isn't a great movie it has some nice elements and is mostly entertaining.<br><br>The title refers to a botched marriage proposal, a 50-ish man, a family friend, proposes to a 26-yr-old daughter under the Eiffel Tower, after mistaking her friendship for a romantic interest. Properly embarrassed he decides to wander randomly into France, ending up in the wine region near the city of Bordeaux. On the train he meets a pretty French lady who, it turns out, is co-owner of a really nice vineyard. In turn he convinces his boss back in Kentucky that their company should buy the vineyard. But he really wants to have the lady.<br><br>In reality it is a small fluff of a movie but is decently entertaining. Don't trust any reviews that claim it is a \"1\" or a \"10\".","user":"TxMike","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"I enjoyed it.","rating":7,"date":"15 October 2019","review":"Not sure why ratings are so low. I enjoyed it. Acting was good. The story is as old as the world itself, nevertheless the setting is beautiful and Judith Godr√®che is stunning. No screaming American women here.","user":"myotherpetisdog","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Worst Scottish accent ever","rating":6,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"Why did Matt Reid's character have to be Scottish ? It is so bad that however pleasant the film is, and Matt Walsh is excellent, it ruins the film by being so distracting. It's a fine rom com with Veep buddies but alas I can't get over the accent which is a different accent on almost every other word!","user":"tobyshjones","rank":[6,7]}]
