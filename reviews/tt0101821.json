[{"title":"Ernest P. fights off \"booger-lipped\" bad guys. . .","rating":9,"date":"20 September 2001","review":"O.K. so this movie probably wasn't nominated for an Oscar for best original screenplay.  Or best of anything else for that matter. And the film is what most folks would term \"stupid\" humor.  So I like \"stupid\" humor, so sue me. Jim Varney's creation of characters like Ernest and the myriad others he pulled out of seeming thin air, in my opinion speak volumes of his talent and creativity.  Sometimes it's enough just to be entertained with belly laughs and not stop and analyze every single line of dialog.  If you're the intellectual type, don't bother with this movie, it'll go way over your head, or under your radar screen one.  But if you're an otherwise intelligent and reasonably good humored person, and especially if you're looking for something that is decidedly NOT a gut-yanking, eyeball popping, gorey screamfest to watch with your kids on Halloween, this is a fun and easy on the brain flick.","user":"Iammymothersdaughter2","rank":[22,23]},{"title":"When Halloween was fun and Ernest made us scared stupid","rating":7,"date":"29 November 2003","review":"One of the movies I remember watching like crazy when I was a kid during Halloween was Ernest Scared Stupid. It was always on TV and one of those harmless kid's movies that they could watch with a fun scare and was pretty safe for the family. I always loved this movie, even though I liked the more intense films like Jaws and The Exorcist, Ernest Scared Stupid was something special to me. I think because I always liked the mix of horror and comedy. Jim Varney went from doing Mello Yello commercials to creating Ernest, one of the silliest but funniest characters of all time. He saved Christmas, went to prison and now he's being scared stupid. Now does the film still hold up after all these years? I think so, it's a reminder of a time when Halloween was fun and about the scares.<br><br>Ernest works as a sanitation engineer for the town and is close friends with Elizabeth and her two friends Joey, and Kenny. After their haunted clubhouse is ruined by the Mayor's two sons who are bullying them, Ernest promises to find them a better place to build one shortly before he is ordered to clear the land of Old Lady Hackmore but he is frightened off by her, and when running through her lands he comes across a gigantic tree, which he and the kids decide to turn into a gigantic tree house. Ernest accidentally incites the incantation to summon the troll. The troll now wants the children so he can bring back his other evil troll friends. But Ernest and the kids are on top of it trying to stop him before he can do this and save the town.<br><br>Ernest Scared Stupid is a harmless film that I don't know why, but people gave this movie the harshest rating. Is it because we grew up? When did we stop forgetting what it's like to be a kid? Especially during Halloween where we wore that horrible Walgreens make up, itchy costume, went trick-or-treating, coming home to get rid of the corn candy in the bag only to get to the good stuff like Snickers and Hershey bars. That's what Ernest Scared Stupid meant to me, reminding me of the good times. The acting may be bad, but it's a kid's movie for goodness sake. The kid actors do as average of a job as most actors. Ernest was hilarious though, I just love when he reunites with Rimshot at the end and is taken down by his kisses. I thought the costumes/impressions by Jim were great and just a fun laugh. This may be a silly movie, but I think people just need to let go. After all, when it comes down to it, every holiday takes us back to the time when we were kids with all those good memories.<br><br>7/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"More Innocent Than It Is Stupid","rating":7,"date":"29 August 2007","review":"This was the first \"Ernest\" movie, I think, that I watched and I was surprised that it wasn't as stupid as I thought it was or the title convinced me it would be. It really wasn't \"stupid\" until the last 20 minutes, but a lot of movies get really dumb in the last half hour.<br><br>For most of the movie, it was nice, lighthearted fun that - clich√© aside - is fun for the \"whole family.\" There is nary a bad one word in this movie and it's old-fashioned slapstick fun and about as innocent as it gets. <br><br>Having said that, I realize a lot of people would still consider the movie as a dumb one but I always liked Jim Varney and laughed at the most of the stuff he did, beginning with those famous TV commercials of his.<br><br>In the last 30 years, how many comedies do you see without a tons of sex and profanity? Almost none......so give \"Ernest\" some slack.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[21,24]}]
