[{"title":"A bit different but not bad.","rating":6,"date":"5 November 2019","review":"I wouldn't go that far to say that Limbo is a gem like somebody else wrote, but the story itself isn't bad. It's a bit different, not one of those déjà vu movies in the horror genre. Well horror is a big word, because that's not really the case for Limbo. Everything happens in hell, or just before hell, and there are some demons, but it's all more dramatic than scary. The acting is not award winning but not bad either. Limbo is a bit different from all the rest, but I'm glad I watched it.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"A very different film","rating":8,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"This was a very different kind of movie.Then at the end, it becomes very different than you thought it was. Was it a great movie, with fantastic acting? Meh, it shines in some spots throughout. Was it a great story/premise? Hell yes. If you enjoy something like The Man From Earth, you will most likely enjoy this.","user":"Manwhofell","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Very well told story with a little humor and subtle drama.","rating":7,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"This was a fairly enjoyable film. The characters were well developed and the actors made them believable. The plot was interesting enough that I wanted to know more and to see what would finally happen. The concept was simple but it worked well because of some very creative writing with just enough humor and a mix of drama to keep things moving at a good pace. The setting and effects added to the intrigue and mystery of what was going to happen next moments. Someone mentioned 'Man from Earth' and I would totally agree. You'll be pleasantly surprised as I rated this a 7, a fair movie.","user":"safsurfer","rank":[5,5]}]
