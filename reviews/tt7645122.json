[{"title":"Another wedding-themed romcom","rating":9,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"There was nothing new to the story. Everything falls in as expected. Friends become couple, break up, patch up and everything else...\nBut what I liked about the movie was how the story was shown. Wedding after wedding, Best Man and Maid of Honor speeches. All of that combined with the dialogues, it felt very real. Cast has done an amazing job.\nI really enjoyed it. Recommend watching it.","user":"www-aktomer","rank":[31,38]},{"title":"Really Good","rating":8,"date":"15 June 2019","review":"It's really good &amp; I obviously enjoyed it. It's well written &amp; acted.<br><br>It's the best romantic comedy I have seen in a while &amp; deserves to be a hit. There's a moment when the lead female character's persona flips &amp; it's heartbreaking.<br><br>It's just a good old Boy/Girl romcom - which is becoming a rarity. There is something for the majority of folk to relate to here.","user":"LouieInLove","rank":[36,48]},{"title":"Rom-Com Wedding Heaven","rating":9,"date":"20 July 2019","review":"This is a great addition to the rom-com genre. The characters are attractive and engaging, enjoy great chemistry and the dialogue crackles along throughout. Jack Quaid and especially Maya Erskine are excellent in the lead roles. Even the last half hour doesn't flag and so avoids something which plagues so many films in this genre. One aspect which engaged my post viewing ruminations was whether the lead female character Alice was a Manic Pixie Dream Girl. I concluded that while she probably was - after all the essential arc of the film is the overcoming of the male character's lifelong romantic commitment phobia by his association with a dynamic female friend at a series of weddings - nevertheless her character is so rich, well-drawn and zestful that it doesn't matter. Heartily recommended for those who enjoy their rom-coms and even those who don't.","user":"prs-51","rank":[14,18]}]
