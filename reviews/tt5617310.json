[{"title":"Not bad at all!","rating":6,"date":"17 June 2019","review":"I'm a big fan of found footage horrors, but a lot of the newer once are not up to par... This one is quite good!Recommeneded!","user":"aramt-07935","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Not bad.","rating":6,"date":"12 February 2019","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this low-budget film. If you go into this with the mindset that it is a mystery, that could develop into a horror film, you'll definitely enjoy your time spent.\nUnlike most found footage horror films, this one doesn't really drag or, has a storyline that goes nowhere. It's very consistent, and has somewhat of an interesting ending. Think of \"the wicker man\" Mixed with \"The Last Exorcism.\"","user":"clk264-649-716463","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Solid Folk Horror Found Footage","rating":7,"date":"19 December 2018","review":"I checked out the review page before posting this and there seems to be a few silly reviews. This is a well constructed horror flick and the tension builds nicely throughout. It's not perfect, but great to see the weirdness of folk horror like The Wickerman used to inspire something more akin to The Blair Witch Project. Yes, the camera is shaky, yes it looks like a vlog, and yes the dialogue is naturally repetitive at times - it's meant to look real - and that's the point. The tension broods and delivers with a solid climax.","user":"andrewjohnsjohns","rank":[12,23]}]
