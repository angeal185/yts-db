[{"title":"Vishal Bhardwaj, you are a legend","rating":9,"date":"30 September 2018","review":"The story is pretty average and is very predictable all the time. But there are so many great things about this movie, these things won't bother you.\n1. Acting: I don't remember the last time I saw such great acting performances in a single movie. Everyone was just awesome.\n2. Dialogue: That rajasthani accent is lovely. You would enjoy it throughout the movie. Also the one liners are great, no cringy jokes which the movies nowadays are filleeld with.\n3. The locations of the shooting are very good. Village scenes are perfect, you can see that they shot everything in a real village, not in a studio (most of them).\n4. The sweet messages throughout the movie will make you question.<br><br>Summing up in short, everyone should see this movie, its worth every penny.\n9/10","user":"masssmukul","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"Entertaining and hilarious","rating":8,"date":"24 November 2018","review":"Will keep it short.<br><br>You won't regret watching this movie and is definitely a Paisa wasool movie.","user":"abhineet150","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Loved this movie.","rating":10,"date":"26 December 2018","review":"Acting of two sisters are amazing .
