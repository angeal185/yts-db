[{"title":"Really enjoyed it","rating":8,"date":"17 May 2019","review":"Was far better than expected and a more real look at relationships. Good cast for an independent film. Was crying out that they were both better suited for the other couple and would have preferred that to the actual ending but you can't have it all. For a low budget indie film a lot better than many have made out.","user":"muamba_eats_toast","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Better than a lot of the ratings","rating":7,"date":"15 March 2019","review":"Yes it's maybe not as shiny and sparkly as how relationships are normally portrayed but it's just as good maybe s bit refreshing. The music is really excellent though.","user":"ciaratarpey","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"What Love is Really Like","rating":10,"date":"11 May 2018","review":"Narrative movies at film festivals are often a gamble, so I was happy to see such an honest, funny, and sweet movie at Tribeca late last month. Hoping it's picked up for distribution soon, because it's the kind of movie that isn't made much anymore, and one that will please people who have been waiting for more authentic love stories.","user":"juliancharles-04304","rank":[19,30]}]
