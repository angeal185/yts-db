[{"title":"Absorbing but Ultimately Mediocre","rating":7,"date":"29 May 2016","review":"Great cast, great performances, great direction...but the script...it was as if the writers either got bored of the whole thing or hastily finished it on deadline day.<br><br>An absorbing, at times very tense buildup, hints at something possibly occult going on, but then a rushed ending that didn't need the buildup! It begins with a kind of Rosemary's Baby feel to it but the plot and tension builds to a certain level then remains there at that pace for the rest of the film.<br><br>Well worth watching, but just enjoy the actors and mood and don't expect to be blown away by any clever plot twists and turns.<br><br>It should have been shown as a Sunday evening BBC2 play or something.","user":"syphongb","rank":[63,82]},{"title":"A gaping maw of a plot hole at the end ruins this film","rating":3,"date":"20 April 2018","review":"The idea is a good one, and up until the last ten minutes it's actually very clever. However - spoiler alert - baby goes missing, no investigation, father never mentions why wife is so worried and no police? over a missing baby? Rudimentary investigation would have revealed who did it in ten minutes. Utterly relentlessly pointless ending that makes no sense! How was this ever released with such a painful plot hole!","user":"jonchamps","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"A haunting story with an unfortunately flawed script","rating":26,"date":"26 September 2016","review":"I really enjoyed 'The Ones Below' and was almost willing to give it a '9' rating, when I suddenly realised there was a glaring and unforgivable plot hole ruining the premise of the movie, or more importantly its twist. Usually I'm very forgiving when it comes to plot holes, because I'm pretty good at finding a way to justify them in some context and not allow it to destroy the experience for me. On this occasion though I simply could not do that. (SPOILERS) When the twist at the end is revealed that it was never actually the baby being thrown into the river, it makes no sense that no one has actually gone in searching and worked out there is no baby and launched a massive search. It would take the police literally 5 minutes, by the look of that river, to go in there and find whatever bundle was actually thrown in (I suspect the cat). In fact I kept expecting the father to dive in right there on the spot. You'd have to wouldn't you?<br><br>It's a shame that a very poor and lazy piece of writing can take so much away from an otherwise great film. There was a lot of good elements here. There was the mystery side of things, where we were never entirely sure of character's motives and whether things were as they seemed or not. There was the dramatic side of things, with people genuinely dealing with loss and depression. And there was a lot of intensity in particular scenes, mostly created by some excellent acting by the main four actors in the cast. Putting aside the writing flaws in the ending, I did like it as a twist. It's not the most blindsiding of plot twists (because a part of you suspects this the entire film) but it still works. Definitely a film worth a look.","user":"jtindahouse","rank":[14,20]}]
