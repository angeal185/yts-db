[{"title":"The creme de la creme of cheesy action flicks","rating":7,"date":"24 May 2001","review":"I went into this movie with the no expectations, except to see a cheesy action flick. This means I desired high-flying, over-the-top action that includes lots of cool martial arts, mushroom cloud explosions, high speed car chases and catastrophic crashes, and ultra-violent death scenes. Boy does this movie deliver!<br><br>I've been reading some of the other user reviews here on imdb and many are saying this is Seagal's best flick. I would probably agree that it is close. His stiff under-acting makes him perfect for this Dirty Harry type part.<br><br>\nThe plot is nothing new. Seagal is a strung-out lone ranger cop who plays by his own rules...well you know the type, this character has been used in countless movies. Basically, Seagal's character finally goes too far (by throwing the Vice President off a bridge no less!) Thus, Seagal gets demoted down to the most dangerous precinct in town. Once there, he begins to discover crooked cops and internal conspiracies. With no one to trust and people trying (emphasis on \"trying\") to kill him left and right, Seagal starts kicking ass and taking names.<br><br>Yes I know, this storyline is as old as they come, but I maintain that cheesy action flicks aren't about great or novel plot lines. No, cheesy action flicks are about great action with all the things I listed above, in which, this movie delivers the goods with a bang. <br><br>This movie also stars DMX, who is surprisingly competent as one of the main and most interesting characters of the movie.  Generally good performances all around. I never noticed any laughably bad acting. Flashy directing and nice production design are also bonuses. This tired plot even still manages a few interesting twists (I won't reveal anything for those who haven't seen the movie, but lets just say everyone is not how they seem, including the bad guys). <br><br>FINAL RATING: 7/10 - As good as a cliched action flick can be. Semi-interesting characters, a few plot twists here and there, steady, interesting action, flashy directing, decent performances, plenty of cool explosions, exciting car chases, and numerous excellent violent death scenes. This movie is truly the creme de la creme of cheesy action flicks!

A total blast!","rating":7,"date":"4 August 2001","review":"Anybody should know when you're getting ready to see a Steven Seagal movie you're not getting ready to see a Greek tragedy.  What makes \"Exit Wounds\" special is it's all in good fun.  There's no pretentions whatsoever.  In fact, it even leaves a good share of the running time for comic relief.  You have spectacular action in one corner...you have hilarious comedy in the other...what the hell more can you ask for?  <br><br>Seagal hasn't made an action flick in a while, so it was great to see him again on the silver screen.  He takes a lot of flack for gaining a little weight.  OK, so he's heavier than normal.  So maybe him and Sammo Hung been hanging out in the same buffet.  But Seagal can still kick butt like he did back in \"Above the Law\" and \"Hard to Kill.\"  His action scenes are always fun to watch.  As I tell people, I'm not easily aroused by action scenes.  I can be just as bored by an action scene as one would get bored during an episode of \"Masterpiece Theater.\"  But Seagal's action scenes have a sense of originality and flare.  Big deal.  He's not the best actor.  Does his work require great dramatic acting?  Would a dramatic monologue be appropriate during one of HIS movies?  Let's be sensible.  I think people are way too hard on the man.  He's still cool with me.<br><br>In the comedy department, we have the uninhibited Tom Arnold.  Arnold plays the stereotypical cheesy talk show host, who takes anger-management classes with Seagal.  There's a hilarious scene where Seagal loses his temper and throws a fit, yelling to the teacher \"I'm a happy person!\" with anger in his eyes.  Then Arnold decides that Seagal would be a perfect guest for his show.  Also, we have Anthony Anderson of \"Me Myself and Irene\" fame.  He was one of the foul-mouthed African-American brothers in the Farrelly Brothers comedy.  He gets an even bigger opportunity to flaunt his comic chops in this flick.  In fact, him and Tom Arnold have a hysterically funny conversation at the end credits, so PLEASE don't be so quick to walk out the theater.  <br><br>DMX is not a terrific actor, but he's fairly good.  He proves his discipline as an actor in a more restrained role than his starring role in Hype Williams' \"Belly.\"  In that film, he pretty much portrayed a character out of all his rap videos.  So that wasn't a big stretch.  \"EW\" gives him more to work with.  Not the role of a lifetime, but meatier than a drug-dealing \"gangsta.\"  And did I mention Jill Hennesy is in the cast?  Oh...mannnnn! She is an absolute knockout!  Perfect eye candy!  Throw in a gratuitous strip club scene(which this film has), and we have the ultimate guy flick. <br><br>With DMX in the lead, naturally we have to expect some of his songs on the soundtrack.  And he provides some good stuff.  One--which was used in the previews and thankfully was used in the movie too--is a remix of \"Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone.\"  It's quite innovative how they insert an artist's songs into a movie's soundtrack.  There's also a scene where DMX is picking out a car and blasts on the stereo his song \"Why Do Good Girls Love Bad Guys.\"  <br><br>There isn't much depth to \"Exit Wounds.\"  In fact, I don't know if there's any depth.  But a film like this is meant strictly for exhibition.  And in that department, it really really delivers!  It's exciting!  It's funny! It's rousing!  It's a thrill a minute!  You won't be bored for a second!  An hour and thirty minutes of sheer, uninhibited fun!  \"Exit Wounds\" won't have you heading to the exit.  In fact, you probably won't even want to go out for popcorn you'll be having such a great time!  Strap in!<br><br>My score:  7 (out of 10)","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[31,41]}]
