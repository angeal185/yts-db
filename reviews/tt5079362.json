[{"title":"I laughed. A lot.","rating":9,"date":"16 January 2020","review":"I saw Reality Queen! when it premiered in Los Angeles around two years ago. I tagged along with a friend who had been invited to the premiere. Not knowing what to expect, I was quite pleasantly surprised at how funny the movie is! I especially enjoyed the casting, particularly Kate Orsini playing the role of BBC journalist Diana Smeltmarlin. What a fantastic performance! Overall,I highly recommend Reality Queen! for a fun evening in.","user":"FilmFan0077","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Funny as hell, and here's why...","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2020","review":"It pokes fun at the reality of the movie industry, doesn't ever take itself seriously and you shouldn't either. It's never judgemental or trying to communicate anything serious. I laughed at all of the off-the-wall humor which was a nice change from movies that actually try to be funny and fail. Enjoy!","user":"rvp-58408","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"HILARIOUS","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2020","review":"Great movie!! The humor is amazing!
