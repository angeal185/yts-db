Since the second one (and there are MANY Puppet Master movies) they just are not meant to be taken seriously. <br><br>They are campy, over-sexualized and goofy. And that is exactly why you watch them. Nazis with bad accents? Check. Gratuitous boobage? Check. Puppets that kill? Check check check.<br><br>This movie is what it is, a good movie to laugh at with your friends. It's made by the same folks who made Demon Toys and who have their own Roadhouse line. That should tell you what type of movie you're in for. It's worth the rental.","user":"mistyfifield","rank":[14,18]},{"title":"Solid and enjoyable outing in the franchise","rating":7,"date":"22 October 2018","review":"With the puppet in Nazi hands, the couple who survived from before are thrust back into the fight against the Nazi's when the superior officer in charge comes in to clean up the mess in order to carry on his quest for Nazi super-soldiers and forces them to fight new, deadly puppets to stop him.<br><br>This was a fun if somewhat flawed entry. One of the better aspects to this one is the fact that there's a lot of fun work to be had here with the continuation of the storyline. Not only by knocking off the previous film's villains in order to keep that storyline going but introducing the new one involving the rogue Nazi commander who wants to create a new race of beings based on the work of the puppets that moves this one along nicely. There's a fun air here in the Nazi hideout where we see the failed experiments play out as the reanimated soldiers turn to goo or melt away which launches into the many speeches or enjoyable rounds of temptation taking place in the lab where it really plays on the sympathies of those around him to really work nicely within this one. The second half here, where it focuses on the plan to stop them and get their stolen friend back leads to some more fun here in the full-on puppet action that gets unleashed here. From the first encounter with the new puppets that are not only cool-looking creations but given some impressive powers, the later confrontation in the community hall as well as the series of action scenes in the German hideout that has a lot of fine action between the puppets and between the people involved which is what makes this so enjoyable overall. There are a few major problems with this one, mostly the fact that the puppets are reduced in screentime to such an extent that they rarely are shown here. This one offers up far more scenes of the Nazi's standing around making threats or experimenting on their discoveries which goes hand-in-hand with the few scenes of the kids coming to terms with what happened the day before which really keeps the puppets to such a small part of the film that they don't make much of an impression until the finale. There's a lot more this could've done to work them into the story earlier and more often, so it's a major missed opportunity to leave this one with such a lack of action. The other big issue here is the rather obvious cheap-looking aesthetic throughout here, from the few locations that are rarely changed up or look like they're all that well-stocked which give away the film's key nature. As that extends to the CGI blood-splatter that looks awful as well, overall this one really showcases such a low-budget nature. Beyond these elements, though, the film isn't that bad.<br><br>Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Language.","user":"kannibalcorpsegrinder","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"B -Movie - puppets, Nazis, boobs and blood.","rating":21,"date":"21 February 2013","review":"Nazis attempt to create a new army by reanimating corpses, when their plan goes awry they go about using Toulon's Puppet's secret to assist them.<br><br>Picking up where Axis of Evil left off producer Charles Band's cult creations return.
