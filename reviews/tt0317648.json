[{"title":"Old Style Entertainment...","rating":8,"date":"10 October 2004","review":"In the age of Matrix, I Robot, A.I., Minority Report, etcetera. ain't easy to find adventure-movies made in the old style: the good guy, the very bad guy, the girl, and a happy ending ... Well, this is what Hidalgo offers us.<br><br>Viggo Mortensen's character is a cowboy specializing in long distance horse races, he and his horse (Hidalgo, a Mustang) are just unbeatable. So some arabian skeikh (Omar Sharif) sends for him to take part in the biggest horse race in the world (4.800km long, through the Arabian desert) to prove that Mortensen's non-thoroughbred horse is not as good and resistant as arabian horses. That's the starting point. And from that moment on we will witness a marvelous adventure through the desert in which the starring will have to face all kind of difficulties and traps. As I've said: and old style adventure movie. No absurd and meaningless special effects, no absurd and unbelievable plots, and no pretensions but to make the audience have a good time. And no doubt Joe Johnston achieves that: the movie is 136 minutes long but you don't feel tired nor boring in any moment. The rhythm is just great and well measured. The photography and the landscapes are just astonishing; and the work of Mortensen is so remarkable. He seems to be the perfect heir to those actors specializing in adventure movies just like Harrison Ford, though Mortensen's characters (Hidalgo, LOTR) usually are a little more darker than Ford's. <br><br>My rate: 8/10","user":"rainking_es","rank":[91,103]},{"title":"Feel good movie - start to finish ~!","rating":10,"date":"10 March 2004","review":"Hidalgo is one of those movies that comes along once in a blue moon.  This is a movie NOT to be missed.<br><br>Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of a gentle, laid-back cowboy hearkens back to the golden age of cinema and would make the likes of Gary Cooper proud!  His subtle blend of virtue such as honor, honest and pride - without being the least bit preachy, make watching his performance an utter joy.<br><br>All of the actors are brilliant in their roles, especially the one in the title role!  Hidalgo is clever and entertaining without being unbelievable as many animal movies are these days. You won't find him standing on his hind legs and doing the hokey-pokey, but his talents are very evident and he becomes a hero that we all love before the end of the movie.<br><br>One of the best parts of this movie is the fact that it is a movie by grownups for grownups, although it carries enough action and suspense that kids will probably like it to.  Absent, however is the sickeningly sweet \"kids scenes\" that we simply cannot get away from in movies today.  No charming close ups of dimple-faced waifs.  No little wise-mouthed child prodigies - nothing but good old fashioned grown-up fun!  How refreshing.<br><br>You will be happy to know that the ending isn't as predictable as it could have been.  Although falling into the \"happy\" category (of course), there are poignant moments and you might shed a tear.  <br><br>One other aspect of this film which I found intriguing is the issue of examining and accepting who we are.  It was very well done and meaningful. <br><br>\nOverall this film is easily a 10+.  Please see it","user":"Donsgal","rank":[71,82]},{"title":"Critics are wrong","rating":10,"date":"14 March 2004","review":"I've seen Hidalgo twice and will go again (and again) and I will buy the DVD. I hope that people will not listen to the critics and will give this movie a chance for success. It doesn't matter if Frank Hopkins did these things or not. If he didn't, he gave us a rousing story. Viggo is perfect in this role as the \"cowboy\" and rides Hidalgo like the wind. The Arabian desert is frightening and beautiful. The horses are beautiful. Some don't like what seems like stereotypes, however, it takes place in 1890 and Native Americans were killed, then played for sport in \"shows\". Africans were enslaved and women wore (wear) veils. The movie is right with the times. The music is enjoyable. I'll look for the soundtrack on CD. See it and decide for yourself.","user":"ja_hunter","rank":[39,44]}]
