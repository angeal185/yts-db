[{"title":"The sheriff is weary of being the only clean person in his dirty little town.","rating":9,"date":"1 August 2017","review":"No spoilers here. <br><br>Like Memento, it's written to be watched twice. The writing is tight and smart, nothing is wasted, though that might not register until the second time through.<br><br>Both bleak and comic, it is a genuine mystery, in that clues and red herrings are carefully planted throughout, with a big reveal at the end that is genuinely surprising. The storytelling architecture is very satisfying. <br><br>You are not emotionally invested in any of the characters. This is by design, the structure pretty much guarantees it, and it's a good thing. <br><br>Though it works backwards, it goes day-by-day, not sequence by sequence, so while you are kept engaged in figuring out what's going on and who's who, it's easy enough keep track, you're never at sea. There's plenty to enjoy the first time through, but much of the early content, and many of the \"jokes\" -- it's very dark, but they are a kind of jokes-- only hit on second viewing. <br><br>It's a new kind of thing, straight to streaming, the cinematic equivalent of a straight-to-paperback noir. Made cheaply enough that neither the cinematography nor the acting seek to wow you (though they do get the job done) so it's not like a movie. But it's not like TV either, it's not looking for ratings, it doesn't have to go big-hit-or-die, it doesn't need a sponsor, it can be its own thing, the story they wanted to tell, everything's in there they wanted, nothing is in there they didn't want. <br><br>I liked it a lot. I probably wouldn't have watched it again, but there were special circumstances, and I'm really glad I did.","user":"folktale","rank":[47,49]},{"title":"Tight little thriller worth a view","rating":7,"date":"10 June 2017","review":"I read the plot summary, \"OK, structured like Memento, let's see if it's original.\" Started out fair with nothing very compelling. Seemed like a standard small town crime story with nothing new beyond the backwards- in-time format. But definitely picks up along the way. Got more interested as I watched and it ultimately paid off very well! The structure truly served the plot and was not just applied to make it seem creative. It was inventive, tautly paced, well cut and an appropriate length. Give it a shot. You might even want to watch it again. I plan to.","user":"ejr-4","rank":[50,57]},{"title":"Gripping Movie","rating":8,"date":"16 July 2017","review":"This movie shows us the events which unfold after a bank robbery, in reverse. It is a very gripping film that has you wondering right until the last scene. Great characters and dialogue, with a good mix of suspense and action. If you enjoy the movie, no doubt you will want to watch it again, since the movie is played in reverse chronological order. I think the decision to show the movie in this order was risky, but well executed. Great length, no filler... awesome movie!","user":"AgallochNZ","rank":[23,25]}]
