[{"title":"So-So But The Actors Are Good","rating":5,"date":"29 April 2018","review":"I Have Reviewed OVER 500 Christmas MOVIES. On all Christmas movies BEWARE OF FAKE REVIEWS &amp; REVIEWERS. Many reviewers have only have ONE REVIEW. When it's a POSITIVE REVIEW chances are that the reviewer was involved with the production. If its a negative review then they may have a huge grudge against the film for whatever reason. I am fare about these films.<br><br>I review them is to keep track of what \"I have seen\". Two people meet by accident on July 4th and find themselves living together very quickly. However as fast as the relationship started it also burns out just as fast. Now this being the holiday the former couple pretend to still be a couple so their holidays do not turn into a pity party.<br><br>The film is not great but it is not a total waste of time. I think both of the characters are people that in real \"You Could Be Friends With\". <br><br>The problem with the film however is that scenes are telegraphed to the audience long before it happens. <br><br>The actors are all good and deliver an enjoyable product.","user":"Christmas-Reviewer","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"I was duped by the reviews.","rating":1,"date":"27 February 2017","review":"This movie was horrendous. The acting was abysmal. I can't believe how bad it was. Who in the world gave this so many stars???<br><br>Just as an FYI, this was produced by the main actress' father and was, unsurprisingly, his first film. That explains a bit of the terrible nature.","user":"thegardenmomma","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"Not Good","rating":1,"date":"21 April 2017","review":"I couldn't even make it through the first 20 minutes. This was ridiculously bad and I never say this or write bad reviews.. The female lead was just overly annoying to watch. Even after reading other bad reviews, I still wanted to try and give it a fair chance. The male lead was good, but he needed to be in a different movie, since the female lead was so amateur and ridiculously bad that it seemed to only drag him down into such a crap movie. :-(","user":"ayla-81-679326","rank":[4,6]}]
