I had missed the first couple of minutes including the title, so I was just as unprepared as the shipwrecked Andrew (Michael York) when he set foot on this beautiful tropical island. To his horror, he finds out that an aging scientist, presumed long dead by the world, has populated the island with his \"children,\" the results of his experiments in combining human and animal genes. What I found most astonishing was the authentic feel to the characters. Starting with Andrew. His initial repulsion develops into a discerning appreciation, without ever condoning the monstrosity of Dr. Moreau's project. The old scientist himself (Burt Lancaster, a rather shallow performance in comparison) is not an evil lunatic but a genius who got carried away, convinced to the end of his own noble goals and best intentions. However, the most amazing aspect is the differentiated portrayal of Moreau's more or less \"successful\" creatures. The movie manages to make your heart go out for them in their struggle to be human against their nature. The most poignant moment is the Lionman's farewell cry for his Master. An overall very satisfying movie, despite some weaknesses in the development of the plot towards the end (it feels like the director suddenly ran out of time). Quality science-fiction with good entertainment value. 7/10","user":"johannI-2","rank":[27,28]},{"title":"Splendid version of Wells' novel.","rating":7,"date":"19 January 2008","review":"There exist several film version of H.G. Wells' famous tale, including a very old one starring Charles Laughton &amp; Bela Lugosi, and the much more known and hyped 90's version starring Marlon Brando. This 70's version is the most obscure of the bunch, but it certainly should appeal to horror fanatics as well as to admirers of Wells' writings. The 70's way of film-making (gritty special effects, cheap atmosphere of sleaze, violence ) fits the story very well because it basically is a very grotesque, far-fetched and strangely unsettling political allegory. Burt Lancaster this time depicts, impressively I may add, the titular \"mad\" scientist, Nigel Davenport stars as his unaware accomplice Montgomery and the intruding castaway Adrew Braddock is no less than Michael York; a personal favorite of mine. As everyone probably knows, Dr. Moreau lives isolated because his genetic research and experiments aren't exactly easy to justify. Convinced that the basic DNA of whatever living species can be altered into any other species of preference, Moreau's island runs full of guinea pigs. The wild animals he attempts to turn into people are subjected to human laws and whoever breaks the rules will be punished harshly. Braddock disapproves of his work and when he also shows a romantic interest in Moreau's gorgeous wife Maria, he becomes next in line for a whole new different and risky type of experiment. The tropical island setting is magnificent and the production definitely benefices from sublime camera-work and enchanting music. The costumes and make-up effects aren't particularly menacing (the guinea pigs actually look like ancestors of the Ewoks) but the last half hour is exhilaratingly violent and Dr. Moreau's ultimate fate is truly nightmarish, even for a cruel being like him.","user":"Coventry","rank":[20,21]}]
