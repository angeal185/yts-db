[{"title":"Beautiful!","rating":10,"date":"7 April 2019","review":"My dad was in the POW camp with Bert and married a local girl (my mum) from Liverpool!\nI knew they'd had a hard time because my dad was seen as the enemy and my mum as a traitor, but this film is so beautifully told and it brought it home to me!\nIt's both funny and deeply emotional, but most of all it's about reconciliation and acceptance!\nObviously there's a little poetic license, but that adds to the film!\nIt had me in tears, Highly recommended!","user":"herrfisch","rank":[40,45]},{"title":"Brilliant!","rating":10,"date":"22 March 2019","review":"A truly heartwarming story of reconciliation and the human condition. I watched this film in the Cinema in St. Helens. A town that is close to my heart and that features in Bert Trautmann's story before his time playing for Manchester City.<br><br>This movie is about so much more than football. I'm largely disinterested in the beautiful game but even I was bowled over by the brilliant humour and heartwarming story of redemption and reconciliation.<br><br>Watch this movie, tell your friends about it and talk about it. It deserves to be seen both on its own merit and as one of the few films to represent working class northerners in a human light, displaying their unique sense of humour and kindness as well as dealing with the emotional fallout of war in a mature way.","user":"mike_lowe_1","rank":[34,38]},{"title":"Should be better publicised","rating":9,"date":"11 April 2019","review":"One of the most enjoyable films of the year, whether or not you like football. Really good story, solidly told. Yet another film not getting the publicity or wide release it deserves.","user":"Jimthellama","rank":[13,19]}]
