[{"title":"\"Veronica Is A Good Person\"","rating":4,"date":"8 September 2018","review":"This movie should have been titled \"Veronica Is A Good Person.\" <br><br>The only reasons I'm giving this movie more than 1 star are the cast and that it kept me engaged and interested. The first half of the movie had me hopeful that Sierra and Jamey will develop a connection, Sierra will do the right thing, and all will be perfect. <br><br>In the latter half it becomes evident that Sierra is selfish, entitled, and just plain mean. She takes no responsibility for her own choices, even against the advice of her best friend. Rather, she blames everything/everyone else to justify her actions. (My gorgeous mother stuck me with this body...my friend kissed my boyfriend who actually thinks I'm her...living under my dad's shadow is making it difficult for me to find my own identity). To echo the reviews of those who were equally frustrated, it's ridiculous that Sierra came out of the mess she created unscathed, with perfect boyfriend showing up unexpectedly to take her to homecoming. <br><br>Meanwhile, Veronica, proves herself a true friend and kind, compassionate human being even after being humiliated.<br><br>While this movie brings to light the great pressure our youths face to look a certain way in order to be accepted and sends a reminder that there is more to a person than their physical appearance and Instagram followers, it sends another message of the harmful sort. It sends the message that it's okay to trick someone into falling for you. That you're entitled to someone's love despite your acts of manipulation simply because they have no business caring about your appearance anyway. That it's okay to commit heinous acts against friends because you're entitled forgiveness.<br><br>But these things are not okay.","user":"r-bea623","rank":[388,429]},{"title":"sierra burgess is an a**hole","rating":1,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"This movie has got me SHOOKETH. Yes it sends the message that it's not always about looks, and it was nice to see the popular girl team up with the outcast. HOWEVER, lord almighty!! The overall message of this movie is RIDICULOUS and WRONG.<br><br>Catfishing is not okay, what the main protagonists do is downright evil and messed up... there are little to no repercussions to their actions, and Jamey just seems to accept all of it without much thought. They never went deeper into that, we never see Jamey's reaction, how much that affects him and I don't feel like Sierra evolves as a character at all since her actions are somehow 'okay' and treated like a minor mistake. That is messed up. What the hell does this movie teach young kids? <br><br>This kind of behaviour is unacceptable. Ew.","user":"elvira-rizova","rank":[346,384]},{"title":"Sometimes good things happen to terrible people","rating":1,"date":"20 September 2018","review":"That is the real message of this movie. Absolutely terrible storyline, they want you to feel for the protagonist but in reality she's a terrible person.. seriously how is this trying to be spun in a positive light?","user":"maxbrt-155-905276","rank":[103,112]}]
