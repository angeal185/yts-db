[{"title":"A \"Classic Horror\" fan's paradise!","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2000","review":"\"The Black Sleep\" is a glorious, elegant all-star \"monster romp\" in black and white from Hollywood's \"ghoulden era.\" The film has it all: rich performances (both mimed and spoken), evocative sets, lighting and cinematography, an involving story and detailed script, mad science, swirling mists, dark London streets, gaslight, an old abbey (complete with an oaken door with a medieval viewing-window), rumblings of thunder, burning candles, horse-drawn carriages, elegant costumes and period (1872 England) detail, gigantic fireplaces with sliding panels, shadowy corridors replete with ghostly \"knight's armory\" lurking in dark corners, sinister music, hidden torchlit chambers, suggestive sound-effects, subtly chilling props and special effects (including clanking chains, coffins, syringes, a musty skull, and a pulsating brain!), a moody matte-painting of a castle atop a hill overlooking a valley of gnarled, wind-blown branches, gruesome monster make-up, and a stunning ensemble cast of  mystery and terror specialists that features Basil Rathbone, Akim Tamiroff, Lon Chaney, Jr., John Carradine, Bela Lugosi and Tor Johnson! To promote the film, make-up artist George Bau was commissioned to create life-sized wax replicas of many of the cast members, which were later displayed in New York City to coincide with the picture's June, 1956 release. For good measure, Boris Karloff, who was in town at the time, is said to have posed with these wax sculptures in publicity photos to help give the film an extra push; in the following year, Boris would work with \"The Black Sleep\"'s director, Reginald LeBorg, its production company, Bel-Air, and many of the same technical crew to make \"Voodoo Island,\" an eerie zombie tale set on a tropical isle. Herbert Rudley (who would later appear in \"The Mothers-In-Law\" TV series), Patricia Blake (aka Patricia Blair), Phyllis Stanley, Sally Yarnell, George Sawaya, Peter Gordon, Claire Carleton, John Sheffield, Clive Morgan, Louanna Gardner, and the unbilled players (who always add so much to the creating of a world in which a film is set--one of whom is Howard W. Koch, who helped produce the film!) all join together with the aforementioned players in bringing a magical level of conviction to this tale of a scientist and the strange drug he tampers with (which produces a death-like trance to all who come under its influence). Dr. Max Andler is the Beverly Hills neuro surgeon who served as technical advisor during the \"brain surgery\" sequences. A well-produced tale of terror, directed by Reginald LeBorg (who helmed such other favorite shockers as \"The Mummy's Ghost,\" \"Diary of a Madman\" and the above-mentioned \"Voodoo Island.\") Curl up on a rainy night and enjoy \"The Black Sleep\"!","user":"zerces_1999","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"Terrific Cast of Veteran Horror Actors","rating":10,"date":"2 June 2004","review":"I first saw \"The Black Sleep\" 48 years ago and was most impressed by the overall atmosphere and genuinely creepy nature of many of the scenes.<br><br>Upon more recent viewings and further reflection, I must say that this film still fascinates me. I am hard-pressed to recall another Basil Rathbone performance (other than his work as Sherlock Holmes) to equal this one. Sure, he chews the scenery unashamedly, but that is a big part of what makes this movie fun. Add in the first rate supporting cast of Lon Chaney, Jr., Akim Tamiroff, Bela Lugosi, and especially John Carradine and you have a veritable \"Who's Who\" of horror and film noir icons of the period. One must not forget the contributions of Tor Johnson and the lesser known actors filling out the cast. <br><br>The best scare occurs when we first meet Lon Chaney as \"Mungo\". The imaginative \"point-of-view\" camera work, focusing on Chaney's hands is very original and creative - especially for a low-budget production such as this one. My favorite scene, though, occurs quite late in the movie when the surgical \"recoverees\", led by the always riveting (although over-the-top) John Carradine, make their escape.<br><br>Sadly Bela Lugosi's character is mute and we are thus deprived of the exquisite pleasure of hearing his unique voice and diction. His character induces sympathy - even pity, rather than horror. In my opinion, this represents his best work from the declining days of his career. I must also single out Akim Tamiroff for the unctuous humor he provides as Rathbone's procurer of surgical subjects.<br><br>I give high marks for creative use of obviously cheap sets and evocative camera work. This is a movie which should not be missed by serious fans of films of the 50's. This is an excellent reminder of how they used to make effective horror films without soaking the screen with blood.<br><br>10 points out of 10.","user":"mackeral","rank":[37,43]},{"title":"Good Outweighs The Bad","rating":7,"date":"15 March 2008","review":"From what I've heard about this one, I expected an Ed Wood style farce. What I got was a surprisingly literate and well-acted classic horror. The flaws are definitely present, but this flick has some genuinely chilling moments and boasts 3 outstanding performances.<br><br>Dr. Cadman, the mad scientist behind this whole house of horrors, is superbly played by Basil Rathbone. This was probably the last good horror role Basil had. He portrays Cadman as a supremely self-confident and utterly controlled man who has willingly tossed aside all ethics and morality in pursuit of his goal. Rathbone's command of dialog and smooth diction brings this human monster to life. And yet, in the scenes with his paralyzed wife, we feel some of the love and devotion that underlies his horrific crimes.<br><br>Cadman's partner in crime is the sly Udo the Gypsy, wonderfully brought to life by Akim Tamiroff. What a great character actor this guy was! His every facial expression and physical movement conveys what a greasy, unprincipled character Udo is. And yet his quick wit makes him roguish and likable in a way. It would be a mistake to consider Udo just a humorous character,though. The scene where he easily disposes of a prospective subject for Dr. Cadman to save his own hide is chilling. Great bit of character acting from Tamiroff!<br><br>The hero of the piece is Dr. Ramsay, whom Cadman has saved from the gallows to aid in his illicit research. Ramsay is played by Herbert Rudley, who I have not seen in any other roles. Rudley fits the part perfectly and more than holds his own in his scenes with Rathbone. I like the way he carefully tries to weigh all sides of the argument against Dr. Cadman before finally takes action against him. Rudley's revulsion against the crimes of Cadman seems heartfelt and authentic.<br><br>Those three strong performances anchor the movie, but not all cast members are so fortunate. A sickly looking Bela Lugosi is wasted completely as the mute butler Casimir. This was Bela's last \"official\" movie role not counting the stock footage that appeared in Ed Wood's \"Plan Nine From Outer Space\", which is a shame. His acting ability and speaking voice is wasted on a part that could have been done by any bit player. Lon Chaney Jr. comes across somewhat better as the moronic Mongo because of his physical size and truly crazed look, but he still deserved better. Mongo was originally a cultured professor and associate of Dr. Cadman until Cadman botched an operation on him. It might have been better to have Mongo as a \"Jekyll-Hyde\" character that veered between the man of science and the maniacal killer...more pathos that way and a better test of Chaney's acting.<br><br>A couple of scenes here are still capable of making the viewer queasy. The open brain surgery scene on the hapless sailor had to be shocking at the time...complete with fluid leaking from the brain. And the \"tour\" of Cadman's dungeon is right out of a carnival haunted house. John Carradine is crazed and over the top are the \"crusader\" Bohemund but he's in good shape compared to his cell-mates: the shrieking, laughing female with tufts of hair sprouting all over her body; the luckless sailor whose face has melted into slag; and hulking Tor Johnson, made blind and voiceless by Cadman's experiments. This is a nutty crew of mutants indeed and when they finally appear, \"The Black Sleep\" turns from a literate thriller of medical horrors into a sleazy, spook-house romp. \"Kill, kill, kill!\" yells Carradine crazily, and kill he does, bringing a visceral end to the movie.<br><br>If you don't require \"Dr. Zhivago\" or \"Lawrence of Arabia\" in every film, \"The Black Sleep\" should keep you awake for a while!","user":"drmality-1","rank":[15,16]}]
