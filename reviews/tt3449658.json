[{"title":"Amateurish but actually endearing","rating":8,"date":"28 January 2019","review":"This teenage romantic comedy is both amateurish and endearing. There are several scenes early in the movie that are quite lame and the acting not very polished as well as the dramatics being quite tame by comparison to the more fancy and flamboyantly captivating romance comedy dramas. Nevertheless, the simplicity and sincerity of the dialogue somehow actually can reflect a more genuine heartful story that reveals more an entrancing believability. The lead actress isn't the bombshell model that one finds in almost any rom com (instead she's almost the typical average teenage female that one can find in the majority of the high school population) while the teenage starlet has this almost na√Øve, yet insatiably innocent, fantasy persona who nevertheless offers a refreshing honesty and deeper helpful truths about life even though he is supposedly a product of the movie industry.","user":"tabuno","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Really Cute!","rating":9,"date":"6 February 2020","review":"I found this movie to be very adorable! Callum Worthy always makes me laugh but he also had a very sensitive side too. He brought the movie to life along with Lexi. I love the message in the movie! I also love how positive and lively the movie is. Definitely worth the watch.","user":"brookenichole-98054","rank":[0,0]}]
