[{"title":"A movie that has it all","rating":1,"date":"1 September 2000","review":"A film about boxing, diamonds, gangsters pretending to be Jews, a fat getaway driver, a rather vicious dog and man eating pigs. Guy Richie has followed the success of Lock, Stock with an equally stunning and ambitious return just as Tarantino did with Pulp Fiction. The characters are so colourful they jump right off the screen, the dialogue so snappy you want to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. Vinnie Jones reveals he can act and Brad Pitt shows that he is far more than a pretty face and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as Irish Mickey. See this movie!!!!","user":"dazza11","rank":[257,296]},{"title":"A Comedy Masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"3 September 2000","review":"\"Snatch\" is fantastic; and not least because it demonstrates emphatically that the British movie industry is capable of rivaling even the best of what Hollywood can offer.<br><br>\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" was one of the funniest movies released in recent years, and \"Snatch\" takes everything that \"Lock, Stock...\" did so well and does it even better.<br><br>Back are the cleverly intertwined plotlines, the hilarious one-liners, and the simultaneously intimidating and comedic London villains. So is the skillful editing, and often original cinematographic style. This time however, it all looks somewhat slicker and better funded, and alongside the British regulars are the odd American celebrity (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro).<br><br>Everyone in the film puts in an excellent performance, but Pitt stands out as a charismatic and near-incomprehensible Gypsy boxer.<br><br>Like Ritchie's earlier film, this one takes a little while to find its feet, but once it does the pace doesn't slacken until the finale. One scene featuring three guys and a squeaking dog in a stolen car stands out particularly, and left the audience at my local cinema almost weeping as punchline after punchline was uttered.<br><br>When it comes to comedies, I cannot recommend this one highly enough. If you're after a good laugh, you won't find much to better \"Snatch\".","user":"SpudMons","rank":[385,452]},{"title":"Do You Know What Nemesis Means?","rating":10,"date":"26 August 2004","review":"I was never really too keen on \"Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels\".  All my friends constantly quoted it, raved and ranted, and then when \"Snatch\" came out, everyone made an even bigger deal of that.  I watched Lock Stock, and though I did like it, it didn't really tickle my fancy.  But Snatch, that's a completely different story all together.<br><br>When I saw Snatch at the cinemas, I was shocked to see a couple leave only fifteen minutes into the film.  As they left, you could hear their intellectually deficient comments; \"this movie is so boring\".  I couldn't believe it!  I'd recommend this movie to ANYONE, The Pope even!<br><br>There are hundreds of thousands of reasons for anyone to see this movie; each word of the script being a reason.<br><br>Snatch is possibly one of THE best written movies I've seen. It's smart, witty, funny and has just the right touches of dark humour.  With characters like Turkish, Mickey, Tommy, Brick Top, Bullet Tooth Tony and Cousin Avi; their witty repartee will have your personal quotes list full for months after watching it.  The camera work and editing complement each other to keep the film's pace on its toes, much like the boxers at the center of the character's stories.<br><br>Jason Statham has some of THE best lines in the movie, constantly slamming anything even slightly intelligent his partner Tommy has to say.  Brad Pitt turns out an excellent performance as the Irish-Gypsy-Pykie Mickey; his accent is hilarious.  <br><br>Even though the story line is only a simple one (following a massive Diamond through England's criminal underworld), it is the connections each character has to the diamond and each other that really makes this film stand out from all the usual jewel-heist films.<br><br>Another 10 / 10 from me on this one, it's just a pity the follow up to Snatch was a \"collaborative effort\" from Mr. Richie and his um.......wife.","user":"marty_666","rank":[332,399]}]
