Seriously, a decent movie with a decent average plot was completely ruined because of the sound mixing! Mr. Bagdasarian, as a fellow Armenian compatriate I suggest you go to Mr. Atom Egoyan and learn a thing or two about movie making. It's not all just lights, camera and action, and cut all the time!!!!","user":"haroot_azarian","rank":[17,26]},{"title":"No comment is the best comment","rating":1,"date":"5 March 2020","review":"How don't you want to learn how to make a movie. It does not need to talk about the main elements of this film because in any points of view it was ruined.","user":"khodamoradia","rank":[15,28]}]
