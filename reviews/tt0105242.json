[{"title":"A hidden gem.","rating":11,"date":"11 April 2001","review":"Here's something you do not see everyday, a horror movie that actually remains faithful to book it was adapted from. Often film makers who alter the original product in the name of creativity needlessly dilute or destroy the story in the process. In 'The Resurrected' director Dan O'bannon wisely refrains from such tinkering. He takes H.P. Lovecraft's creepy classic, 'The strange case of Charles Dexter Ward', and places it amid late 20th century trappings. The result is a near perfect horror movie.<br><br>The film starts off like a cheap detective novel. A hard boiled trench coat clad private investagator sits in his office waiting for his next case to come along. Enter a beautiful blonde who hires him to discover why her scientist husband is spending all of his time in his secluded lab.<br><br>\nAt first the P.I. believes the scientist, one Charles Dexter ward is having an affair. He soon finds Ward is involved not with a lover but a research partner. A mysterious fellow known only as Doctor Ash. The two are apparently engaged in highly secertive experiments involving tons of fresh meat.<br><br>Shortly after this revealation, strange things begin happen in and around the Ward estate. Doctor Ash vanishes. Wards begins to conversing in antiquated speech. Ward's neighbors become the victims of grisley killings.<br><br>\nAs the case unfolds the detective follows these and other clues down a path that leads further and further into the preternatural.<br><br>\nThis film is something rare. A horror movie that is actually scary. It is probably the best ever adaptation of a Lovecraft story. The reason for this is simple. Unlike most filmakers director O'bannon had the common sense to let Lovecraft's masterful writing speak for itself.","user":"Bynovekka1","rank":[45,58]},{"title":"Best adaptation of the Case of Charles Dexter Ward","rating":13,"date":"13 May 2004","review":"This movie is a must see, IF you've read the story and like it, and IF you've seen the other adaptation, \"The Haunted Palace\" with Vincent Price. Sure, this story is a bit different than the book. It's set in the modern day, and Charles Ward is a well-paid chemist at Belmar Cosmetics, not a young antiquarian d√©butante. And instead of Doctor Willet being the principle investigator, John Marsh P.I. is (nice nod to the Innsmouth stories with that last name).<br><br>Aside from those differences necessary to bring this into the modern day, and aside from a very slight difference in how Joseph Curwen is ultimately dealt with, this follows the story in the book. It's all there: the portrait, the neighbor Fenner, the house in Pawtucket, and of course the underground labs of J.C. Curwen. There are story sequences set in Colonial times to build the story as well, and they are nicely done. But the real crowning glory of this movie is the sets they built for Curwens underground lab. They are MARVELOUS. Everything is there: the sanity blasting carvings, the \"mistakes and screw-ups\" raised from Imperfect salts, and the jars of Materia.<br><br>I highly recommend this movie. I'm still treasuring my copy on Laser Disk and hoping that it someday comes out on DVD. Production is top notch, as is the music and of course the story.","user":"otto4","rank":[38,51]},{"title":"You can almost smell the putrid flesh that fills this movie","rating":10,"date":"9 March 1999","review":"Here it is people! This is the best Lovecraft story adaptation for the big screen. It's also probably one of the best horror movies ever made, which makes it a must-see title for not only the genre fans, but to all of those who love this art. The story of a man who dared to fool around with death, finding a \"cure\" to it is certainly a tragic one. As in \"Re-Animator\", there are plenty of scary moments as well as extremely gory ones. It's always nice to watch movies that put the viewer \"inside the action\" to the point that at times, the smell of the action invades our homes. \"The Resurrected\" is certainly one of those movies!","user":"Freakest","rank":[32,47]}]
