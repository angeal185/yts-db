You gotta have a penchant for goofy stuff though.  This group is pretty enjoyable together, and the bits with Chan battling his way through the Haunted House is well worth it.  Sort of a \"minor\" Jackie fil,m, it's worth a watch.","user":"rutt13-1","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Great Comedy Actioner!!!","rating":26,"date":"26 February 2004","review":"This movie was very funny! Sammo Hung has a true sense of humor. There was more comedy than action present, but it works out just fine. Jackie isn't the star of the movie. I think it works out better that way. The movie wasn't meant to be all action, but comedy mostly. The cameos were excellent!! Dick Wei's usual villainous role doesn't surprise me, but he shows off his moves and throws down in this movie!! Jackie, Yuen, and Sammo's chemistry on screen is incredible. I wonder when they trained at the Peking Opera School, did they ever think that they would use their skills on screen? Anyway, Eric Tsang is a very funny, versatile actor. His childish antics in this movie are hilarious. If you want to watch hilarious HK comedy, go meet the Lucky Stars!!  They're all that and a bag of Kung Fu.","user":"jrat6200","rank":[5,6]}]
