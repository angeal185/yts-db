[{"title":"Just as good as the book","rating":8,"date":"14 January 2013","review":"When I saw that Disney made this movie I was expecting it to be a toned down adaptation of S.E. Hinton's novel. Boy, I was wrong. This was one of Disney's more mature movies and had all the important stuff from the book. Even the drug deal that went wrong. The characters are just as likable as they were in the book which is good. It's too bad that this movie is forgotten. There was one review that called the movie version of That was Then... This is Now a gem and I would've agreed with that statement if it didn't have that crappy ending. This is the real gem out of all S.E. Hinton adaptations. If you ever find this movie somewhere, I recommend checking it out.","user":"TopperHarley29","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Unpretentious coming of age story","rating":7,"date":"7 April 2012","review":"The story is of two teenage brothers living together on a small property in Bixby, Oklahoma (a small town about twenty miles south of Tulsa). Tex (Matt Dillon) is the younger and Mason (Jim Metzler) is the older. Their mother is dead and their father rarely shows up. The brothers are doing everything they can to avoid the clutches of social services. <br><br>The dynamic of their relationship is one of frustration, love, and anger. Their lives are not easy and money is running out. To buy food and get the lights back on Mason is forced to sell Tex's horse and of course that infuriates Tex and he takes off in a rage. The poignant scene that has Mason drive his pickup along the road to coax Tex back is an early scene that establishes the tone of the relationship between the siblings.<br><br>It is not clear where this story will go. There are some moments along the way where it looks like Tex is going to take a very wrong turn when in the company of a drug dealing friend. <br><br>The young Dillon and Metzler carry the movie by their natural performances; the kids talk and act like most kids of their age did in that place and time (early 1980s). The fact that the movie was filmed on location in Bixby and Tulsa adds to the feeling of authenticity.<br><br>This movie does not go beyond the scope of being a simply-told, affecting tale and, within that scope, it delivers admirably. Some sentimentality creeps in toward the end, but for what it is I found this modest movie satisfying.","user":"bandw","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Its pretty much just like the book","rating":10,"date":"6 July 2000","review":"Disney Pictures did a pretty good job on this movie. Matt Dillon played a really good Tex McCormick and the other actors and actresses were really good too. The movie was almost like the book except for little differences. The only thing i did not like were the cast members. Now! wait don't get me wrong they all did a wonderful job, but the only one that seemed to fit the description of the character as in the book was Matt Dillon. That dosen't really matter, its the movie not the book. So it should be different,and its a good movie. Just that you can't really rent it anywhere so you will probaly have to buy it. I had to.","user":"blu_cat_eyes","rank":[4,6]}]
