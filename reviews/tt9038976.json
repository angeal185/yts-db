[{"title":"A Feature Length Home Movie","rating":1,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"Expository and unnecessary dialogue litter this fan film-ish home movie. Props, set locations, acting and camera work leave a lot to be desired. On the other hand, the inane dialogue is clearly recorded. Many of the props are shared between characters. I suppose there was a script, but it doesn't look like it contained a comprehensible plot. I have my doubts the cast and crew understand what this movie is about. Example: a character mentions a need to avoid something environmental which will cause great harm, then proceed to briefly avoid the threat, then carry on like the threat no longer exists, while the threat does clearly still exist. Fight scenes make no sense. Enemies appear out of no where, then fail to make use of their tactical advantage. This movie is so bad the only value in watching it is to document all of the short comings.","user":"allen-roulston","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Tisk Tisk Tisk","rating":1,"date":"6 November 2018","review":"Whoever made this movie should be ashamed of themselves worse thing ever and I've seen some bad movies... The dollar store should put pics of these people and stop them from get their props....","user":"mbruschett","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Oh my God!","rating":1,"date":"8 February 2019","review":"I managed to watch 6 minutes, that's it!\nI really don't know how anyone can use money to make movies like this.\nYou may say how I could revive a movie in such a short time. Well, try yourself.","user":"thomahal","rank":[2,3]}]
