[{"title":"Not a Humbug.","rating":8,"date":"24 December 2018","review":"Charles Dickens 'A Christmas Carol' is a classic. It's been told in many different ways and formats. From book, radio, the stage, the big screen and beyond. From Muppets to CGI, through comedy and through tragedy, there's even musicals. This version doesn't fail to impress.<br><br>A Scottish retelling has old Scrooge the boss of a distillery in modern days. With Bob Cratchit his faithful employee, and her ill husband Tim.<br><br>Shot on a budget but with good camera work and pretty decent acting all around. The colours are dark and gritty but it makes sense when Ebeneezer comes to his senses and his world lights up. Stuart Brennan emotes pretty well as Ebeneezer and he had me cheering for him in the end. Keeps to the Dickens spirit and is well worthy of a watch at Christmas..... Oh; and it stars the gorgeous Bonnie Wright too. Extra half star for that.","user":"TheWalkingDood","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"A surprise!","rating":9,"date":"25 December 2018","review":"Well this was a Christmas Eve surprise. We just put this on for something in the background as it was a cheap rental for a new release, but ended up glued to it. Fast paced throughout. Well acted by most characters and very well directed. Low budget but there are some stunning shots of castles and landscapes. Well worth a watch this Christmas especially for the bakery scene. Up go the thumbs.","user":"sarahstevenson-22001","rank":[6,11]},{"title":"Best modern-day version","rating":9,"date":"25 December 2018","review":"For years I've searched for satisfactory modern-day versions of this movie.<br><br>I was fearful that maybe this movie wouldn't make the jump to modern day as such things like debtor's prison are a thing of the past.<br><br>But, glad to say this movie was really, really enjoyable as a modern-day version of A Christmas Carol.","user":"info-412-760174","rank":[5,9]}]
