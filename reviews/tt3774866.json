[{"title":"Slow Methodical","rating":1,"date":"28 June 2018","review":"There is no story development. It's about neurotic narcisistic people in a remote place on the planet earth. That alone would drive anyone crazy. This was a terrible contribution to the movie industry. Categorized as a Mystery, but, there is absolutely no Mystery at all. The story was cliche and predictable.\nActing was incredibly terrible.","user":"randbark-2","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"An okay start in a beautiful location... but boring and trivial film....","rating":3,"date":"23 August 2017","review":"Beautiful locations, so-so (if not dull) cinematography, and useless scenes riddled with weak and expositional dialogue. For an independent film, it looks serviceable, but what is technically satisfactory is doubled in it's problems considering character, plot, and performance. The writing and execution needs work - and though one can see the creators' vision and the concept itself has potential, it ended up resulting in an amateur product. It focuses too much on trivial threads, scenes are repetitive and drag. As a personal project, it's good - but as an actual film, it's a feather - it holds no weight to it. Nothing's really all too incredible except the location of Iceland itself, and let's be real - it's not difficult to make Iceland pretty on screen. It's one of the most moody, scenic, and beautiful places on earth - it's just that the story didn't do anything to service that. Heavy handed and boring, even pretentious, this film brings no revelations. Too much telling and not enough showing to bring about the emotional context it so desires to play on. Tries to be earnest without much substance to its subject, as well as predictable.<br><br>Though this film wasn't that much of an experience to get through, I wouldn't object to seeing any future pieces of the director/studio's in hope that their next project will be much more competent. All that I've taken from this film is that I need to visit Iceland, but I've already known that for a very long time.","user":"redshoesfall","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Watching a tramp flirting is just boring.","rating":4,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"Well this is one of those movies you wonder why they make them. It should just had been a short movie instead as you could fit that whole story in about half an hour. Because there is not much going on in Autumn Lights. It's not a mystery and I wonder why it's categorized as such. A woman died in the beginning and that's about it for the mystery. Don't expect any answers or why they even showed that part of the movie as it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual story. The actual story is about an unfaithful wife, a tramp let's just call her like that, about her depressive state of mind, and about other men trying to have sexual intercourse with her, and this while her husband is the most naive guy ever. It's boring to watch, so don't believe any of those perfect ratings on here. The only good thing about this movie is the view of the lake but then again National Geography has way better documentaries about lakes.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[7,9]}]
