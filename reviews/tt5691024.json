[{"title":"Really cute family film that was way better than expected","rating":10,"date":"21 May 2018","review":"Reading the critics' reviews we weren't sure what to expect but we all laughed a lot and had a great time. Kids loved it and were quoting it all the way home. I highly recommend this old fashioned fun kids flick. You won't be disappointed!","user":"getarazor","rank":[122,200]},{"title":"Deserves a second chance!!","rating":10,"date":"2 June 2018","review":"I really liked this movie. As a former Rottweiler owner, it was great to see one in a lead role. I'm not going to go in depth about it but I will ask that the irate parents who opposed the scene that was taken out please give this movie a higher rating. While I agree the scene did not belong in the movie, I feel the movie deserves a second chance now that it was edited. C'mon, you got why you wanted so please rate the movie higher.","user":"bjordan396","rank":[79,126]},{"title":"I was actually entertained!","rating":10,"date":"18 May 2018","review":"I usually hate kid movies. Almost all of them, especially animated ones. I didn't have any expectations going into this, but the jokes were actually pretty funny and it was a cute storyline. People are always going to hate on movies like this but it's not made for adults. It's a kids movie, and a pretty good one at that. If you're looking for a cute funny movie with really adorable animals, go see it! You might be surprised.","user":"justjocie","rank":[141,239]}]
