[{"title":"Indie Film-making!","rating":10,"date":"13 December 2018","review":"We need more film-makers like this! There are too many Box Office movies being made by the same group of director's, all hand picked by the studio heads. Films like these show promise and hard work. New fresh ideas and new fresh outlooks.<br><br>The soldiers in this movie really make you care about them at the end. This film seems to be about the soldiers and how a small squad interacts. Cool uniforms, something unique.<br><br>We never see fantasy in war movies but here, if you open your mind to the story, it is a really cool journey that breaks an hour of storytelling. Hope we have new movie makers like this in the industry to spice it up a bit!","user":"malonericcardo","rank":[22,29]},{"title":"Odd, interesting tale of madness.","rating":10,"date":"2 January 2019","review":"An extra point for style. Intriguing style, without a budget, without much experience; strong re-make of this hit/classic. The story is interesting but makes no more sense than the madness of war, which is what is depicted.<br><br>Could be a bit shocking, dealing as it does with moral issues that are so basic many people would rather not admit that they exist. Attempting to depict such weirdness is part of the movie makers genius.<br><br>Really interesting and sometimes downright good use of camera and sound. Always do your best, dear reader, for even your first movie could be your last.<br><br>Dare I say better than the original? (Fear and Desire)","user":"joshuacranereview","rank":[20,27]},{"title":"Movie by Veterans","rating":10,"date":"20 December 2018","review":"You'll see red target-like uniforms with helmets sliding off their heads, hanging by their straps. Marching through the Forrest not knowing what to do but keep going almost as if the movie makers were Military Vets or something...","user":"brianlukowski","rank":[20,27]}]
