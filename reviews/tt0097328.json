[{"title":"What's the problem?","rating":8,"date":"12 November 2001","review":"I can't believe the reviews for this!  <br><br>If anything is open for critcism here, its the casting of Connery, Hoffman and Broderick as grandfather, father and son, but no one seems to mind that. Hoffman's wife is a Jewish woman, played by Rosana DeSoto, who was Richie Valen's mom in \"La Bamba\" and Edward James Olmos' wife in \"Stand And Deliver\".  All the casting choices are questionable but I think someone along the way decided to be sarcastic about it, which of course makes the movie that much better. <br><br>Broderick is not a criminal but his elders are (or were) and he brings them all together to do a robbery.  It makes perfect sense, since he's in that family and has their blood.  Without even trying hard, he's a product of his environ, just like we all are.  Matthew was a whiz-kid who got bored with that and doesn't seem to have any guilt about this caper.  His girlfriend (Victoria Jackson) has extremely questionable morals and practically brags about that fact at dinner one afternoon.  But is also in keeping with Broderick's character.  He's like a wanna-be lowlife. <br><br>Hoffman is working in the meat-packing district in the West Village of Manhattan and is trying very hard to do the right thing after having served time and having had an on-again, off-again relationship with both his father and son.  He demands honesty and even fires a guy (Luiz Guzman) who is caught stealing from him.  The movie is also very realistic from his point-of-view since he gets involved mostly to keep an eye on the other two. Father and son do not get along and always seem to be arguing about one thing or another.  <br><br>Connery is a life-long trouble maker who was never much of a father but loves his grandson very much and has some pride about their all working together.  He argues with his son..father and son do not get along, again.<br><br>\nSome of the dialogue is very funny and there are always great character actors in Sidney Lumet's movies; this one is no exception.  In very small parts are Marilyn Cooper, Deborah Rush and Marilyn Sokol.  This is in addition to a great trio in the leads, all of whom register great work in this little-seen flick. <br><br>Movie has a real NYC feel to it.  I'd recommend it to anyone.","user":"Boyo-2","rank":[37,46]},{"title":"Nasty, but brilliant","rating":9,"date":"14 July 2010","review":"When I see this film reviewed, over and over, as a comedy, I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. This is one of the most brutally cynical, agonizingly tragic films I've ever seen - the story of a family caught up in the romance of crime, trying to help at least the youngest generation escape its inevitable fate.<br><br>Perhaps it helps to know Sidney Lumet's other work, especially his previous bitterly brilliant collaborations with Sean Connery: The Hill, and The Offense. Family Business is a similarly scathing attack on preconceptions. Lumet takes what looks like a tame little 'heist comedy' scenario and shows just how poisonously evil it really is. He gives us the charming scoundrel (Connery), and shows how destructive his devil-may-care attitude can be.<br><br>One might as well criticize Othello or Macbeth for having no laughs. This film is, in fact, Shakespearian in its tragic dimensions. Connery starts out with the classic Tragic Flaw, and must pay for it in the end. (There is a heroic dimension in his ultimate realization, at least.)<br><br>I can easily understand that many people won't enjoy this film. It's a nasty, venomous, painful piece of work. But it's also quite brilliant. If you want easy answers, by all means, rent Ocean's Eleven. But if you're up for a challenge, don't overlook Family Business.","user":"fung0","rank":[23,29]},{"title":"Expectations: Great. Reality: A little bit disappointing","rating":6,"date":"31 December 2011","review":"Looking back now, we can say that this is the kind of films Hollywood should be doing now. Put together three big stars from different generations and make a good film about a good subject; in the case of \"Family Business\" about a family united in criminal activities. A material like this could rescue the career of many veterans actors.<br><br>In 1989, having Sean Connery (after Oscar for \"The Untouchables\"), Dustin Hoffman (right away for his Oscar in \"Rain Man\") and Matthew Broderick (still on the wave from hits like \"Biloxi Blues\" and \"Ferris Bueller Day Off\") as the cast from this film directed by Sidney Lumet was solid gold, a real bait to attract audiences, and even know when you hear that those talents were together in a picture you rush away to see it. Those are the expectations but expectations always differ from reality. Given a better script these could be a better picture than it is, more memorable.<br><br>\"Family Business\" tells the story of three generations of a problematic Jewish family involved with robberies. It starts when the bright college student Broderick (Hoffman's son and Connery's grandson here) decides to get involved in a sure thing business related to robbing a laboratory and he calls for his family to help with. But all of this triggers a crisis among father and son and grandfather, when Hoffman's characters wants at all costs protect his son for doing this, he doesn't want his son to get caught and arrested while Connery thinks they must do it, because nothing can go wrong. From here, the movie is more about family issues than dangerous and illegal activities. <br><br>It lacks substance to this being a great film, it lacks something to make us involved with their problems. The main problem was the that there were times when the film required of its viewers a certain seriousness but when we knew this was also a comedy. It gets stranded in never being really funny and never being awfully dramatic as some situations tend do be. The good news about this project is that Sean Connery has an incredible timing for comedy, his punchlines were amazingly funny, not to mention that his character is very problematic yet very amusing. His best scenes are when he defends himself on court for beating a policeman and when he beats another prisoner during their transfer, to what the guard asks what happened and the other prisoners reply \"He felt!\" <br><br>A path should be decided by the writers in what type of film they were looking for, a goofy comedy or a powerful drama about family relations, and that was a deficiency that almost ruined the film for me. Regarding the most awaited moment of this, the robbery was pretty good, funny and tense at the same time but the whole situation involving Broderick's arrest was poorly made, unconvincing that he couldn't run away and cross the street to his family car or run to any other direction when it was clearly enough that the police wasn't so close to him, that scene is bizarre. One final complaint: the soundtrack was totally wrong for this film, hauntingly dramatic.<br><br>What makes me like of this film, except the reunion of stars involved even though they're not at their best and they are somewhat mediocre, is its way of showing us the importance of family and caring about them whether through good times or bad times. When it comes down to present how Hoffman suffers for his son, wants the best for him, is when the movie really hits the target, family is family and business are business and sometimes they should not be mixed, otherwise is problems to both sides. And that's the ruin for everyone involved.<br><br>A good film from the 1980's, deeply flawed but completely watchable. I'm positive that Lumet has better than this. 6/10","user":"Rodrigo_Amaro","rank":[8,9]}]
