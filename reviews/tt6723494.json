[{"title":"Playing with Dolls Havoc: A remarkable improvement","rating":7,"date":"6 December 2017","review":"Playing With Dolls (2015) and Playing With Dolls: Bloodlust (2016) were really poor slashers with an interesting premise and amazing looking killer. The latter didn't even have an ending, it just rolled the credits mid fight scene.<br><br>Understandably I expected more of the same with this third (And likely final) offering.<br><br>Our killer Havoc returns, breaks free from the \"Master\" and sets about picking up where he left off going after a bunch of innocents in a secluded cabin.<br><br>I get the impression that the creators had a bigger budget to play with, either that or they'd gone to film school and mastered the art.<br><br>Havoc is a surprisingly good slasher flick and one I'd actually recommend to fans of the genre. I would perhaps suggest they skip straight to it and dismiss the first two.<br><br>Richard Tyson does not return which I found strange, maybe the budget was higher because they didn't need to pay for his star power? Either way I was impressed. Great kills, looks solid and the execution is impressive. I'd like to see the franchise continue if they maintain this quality.<br><br>The Good: <br><br>Killer still looks awesome <br><br>Story is vastly improved <br><br>Kills are great, much better than before <br><br>Nicole Stark is a decent lead <br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Quite misandric <br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie: <br><br>A chainsaw to the balls looks fairly uncomfortable","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[17,27]},{"title":"Ignore all these fake reviews, this is a very very bad movie","rating":1,"date":"10 October 2018","review":"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen, I just laughed at the ridiculous acting, the music done on a cheap Casio keyboard, the blood effects made me laugh the most. The best bit of this movie is the blonde bimbo with the fake assets at the beginning when she takes her t shirt off exposing them and she must have been very cold. The rest of the movie is just plain awful. Please please please, save your time and don't watch it, there is nothing remotely horror based in this movie, not even a single jump scare, nothing will scare you in fact you'll probably just laugh like I did, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, IT'S A JOKE.","user":"milesd-90529","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"I am only going to say this once","rating":6,"date":"7 August 2017","review":"This is a continuation of the series where crazed killer Havoc is filmed by a rich man as he dismembers people, especially young women. In this episode Havoc escapes the cave set up a game killing (I was hoping the film would take place here) and wanders into the snowy hills of California (?) a familiar outdoor scene for Rene Perez film aficionados. Here he finds the proverbial cabin in the woods with drama inside.<br><br>On the plus side the gore scenes, including spine removal were done great. He didn't turn the camera away as in low budget films. I liked the drums in the sound track on the house hunt scene, but not too keen on the sound track during the gore scenes. I was hoping for something more classical as in 'Wrong Turn 4\" which BTW was snowy also. Another plus are the pretty women who are not camera shy, but on the negative side, they were not convincing. The dialogue was seriously bad. The scene between Tim (Kyle Clarke) and Sara (Nicole Stark) was the low point of the film. It was a horror show as far as dialogue and acting. I am not sure who names a character with a wife and mistress after Tim Curry who is believed to be gay. Is this like the Neil Patrick Harris thing as in \"Harold and Kumar...\"? If so it was genius but only if Rene continues on with it. And the ending was...seriously? Guide: Don't recall any swearing. No sex.
