The theme is not interesting and has been overdone. The actors are OK, but you need leading men who are handsome in any movie, gay or straight, and the claustrophobic confines of the motel where most of the \"action\" takes places feels cloistered and smarmy.<br><br>It doesn't come together anywhere. Why greenlight a project you know is not going to work?","user":"tr-83495","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Chris Modrzynski","rating":2,"date":"23 March 2019","review":"Chris Modrzynski has to be the most irritating actor in the world. I hope I never see another movie he is in. End of story!","user":"rshawnhoover-59446","rank":[2,4]}]
