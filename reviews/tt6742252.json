[{"title":"How come Danish films are often just so good?","rating":9,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"In the vein of Locke, this super low-budget but effective thriller had me on the edge of my seat. It had the appropriate twists and turns to keep the audience guessing. It played with my emotions and had me in tears. How come Danish films are often just so good?<br><br>Unfolding in real time, this immediately involving story bends and turns in surprising, sometimes horrifying ways. Enriched by Oskar Skriver's marvelous sound editing, which takes us from a speeding van to a bloodcurdling crime scene with equal authenticity, the movie smoothly blends police procedural with character study. What's happening on the end of Asger's phone line is gripping enough, but what's happening inside his head - illuminated by Jasper Spanning's almost abusive close-ups - is every bit as fascinating.","user":"asifahsankhan","rank":[130,146]},{"title":"Forgot to drink my beer","rating":10,"date":"11 September 2018","review":"I watched this in theatre, and when it finished I found out that I didn't finish my overpriced beer. Haven't been this engaged in a movie in a while\n10/10!","user":"martijn-van-welie2","rank":[261,303]},{"title":"Mr Pig's Wild Ride","rating":10,"date":"24 April 2018","review":"This tense, tight movie takes place entirely at a 911 emergency call center, and almost all of the time, we see only the police officer talking on the phone. (Occasionally he interacts briefly with colleagues at the call center.) Maintaining the tension in such a limited setting is an impressive feat for both director and star. In that sense, it reminds me of Tom Hardy's movie 'Locke', but here the stakes are a lot higher.<br><br>As the main story unfolds, we get to know the people on the other end of the line and care about them. Given that we never see them, that is impressive, too. And we learn a lot about the our main character -- almost as much as he learns about himself.<br><br>I hope this movie gets a proper release here in the US. It deserves it.","user":"reidandgenene","rank":[176,210]}]
