[{"title":"Cool Movie...for what it is","rating":4,"date":"28 December 2019","review":"I liked this one. It was about three buddies discovering Europe. Meeting hot chicks on the way. Some of these women were smoking hot. It told a good story. The guys end up rich and happy at the end.<br><br>I liked it! Well worth the time<br><br>4 stars","user":"michaeltrivedi","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"So very unoriginal","rating":4,"date":"7 November 2019","review":"Acting isn't bad, but I didn't laugh even one single time. The story is completely unoriginal and just seems to steal little parts from every other good comedy written over the past 15-20 years (Road Trip, Euro Trip, Hot Tub Time Machine 2 with a touch of Willy Wonka thrown in there comes to mind). I watched the whole thing just to see what would happen but it really had no redeeming qualities outside of absolutely beautiful female cast members that mostly couldn't act or were given horrible direction (not all of them). Main characters acted okay though, so there's that. Gave it 4 stars but it's truly 3 1/2. I'm surprised this was funded.","user":"cmmedland","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"PATHETIC","rating":1,"date":"8 November 2019","review":"What a stupid waste of time movie.\nI seen stupid movies but this one was stupid...\nDon't waste your time watching it.","user":"nickvdp1","rank":[0,0]}]
