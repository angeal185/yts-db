[{"title":"One of the funniest, yet most under-rated comedies ever made","rating":10,"date":"10 August 2004","review":"This movie is funny, not ha ha funny, but stop breathing turn blue fall on the floor pass out funny. <br><br>Whether you find it funny at all will depend on one thing,  do you think that a Marx Brothers style movie could be made now? If you don't think so or hate the Marxes then don't bother seeing it, you'll be wasting your time. However, if you like comedy that's both clever and stupid in the classic Marx sort of way, see this film. <br><br>The plot has Groucho, er...John Turturro playing a shyster lawyer who is trying to bilk a rich widow of her money by fronting for a ballet. Add to the madness Mel Smith in the  Chico role and the incredibly under rated Bob Nelson in a role Harpo would have played if he talked. Its all madness, mis-representation and misdirection that ends up on stage in a ballet only an insane person could have come up with (its at this point breathing becomes optional).<br><br>See this movie.<br><br>Its simply one of the greatest screen comedies, even though almost no one has seen it.<br><br>10 out of 10.","user":"dbborroughs","rank":[37,40]},{"title":"Miss! These seats are terrible, they're facing the stage...","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2004","review":"This movie makes you cry you're laughing so hard.  I've seen it countless times, and it just gets better and better each time I see it.  The writing is brilliant and the acting is just as good if not better.  John Turtturo was born to play this part, just like all his other roles, but excellent in this one in particular.  A take off on the Marx brothers' Animal Crackers (1930), it captures a more modern feel, only being twelve years old.<br><br>So many great moments and lines it's hard to pick a favorite scene or dialogue.  I think that my favorite part of the movie if forced to choose would have to be one of the last scenes, when they are at the ballet and the two guys come out on stage and start hunting swans and ducks with rifles and blood hounds!  Every time I see that I think I'm going to faint I'm laughing so hard!  One of the best all time movies ever made, and should have one an Academy Award for best comedy of it's time. A classic that will most assuredly go down in history! <br><br>I give this movie a 10 out of 10.<br><br>End of review.","user":"Pookyiscute","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"The funniest one-liners since Groucho.","rating":23,"date":"23 November 1998","review":"A lot of critics moaned when this movie came out that its characters were pale imitations of the Marx Brothers.  Fine, that might be true.  But this movie is still hilarious.  On the surface, it appears to be a very dumb comedy, but if you listen to John Turturro's constant string of dialogue, you'll realize that his insults are the most sharp-edged one-liners since Groucho died.  Obviously it's not as good as any Marx Brothers comedies, but it's not bad either.","user":"Tug-3","rank":[24,27]}]
