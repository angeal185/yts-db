Director and script writer had no idea what they wanted to do! they make a worst byomkesh ever. just wasted time. no offence.

I'm usually not of the kinds who writes off efforts of filmmakers and actors. However, in case you are making something on a legendary personality like Byomkesh Bakshi, you've got to be cautious. Not only does the film fails to be cautious it fares miserably.<br><br>Too many loose ends, bad script, a seemingly lull performance by Abir in the younger lookalike grandson of an old Abir-ed Byomkesh are few reasons the story fails to impress completely.<br><br>Going by the director's effort the film looked more like an effort to be the launchpad for Abir playing Satyaki Bakshi in a series of upcoming stories. However, the film in that effort, misses the plot and falls flat on its face.<br><br>A 2 star from me for the wonderful prosthetic makeup that's done on Abir and for weaving a few wonderful cinematic moments like:<br><br>1) The grandad, the son and the grandson smoking cigarettes at the same time in different contexts of life\n2) The dialogues between Byomkesh, Ajit and Satyavati\n3) The last scene that depicts how even a star faces solitude in the absence of near and dear ones.","user":"dipanjandutta-33715","rank":[3,4]}]
