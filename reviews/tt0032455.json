[{"title":"Fantastic","rating":10,"date":"23 July 1999","review":"There cannot be one verdict on \"Fantasia\".  There must be eight: one for each of the seven segments, and an eighth for the film as a whole - for, varied though the seven segments are, they undeniably belong together. And, alas, space does not permit me to lay out all eight verdicts.  I shall have to confine myself to details representative of the whole.  At any rate, I shall try.<br><br>We learn the modus operandi of \"Fantasia\", the linking theme, in the second segment - an abridged version of Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker\" suite. (Missing are the overture and the march.)  Tchaikovsky's ballet involves anthropomorphising inanimate things, plus the odd tiny animal.  So does Disney's \"Nutcracker\".  But Disney has thrown out the particular details. The Chinese Dance is danced by mushrooms (who look, but are not, Chinese); the Arabian Dance by \"Arabian\" goldfish; the Russian dance by \"Russian\" thistles and orchids.  Sometimes it goes further: \"Waltz of the Flowers\" shows two entire changes of seasons, with leaves, fairies, seed pods, seeds, snowflakes - everything but flowers.  But in ignoring the letter of the instructions Disney is perfectly true to the spirit.  Indeed he is more true to the spirit than the original ballet - for, let's face it: stage ballet is a degenerate and over-formalised art, which makes some of the world's most exciting music dull as wallpaper.  Disney's amazing images express Tchaikovsky's sense of motion more than earthbound dancers ever could. This, one feels, is the kind of thing ballet music was TRULY designed for. The same goes to a lesser extent for the other two pieces of ballet music on the program.<br><br>This basic device - ignoring explicit instructions, but remaining true to the spirit - is carried through into every segment.  (Some segments are better than others, but none can be called a failure.)  Dukas's \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" has been turned into a Mickey Mouse cartoon - but it's the best Mickey Mouse cartoon ever made; and we realise that the story of the Sorcerer's Apprentice is really the archetype that all of the best Mickey Mouse cartoons had been  reaching towards, all along.  The Pastoral Symphony adheres to Beethoven's program but moves everything from the woods of Central Europe to a dreamland from classical mythology.  (The second movement - the section with the courting centaurs - is a failure.  For once the spirit as well as the letter of Beethoven is ignored.  Unfortunately some critics cannot see beyond this movement to the superb interpretations that flank it on either side.)<br><br>I doubt that so much genuine creative work has gone into a film, before or since - even if you don't count the contributions made by the composers. What's my favourite film?  I really don't know.  But if you tell me that I must sit in a large dark cinema for two hours; and ask me what I would like to occupy my eyes and ears over those two hours, I would answer, without hesitation, Fantasia.","user":"Spleen","rank":[79,87]},{"title":"A Truly Unique Experience","rating":26,"date":"26 December 1999","review":"This is one of the truly rare, one of a kind movie going experiences, kind of in the same league as watching 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  I like to watch this film repeatedly;  often times I'll just close my eyes and daydream, letting my own imagination go in place of whats on the screen.  My favorite part is the opening sequence, with its dramatic music and free flowing imagery foreshadowing the state of the world in 1940.  The end of Ave Maria is the perfect bookend to this masterpiece; death has withdrawn and peace has finally arrived.  It would, but not for another five years and millions of lives.  I can never watch this movie without seeing it in this context; for me its a work of art, both a part and ahead of its time.","user":"JoshyR","rank":[62,70]},{"title":"Unusual & Very Creative","rating":5,"date":"5 November 2004","review":"This unusual and very creative classic of animation combines a very interesting idea with quite a bit of imagination, plus visual effects that still hold up quite well. All but a couple of the sequences are quite enjoyable, and some especially so. Even the segments that don't work as well are usually at least interesting, since you can at least appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.<br><br>You don't really have to be all that familiar with the specific pieces of music for it to be worthwhile, since in several cases they chose to match the music with material that is rather different in nature from any original context that it may have had. And in any case, the animated sequences are intended to provide the context, in terms of the movie.<br><br>No doubt, everyone will have his or her own favorite segments, based on the music itself and on the choice of accompanying visual material. The \"Sorcerer's Apprentice\" sequence, with Mickey Mouse, is certainly one of the most memorable. The adaptation of \"The Rite of Spring\" is quite imaginative in using an entirely different setting for the music. \"Night on Bald Mountain\" has striking and sometimes bizarre visuals.<br><br>Many of the classic Disney features still hold up well as family entertainment, but \"Fantasia\" is unique for its combination of imaginative concept and visual creativity. Not every minute of it works, but that's the price of being willing to experiment. It's an enjoyable and satisfying feature that well deserves to be remembered.","user":"Snow Leopard","rank":[29,34]}]
