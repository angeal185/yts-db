[{"title":"Collette shines","rating":7,"date":"11 December 2016","review":"Jess (Drew Barrymore) and Milly (Toni Collette) are lifelong friends from childhood. Jess was an American girl fish-out-of-water in England and Milly was the only one who befriended her. Milly's mother Miranda (Jacqueline Bisset) is an often-absent flaky actress. The girls did everything together. Milly has famed rocker husband Kit (Dominic Cooper), a high powered job, and two kids. Jess lives on a boat with Jago (Paddy Considine) desperately trying to get pregnant. The couple's money is drained and Jago has to work on a North Sea oil rig. Then Milly is diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer.<br><br>This is solid female friendship material. The breast cancer story has its melodramatic touches but it doesn't go overboard. There are enough surprises to keep it fresh. Director Catherine Hardwicke could have made this tighter. Through it all, Barrymore and Collette create a believable best friends duo. Collette especially shines. In the pantheon of female best friends with cancer, this is one of the better ones.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"I was impressed and tearful - and I'm a man","rating":8,"date":"8 October 2015","review":"This is the archetypal woman's film - but there's nothing wrong with that, with far too few opportunities for women in the key roles in movie-making. So women fill the slots of scriptwriter (the British Morwenna Banks), director (American Catherine Hardwicke) and the two top acting positions (Australian Toni Collette and American Drew Barrymore). <br><br>And the subject material is feminine too: breast cancer, infertility, and female friendship. Like \"The Fault In Our Stars\", this is a frank exposition of what it is like to suffer cancer - in this case, with chemotherapy and its attendant sickness, tiredness and hair loss followed by headaches, vision loss, and pain. <br><br>It sounds tough and it is - one the saddest film I've seen in a long while - but there is humour and warmth and superior acting which make it worth viewing this real slice of life. After all, most of us of a certain age have had relatives or friends who have suffered one form of cancer or another, some surviving, some not.","user":"rogerdarlington","rank":[52,60]},{"title":"Heart-felt performance","rating":10,"date":"27 January 2016","review":"The story line and acting was absolutely amazing. I was engaged in the movie from the beginning to the credits. The story line was realistic, coherent and relatable to the struggles some suffer. This movie brings awareness to life issues that are hard to imagine, yet you can feel these in this movie. <br><br>All actors did an outstanding job playing their characters. The setting was fantastic as well. <br><br>I do not want to spoil the movie so I won't say more details! <br><br>I am very picky with the movies I watch and all I can say is that it is worth watching!!!","user":"nicole-43868","rank":[34,43]}]
