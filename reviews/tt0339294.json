[{"title":"Superb Leprechaun movie","rating":10,"date":"18 January 2004","review":"This is a great movie! It has some very funny scenes and is one of the best Leprechaun movies out there. The Leprechaun seems much more evil in this one and no longer rhymes but he is still the reason to watch the movie. The deaths, although without the usual amount of gore, are still quite good. This movie will most probably spawn another sequel which will have to live up to this ones expectations. If you want a great Horror/Comedy you have to look no further this installment in the Leprechaun franchise will not disappoint!","user":"savoie_marc","rank":[20,26]},{"title":"Silly, but Funny in Some Moments","rating":4,"date":"31 July 2008","review":"The hairdresser Emily Woodrow (Tangi Miller) finds a fortune in golden coins and she shares the amount with her close friends. However, the owner is the evil Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) that returns from Hell to get his treasure back, killing each member of the greedy group.<br><br>\"Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood\" is silly, but funny in some moments. The problem is that the pothead and drug-dealer characters are non-likable and extremely ambitious, with the exception of Emily and Lisa; therefore the devilish Leprechaun becomes not as bad as he should be. The scene with the leg of the policeman is hilarious. My vote is four.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"O Duende Perverso\" (\"The Wicked Leprechaun\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Not the best, but an improvement","rating":15,"date":"15 January 2004","review":"Leprechaun Back 2 Tha Hood Written and Directed by: Steven Ayromlodi<br><br>Yep, everyone's favorite evil elf is back in the 6th installment in this classic horror series. <br><br>Parts 4 and 5 are universally viewed as two of the worst movies of all time (Despite them being two films I love, they are admittedly terrible) Steven Ayromlodi was still able to convince someone to give him the money to make a 6th movie.<br><br>This time the Lep comes back to the hood in search of his gold once again. This time it is discovered by some down and out friends in the ghetto. They spend their fortunes and have fun...until the little Irish monster shows up and starts killing off the people that took his gold.<br><br>Yeah, pretty cookie-cutter..but that's how the whole series is and you can't expect much more. But you gotta give director Ayromlodi credit for pulling out a couple of new turns, and making a solid entry into the series.<br><br>I still think 3 is my favorite of the series, but this is definitely an improvement on 4 and 5 in all aspects. Sure, the acting is a bit cheesy at times, and it lacks in the gore department and the kills are less creative, but overall I was satisfied with this movie, and can only hope for a 7th.<br><br>Definitely only for fans of the series though.<br><br>**/4","user":"Sean102218","rank":[11,14]}]
