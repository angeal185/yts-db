[{"title":"Interesting, but it falls short.","rating":4,"date":"9 December 2019","review":"Im sure that you have read that this is a more modern retelling of invasion of the body snatchers. Don't think of it that way though. If you compare the 2 then my rating for this would go down. This feels more like a pretentious indie movie rather than a horror. The whole thing being about a flower was interesting, but the characters are boring and uninteresting. Which is disappointing considering that is what is supposed to hold this movie together. There isn't really a satisfying climactic scene that the movie builds up to and there is a ton of build up. The music in the movie was really odd to say the least and sometimes annoying. What can I say, I feel as if I wasted a lot of time on this movie.","user":"pickleinabag","rank":[29,37]},{"title":"Flawed in every department, typical critic love fest","rating":4,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"So it's a modern day take on an old sci-fi classic, with a slight twist, fine we understand that quick enough. However, it fails in direction completely, cold acting with warm and pastal colours is just a cliche.\nThe lead actor centre stage and holding the shot whilst (kabuki) music plays (clearly thinks it has something to do with ikebana) gives an ominous feel, REALLY. You care nothing for the characters, why should you, that's the premise of the film. As for the soundtrack, well it is very annoying, a drum here, an asthmatic whistle there, a tin can, what sounds like a box of chihuahua's, just annoys the viewer. The style, it tries but falls flat, the plant is shown in vivid pink, alluding to the passion it feels, the lead actor originally wears bold colours but then the pastoral colours come in later, why they have to wear 70's clothing to allow this when the rest of the film is clearly in the here and now god knows.\nA typical critics film from a director who believes their own hype finding what they need to find in films as their own lives are one dimensional and so far from a real film goer.\nDon't even start on the dialogue. A ten minute short would give you a better experience.","user":"namstonk","rank":[47,68]},{"title":"Had all the elements to work as a short, at feature length it is a slog.","rating":6,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"This film has several elements that would have made a great 15-20 minute short film. But at feature length it is a long hard receptive slog","user":"random-70778","rank":[27,37]}]
