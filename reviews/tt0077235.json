[{"title":"Awesome","rating":10,"date":"14 March 2002","review":"I first saw this film in 1978, my father took me to see it with my brothers at the drive-in as a double feature with \"Every Which Way But Loose.\" It's a movie that I have never forgotten. It combines brilliantly heart gripping surfing action, heart wrenching emotions, and heart uplifting humour, all set against the back-drop of the Vietnam War, teenagers growing up, the wisdom of elders (Bear) and of course, the surfing.<br><br>I've never surfed a minute of my entire life (although whenever I watch this, I feel like I should), so don't think of this as a \"surf movie\". It simply is an excellent piece of cinematic history that you will feel you missed on if you never see it.<br><br>Recommended with 2 thumbs way way way up.","user":"mijbril","rank":[46,51]},{"title":"Hollywood's Perfect Wave","rating":28,"date":"28 June 2004","review":"\"This movie is too good for surfers.\" Quentin Tarantino was asked about \"Big Wednesday\" once and this was his answer. Tarantino grew up in southern California and surfers, he says, were mean to him and his friends. Tarantino, however, knows a good movie when he sees one. This truly is Hollywood's \"perfect wave\", the only time the surf culture was portrayed accurately in a studio film. The surf community consistently refers to this film with reverence, citing it's depiction of the \"soul\" of surfing as being worthy of their hallowed endeavors in the water. After years of Frankie and Annette or, God forbid, Keanu Reeves, this is one they can be proud of. Writer-director John Milius was a surfer himself referring to it again in his most celebrated screenplay for \"Apocalypse Now\" (\"Charlie don't surf!\"). One of the keys to this film's authenticity is the fact that the three stars did a lot of their own surfing. Actually seeing their faces as they stand up for a ride is a bonus. William Kaat, Jan-Michael Vincent and Gary Busey (actually pretty big names from this era) were accomplished surfers, Busey learning for the role. The fine cast is rounded out by cuties Lee Purcell and Patti d'Arbanville and Sam Melville as the mystical mentor Bear. Keep your eyes peeled for legendary surfer Gerry Lopez, \"Perry Mason\"'s Barbara Hale, future Freddy creep Robert Englund, Larry Talbot from \"Miami Vice\" and Charlene Tilton and Steve Kanaly who both ended up on \"Dallas\". If you ever had a group of friends who did stuff together, you'll find this film has a lot of depth and soul. As Matt says after riding Big Wednesday \"we drew the line\". The three friends have validated the thing that consumed them as young men, that is riding waves and promising to be together when the big one hit. But they also acknowledge the need to embrace adulthood and put surfing where it should be. As Bear himself said \"nobody surfs forever\". Sad but true. It applies to all of us, no matter what we do.","user":"LateShow","rank":[41,47]},{"title":"Top five movie music - take a bow Basil","rating":20,"date":"20 October 2005","review":"What is it about Big Wednesday that inspires so much affection? I won't repeat the many tributes that have been made here, and yes, I was a surfer, and yes, this is in my top five of all time movies, and yes, I watch it about once every eighteen months.<br><br>But something others don't seem to mention much is the perfect score that Basil Poledouris wrote for the movie, sound which echoes and complements the action throughout, and reminds me strongly of artists and music of the time like Jack Nitzches \"Lonely Surfer\", and \"Beyond the Break\". Not, for heaven's sake, the Beach Boys or Jan and Dean.<br><br>But isn't that a big part of good movies? When music, image and story all combine? (Discuss)<br><br>The other four of my five are \"Andrei Rublev\", \"If...\" \"The Piano\" \"Journey to the Center of the Earth\"","user":"john-sellers","rank":[14,16]}]
