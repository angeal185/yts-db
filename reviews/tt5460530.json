[{"title":"Imbecilic writing","rating":1,"date":"15 January 2018","review":"I'm not a movie critic but I did practice law for 41 years. The courtroom scenes in this movie exceed the outermost boundaries of stupidity. This is sloppy, incompetent and irresponsible writing. A piece of trash. \nIt's impossible to point a finger at the person responsible with two screenwriters fiddling with a novel. \nDisgusting.","user":"tomnel-1","rank":[55,68]},{"title":"Formulaic Revenge Story, With One Good Performance","rating":6,"date":"1 December 2017","review":"There is not much of anything original or unpredictable going on with this movie. It is pretty much your standard revenge flick, where the bad guys get off in court, and they are dealt with via vigilante justice.<br><br>There is one bright spot in the film, though. That is the performance of Talitha Bateman as the daughter. She acts in a relaxed, natural manner that is totally believable. In fact, she shows more acting ability than some of the other characters in the movie. But to be fair, there are a number of caricature roles in the movie that aren't very demanding of the actors (for example, the bad guys and their mother).<br><br>Bateman is young, so I hope she can find some better scripts than this in the future, and continues to grow as an actress. At this point, she reminds me of how Saoirse Ronan was at the same age. Ronan developed into a very good actress. I hope Bateman can do the same.","user":"Stoshie","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"No Plot Structure, Character Development, etc, Whatsoever","rating":2,"date":"16 January 2018","review":"There is a new rash of screenwriters out there who have never read a book or seen a play. They no nothing about plot structure. They don't know that a story needs 3 acts. The don't know about character development or arc. They don't know what subtext is. They don't know the 7 basic plots. And they definitely have no idea what a 3rd act is. <br><br>Everything they know about writing a movie is from watching movies and they don't understand what they're watching. In this particular movie they thought all they needed something bad to happen so the good guy could start going after the bad guys and then you just stop and that's your end. Unbelievably shallow attempt at storytelling and the writer wants us to believe there is no such thing as DNA evidence. If there was DNA evidence then this movie couldn't have been made. Well, DNA evidence exists and this movie shouldn't.<br><br>And what the hell ever happened to Nicholas Cage? He used pick interesting roles and create something interesting a memorable? Why did he decide to suck?","user":"jburtonprod-802-759029","rank":[23,31]}]
