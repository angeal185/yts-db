[{"title":"Nice but Predictable effort","rating":5,"date":"19 September 2018","review":"A tragedy with use of symbolic like surprising situations but overall ist mostly predictable for a grown up with life experience. \nBut it could maybe help for younger people who try their luck in a cruel business.","user":"kinemagine","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"A Must See...","rating":9,"date":"25 March 2018","review":"Went to the premiere last night and absolutely recommend it. This film navigated the heavy internal conflicts of the struggling actor poignantly and gives its viewer pause as to what's really important in life. A great reminder not to lose our sense of self and our values in our fight to get ahead, no matter what profession.\nGreat composition, all around. \nThank you for telling this story","user":"mandylrubio","rank":[8,31]},{"title":"Not bad , could have been much better but they copped out with the usual American ending!","rating":5,"date":"1 January 2019","review":"If this had been a British production the ending would have been much darker and truer to life. This just followed the usual movie making hollywood rulebook and thus broke no real new ground!<br><br>The film was very well acted and the story paced well until the last 15 minutes where they just copped out and gave the American audiences the usual sickly, moralistic, happy ending where it should have been brutally truthful and broke the rules.<br><br>Shame!","user":"omendata","rank":[1,3]}]
