[{"title":"Can't watch it because of bad acting.","rating":3,"date":"6 September 2017","review":"Seriously. I don't think I've ever seen less believable acting that Ryan Scott's. Within 10 minutes I'm annoyed with every line he utters. It's wooden and stiff... It's just bad acting!<br><br>Jeannette Sousa isn't all that bad, but also not really convincing.<br><br>I bet the story line is somewhat fun, but I just can't stomach it. Do not recommend.","user":"lauravankessel","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"The story is cheesy and the acting is horrible","rating":1,"date":"20 August 2017","review":"The story is not even close to being average. On top of that the acting was horrible from the lead male actor. These combination made watching this an unpleasant experience.<br><br>The title itself was a red flag but I still decided to watch this anyway. And not to my surprise, I ended up completely wasting the time. Amid this chaos the only positive thing was the acting of Jeannette Sousa. She wasn't annoying like the people around her.<br><br>My suggestion is....there are tens of thousands of better movies out there. Go watch those.","user":"said-buet10","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Cute but with problems","rating":5,"date":"11 July 2017","review":"Saw this last night - couldn't finish it. I like rom com's and I understand they can be contrived but this was just too awkward and clumsily written. I couldn't get over how stiff the acting was by the male lead - it's not often you notice bad acting and I had to look up the movie online (that's what got me here) and then read the back story that they wrote the movie and are actually married. That explains it. No way he would have gotten a callback if he had auditioned. Sorry but his acting really ruined it for me. B","user":"brian-ogrady","rank":[3,4]}]
