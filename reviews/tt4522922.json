[{"title":"Unexpected pleasure","rating":8,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"I wasn't expecting much when I stumbled across this title, but have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. Quirky offbeat humour with a few laugh out loud moments and an absurdity that enhances, rather than detracts, from this mash up of camp-fire story telling, and comedy suspense. Definitely worth the watch and worthy of a better rating than it has on IMDB.","user":"lukeshulver","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Watch it - it's good - it's not \"amazing\" but it's a \"must watch\" good","rating":7,"date":"4 November 2019","review":"At first, I couldn't even understand what they were saying but slowly, the accent normalized and in the middle of the movie, I thought this was it but apparently, there was more so I was presently surprised.","user":"A-Shekhar","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"Off one's Brits","rating":7,"date":"31 October 2019","review":"Now this may or may not work better for a British audience. But it will also depend on if the viewer likes the mix of thrill and comedy. This can seem annoying (especially a certain character portrayed in this), but it can also be just a lot of fun.<br><br>Don't overthink it, especially the twist towards the end, that may or may not be easy to spot from miles. Also the very end is quite ridiculous and made for laughs. Does it work? I'm uncertain myself, didn't quite like the note it ends on, but it didn't spoil the experience and fun I had before that (not political correct this is ... not really likeable characters it has)","user":"kosmasp","rank":[10,16]}]
