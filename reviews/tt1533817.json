[{"title":"Eurgh...bad movie.","rating":3,"date":"20 September 2010","review":"Stomp The Yard was a great standalone film, and never really needed a sequel. Sometimes sequels work, sometimes they don't. Unfortunately, STY2: Homecoming is the latter. <br><br>STY2 was made on the cheap and it's really obvious. The characters are lacklustre, the acting is awful, the visual quality is poor and everything just seems very unfinished. It's not polished, slick or funny like the original. It's dark, jerky and hard to follow. If you are a huge fan of the original, i'd recommend watching it purely for Columbus Short's monologue later in the movie. He's the only saving grace in this car crash, and the sole reason for a 3 star review. <br><br>This movie is cheap, nasty and super disappointing. Give it a miss and watch the original instead.","user":"l-tavendale","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"HATED the movie. Didn't finish.","rating":1,"date":"26 September 2010","review":"I loved the original Stomp the Yard, even though I disagreed with a few things in it.<br><br>I hated this movie so much that I walked out of it (even if walking out only meant leaving the living room) partway through.<br><br>WHY take a movie about stepping and turn it into a movie about senseless violence??? Plus, this movie doesn't have the eye-candy characters as did the first one.<br><br>The movie should have been light-hearted and shown more STEPPING. I'm super frustrated that so many movies about one thing just HAVE to throw in a bunch of violence.<br><br>On top of that, the main character does not draw you in. I do not feel any sympathy for him at all, as he his predicaments are all due to his own actions and choices.<br><br>The best thing about the movie was seeing tWitch, as I am a huge So You Think You Can Dance fan.","user":"NatPatBen","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"its OK to watch on your laptop","rating":3,"date":"5 January 2011","review":"Well all i can say is that this movie is OK to watch but after watching to the end then you would realise that it was a bit weak....the plot was OK...the acting was OK...a bit exaggerated at certain parts. It was very very predictable though....but trust me it is way better than the back up plan...with J'lo......(i would say that movie was the worst for 2010) Stomp the yard 2 in my opinion was done in a rush. I mean i think the makers of this movie weren't too keen on out doing the 1st one but just wanted to do a dance movie in a hurry and reap of unsuspecting movie goers like you and i. So I am sure their plan was that by the time you would realise that the movie sucked ass, you would have already paid to be in the cinema hall. It is worth watching on your laptop, after all if you got it for free from a pal who downloaded it then its worth watching. At least it is a great a opportunity to use it to kill 1.20hrs of time if don't have anything to do or if u don't have anywhere to go. Other wise i recommend Scott Pilgrim vs the world<br><br>i give it 3 stars","user":"niidalai","rank":[4,5]}]
