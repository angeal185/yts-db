[{"title":"Enjoyed it","rating":10,"date":"10 March 2017","review":"Not bad for a LMN movie - not bad at all! This was a small twist on an old plot - crazy fan tries to control the object of their obsession. The action takes us onto the workings of a movie set, which I'm sure bears only some resemblance to the real thing. However, it was realistic and kept me watching. The acting was fairly good - the B-movie (really cable-TV) 'stars' were more approachable than your standard movie star. One of the hangers-on was a little too compliant to be believable, but since it was a minor part, it was tolerable. Had the usual twists and turns - people start to inquire and are dealt with, Tension ebbs and flows - again relatively believable. LMN has started producing more quality stuff - not just 'for women' anymore.Check this one out","user":"billsoccer","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"Bored, silly and bad","rating":1,"date":"24 July 2018","review":"Honestly I cannot recommend such a bad film. The characters are not well constructed, argument is not credible and even the stupid fan's club does not fit.","user":"malekith99","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"Wasted potential","rating":3,"date":"4 August 2017","review":"I love Betsy Brandt from Breaking Bad that's why I watched this Lifetime thriller. But it wasn't very well done and wasn't cleverly written. The premise had potential with all the fan conventions and social media involving TV shows. Some fans are sure to be stalkers. This obsessed fan pretends to have an affair with a sci fi action hero then things get out of hand. The various stalker things felt lame and her fellow crazy fans looked silly. Betsy and the guy were not hot enough to be subjects of stalking. Wrong casting. And the fan looked too benign.<br><br>Don't bother with this one - it could have been done much better. Maybe LMN will do another such themed show but make it with a cool hit show and some convincing danger.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[4,8]}]
