[{"title":"Not for everyone","rating":8,"date":"12 February 2018","review":"Loved the film, it is definitely not for everyone, as an art student it was rather interesting to see an artists process of making a painting. The film itself is rather small, it is centred around one particular event. The acting is great. I would recommend it to artists and people who are interested in creative process of making an artwork.","user":"vladimir-janic","rank":[38,43]},{"title":"For the sophisticated spectator","rating":8,"date":"22 February 2018","review":"The search for perfection is an endless workflow. It is a routine in which there is always time for a walk with a friend, an affair with a muse or a fight with a wife.<br><br>The peculiarity of this picture is that Tucci does not dramatize the reality of life. He shows everything as it happens in it. A good well-done shot story about the true love of artists for their craft.","user":"danielmeench","rank":[27,30]},{"title":"An interesting portrait","rating":7,"date":"24 March 2018","review":"An interesting portrait about the painter Giacometti at the end of his life, when he painted his last painting before he died. It is curious to see their crises, their insecurities and dissatisfactions in the act of creating. And Geoffrey Rush is very well in the role of the painter while creating an interesting relationship with the character of Armie Hammer.","user":"alvesmarceloalves-73751","rank":[14,15]}]
