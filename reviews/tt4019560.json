[{"title":"Horrible Movie...but for good reason..","rating":1,"date":"11 February 2016","review":"I'm not the type to ever leave a review on anything, unless its in a positive context, but i felt the need since there wasn't a way for me to directly respond to some of the reviews that i read. This movie is bad! Really really terrible! There is no mysterious deeper meaning, like I've been reading.<br><br>Its actually embarrassing that there are people on here who think they are some how so above every one else, so special, that they took this movie for some artistic genius, that went over all our heads. Lions Gate films gutted and re-edited this movie to focus around Keanu, when the movie wasn't supposed to. <br><br>The actual director of this movie felt so strongly about the fact that it became a piece of crap, that he took his name off the movie completely. <br><br>So instead of trying to be the next Roger Ebert, or trying to look for a deeper meaning in a movie that doesn't have any, just stop, don't, because you're misleading people into wasting 2 hours of their lives.","user":"nickolasyiannios","rank":[133,177]},{"title":"Horrible Movie","rating":1,"date":"22 January 2016","review":"Just awful!<br><br>This is not one movie. But two entirely separate movies. One is in Spanish (with English subtitles) about a Latina woman having visions and struggling with her Latin family's heritage. The other is about Keanu sleepwalking as part of solving his partner's murder. For a long time the movie goes back and forth between these two stories without the slightest connection. Then suddenly the stories are forced to merge.<br><br>Horrible acting. Bad writing. Bad, bad direction. Everything is lousy in this film.<br><br>Movies like this one should be a must-see in all film schools. \"Exposed\" should serve as an example of how many people it takes to make a movie and yet it can turn out this badly.<br><br>One can see by the opening credits that there must have been six production and financing companies involved. It is inconceivable that the producers, financiers and others from those companies just put out the money, saw this movie in progress, or the premiere, and were OK with it.<br><br>Simply inconceivable.<br><br>Do not believe the \"6.3\" (from 146 users!!!!) rating of this movie. These are friends of producers or production crew trying to recoup their money. All lies.<br><br>Just to give you an example: \"Declan Dale\" is the name of the director in the credits. But \"Declan Dale\" is like \"Alan Smithee\", a name that directors use when they want not to be associated with the film.<br><br>Even the Director wants his name off of this piece of junk. That's how bad this movie is!","user":"zubinster","rank":[253,348]},{"title":"Someone owes me 1 hour 42 minutes.","rating":1,"date":"12 February 2016","review":"I am at a loss to find an adjective to truly describe this movie. So,I'll just go with awful, really awful. <br><br>Awful patch work structure. Awful, wooden acting. Awful Direction.<br><br>Given all of the awful mentioned above, skillful editing could have saved it, however the clumsy, almost random links left the converging plot lines disjointed and just, yes, awful.<br><br>The finance and production companies, all 16 of them, should have simply made a donation to charity rather than pour money into this awful mess. Over all, this awful movie left me feeling older and in need of a shower.","user":"tony-wigan","rank":[76,102]}]
