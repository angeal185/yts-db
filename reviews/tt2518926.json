[{"title":"It's actually worse than you're expecting","rating":2,"date":"29 August 2013","review":"No, really. I knew it was going to be bad. Really bad. I mean, a low budget movie about dinosaurs roaming around in LA is going to be bad. You know it's going to rip off ideas and scenes from Jurassic Park. Of course it is... because that's THE benchmark for dinosaur movies. And it's going to be a clone of all the disaster/horror/animals at large movies ever made. If you're like me, you're completely aware of this going in. In fact, you crave a good Cheese-fest B-movie. But no matter how low your expectations are, this movie was still worse.<br><br>Considering how far the CG industry has come since Jurassic Park, which was 20 years ago now, I have what I consider a reasonable expectation of monster SFX to be. This wasn't that good. I mean, they actually failed to match 20 year old tech, or apparently develop any kind of realistic motion models. The flying dinos look like claymation. The matting is horrid, with poorly rendered CG dinos clearly not even remotely matching the background.<br><br>Nah, there's no redemption. And yet, many will watch this on Netflix because it's there. So if you're checking this review prior to watching, take your lowest expectations and drop them one or two levels.<br><br>It's absolutely insane that there can be this many people in the industry who have access to the means of making a movie, but still have no idea how to make a movie. Bad script, bad acting, bad CG, bad music, bad sound FX, bad audio mixing, bad foley, bad continuity, bad makeup, bad costumes, bad lighting, almost every aspect is bad, which is why you'll want to watch it for the cheese factor.","user":"zapdude","rank":[57,59]},{"title":"Jurassic Asylum... wait, ah well, just go with the flow...","rating":3,"date":"14 September 2013","review":"This was bad on a Jurassic scale. Given it is a movie from The Asylum, then at least we as the audience have an ounce of hope that this might just be one of those movies that stand out from the rest of the movies that they spew out. But no. I must say that given the cover/poster for the movie, I had my hopes up just a little bit, but when I saw THE ASYLUM on the screen as the movie started, all hopes evaporated like dew before the rising sun.<br><br>The idea was pretty much everything that was used in the \"Jurassic Park\" movies; dinosaurs have been brought back to life by the hands of humans with the help of technology and research. And of course, these dinosaurs break free of their captivity and wreck havoc on a major city - in this case Los Angeles.<br><br>Right, almost textbook page by page copy from \"Jurassic Park\", well, and then exposed to The Asylum. What could possibly go wrong?<br><br>I will say that the dinosaurs as CGI animated creatures were actually quite alright. However, when they brought in the prosthetics and puppets it just went from alright to oh-so-wrong. These non-CGI animated dinosaurs were such an eyesore that it was downright embarrassing to watch. Especially the scene with the pteranodon in the helicopter. Look at the beak when it is CGI animated and then look at the difference in texture and color even when it is a real prosthetic used. It was just so bad.<br><br>Story-wise, then \"Age of Dinosaurs\" was nowhere near as interesting as \"Jurassic Park\", and chances are that if you have seen any of the \"Jurassic Park\" movies and enjoyed them, then you don't really want to spend 88 minutes on this movie. The story was as plain, predictable and textbook material as they come.<br><br>And what about the title itself, \"Age of Dinosaurs\"? Wouldn't that actually indicate a period of time spanding more than a single day? Well, I guess the title was just about as good as the actual movie was.<br><br>Regarding the acting in the movie, well, nothing overly interesting here. You have TV pseudo-legend Treat Williams, but he is barely making it watchable. And then there was Ronny Cox, which was actually nice to see, though this is not one of his best movies, not by a long shot.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"Another sad attempt to create a prehistoric monster movie","rating":2,"date":"17 September 2013","review":"How many attempts have been made to make a prehistoric monster in the modern day movies have their been? None of them have even come close to the Jurassic Park series, including this movie.<br><br>SPOILER BEGINS <br><br>This 'story' is about several species of prehistoric dinosaur being recreated through genetic engineering. They are first shown to the world in LA.<br><br>Obviously they all manage to escape their cages and reek havoc in the city.<br><br>It is up to Gabe Jacobs (Treat Williams) and his daughter Jade (Jillian Rose Reed) to save the city while trying to save themselves of course.<br><br>That's all you need to know really.<br><br>SPOILER ENDS <br><br>The screenplay written by Hank Woon Jr was atrocious, the direction by Joseph J Lawson was to say the least dismal and the special effects were reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen. Ray I feel provided us with much better and realistic effects.<br><br>The only redeeming factor of this movie is that it included both Treat Williams and Jillian Rose Reed who put in good performances with the terrible script they had to play with.<br><br>All in all this movie will not go down in the annals of movie history as a classic, more likely in the category of movie which should never have been made.","user":"plutus1947","rank":[7,7]}]
