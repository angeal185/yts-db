[{"title":"Surprisingly Good","rating":8,"date":"24 May 2017","review":"I'm an action movie kind of guy. I see every Marvel, DC and transformers movie as soon as they come out. I care not for chick flicks. Luckily my wife doesn't force me to go to them either. I watched this movie because it's our anniversary and I wanted to watch a movie I knew my wife would enjoy. I went into this movie with a Large soda and Large popcorn with the expectation to keep myself energized so that I wouldn't fall asleep on my wife. NOT NEEDED.<br><br>This movie didn't have the most action packed story line but the story line was good. They progressed the story at a good pace, not lingering on any one scene too long. They did a good job developing the characters backgrounds and helping you understand everyone and had a nice plot twist at the end that didn't feel rushed as if they had run out of budget. They also didn't linger with the closing.<br><br>While this movie didn't make me want to go see other chick flicks or go read the book, I definitely enjoyed this movie. I know that some of the ways they portrayed SCID and people who are disabled isn't necessarily accurate, but it doesn't take away from the quality of the movie. After all, this wasn't a documentary but a romance movie so I'm OK with them taking a few liberties with the portrayal of her condition.","user":"jeremyjessup","rank":[63,83]},{"title":"\"Love is worth everything.

I couldn't stop smiling during the entire movie. Amandla and Nick did an amazing job portraying Maddy and Olly. The movie is very faithful to the book (something that I appreciate a lot) The soundtrack is perfect for the story. And I can't wait to watch it again.","user":"krystalcolon-47169","rank":[63,85]},{"title":"Pretty good but mishandled the reaction to child abuse.","rating":5,"date":"17 August 2017","review":"*MAJOR PLOT RUINING SPOILERS*<br><br>I liked the story as much as I enjoy any other sappy teenage romance. There are unforgivable \"movie sins\" in this movie that I can not get over though and that is the way that child abuse is handled. The main huge plot twist of this movie is that Maddy's mother was a delusional child abuser who kept her daughter locked in a glass cage with the threat of dying from a disease that she didn't have. The way in which the movie handles this is having Maddy run away to nurse Carla, her previous caretaker and only other human contact who got fired for allowing her to stand in the same room as another human being. This first step was amazing but from then on it just went down hill. Maddy does not press charges and her mother is treated like she is also a victim who should be offered sympathy. This is neither a realistic and human response to that kind of situation nor is it morally right. The movie ends with a mentally unstable individual who imprisoned someone for their entire life walking free with no consequences. If the woman is capable of that kind of craziness than what horrors will she inflict upon the world now after her victim has escaped.","user":"gamemaster-91558","rank":[25,32]}]
