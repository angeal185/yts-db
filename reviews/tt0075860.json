[{"title":"Transforming Fear to Wonder","rating":16,"date":"16 July 2004","review":"An amazing film, one of my favorites. I watch this regularly, especially at times when the reality of life is overwhelming, just to refocus and regain some sense of perspective.<br><br>Everything in this film works toward one end: to transform the adult sense of fear back into the childlike sense of wonder at the world. From the very opening moments of the film, designed to create confusion and startlement, this movie creates a sensation of dread and foreboding. The dissonance of the soundtrack, the juxtaposition of images, they all are working to build into the viewer a feeling that something just isn't right, that something out of the ordinary is taking place, and underscoring this all with a sense that this is something to resist, to pull away from, to not allow it to affect one's \"ordinary life.\" <br><br>But as the movie progresses, the tone begins to shift, and the true intent of the film begins to peek through. This isn't about being afraid of the unknown, but rather embracing it. Paying attention to the \"subliminal images\" in life, allowing them to lead you into something unknown and perhaps dangerous, only then can one be open to wonder and experience the world through the magical eyes of a child.<br><br>Dreyfuss' character takes us on this journey, met with resistance all along the way. His wife, his neighbors, his job, his community, all are working against him, and it's only when he's reached his craziest that he truly gives in and begins to stop trying to understand and instead embraces the experiences in store for him. The scientific community is seeking to understand, but without having any personal calling to be involved. Only Barry is truly able to throw himself into the strangeness that is taking place, and his enthusiasm is greeted by both the characters and the audience as somehow alien and threatening.<br><br>The ending of this film, when all the fear is finally stripped away and the sense of amazed wonder overtakes everyone on the screen and in the audience, brings about an amazing catharsis. Discarding all the \"adult\" sensibilities and being able to approach life once again with a sense of innocent amazement for the Strange hidden amongst the Ordinary, one can begin again to approach life from a fresh vantage point. <br><br>Powerful, mystifying, and rejuvenating. I highly recommend this film for anyone jaded with life and seeking a sense of renewal.","user":"hippybear","rank":[195,257]},{"title":"personal all-time favorite","rating":10,"date":"27 January 2004","review":"For my taste, the first hour and a half of this movie is the greatest stretch of filmmaking ever.  Up until Roy and Jillian reach the \"dark side of the moon\" on Devil's Tower, this movie is perfect.  No, it's beyond perfect -- it's sublime.  It takes me to a level of bliss that no other movie can do.<br><br>Many critics and viewers -- including a number on this site -- don't like this movie at all.  Those who do like it almost uniformly like the final sequence, the \"alien landing,\" the best.  For me it is the rest of the movie that is the most remarkable.  Some of my favorite sequences:<br><br>1.  The blinding flash of light that ends the opening credits and leads us to a sandstorm in Sonora Desert, Mexico -- Present Day, with various team leaders, Bob Balaban, and Francois Truffaut speaking three languages as they find a whole bunch of old Navy planes lost in the Bermuda Triangle and an old geezer who saw something very strange.  \"El sol salio a noche.  Y me canto,\" he keeps saying.  Translation: \"He says the sun came out last night. He says it sang to him.\"  Then Balaban translates for Truffaut: \"Il dit que le soleil etait venue ici hier soir, et qu'il chantait pour lui.\"  Then Balaban disappears in a cloud of dust.  The mystery created in that sequence is incredible -- the greatest opening of all time, if you ask me.  Trivia note:  that sequence was the last Spielberg filmed before the movie's release.  The shooting script opens with Indianapolis Flight Control, but Spielberg decided he wanted a new opening and shot this after production had wrapped.  Supposedly this sequence was inspired by the Iraqi prologue in the Exorcist.<br><br>2.  Roy's first encounter with the aliens in his power company truck -- a brilliantly conceived and edited sequence.  I love the dolly in to Roy's window as he pants in shock in the shadows, then the comedy of his reaction when the lights in the truck come back on.<br><br>3.  The \"sky speeders\" disappearing into the clouds over Muncie, followed by lightning and then the lights of the city coming back on, bit by bit. Spielberg's use of miniatures here is breathtaking -- as it was in 1941 and as it is later in CE3K when the UFO believers gather again to await another encounter and the lights from the government helicopters move toward them across the plains below.<br><br>4.  The entire sequence of Roy going crazy.  This was controversial with critics -- Pauline Kael, who loved the movie generally, hated Roy throwing the bushes into the kitchen -- and Spielberg actually cut the entire digging up the garden sequence from the so-called \"Special Edition.\"  To me, though, this is the absolute heart of the movie.  Ask people what they remember from CE3K and the first thing they'll say is \"mashed potatoes.\"  To my mind, the garden sequence is one of those magical moments that is so funny and so sad it's just perfect.  I believe every second of it, every time.  The reactions of the kids are perfect -- the oldest son is big enough to be angry, while the middle says, \"Dad, when we're finished with this can we throw dirt in my window?\"  (In the dinner sequence, little Sylvia has arguably the best line in a movie full of them -- \"I hate, I hate these potatoes.  There's a dead fly in my potatoes.\"  An ad lib, of course.)<br><br>In recent years, Spielberg has expressed concern with the fact that Roy leaves his family to pursue the aliens, and has said that if he were to make the movie over again, he would change that part.  To my way of thinking, if you take that out, there is no movie.  What this movie is really about is Roy's obsession, and that, I think, is why it has such a hold on me personally.  This movie is about what it's like for a person whose life has lost its meaning suddenly finding there is a really important purpose, and pursuing that purpose at all costs.  Is it right for him to turn his family's life upside down and ultimately leave them behind to do that? No. But his obsession is understandable, I think, and the purpose Roy finds is something a lot of people would like to feel.  Also, it's clear that Roy is not acting entirely of his own free will -- he has been \"commanded\" subliminally to make his way to Devil's Tower.<br><br>I am not aware of any other movie -- or book, or any other source, for that matter -- that portrays 70s suburban life so accurately.  The street, the house, the cars, the toys, the furniture -- it is like an archeological document.  And the way the kids act, and the family conflicts -- to my way of thinking, they are all portrayed with unerring accuracy and realism. Some have contended that Ronnie is unflatteringly portrayed, but to me that's not fair.  She can't be blamed for reacting the way she does to Roy -- many people in her shoes would.  Garr's performance is brilliant; she and Dreyfuss are magical together.  Melinda Dillon, too, is brilliant in her role.  In the shooting script, the sexual attraction between Roy and Jillian was more overt, but Spielberg wisely downplays it in the finished film. It's only hinted at, although it is there.<br><br>The actual \"alien landing\" sequence, in my opinion, is a letdown.  It's brilliantly photographed and realized, but once Roy and Jillian make it to the dark side of the moon, the primary tension in the story is gone.  If I could edit this movie, I'd take a major pair of shears to the final sequence, cut it down to maybe half its current length.  I do get choked up when I see Roy in his red suit at the end of the line of astronauts, though, and Jillian wiping tears away as she clicks away with her Kodak.<br><br>As with the original Star Wars, my other all-time favorite movie, I have a problem with the way this picture has been hacked and altered from its original release through various special editions.  I understand it's possible to watch the original 1977 cut on the DVD, and I'm glad of that. That original version is the best.  I first got to know this movie on ABC in the early 1980s, when it was shown with all the original and Special Edition footage edited together.  Personally, I don't think the special edition footage adds much (even the Gobi desert sequence, which is an interesting concept that was in the shooting script, stands out because it was obviously shot by a different DP and doesn't have Truffaut in it).<br><br>Anyway, I will always cherish this movie.  \"You tell Crystal Lake we're going to candlepower in ten minutes!\"  \"Zey belong here more zan we.\" \"There's always some joker who thinks he's immune.\"  \"You can't fool us by agreeing with us.\"  \"What the hell is going on around here?  Who the hell are you people?\"  \"Ronnie, everything's fine.  All this stuff is coming down.\"","user":"billreynolds","rank":[189,268]},{"title":"Aliens in Muncie make for Spielberg's Best Film Ever","rating":10,"date":"10 January 2006","review":"Steven Spielberg has made huge popcorn blockbusters that gross more money at the box office (i.e. \"Jaws,\" \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" or \"Jurassic Park\") and are more exciting on a visceral level. As he as aged and matured as a director, he has also made movies that are more important and will hold a more solid place in the chronicles of film as an artistic document of history (i.e. \"Schindler's List,\" \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and \"Munich\"). For my money, his best film will still always be \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" This film is Spielberg's humanistic and heartfelt answer to Kubrick's intellectual and cerebral look at man's first contact with life from elsewhere in the universe in his 1968 opus \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"<br><br>\"Close Encounters\" came early on in Spielberg's career, made in 1977, and has all the hallmarks of his later films played just right before he became so self-referential. Here we have his typical bag of tricks long before they became so typical: familial strife, coming to terms with something bigger than oneself that challenges the male protagonist's view of the world around him, little kids in jeopardy, superb build up of suspense, fantastic visual effects, and a memorable score from John Williams. From the first UFO sightings in Muncie, Indiana to the fantastic finale at Devil's Tower in Wyoming, this is grand entertainment. Lots of films have emulated this movie to varying degrees of success, from Robert Zemeckis' earnest \"Contact,\" to the shameful scam that was M. Night Shymalan's \"Signs,\" and even Spielberg himself recently did the dark natured flip-side to benevolent alien encounters with his remake of \"War of the Worlds\" (which makes a fantastic double-feature with this). However, nothing compares to this true original. No other film has made me want to believe in aliens more, and I'll never look at a plate of mashed potatoes the same again.","user":"WriterDave","rank":[128,204]}]
