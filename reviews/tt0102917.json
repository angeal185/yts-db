[{"title":"Bleak and beautiful","rating":24,"date":"24 September 2001","review":"This film could be described as a \"mainland martial arts movie\", but that would probably mislead anybody for who the term \"martial arts movie\" is heavily influenced by the Hong Kong approach to the subject (or the mainland's contribution in the SHAOLIN TEMPLE series). The movie is more akin to He Ping's RF, GF but bleaker in tone. A young swordsman travels to Double Flag town to claim his bride, betrothed to him at birth by his father and revealed to him on said father's deathbed. Upon reaching Double Flag, the girl's father is rather dubious about handing over his daughter to one so young, but invites the chap to stay with them and work in his horse-head soup restaurant.<br><br>Double Flag is not a terribly happy town, being the regular pillaging place of the \"Invincible Swordsman\" and his gang. TIS is a bandit leader famous for always killing with a single deadly stroke. When the Invincible Swordsman's brother takes a fancy to the young swordsman's betrothed, he gets to prove whether or not he has what it takes to protect her as a husband. He calls on the \"Desert Eagle\", a braggart swordsman from nearby, for assistance.<br><br>SIDFT is more Kurosawa than Tsui Hark, with a large helping of Sergio Leone thrown in too. The desert locations and characters permanently covered in muck have drawn comparisons to THE BLADE and ASHES OF TIME, but it's nothing like either of those HK movies. ASHES is probably the closer of those two, but SWORDSMAN IN... has none of the epic grandeur or high philosophy of Wong Kar-Wai's work. Like Kurosawa's Yojimbo or Seven Samurai, this is a story of a village living under terror of bandits in a location miles from the law. Ping's characters are not given to much philosophy, just the challenge of getting by without dying.<br><br>The film is rather beautiful to watch, with the desert town of Double Flag being remarkable to behold, carved from sandstone in the Chinese desert who knows how many centuries ago. Everything in the film is \"gritty\" and functional. Ping has certainly seen his share of HK swordsman films, and the character of Desert Eagle plays a similar role to Tsui Hark's monk in THE BLADE - to make fun of the idea that a swordsman's life is all glamour.  HK action fans will be severely disappointed if they're expecting wirework and long complicated battle choreographry. The action here is swift and decisive, an age of waiting in fear then a swift strike in a flurry of close up cuts, then we see who's still standing at the end. It's quite effective in its own way though.<br><br>SWORDSMAN IN DOUBLE FLAG TOWN is a well crafted and engaging film, with a wonderful aesthetic. Well worth watching, as long as you remember that not every film with \"SWORDSMAN\" in the title is going to be like the Tsui Hark/Ching Siu Tung series of that name :-)","user":"devil.plaything","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Captivating tale","rating":10,"date":"4 August 2002","review":"This film from mainland China tells of the story of a young boy and his journey.  This one had me so caught up me from beginning to end.<br><br>The main theme here is appearances.  Life in life, not everything is as it seems.  The main character Hai Ge goes through a metamorphosis.  He seems nervous and unsure about himself, but there's something brave and determined about him that makes him very likeable.  As a son of a renowned swordsman, he is quickly dismissed by the townspoeple due to his young age and inexperience.  As the story progresses, viewpoints change (as well as my own) and I kept wondering what was going to happen next.  Director Ping He's use of pacing creates suspense in the movie and shows you don't haveto rely on gratuitous violence to make a film enjoyable.<br><br>The story is simple, but effectively told.  The characters are memorable from Hai Ge, the barkeeper, his daughter, and the Lethal Swordsman who gives a great performance and was a great villain (watch that lethal stroke!). The finale is well done and is not necessarily your typical 'happy' ending. Another reason why I liked it.","user":"InzyWimzy","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Initially bleak, then engaging","rating":8,"date":"17 March 2008","review":"Spoiler warning - the last paragraph of this review more or less tells you the denouement of the movie. I do not think that so surprising but you may not wish to read it. I have seen this movie two or three times with no loss of satisfaction for knowing its end, and I give no detail at all.<br><br>Note that some of the character names I use are different from those of other reviewers, a function of different sub-titling or my own ignorance of the original language.<br><br>Spending much of its time as a spare, bleak story about struggles for survival this movie turns out to be marvellously rewarding. The basic warrior-emerging story is set in a poor, dry stone town in a desert dominated by by the killer \"One-blow\", so known because he kills at the first strike and is deemed invincible. One-blow and his followers exploit the local town for food, drink and apparently for women while acting mercilessly toward those who cross them.<br><br>Into this scenario comes the young slightly built Haige, wearing two swords by his side and a great reluctance to use them. This reluctance does not seem to arise out of noble sentiments (although he is certainly a good if naive man) but rather that he lacks self-knowledge or a sound ability to judge other people. Evidently, he has never used his swords in anger. Early, he encounters the reputation of One-blow and in person another apparently strong swordsman, Sandman.<br><br>Only gradually does the character and background of Haige emerge, it becoming clear that his father was a great swordsman but a gambler. It is soon apparent that Haige may have the better character than his father but how good was his teacher and how well has he learned?<br><br>The views of his intended woman and her father gradually change. After first treating him like dirt they see glimpses of his potential. There are also passages of youthful freedom and delight in the desert scenes with horses.<br><br>Even the brutal One-blow is given a touch of human frailty when he wonders about the potential of the unknown swordsman. It is the gradual change in people's views, sometimes based on sharp events, that help to give the movie its interest.<br><br>While the tension and resolution of the necessary confrontation are classically good, if somewhat brutal in the build-up, it is the way in which Haige finally handles Sandman that shows his new maturity, his coming-of-age as a man as well as a swordsman.","user":"dv-39","rank":[1,1]}]
