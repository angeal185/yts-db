[{"title":"Thoroughly well-executed small-budget horror","rating":8,"date":"20 May 2017","review":"Seeing this with very low expectations, I was first waiting it to fall on its face but soon realised the writing, acting and direction was all sure-footed and I'd even say innovative. On the outset, Annette O'Toole and Clark Freeman make an unlikely mother-son couple but they sold their roles and even made me emotional at times.<br><br>The budget is indeed tiny, but it didn't take anything away from the solid creepiness. Build-up was executed well, and the story moved nicely from almost comedy to genuine scares. Even at the end this little horror surprise stood its ground and avoided the usual sour taste that most films in its genre leave behind.","user":"scandinavianmail","rank":[25,28]},{"title":"It seems We Go On is not a popular movie, but I love this movie.","rating":8,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"I like horror movies, which mostly are about exorcism, possession, haunted house, witchcraft, etc. But this one is different, it's a new theme to me. <br><br>The movie is creepy without the need of many dark scenes. \nNo too long slow cautious walk, no boring conversation and almost no hysterical screaming.<br><br>The (main) actor, when he is scared - his acting is so \"real\" and sometimes funny. I like the closeness between mother and son, and by the way, the mother's acting remind me Meryl Streep.<br><br>Maybe We Go On is not for a jump-scare horror movies fans, but if you like something new and original creepy movies, I think We Go On will suits you well.<br><br>I'm happy wasting my 80 minutes to watch this movie. It's fresh, light, creepy, lovely, great acting, and funny too. Two thumbs up. 8/10.","user":"reko-716-854614","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"What a great script!","rating":9,"date":"10 June 2017","review":"Let's start by telling the truth, which can be a rarity these days.<br><br>Horror as a genre is not a popular as it once was.<br><br>The psychologists and sociologists have an explanation for this.<br><br>First, the avalanche of social media and e-news has created a culture where it is hip and cool to be unafraid. This is the \"whatever!\" generation.<br><br>Secondly, horror has always been a mechanism for us to vicariously experience something we do not get in real life. Problem is, the modern world is so crazy, now we are getting all the horror we can handle without having to pay for a movie ticket.<br><br>So, the entire horror niche has become an inbred community that generally makes weak product for the other members of the community to rave about.<br><br>This is a rare exception.<br><br>One of the best scripts ... ever. Deft direction, and great performances.<br><br>The clever, unusual, story grabs you off the top and builds and builds.<br><br>Highly recommended.","user":"paradux","rank":[19,24]}]
