[{"title":"Wow, I was expecting bad, and found a gem","rating":10,"date":"14 May 2015","review":"This is one of the better D&amp;D style movies i've watched, and I watch them all.<br><br>The special effect are sub par, so a lot of youngish viewers are going to crucify this gem. Acting B, costume B+, Plot B, Storyline B+, special effects C (good stuff on the mage/witch though), dialogue C +, direction A-, music B+, sword fight scenes D, homegrown magic scenes B+.<br><br>After watching this I had my wife watch it, and she liked it quite a bit, and thats no mean feat for a fantasy. <br><br>I was particularly impressed with how the character development was done with out viewer knowledge. Since I am now middle age, I've had a bellyful of special effects and movie glitter, I look for overall quality, I don't need state of the art effects if the rest is good, i actually kind of enjoy it.<br><br>Since I am familiar with the whole D&amp;D thing, although I don't role play anymore since a stint in high school, I was impressed on how the movie adhered to that universe, pretty impressive feat overall.<br><br>I suppose the fight scenes could use more realistic choreograph in terms of sword stuff, but the gritty down to earth magic stuff compensated for it<br><br>The costumes and magic are more real then I am used to seeing in these style movies. Clothing was kind of disheveled and soily, magic was earthy, desperate and hurried--<br><br>overall this movie was a real treat","user":"the_doofy","rank":[47,55]},{"title":"Much, much better than expected","rating":7,"date":"15 August 2015","review":"You watch a movie on the SyFy channel, entitled \"Mythica: A Quest for Heroes\" and your expectations aren't set high. Released this year, and you think \"uh-huh\". However, Mythica, is a surprising treat.<br><br>The opening, pre-credit scene, with clunky cgi leads you to lump what's to come in with the majority of SyFy's home-grown output, but pretty soon you release this is much better.<br><br>The plot is decent enough, the script is good, and the actors give a good show, especially the female lead, in a strong, interesting role.<br><br>We're in low-budget territory, but the \"flash-back/forward\" scenes are nicely done, and it's only the larger 'monsters' that suffer from the lack of budget. Fight scenes are so-so, but there's a decent depth to the characters, and the story. It's pleasant, and up-lifting ... just because it's low-budget, they haven't scrimped on the script, and it's nice to see a fantasy tale handled seriously by all concerned.<br><br>The first part in three films, it stands fine by itself, whilst leading into the larger story. Some characters are a little thin, but this is 'D&amp;D' territory, so there's a typical collection of characters to expect.<br><br>This isn't a Hollywood blockbuster, but for what it is, it does very well. I'd rather watch a movie trying to be something, than one which just pads time, without any originality. Mythica is a good, entertaining watch. Let's hope the sequels live up to this good opening.<br><br>Well done to all involved.","user":"mfcoder-imdb","rank":[24,30]},{"title":"Nice Indie Fantasy and two more parts to come.","rating":7,"date":"23 January 2015","review":"With Mythica 1-3 Arrowstorm is going for adventures in a complete new world. Of course this is still a low-budget independent movie but the quality is increasing constantly. This is also possible since more and more money is collected from Kickstarter. Therefore the costumes and settings are already quite good, and I like the landscape. The effects are \"ok\" but could be better: Some spiders and the snake e.g. look really cheap, and the ogre has some good and some bad scenes. And by the way: The wolf was borrowed from Survivor to save some money ... but why not. The story is not new but not that bad. I like the idea of having the young disabled magician Marek running the gang, while she is exploring her dark side and her necromancy. Melanie Stone does a great job and dominates most of the movie. Marek is cute, but Nicola Posener with red hair as Teela looks gorgeous. Independent fantasy and those ladies are worth 7/10.","user":"sven-49-694776","rank":[22,35]}]
