[{"title":"Worth watching it","rating":7,"date":"9 May 2018","review":"After reading a couple of reviews and being surprised by some negative ones and by the accusation of the good ones being paid, I decided to post my first one. Nobody is paying me to do this. I just watched the movie and the result is beyond my expectations. I'm giving it a 7, from a realistic point of view. If I take into account the budget, I should give it higher valuation.<br><br>My favourite movies are time traveling sci-fi movies and I believe this one is worth watching it. It's new, from all point of views, and is not a story we have already seen. At least not me.<br><br>Some dialogues could be better, yes. Increase your budget and hire Tarantino to write them. They are just normal, not ridiculous. And I have seen many movies, much more expensive and advertised than this one, that were absolutely ridiculous and not worth my time. It's not the case now.<br><br>Some other reviews talk about flaws... I haven't seen them. At least not important ones. Actually, any time travelling movie has more flaws or paradoxes than this one as here there is no time travelling, just the fact that time slows down at a very specific location. Taking this into account, everything makes sense.<br><br>To make a comparison. I recently watched 12 monkeys and I can say that, of course, there is better acting there but the plot is much more predictable from the begining. And I will not dare to criticize the actors from this movie. I have seen much worse acting, even from very well known actors.","user":"drodriguez-03954","rank":[258,375]},{"title":"See? Low-budget movies CAN be great.","rating":9,"date":"30 April 2018","review":"While not going into a lot of unnecessary detail, I, somewhat forcibly, have a lot of free time on my hands and not a lot of options about what to do with it. I know, sounds like fun. It isn't.<br><br>So I watch a lot of movies. Since great movies are fairly few, I end up watching a lot of trashy movies whether I like it or not. Low budgets, low-quality special-effects, low quality acting and etc. are a daily diet for me. I'm an expert on films where someone said, \"Hey! Let's make a movie in the barn!\"<br><br>TIME TRAP is a real rarity. While not a summer blockbuster or awards night darling, it somehow manages to be both cheap'n'cheesy and a really good, entertaining movie. It's proof that just because you have to make a movie with your allowance money doesn't mean the resulting flick has to be unwatchable.<br><br>Perforce, the plot is very simple. If you think about it, nature is full of surprisingly large-scale booby-traps. As examples: the La Brea tar pits have trapped countless thousands of animals for literally tens of thousands of years (and even one human girl). Whole valleys located near volcanically active areas have seen entire populations of animals wiped out by escaping poison fumes. Even whole large-scale dinosaur nesting sites, complete with nesting dinosaurs and eggs, have been wiped out en masse by some natural disaster or other. Sinkholes and caves with vertical walls have been treasure troves of ancient animal skeletons trapped over thousands of years.<br><br>And so on.<br><br>Similarly, in TIME TRAP, we have a cave system that, for some unexplained reason, has varying levels of time \"bubbles\" within which time is operating on different scales relative to the larger, outside world. Anyone venturing within the cave system becomes \"trapped\" in the sense that while they are inside the cave system they are like bugs trapped in amber, effectively frozen in time while the outside world races ahead in \"normal\" timescale. Technically, people CAN leave, but if they've been within the cave system for any length of time beyond a minute or so, the outside world will have changed beyond recognition when they return to it.<br><br>Many of the situations that you might imagine given such a plot description properly play out in the movie. Characters standing outside any time bubble (or within a \"faster\" time bubble) view other characters standing in other bubbles as either frozen statues or vanishing in an instant. Moving from one bubble to the next, characters who were looking like statues suddenly start moving. Throwing an object from one bubble to another sees that object suddenly freeze in midair. Standing inside a time bubble and looking out upon the outside world one sees the sun flashing by in streaks, very similar to what one sees in any time machine movie.<br><br>Fascinatingly, again like bugs caught in amber, over the eons, humans from different eras and different levels of evolution have become \"trapped\" within the system. The characters which represent the protagonists in the movie encounter everything from cavemen to people from the future. There's one particular scene which depicts an ongoing free-for-all brawl occurring within an especially slow-moving time bubble featuring and including people from many different eras. Wonderfully imaginative.<br><br>There are a few relative-time errors within the movie that the viewer has to turn a blind eye to in the name of poetic license. TIME TRAP is somewhat careful in laying out the speed of the time differential between the outside world and the main bubble that our protagonists are trapped within and then clearly violates those time relationships in order to play out some poignant scenes between some of the characters that know each other. Oh, well. Wink wink nudge nudge, give the makers a break. Considering how well they did with the rest of the picture, made with $1.95, I choose to let this one go. Most movies with these sorts of resource origins have too many screw-ups to count. All things considered, TIME TRAP does a pretty nice job with its premise.<br><br>I gave this movie a 9/10 which some people might interpret as my claiming that it's on a par with RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK or something, which is not my intent. I simply feel that a low-end movie that rises so far above its station should be well rewarded. TIME TRAP is what it is, and judged relative to the other movies in the bargain bin it comes from, it is a sort of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK of the stand next to the checkout counter.","user":"S_Soma","rank":[210,328]},{"title":"Much more interesting and thought provoking than expected","rating":8,"date":"14 August 2018","review":"If you like the idea of time relativity and enjoy adventure Sifi movies give this one a watch. It's not a high budget Hollywood affair however the makers and actors have really done very well. After watching the trailer I figured I had it worked out, however there are some small twists that expand and hold your attention. All in all, for a teens and 20s mostly cast they did well and the production value was on par for higher budget films. It's obvious The screen write and directing had heart and this film really does show that less is more. Unlike some big blockbuster films with too many hands in the mix. Enjoy","user":"ryanbernard-45756","rank":[174,278]}]
