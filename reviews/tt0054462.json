[{"title":"Buzz off, you uncanny ladybug!","rating":6,"date":"28 August 2006","review":"Like none of his other late 50's/early 60's horror &amp; Sci-Fi tryouts (and there were quite a lot of them), \"The Wasp Woman\" truly proves that Roger Corman was, and still is, a very creative and versatile filmmaker! The plot of his ultra-low budget quickie is mundane and unbelievably predictable, yet the whole film is stuffed with ingenious little twists and elements that make the premise feel fresh and original nevertheless! There are very few directors out there, apart from Corman, able to achieve this! Susan Cabot, who starred in a handful of contemporary Corman productions, plays a businesswoman leading a prominent cosmetics company. She's unable to accept her own natural ageing process and righteously fears that her looks will bring down the monthly profits. When a scientist announces that he developed a rejuvenation liquid by extracting enzymes of ordinary wasps, Janice Starling immediately wants to commercialize it and test it on herself. The miraculous discovery is highly efficient, but when Janice injects herself with too much doses, she transforms into a murderous wasp overnight. \"The Wasp Woman\" is no more or no less than fun &amp; undemanding Sci-Fi entertainment! The film has a good pace and there's the occasional suspenseful moment to enjoy. The monster-transformations and special effects are really tacky but what else did you expect considering the money that was involved? This charming little movie may not be very appealing to the younger generation of fans, but I warmly recommend it to admirers of classic science fiction. The rating here on IMDb is WAY too low!","user":"Coventry","rank":[52,60]},{"title":"Good stuff from Roger Corman","rating":6,"date":"19 January 2003","review":"THE WASP WOMAN is certainly not a film to be taken very seriously as it details the hideous and unexpected transformation of a woman looking for the fountain of youth into a rather nasty flesh-eating monster instead...an unforeseen side effect of Dr. Zinthrop's wasp enzyme treatments. The common be wary of science theme is certainly in full force here and it does feel comfortable in this low budget environment.<br><br>The best thing about this film is it has a great pace as it keeps moving along nicely and is consistently entertaining. The worst is the low budget look of the monster and the awful music.","user":"Space_Mafune","rank":[39,45]},{"title":"Classic R. Corman with unique Ms. Cabot!","rating":6,"date":"8 August 2004","review":"One of Roger Corman's better directorial efforts about reversing the aging process to sell cosmetics in the early 60's!  Susan Cabot, the lead, finished her film career with this one before returning to the theatre in New York after many films in the 50's.  Unfortunately, she was bludgeoned to death by her dwarf son sometime in the 80's which ended her promising career.  She was a serious actress with a terrible final act.<br><br>A definite 6 out of 10.  Best performance = Susan Cabot.  Worst performance = Anthony (Fred) Eisley - the \"actor\" who always managed to reach the pinnacle of Blandness in every film he made in the 60's.  Dr. Zin in his spotted pajamas reminds me of someone's Uncle Luigi.  An under-rated low budget flick which hits a nerve (cosmetics, pshaw).  This is on DVD.  Seek it out!","user":"shepardjessica","rank":[34,39]}]
