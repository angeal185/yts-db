[{"title":"Only good for the Pep","rating":3,"date":"8 December 2019","review":"I love the cheesy Hallmark movies. This isn't that kind of quality. I felt like it was some low budget film school project, and after reading the other reviews it sounds like that is exactly what it was. The only redeeming part of this entire film is Pep. She was great. I gave her 10 stars and everything else dragged down my ratings.","user":"direwolf-17986","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Real honest to goodness Christmas movie","rating":7,"date":"3 November 2019","review":"Ticks all the boxes for a real feel good Christmas movie. The start had me worried but give it 10 mins and you really start to enjoy it. Good characters. Bad guys. Good guys. Happy ending and a good romance All wrapped up in Christmas paper. Def one to watch again.","user":"gailmoir","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"Hard to watch!","rating":3,"date":"13 November 2019","review":"The storyline is problematic, but the characters and the actors are the bigger issues. The main storyline hinges on an arranged marriage for Santa's teenage daughter, a plot device that is outdated. The main characters are completely unlikeable and poorly acted. It's hard to have much empathy for any of them. I finished this movie because I was watching it with my son. It qualifies as a family friendly Christmas movie so it gets a few stars.","user":"jennifercfaith","rank":[12,17]}]
