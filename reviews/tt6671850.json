[{"title":"Mostly Drivel","rating":2,"date":"1 May 2019","review":"A very predictable and dull movie where every character is very unlikable, shallow and generally idiotic. Accordingly I had no interest in the well-being of any of them and watched the story plod through to its dreary end. Dozens of silly old cliches - including the ancient one where two characters grapple - with one of them holding a gun, it \"somehow\" gets fired, they freeze instantly (like inexperienced actors and directors believe gunshot victims always do) and we wait to see which of them has been shot. The whole story is this unimaginative and unrealistic.And identically, ANYONE who gets shot in the this trashy movie freezes in shocked silence.<br><br>The frequent, gratuitous, deep bass sounds inserted for atmosphere are ridiculously amateurish.<br><br>I regret wasting my time on this move, giving it a rating of 2, which means I watched it to the end and despised it. (1 is reserved for garbage that I stop watching before it ends).","user":"mrvanin","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"Alot Better Than IMDb 4.1 Stars - About A 6 Or 7 Star Movie? - Definately Worth Watching","rating":7,"date":"3 May 2019","review":"05/02/2019 Not a bad movie.

Well edited &amp; fast paced no wasted scenes or pointless time fillers. Great revenge storyline just the type of British flick I like! Should definitely be higher rated. Enjoyable and well worth the view!","user":"Gazzaman12","rank":[8,15]}]
