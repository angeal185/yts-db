[{"title":"An introspective and revelatory journey","rating":10,"date":"10 April 2016","review":"This film tells the story of a young writer who wrote a book about his troubled relationship with his father, and the abuse he had to endure over the years. The sudden appearance of his father in the book launch party raises doubts on his claims in the book.<br><br>The story is good because it draws viewers in to both sides of the coin. Initially I am so convinced that Stephen is the victim, yet as the story unfolds we get to know how things may not be as it seems. The revelation that memories can be distorted, but we never question our own memories is quite a strong argument, and many of us can relate to that. It is an introspective and revelatory journey for Stephen, but I can relate to it as well.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[22,28]},{"title":"Thought provoking film about personal narrative","rating":8,"date":"3 April 2016","review":"The film is about personal perspective and how far we can delude ourselves about who we are and the events which created us. For such a tricky topic, I thought they did an excellent job. The catalysts and personal revelations were believable, and I found the pacing exactly right for this type of film.<br><br>With each scene, the film both offers us information about the characters and invites us to question what we've been told. Finely nuanced contradictions kept me fascinated, waiting for explanations. When answers were presented, they were satisfying but also left me with the understanding that the story was far more complex than we could ever know, that truth was still and would always be subjective, and that the question of who are the villains and who are the victims could only be answered: \"All of us.\"<br><br>I don't know that it will appeal to everyone, but if you're a fan of psychological dramas (not thriller, just drama), you will likely enjoy this as much as I did.<br><br>Beware of the resulting soul-searching you might experience about who are the heroes and monsters in your own life story.","user":"kay_rock","rank":[23,34]},{"title":"Ah, the tricks our minds can play to protect us....","rating":6,"date":"16 April 2016","review":"This movie is journey about coming to terms with who you are and how you became that person. <br><br>The enigmatic Franco plays a deeply troubled writer who is trying to come to terms with his traumatic past and the heartbreakingly tumultuous relationship he had with his father. Along the way, he meets the beautiful Amber Heard. This is why I did not give the movie more stars. If it was the writers intent to portray her as damaged as he was, it was an epic fail. She came across as strong and self-assured -almost cocky at times - not what you would expect from someone reeling from childhood trauma. It was no fault of Heard's - her character was just badly written. Ed Harris rocks the screen, as usual, as the domineering father who haunts his dreams and creates the clouds of his past that he can't see through.<br><br>The mind is amazing - we can do all sorts of things to protect ourselves. The ability to alter our memories is only one tool of many. This one is worth your time.","user":"wildsparrow16","rank":[13,18]}]
