[{"title":"The best bike movie I've ever seen","rating":8,"date":"15 July 2017","review":"Beautiful pictures and locations, great riders, powerful music. Do you need more? I don't. The scenario is not the best, but seriously... I did not expect any. I like short comedy scenes between action. Maybe there are not very funny bit I laughed once or twice. I think I will start watching more movies like this. I would love to find another gem.","user":"admxswn","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"People bored from work and life find their peace biking","rating":8,"date":"5 August 2017","review":"It isn't just a movie for bikers and it also isn't a movie to take popcorn to, it's very new. It is a chance to break free from your boredom. You'll definitely find yourself relate to one of the protagonists and how they break free. The amazing cinematography actually makes you live those moments. Plus the soundtrack selection intensifies it further. P.S.-It's not a dialogue movie, it's a live in experience.","user":"roxx-anish","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Some what cheesy but amazing riding.","rating":8,"date":"21 April 2017","review":"The overall storyline is cheesy but does a good job tying the various segments together. The music is great and the film flows nicely from one interesting adventure to another.<br><br>If you're a fan of the great flick Where the Trail Ends by redbull films this is a must see. Amazing group of riders and some of the most beautiful and amazing shots I've ever seen. Well worth a watch.","user":"King_Kinq","rank":[0,0]}]
