[{"title":"Die-hard Robert Patrick Fans only","rating":5,"date":"5 October 2003","review":"I'm barely ten minutes into this movie when I start thinking, \"This is one of those movies where some naive bulb (Patrick) shacks up with the wrong person (Esposito) and gets burned in the process\". Well after twenty minutes that's definitely the road this movie was heading down with Patrick playing the everyday joe who's fearful of being a failure and the sexy ex-con Esposito who tries to twist him around her little finger to fulfill her plans.<br><br>Patrick and Esposito's chemistry works fine enough and the film features a couple of funny bits, but the story gets pretty convoluted as it reaches into the third act and by the end it has only gotten worse. So when it's all said and done, Backflash has played out like any number of typical straight to video quickies. There's adequate atmosphere and it features some recognizable faces in the supporting cast, but there's little freshness in the story department. As a movie on it's own merits, it's average, but Robert Patrick fans will probably want to check it out.","user":"refinedsugar","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"REALLY LIKED IT,DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING","rating":7,"date":"25 June 2003","review":"This really is a nice little movie,definitely worth watching!<br><br>The entire movie plays in a desert environment,really an alien looking place to one who lives in Belgium,like me... It's filled with strange people ,the cameraman did an outstanding job of shooting atmospheric images and the music too adds a lot to the atmosphere... See the other reviews to learn more about the content of this movie.<br><br>It last only for about 87 minutes but is definitely a time well spend!","user":"spanky6666","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"Lacking juice","rating":4,"date":"4 April 2004","review":"For a low-budget movie, BACKFLASH looks pretty good. The cinematography is crisp and bright, and while some scenes look a little sparse at times, it never looks really cheap. The problem instead is with the screenplay. It plays like a first draft - scenes go by v-e-r-y slowly, when the story should play out quicker and tighter. There's no spark, and that includes the various twists and turns - you'll most likely have seen most of them before, so they aren't a surprise. The movie tries to jerk us around more near the end, but the twists in this part aren't believable and/or just lead to plot holes. And while Robert Patrick isn't a bad actor, he's wrong for a role that more belongs to someone who can convincingly play a little dim and not totally sure of things. And sadly, Michael J. Pollard is wasted in a role that just gives him two minutes of screen time at most.","user":"Wizard-8","rank":[10,14]}]
