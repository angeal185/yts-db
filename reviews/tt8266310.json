[{"title":"Blinded by the Light (2019)","rating":8,"date":"17 August 2019","review":"I absolutely love the music of Bruce Springsteen. When I got into his music a few years back, I instantly became enamored with his albums namely Darkness on the Edge of Town. When I saw the trailer for this, I was instantly hyped. This looked a bit like Danny Boyle's Yesterday. A film about a talented brown guy who uses a classic rock act to better his life and land a beautiful girl. I was always going to like this but I felt an identification with the character and the music as an inspiration and the idea of chasing what you believe in.<br><br>The film is about a young Pakistani high school kid who has to deal with racism and the pressures of his traditional family, in 1980's Luton, England. A friend of his introduces him to the music of Bruce Springsteen, and he quickly becomes influenced in all facets by the music of the Boss. Relating to the words of Springsteen, he uses this as fuel to get the girl he likes, chase his dreams of becoming a writer, and butting heads with his family namely his strict and overbearing traditional father.<br><br>Great acting all around, with a very impressive debut by Viveik Kalra. Nell Williams is beyond gorgeous. The music and use of songs in this music is fantastic. Couldn't help but sing along. Its true what they say, Bruce made songs that related to the working class and the struggles that people faced at work and in life. With all its profound lyrics as a backdrop, the film manages to touch on important issues of xenophobia (which are still present today) and the struggles that can come with familial expectations not lining up with ones own goals.<br><br>As a brown male myself who works on developing his skills and chasing a better life, I identified with a lot of this film. Heck, I even travel to Luton and Bury Park every year on vacation. So, I really felt this film. I'm all for breaking out and chasing happiness and bettering yourself in life. Therefore, I found this to be a real and identifiable film. I think if you like the work of Springsteen and the influence he has as an artist, then this will resonate very well for you. I recommend a watch for everyone though.<br><br>8/10","user":"rockman182","rank":[65,80]},{"title":"It's absolutely fine","rating":6,"date":"9 July 2019","review":"I just saw this in a Cineworld Unlimited screening and, other than having seen the trailer and thought it looked ok, knew very little of Blinded By The Light. Immediately a few people got up and walked out. Ten minutes in a couple more joined them. Others waited an hour, then popped off. Some of these people - though not necessarily in the same screening as me - have added their 1-star review to IMDb. These people should have their Unlimited cards confiscated and be barred from cinemas and writing reviews permanently. Sure, it's not a perfect film - Springsteen is shoehorned in a cringeworthy number of times and the narrative has a paint-by-numbers feel to it - but it's a cheerful film with a good message: do what makes you happy and don't be a douche. Those giving the 1-star reviews really did miss the second part of the message.\nLook, it's an ok film. If you like Bend It Like Beckham, you'll probably enjoy this. Of you're a massive 'The Boss' fan, you'll probably enjoy this. Don't trust the 1-star reviews; it's never a 1-star film. I'd probably really rate this 5 stars, but I'm adding one just to counter a couple of those walk-outs who feel justified in tarring a film with their own ineptitude.","user":"jamescraiguk","rank":[117,155]},{"title":"Heartwarming and funny!","rating":9,"date":"9 July 2019","review":"Blinded by the Light is just brilliant! It's so heartwarming, heartbreaking and funny all at the same time! I laughed, cried and really tried hard to not sing along! Sure, it's corny in parts but it adds to the magic of it. It's never gonna win an Oscar, but it's a deffo feel-good movie that will literally have you smiling from ear to ear!","user":"daxxafreeman","rank":[81,107]}]
