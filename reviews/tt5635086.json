[{"title":"Men In Love","rating":10,"date":"24 February 2018","review":"What a wonderful and unusual experience, to see a film without knowing anything about it. Before I knew it I was in Yorkshire. The silence was deafening, emotions unspoken. Then, Josh O'Connor - a miraculous actor - I didn't know who the actor was and that helped enormously to get sucked into his world - exterior and interior - and to live his experience fully. Alec Secareanu produces the perfect emotional blow. Roughness and tenderness in a stunning, totally believable performance that, I know will live in my mind forever. They changed me somehow. I was forced to look at something in a different way, without preconceptions. Gemma Jones and Ian Hart. complete this masterpiece that I intend to see again tonight with a group of friends who, like me, don't know the first thing about the film, other that I loved it. Francis Lee I'm joining the chorus with a heartfelt, thank you.","user":"alanbenfieldjr","rank":[179,207]},{"title":"The level of intimacy between the characters is unlike anything I have seen before","rating":10,"date":"17 January 2018","review":"Absolutely stunning film that is now right up there among my all-time favourites. It's sensual and romantic; and raw and ugly at the same time which is actually quite an accomplishment. The partnership between O'Connor and Secareanu is incredibly effective; the magnificent Ian Hart made me cry and Gemma Jones is amazing as well. Along with a breathttaking scenery and the haunting melodies of A Winged Victory for the Sullen, it's truly a film to remember and cherish.","user":"aecceity","rank":[124,151]},{"title":"A Powerful Must See","rating":10,"date":"16 July 2017","review":"After seeing this at the Galway Film Fleadh, I can honestly say that this film is a beautiful standout that deserves more than to be called the \"British Brokeback Mountain\". While the comparisons between the two films were inevitable, God's Own Country offers different things than Ang Lee's classic. It speaks to more current issues of gay young men in a modern rural area, masterfully incorporating themes of identity issues, immigrant problems, and familial expectations. It's not a remake of the classic, it's an advancement of the genre that Brokeback Mountain helped define. <br><br>The most dazzling part of this film is the two young leads, Josh and Alec. It has been many, many years since I have seen a film where two individuals had as much chemistry between them, and the work that Josh and Alec put in to their character leaves the audience deeply and emotionally connected to both characters throughout the entirety of the movie. I could feel the lust between the two when they were on stage, and the heartbreak that happens when a fight occurs. The emotional performances by the two leads make the great movie even better. <br><br>Props must also be given to Francis Lee-- as a first time director, this is not the movie we in the audience were expecting. It was as masterful, as poignant, and as beautiful as any established director could have done. It was an honor to watch this film, and I cannot wait to follow the career of the director-- after what he did here, I know much more greatness is on the way. <br><br>I have not stopped thinking about this film for 3 days after I saw it. It won't leave me for a long time, because there is so much to thing about and so much to celebrate. I cannot wait to see it again, and I encourage you to see it as soon as you possibly can- - this is what independent cinema can look like when done masterfully!","user":"k_buck4","rank":[127,155]}]
