[{"title":"cool fun film","rating":8,"date":"7 February 2010","review":"I really Enjoyed this film, and it was full of some suspense. Its a rather different film for sure. Other reviewers do not like how its unbelevable, but have they worked in such a place for any period of time, are they art lovers themselves? are they ever captivated by anything in life. I think this shows very well the obsessive nature of people. Anything can take a persons fancy, and become an obsession, a piece of sting, how mundane it is to some, could be someones obsession, and they could know all manner of things about it.<br><br>so in that respect this film touches on a good subject, has fun moments, and is not made to be a serious film, its a fun film, just i think people need to relax more and learn to just enjoy it.","user":"dexteruk","rank":[47,56]},{"title":"Better than Average Straight to DVD should have had theatrical release","rating":7,"date":"29 January 2010","review":"Maiden Heist (2008) The Maiden Heist quickly sold out at its opening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. It's a light-hearted caper that makes for undemanding viewing. It is a fairly entertaining comedy heist film starring Morgan Freeman, William Macy, and Christopher Walken. Plot. Great art has its protectors every day in the major museums. Three guards are more than dedicated to the job they do. Their museum brings in modern work that has no appeal to the guards, and the museum authorities plan to sell the classic pieces, sending them elsewhere in the world. When Roger (Christopher Walken) and George (William H. Macy) and Charles (Morgan Freeman) find their long-beloved work transplanted to Europe, they not only miss their favorite art pieces, but they make plans to steal the works with which they have become obsessed. Roger becomes the mastermind of an inside plot to perform the biggest art heist in the history of their museum. First each must obtain a forgery; then, they have to smuggle the forgeries into the museum and find a way to make the switches. The heist is complicated by Roger's intrusive wife - he's promised her a trip to Florida for their anniversary - and George's proclivity for taking his clothes off when standing in front of the warrior statue he loves. THE MAIDEN HEIST was originally going to have a theatrical release, but the bankruptcy of the Yari Film Group put the film in a direct to DVD status. It feels like a 70s movie that Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon would have done, where slightly nutty characters would made the film but that's not the case anymore. This is a comedy that might make Woody Allen fans recall (affectionately) Small Time Crooks, even though this film is very different to Allen's caper. The Maiden Heist isn't another turkey unceremoniously dumped to Netflix. It's an above average straight-to-DVD effort, it is weaker than one might expect considering its power stars in the cast . It's really quite an entertaining comedy though more could have been done but I like it OK as it was. Not a great film but not a bad film 3 stars.","user":"dfwforeignbuff","rank":[35,43]},{"title":"A fun little movie","rating":6,"date":"3 August 2010","review":"That could. Not because of the story so much, but more because of the actors that are in it. And is it a bad thing, that this movie works mainly because of the three main actors? Don't be fooled by the mention of Breckin Meyers though, he doesn't have a big role in this (just in case you're a fan of his).<br><br>No this movie belongs to the \"big three\". Mainly to Christopher Walken, because he is the lead. But everyone else gets his time and they are really great. They have funny scenes and the movie roles along quite nicely. Maybe if it had a better script, a greater antagonist (there really isn't one), it could have been better. But it is a nice watch and a good film.","user":"kosmasp","rank":[24,30]}]
