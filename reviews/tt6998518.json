[{"title":"Really Really not for everyone but...","rating":7,"date":"20 March 2019","review":"Ok so I first watched this not sure what it was about but I was hopeful of some good old meme quality Nic Cage Rage scenes at the very least. After it finished I sat there thinking WTF and I had to go make a cup of tea and seriously think about some of my life decisions.<br><br>Once that was done I came on imdb to find out more about the film and to frankly rant a little. After spending a good half hour reading a lot of very mixed reviews I decided to leave it and watch the film again another day. Which I just have.<br><br>It's not my cup of tea. I think the majority of people will hate this film purely because it's not what they are used too, and they just don't get it. Yes ok sympathise with the haters the film is a very simple revenge plot, there's not much dialogue, it's filmed mostly in red and it can drag on in places and many will turn it off before it gets half way.... Which is a shame as this film left me with a similar 'wtf did I just watch' feeling that reminds me of the first time I watched 'Eraserhead.'<br><br>'Mandy' is very much an arthouse film with a dose of 80's grindhouse thrown in and if that's the kinda film you like you will love this film. Nic Cage is brilliant in it, and yes he has those rage moments, the violence is swift and brutal, there's even a chainsaw fight. It's surreal, the atmosphere and music blends perfectly with the madness and drug induced hysteria and anger the film is trying to portray in its own arthouse style and I genuinely think this will turn out to be a cult classic.<br><br>So yep, not for everyone, but at least try and appreciate it for what it is. 8/10.","user":"zahrim_uk","rank":[99,123]},{"title":"David Lynch meets Hellraiser meets Rob Zombie","rating":7,"date":"19 November 2018","review":"Just a brief review here summed up in two words...Absolutely Mental.","user":"shamilton-70796","rank":[164,238]},{"title":"Something unique","rating":9,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"This really is not for everyone and that is just fine.\nAlso story wasnt anything new or special, just typical revenge story.\nReally liked how this looked, sounded and felt.\nVisuals and colours are just outstanding and that was something that hooked me from the start, really trippy stuff in a good way.\nMusic and sounds were pushing this dark overall sinister feel and worked perfectly.\nAnd also Nick have us great performance near insanity.","user":"mts-564-429762","rank":[319,487]}]
