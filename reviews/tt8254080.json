[{"title":"Failed to connect","rating":5,"date":"8 October 2019","review":"I watched this movie with English subtitles. After seeing the trailer I was hoping it would be as touching as the 1994 movie \"Surviving the Game\" with Gary Busey in it, which I loved. The story was a little different but same sort of scenario in which people are hunted as sport for money.<br><br>I believe it could have worked with a much higher budget but would still generate a mild response from the majority of viewers. Several of the actors let it down, especially the main villain.<br><br>The ending was a bit of a let down and made me think of stirring spaghetti bolognese where I was trying to keep up with the focus of the story and who was dying. I guess reading subtitles takes away from appreciating it a bit too. Not being a real fan of martial arts I would have to say didn't help my rating.<br><br>I see this movie generating a more positive response from young viewers.","user":"JakubBednar","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Move on...nothing to see here.","rating":2,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"This has a pretty low-budget feel to it, but that isn't the problem. It just has no originality to the writing and no performances which raise it from bargain-bin level. Trust me and just give it a body-swerve.","user":"gjcannon","rank":[0,0]}]
