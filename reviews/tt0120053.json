[{"title":"A guilty pleasure","rating":20,"date":"20 March 2004","review":"I love this movie.  As a movie buff, I must admit, objectively, this is a bad movie.  The writing is ridiculous, the plot is convoluted, and Val Kilmer's accents are bizarre.  But I love this movie.  It is that wonderful combination of danger and romance that makes for great fantasy.  The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue holds this movie together.  It is a delight to watch them realize that their skin deep attraction goes much deeper.  If you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the ride, the Saint is a fun movie.  Despite its flaws, the Saint is a guilty pleasure to indulge in when your own life is lacking in explosions, gun fights, and sudden, passionate romances.","user":"Crewgrrl20","rank":[157,176]},{"title":"Am I the only one to like it?","rating":7,"date":"22 February 2000","review":"I liked this movie. Not as \"The Saint\" but as an elaborate action movie with a twist. Val Kilmer bears nothing in him that even gets close to Roger Moore's character - but if you look away from that and try to see it as an ordinary film, it's really good.<br><br>First of all, Val Kilmer performs fairly well, despite his weird accents. I really liked his artist type guy who seduces Emma Russell, he was great fun.<br><br>As for the story, well...I didn't bother to check for anomalies, I knew I'd find plenty. I only have two more things to say:<br><br>1. Elisabeth Shue is absolutely stunningly beautiful in this film.<br><br>2. The cool car that we only get to see a few seconds is a Volvo C70, a worthy replacement for the Volvo P1800 that Moore's Saint drove around in.","user":"Rammstein-2","rank":[94,109]},{"title":"Val Kilmer's performance is incredible","rating":10,"date":"16 October 2004","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and not just because of Val Kilmer's accomplishment at successfully being eye-candy, but also because of the amazing personality transformations his character goes through in front of the mirror. The story line itself is pretty impressive and I loved that although it keeps you guessing, you don't end up wondering, \"What the hell is going on?' The science side is played down enough for the audience to know it's there but not to get distracted by its details. I don't know if the theory actually works, but after watching the film I don't really care - that isn't the point of the movie.<br><br>The thing that surprised me the most though was the leading female scientist, played by Elisabeth Shue. It's obvious from the start that she's going to be the 'love interest' but her characters personality always puts a question to the question, will they actually end up together. She's shy and nervous of people, but is incredibly open, honest and warmly lovable - an almost perfect contrast to Kilmer's Ã¼ber-suave, identity-confused, international thief-for-hire/spy. But that's the very thing that makes them ideal for each other, they might just be able to help each other with their character flaws and so you root for them both on a rather grand scale.<br><br>I was vaguely baffled by the inclusion of random, suffering Russian civilians towards the latter half of the film, but considering that they were a film device to make the baddie look bad, the goodie look good and the 'common people trapped in the middle' look down right fantastic, they do their job rather well (apart from one woman who rats out our hero). All in all, they makes sure the audience are still caring if the common people are helped by the good guy, and hoping that the bad guy will eventually get his comeuppance. <br><br>However, back to my original point. I still think that the film's main achievement is putting Val Kilmer in an interesting role that shows off just how good he can be; he's observant, yet unobservable; seductive, yet not a cad; confident but riddled with insecurities. Moreover, in the early stages of the film, British students are no longer misrepresented as drunken, whoring lay-abouts, but as attentive learners who actually show up for lectures. Impressive stuff.<br><br>Yours Sincerely, A Proud British Student.","user":"Lotts","rank":[85,103]}]
