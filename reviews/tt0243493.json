[{"title":"A Great, Funny Feel-Good Movie","rating":9,"date":"11 November 2004","review":"Anyone who dismisses foreign films as too abstract or intellectual should see this one; it functions no differently than any American comedy. (By American comedy, I'm speaking of movies like the better Coen Brothers or Woody Allen comedies and not mass-produced garbage like \"White Chicks\".) Many times I completely forgot it was in French and that I was reading subtitles.<br><br>Daniel Auteuil is great in this charming film. His sad-sack loser is reminiscent of William H. Macy's most famous roles, or perhaps Jack Lemmon in \"The Apartment\".<br><br>Everything goes wrong for Fran√ßois Mignon. Neither his wife, who left him two years before, nor his teenage son will have anything to do with him. He is ignored at work, and finds out through the grapevine that he has been fired.<br><br>His next-door neighbor talks him out of suicide and comes up with a plan to save his job: if Mignon pretends to be gay, the company will not want to look homophobic by firing him.<br><br>This plan works perfectly, and Mignon is thrown into a number of increasingly ridiculous situations, now that he is reputed to be gay.<br><br>The film wraps up quickly and ties together almost too neatly, but the ending fits the fast paced comic style of everything before it. Overall, this is an entertaining and heartwarming film.","user":"BriGuy7783","rank":[47,51]},{"title":"a touching astute film masquerading as a farce","rating":10,"date":"10 June 2003","review":"This is a delightful character study and social commentary masquerading as a broad farce.  It is very, very funny.  They avoid cheap \"queer\" jokes and cheap \"homophobe\" jokes even as they bluntly portray attitudes about homosexuals.  Even though they use very real language to illustrate the attitudes.  There is some great acting throughout.  Each of the characters is a study in itself.  The homophobic character (Depardieu) emerges as intriguing and sympathetic, where it could have been two dimensional.  The relationship between Auteil and Aumont almost brought me to tears.  The transformation of the lead character is believable, despite the improbable context that the film creates.  The final scene with his ex-wife is powerful.  Others have pointed out that the lead character never changes, the perceptions of others change.  This makes his actual transformation that much more effective.  This movie is a real find.","user":"wtyson1","rank":[40,44]},{"title":"Anything can happen in a condom factory!","rating":30,"date":"30 September 2001","review":"This amiable and amusing film is delightful as it plays around with political correctness, homophobia, machismo, and business management.<br><br>The dull-witted and just plain dull main character keeps his job by pretending to be gay -- at the suggestion of a neighbor who is an industrial psychologist that once lost his own job BECAUSE he is gay. With that premise, the film is off to a wonderful series of misunderstandings and revelations as our hero discovers a great deal about life, people around him, and most of all, himself. The fact that all of this takes place is a very prim, high-tech condom factory makes the comedy all the more lively.<br><br>I wasn't expecting the lift that the film gave me. It has a flimsy giddiness about it lacking in most comedies about being gay or straight or anything else. See it if you get a chance.","user":"mermatt","rank":[34,37]}]
