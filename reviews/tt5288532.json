Definitely a very low budget film, poorly written film. The lead actress is terrible, she speaks with such a slow-emotionless tone it completely takes away from the movie. Her character also narrates everything with got very old, very fast. The lead actor has potential. Not a must see or frankly even a bored see.","user":"reneeamurry","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Love story that just lacked energy!!","rating":7,"date":"16 February 2020","review":"I think all the cast was great except for lead female!! She spoke like she was on downers. It was a cute love story that had a good ending. But seemed like a \"B\" movie without the energy of the lead actress!!","user":"katslzoo","rank":[0,0]}]
