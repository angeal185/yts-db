Not to mention the \"This is Sparta\" wannabe scenes shot on a green screen are so bad that it's not even funny<br><br>Sound &amp; Music 2/10 - the overlay for the fight scenes must-of came from a free music library, same for the soundtrack<br><br>Waste of my time 11/10","user":"SaseDegete","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"How did this ever get 6.7?","rating":1,"date":"8 April 2018","review":"Foolishly watched this without reading the user reviews as I was intrigued by the concept. It's one of those oves where you know you can never get those 100 minutes of your life back, ever.","user":"ruthandgareth","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"dont bother, really.","rating":1,"date":"6 April 2018","review":"I luv martial arts, scifi movies, anything w/action. but oh my god this movie makes no sense. huge gaps in the story line. ok, i can live with that but not to this extent. the fighting is ok which there are a couple of good fight scenes but theyre not worth watching this movie that has no script....or a script written by a a 2 yr old. the scifi and kungfu sounds like a different/cool idea but this movie didnt know what to do with those 2 concepts","user":"vincom","rank":[13,18]}]
