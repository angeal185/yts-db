[{"title":"Uggghhh","rating":1,"date":"17 October 2016","review":"I really wanted to like this movie because it's an important theme and \"should\" be an emotional journey but 30 minutes in and it's getting almost impossible for me to even want to finish watching it. There is no emotional depth, the actors (all of them) are just cold and distant (and not in an intentional way); it's just very poorly acted. I have yet to get to a scene where Susan Sarandon is in; so I'm hoping she is the saving grace as we all now she can deliver an emotional performance (Stepmom). But damn this is so poorly acted. It's such a shame because it could've been a great movie based on the story-line but the delivery is not there at all.","user":"lifeiknowgamo","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Mothers and Daughters: a somehow Pointless but Uplifting Comedy.","rating":6,"date":"8 May 2016","review":"It's a fresh Comedy, cheering and entertaining. The plot is not original but inspired enough not to leave you disappointed: you'll be easily able to foresee what's coming next but this isn't exactly a pity, if you stop and think about it for a second, in this kind of flicks.<br><br>The film doesn't offer any new or deep insight about maternal love: it just celebrates it and in doing so it leaves the impression that the story, in the end, is pointless.<br><br>The overall design reminded me of 'Love Actually (2003)' with the remarkable difference that that movie was mainly about males (plus some beautiful women). Here is the opposite.","user":"niutta-enrico","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"None so boring","rating":1,"date":"1 August 2016","review":"If the first 15 minutes doesn't do it for you, press eject. I kept watching because of the two good reviews. I thought I would get this great reward at the end for suffering. But that's all I did was suffer through a boring movie.<br><br>There are several well noted actresses doing this D- movie. I don't think there is a more boring movie with this many good actresses in it. This movie belongs on the Lifetime channel, maybe. The writing is poor, the story line is barely breathing. Everything else is typical for a lifetime channel movie. I don't understand why there are good reviews for this movie. There is no special ending, no gotcha moment, it is wrong to have this many great actresses doing such a bad movie.","user":"janetgunther","rank":[8,10]}]
