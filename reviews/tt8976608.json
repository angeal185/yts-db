The writing is bad, the acting is bad, and the plot is bad.","user":"adeleysim","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"As interesting as watching wood rot","rating":3,"date":"25 November 2019","review":"The actors in this are god awful. Have they even acted before? From the opening scene it's like instant boredom from two actors with no personality or charisma talking to each other in slow motion. It just keeps getting worse with more and more boring dialog exchanged that id rather watch paint dry rather than watch their horrible performance with not one shred of realism to their conversations. It sounds scripted, and badly scripted at that.<br><br>It's amazing the film quality and editing seems proffesional. But it's not enough to redeem anything about this monotone snorefest rip-off of the Blair Witch Project, but set somewhere just outside the Hollywood hills.<br><br>No good kill scenes either, nothing for gore fans, no creepy bits, no scary parts, and not one thing worthy of qouting. This movie offers absolutely nothing to anyone into this kind of genre and I wouldn't even recommend watching it for free even just once. Its flow is slow, the few characters have no charisma, the diolog is not natural, and its just a god awful movie.","user":"MikeHunt1075","rank":[11,15]}]
