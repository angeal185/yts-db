[{"title":"Beautiful scenery, a haunting atmosphere and a gripping story.","rating":10,"date":"14 November 2000","review":"When I first saw this film in 1989, the director had just won the Bavarian Film Prize as \"Best Rookie Director.\"  However, I didn't know what to expect.  I had been familiar with other modern German movies and was prepared to be disappointed.  Just the opposite turned out to be true. The film had a dreamlike quality with beautiful photography, a haunting atmosphere and a gripping story.  The music fit the film perfectly and I couldn't believe that the movie had been made by a first-time director. The story was not presented chronologically or sequentially, but was punctuated with flashbacks and \"flashforwards,\" making it seem like a puzzle to be solved, as much as a story to be told.  Although it had elements of a fairy tale, the sinister and symbolic elements conspired to make it seem more like a Gothic novel.  It was an interesting combination of mystery, suspense, and psychological study, with historic elements thrown in.  I came out of the theater knowing that there was hope for the modern German film.  In recent years, I have seen the film again a number of times.  Each time I see it, I seem to understand more and to find things that I hadn't previously noticed. Although some would put the film into the \"horror\" or \"suspense\" category, it is a world apart from a monster or slasher movie, although it has tinges of both.  I heartily recommend the film to anyone who enjoys suspense. You will be sitting on the edge of your seat, especially during the final scene, and you will be thinking about the film for days to come.","user":"tspeel1","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Not exactly horror, but a very good movie","rating":9,"date":"2 August 2004","review":"This movie turned out to be quite a bit different then I thought it would be but in a good way. The subtitle would lead you to believe that Laurin is a horror movie but after a few minutes you realize it is something completely different. Previous comments refer to this movie as being surreal and I think that is about as close to an explanation as you can get. This is a gorgeously shot movie that utilizes great natural scenery combined with carefully chosen lighting which sets the mood in every scene. The director makes great use of imagery and color and overall this movie has a really ominous and eerie feeling to it all the way through. As I mentioned though, this isn't really a typical American \"horror\" movie considering the low body count. It is more cerebral then most horror movies and is artfully put together from beginning to end without being pretentious art house crap.<br><br>There are a wholllleeeee lot of interesting characters in this movie, many who have issues with repressed sexuality. The lead character Laurin sleeps in a crib and at first seems to be mentally age-regressed or slow...or something. Also present are the local Priest and his son who both seem to have a number of \"issues\" relating to childhood and sexuality. Don't forget the crossdressing sissy school-boy, the dope smoking granny, and spying on people in the bathtub. <br><br>If you're looking for gore or high body count then keep going but if you are open to something a little more in the vein of maybe David Lynch then I highly recommend Laurin.","user":"Iainkelt","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"A fairytale from the book Laurin reads","rating":7,"date":"19 October 2011","review":"The atmosphere of the film and the fact that the adults seem to be bit parts who are not able to help the children makes the film like a fairytale and possibly one from the book that Laurin reads and sleeps with when first we meet her.<br><br>Laurin is a child whose mother dies in mysterious circumstances after she witnesses a man trying to dispose of the body of a boy. Laurin is imaginative and after her mother's death suffers visions that include being able to see a black dog, the murderer's companion. Gradually Laurin comes to 'see' not only her mother's death but the man/murderer's face.<br><br>There's a lot from the film that I did not understand including the murderer himself. It seemed to be suggested that he was a paedophile. However not understanding everything does not detract from the eerie quality of the film. I watched in on a recommendation for fans of Dario Argento's films and whilst this is not a giallo/gore film it does echo some of Argento's work such as Phenomena.","user":"PoppyTransfusion","rank":[7,7]}]
