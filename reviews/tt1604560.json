[{"title":"Had me hanging off my seat!","rating":10,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"Being from Jersey, I always heard stories about Clinton Road. So, when I came across this film, I was really excited to watch it. While it was scary at times, I couldn't look away. Awesome storyline and cast. Definitely a great movie for those of you who like thrillers. Especially since it is based on an actual road. Highly recommend!","user":"brianaaceti","rank":[54,59]},{"title":"As real as it gets","rating":9,"date":"6 October 2019","review":"This movie is good! We just seen it and it was scary for reals. Looking forward to visiting that place one day (in my Ice-T voice).","user":"uvz-54425","rank":[45,55]},{"title":"Well Done","rating":8,"date":"3 October 2019","review":"Just seen it on Prime and it kept us entertained.
