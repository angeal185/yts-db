[{"title":"Predictable and not surprising.","rating":6,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"The chemistry between Stallone and Schwarzenegger is fun and sharp, but the film's director is inappropriate and delivers a movie that could be much more than a recycled example of 80's kind of genre.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[36,37]},{"title":"Not great...but not horrible either.","rating":6,"date":"2 February 2014","review":"Despite the fact I haven't been impressed with much of their work lately, you can't deny the fact that Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger are the grandfathers of the action genre. So what's it like when you put the two of them together in a film (which should have happened a long time ago) and it's not one of those \"Expendables\" movies that play out like a bad fake, fan-made trailer on YouTube? Actually, you get a fairly decent film.<br><br>I wont' play coy here; \"Escape Plan\" isn't completely spectacular. The film has its problems. For example, Vinnie Jones is in the film and he's just lethargically playing the same character he's been riding on since his Guy Ritchie days (only, he's lost the unique wit and humor he had in those days) but at least he's not playing the Juggernaut in this film because that was just embarrassing for all of us. Secondly, the movie shifts tones during the climax and it was slightly jarring. The film goes from a movie about guys sneaking out of an inescapable prison to guys just deciding to shoot their way out. It goes from interesting to \"eh, let's become a generic action film\" very quickly. Finally, the movie has some unresolved plot threads towards its end and it make a mad dash like a demon is on its tail to try and get them resolved before the credits decide to shut the whole thing down. <br><br>However, despite the problems, the movie has its elements working for it and makes it a watchable film and something destined to be played numerous times on FX or Spike. Stallone and Schwarzenegger are terrific together and are giving performances that are probably the best they've done in the last decade. Plus, it's very clear Arnold is having a blast with his role and it was sorta infectious. Finally, Jim Caviezel is a decent antagonist as the film's evil warden to the high tech prisonÂ…that is, when you can hear him. Caviezel really enjoyed whispering all his lines.<br><br>\"Escape Plan\" may not be the most memorable film of either Stallone's or Schwarzenegger's career but the movie is mildly entertaining and worked for what it is.<br><br>Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I write a blog where I review whatever film I am currently watching (Old or new!).

There is no thick plot or real complexities, it's a simple bad guys Vs good guys action flick. However, the movie does not disappoint, its very entertaining and full of action and hard core scenes. The acting is as expected, nothing Oscar worthy but good enough from action legends like them. The idea is simple and is easily understood. The one difference in this movie is that the chemistry between Schwarzenegger and Stallone is excellent and they deliver some humor also. The only downside that I can think about is the fact that this movie is really meant for both the stars fans and not people who are looking for real ideas or excellent cinematography. Bottom line go enjoy the movie and don't forget your popcorn.","user":"Mrs1586","rank":[152,197]}]
