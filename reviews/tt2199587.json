[{"title":"A lot better than rated here","rating":8,"date":"12 April 2018","review":"As of this writing the rate is 4.9 but that is because they dont have any reviews, just ratings. This is a story of a young Albanian illegal in England desparetly trying to get legal status but running into bad luck all the way. Very ironic story, especially when compared to the horrendous immegration situation in the USA today (2018). The film is very well done and engaging and deserves more people watching and reviewing it.","user":"BILLYBOY-10","rank":[9,11]}]
