[{"title":"poor action film","rating":2,"date":"12 November 2010","review":"ohh where to begin????this film has poor fight scenes,the look like they were choreographed by a 5 year old. the acting is terrible, the cast look like they are plucked straight from the street and they act like it. on the plus side though the main character puts this funny batman accent on (think Christian bale meets keanu reeves high on speed.)the film looks cheap, it has an unbelievable storyline which defines logic in some places. and these are all the good points. rubbish film, waste of 90 minutes. if you want to see a good prison fighting film, watch undisputed 1,2 or 3 (2 is my favourite) this film is a rip off of all 3 of these films, and a poor 1 at that.","user":"metheridges","rank":[17,25]},{"title":"Cliché prison story with music video-like fast mo-slow mo fight scenes.","rating":4,"date":"10 November 2010","review":"After a drug sting operation goes bad with the death of 2 cops and the accidental death of the dealer, the cop who pretended to be a buyer in the sting is arrested some time later at his home where a search turns up money and drugs in the mattress of his bed. It is insinuated that he deliberately killed the dealer and his ass is sent to a prison where a criminal he sent away years before is running a \"cage fighting\" operation in the basement (Well, where else they gonna hold it?). At some point in the course of his stay, it is impressed on him by said criminal that he has to participate in the fights and \"no\" was not an option.<br><br>While this movie is a cliché of the genre (guy in prison fights to survive in illegal prison matches), it isn't unoriginality that necessarily spoils it because even original ideas can be executed badly. By the same token, old ideas can be done well. If you like clear, methodical, workman-like exchanges in your fight scenes you might not be happy with the \"music video-editing-and-effects-type\" of fighting employed here. Mind you, I think the music in this movie is good, and I like music videos --BUT-- this was a bit much. The whole film in retrospect seemed to me like one very long music video even though there were actually scenes without music. I wonder why?<br><br>Further, because of the way certain things were thoughtlessly thrown into this movie it seems to me that the people who made it were being exploitive and were probably using a formula directed at the younger crowd: hard rock and rap, visual effects (lots of slow mo &amp; fast mo), and a little T&amp;A thrown into the mix for good measure. So. Music, ass-whippings, and ass. A formula for success, no? \"Not necessarily\" is what this movie proves.<br><br>Instead of loud music, video editing and effects, the fight scenes should have been bare and workman-like; just 2 guys in a cage, mano a mano, showing their technique and the size of their balls with the only sound coming from their contacts and the crowd watching. This, by itself, with the same tired story-line would have been a great improvement. That said, the movie is not \"worthless\". It can provide \"light entertainment\" for the individual who just wants to kickback and not think too much. As well, if you can't get enough of music videos and don't mind your movie essentially turning into one, you could get something from this.<br><br>The guy wrongly convicted <br><br>The sadistic guard <br><br>The clueless or corrupt warden <br><br>The prison bully <br><br>The helpful cell-mate <br><br>The mess hall encounter<br><br>The threats <br><br>The showdown at the end<br><br>Can anyone put the list above to music? It should be a song by now.

The acting is sub par even for a \"Tap Out\" movie with the best acting job being done by Kimbo... and that was mostly grunts and swears. Tony Schiena's acting is... well I don't know if you can really call it acting. Tack on a pointless and rather cheap looking sex scene and it's a recipe for a failed and embarrassing movie. <br><br>By the way, I noted that IMDb has a bio on Tony, and after a bit of checking, I have concluded that it's mostly (if not entirely) fictitious. <br><br>He claims to be a world champion Karateka, but doesn't include what organization, style or any other details. The bio is done by some company in England that I am pretty sure is his own as they have not reviewed anyone else on IMDb. He's got videos on You Tube titled \"World Champion\" consisting of a few seconds of blurry action in some sort of local karate tournament, with rave reviews by people that I can only assume are himself. All in all... really cheap. <br><br>Which brings me to the last point. Action. All the fighting looks like it's done by drunk bears. Repetitive screaming and waving your arms around is not martial arts. <br><br>On the other hand... if you really like bad movies, this is likely the worst, so it's got that going for it.","user":"darques1","rank":[9,14]}]
