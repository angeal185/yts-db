[{"title":"A good film with great scenes","rating":8,"date":"13 August 2006","review":"\"Tortilla Flat\" is a good movie. In some ways, it reminds me of \"Juarez,\" another film in which John Garfield plays a Latino. The similarity is that both are good films that have contained within them really terrific scenes. I guess you could say that in these films, the parts are in some ways greater than the whole.<br><br>For me, the best scenes in \"Tortilla Flat\" revolve around Frank Morgan, who plays a sort of tramp (homeless man) who goes around with a bunch of dogs. Like Mr. Morgan, one of the dogs seems to have appeared in \"The Wizard of Oz\" -- yes, I think Toto is in \"Tortilla Flat.\" Not surprising, since both films were directed by Victor Fleming.<br><br>But the most extraordinary scene is that in which Frank Morgan has gathered his five dogs, in the midst of the majestic Redwood Forest, and relates to the dogs the story of St. Francis. As he is telling the story, the dogs actually have a vision! As the vision hovers, and the dogs react, Morgan averts his eyes. When the vision passes, Morgan shouts to the dogs: \"Did you see him? Did you see him? It was St. Francis! What good boys you must be to see St. Francis!\"<br><br>I know of few other films that depict pure religious experience so effectively. It raises this good film onto another level.","user":"Swithin","rank":[32,38]},{"title":"Great film","rating":7,"date":"10 December 2006","review":"I grew up in Monterey and I vividly remember my father speaking of these characters when he was growing up. Steinbeck sought to place these men in a motif that was similar to that of the knights of the Round Table showing all their excesses, loves, and loyalty to each other. While the film shows 1940's insensitivities it also captures a great deal of Steinbeck's purposes. It might be helpful to remember that Steinbeck wasn't writing of chicano's or even Mexicans per se, but of the creollo or Californio, i.e. the Spanish and later Mexican vaquero who ruled and reigned in Californio long before the Mexican national arrived in California.","user":"theredflyer","rank":[24,28]},{"title":"It has its flaws but was decent for its time","rating":7,"date":"23 June 2006","review":"Okay yes, Spencer Tracy does NOT look like a Paisano, but his performance in this movie is pretty cool and worth noting. I absolutely loved the book and Spencer Tracy's portrayal of Pilon went above and beyond what I expected the character to turn out like on screen. Frank Morgan was wonderful too. The scenes with the songs are particularly charming.<br><br>The story is about homeless men who live life one day at a time. Their biggest concern of each day is how they're going to acquire wine. Their friend Danny inherits two houses and Pilon is concerned that this newfound wealth is affecting their friendship.<br><br>Along the way they bring in more roommates including the wonderful Pirate character and the guys get into some shenanigans involving what else? Money, women and wine.<br><br>I also very much adored the simplicity of Victor Fleming's direction. He made a lot of beautiful shots, especially of the Pirate's adorable dogs!","user":"serval26","rank":[22,27]}]
