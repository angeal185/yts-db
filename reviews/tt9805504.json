The rapid descend into madness by some of the characters is a little hard to swallow with extreme measures being taken that barely make sense","user":"thenextrushmagazine","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Put the hood on!!!","rating":6,"date":"27 June 2019","review":"The idea of the movie being stolen from very cool movie Frozen 2010, even the hand that got stuck to the cold metal ...","user":"mrsmuscat","rank":[14,18]}]
