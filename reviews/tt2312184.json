[{"title":"Enjoyable mindless entertainment and a fun ride!","rating":8,"date":"2 June 2017","review":"This was surprisingly and unexpectedly much more entertaining than I expected! If you're looking for an enjoyable funny 'Netflix and Chill' type movie to watch on a lazy day, this movie will not disappoint! <br><br>To be clear, it's not a suspense type thought-provoking psycho- thriller drama, nor a top notch comedic production, but just simply an enjoyable mindless comedy that will entertain. <br><br>The comedy was a little overboard at times, but there were *some* LOL moments, and I caught myself having a permanent smile throughout most of the movie. It was stupid humor but it was executed properly. Casper Van Dien was surprisingly comedic, and although Eddie Griffin seemed a little too much next to Blake Freeman's somewhat stale comedic performance, the three together made it work! Jon Gries was on point as the psycho marine. There was a decent story-line. The location setting was great. There's some action, suspense, gore, eye-candy, and pretty much all the elements to make this one of the more successfully entertaining B grade action/sitcom attempts I've seen in a while.<br><br>I'm sure there will be other reviews dissecting and over-critiquing and low scoring this movie, but in my opinion, it was just simply an enjoyable, mindless form of entertainment with some hilarious characters and over-the-top comedy. <br><br>Enjoy it for what it is, a fun ride.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[25,35]},{"title":"Goofy loser comedy which progresses to inane","rating":5,"date":"17 July 2018","review":"An American action comedy; A story about three American guys who venture to Columbia for a dollar reward with the aim to capture America's most wanted criminal. The film starts well, establishing the characters, and there are several instances of genuine amusement. Unfortunately, it then descends into a cramming of drug-addled inaneness, racial crudeness and silly, predictable encounters with dangerous 'Scarface' typed narcotics criminals with no real menace. It transforms from funny buddy comedy to juvenile caper.","user":"shakercoola","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Thin story done badly","rating":3,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"Not a great story and not a great script. Relies heavily on profanity, tripping, stupidity and chicks with dicks to get the laughs (and there are a few sprinkled throughout) but overall there are better ways to spend 90 minutes. Watch as a last resort or when you need to get off to sleep.","user":"jasonedge8","rank":[5,8]}]
