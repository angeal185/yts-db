[{"title":"There are some brothers involved but not really a war film – and ignore the cover.","rating":4,"date":"3 June 2015","review":"The synopsis of this film is that two brothers have been indulging in sibling rivalry for some time. Greg is the nice one who likes poetry and is all sensitive and Jake is the black sheep who loves divilment and causing a ruckus. This is all told in both linear and flashback mode. Then the war breaks out and Greg is the one who volunteers in 1939 and leaves the familial strife on the farm to go off to war. **Please note the following may contain PLOT SPOILERS**<br><br>Well the war bit or rather the actual fighting bit lasts about three minutes of screen time, the rest is all about relationships both in England and France. One brother never even makes it to war. This is though quite a good film if taken on the relationship front and the issues of family ties and love. There are some plot holes too which were easy to have addressed. The acting though is all pretty solid and the attention to period detail is all done very well, especially when you consider this was an independent effort. It is the mis selling that is the real issue here.<br><br>So not a war film, per se, but with a background to WW2 to add drama and give context to the bigger story. The cover art is about as accurate as saying FIFA runs like a well oiled machine. It should not be allowed and will attract lovers of war films who may not be at all interested in a purely relationship based story – and that is no matter how well acted and put together it is – hence my rating.","user":"t-dooley-69-386916","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"Outstanding achievement","rating":8,"date":"26 July 2015","review":"Having been involved in around 100 productions myself from no/low budget to Hollywood I can see one thing that everyone involved in this film believed in. While watching this of course I can see a few holes but what films don't. In my humble opinion those holes appear for a number of reasons with financial constraints in my experience can harm a truly outstanding script. What Brothers of War does is make the very best of the creative talent that I can see stretched themselves to the limit. Am sure the days was long and very few people moaned as they all knew what could be achieved when all pulling in the same direction. The results on screen are quite simply astounding and like I said earlier when making a film with very little budget its a miracle everyday to shoot something never mind put out a film which can be seen and in this case be proud of. My hat is tipped to those that inspired the monumental work ethic that all the cast and crew put into the making of Brothers of War and I for one would work with anyone involved on their next productions. Watch this and see what I saw and you will watch in awe at the talent we have in the UK independent film industry and I for one will be watching what they do next. Well done everyone.","user":"johnnylynch","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"A terribly mediocre attempt at a \"sweeping war epic\"","rating":1,"date":"9 July 2015","review":"There is nothing redeeming about watching Brothers of War. The story lacked any and all forms of depth, as did the frigid characters that were so very hard to even remotely care about. <br><br>I was either very uneasy during this film, or very preoccupied with watching my neighbour's fence dry after a fresh coat of linen white paint. The cringe-worthy attempt to create something meaningful with emotional depth, came short as a possible result of the writer/director not having the life experience to show us what life is really like. The real mystery here is how this film got $1.7m to get made. I wonder if the said investors are hunting the filmmaker for their money back. But hell, maybe they enjoyed the film. Maybe they just had no taste to begin with. That money would have been better spent making a documentary about the making of the worst sweeping war epic ever made. <br><br>That would have made a much better film, although I would probably be writing a very similar review for it, had it been made instead. And please...please, do not dare to make it now.","user":"ka-rmageddon","rank":[16,32]}]
