[{"title":"Ok story line but no character development","rating":6,"date":"2 August 2019","review":"The movie overall was a little boring and both main characters are pretty Unlikable.. I didn't feel sorry for either of them. The plot was good but it definitely was a waste of time","user":"mrgums-87207","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Generic","rating":2,"date":"30 August 2019","review":"I gave up half way unfortunately. There is little to keep me watching, it's a slow enduring slog through a generic story, offering little to say, nothing new on the love plot.\nThe acting is ok, though the boyfriend is pretty bad....as I said I got half way through, I gave it a shot but I don't understand what was in this story idea that was worth developing into a film, it's so generic!\nNothing happens in the film, almost all the context is delivered by dialogue, nothing in a compelling way to keep me watching...though the one experiential moment is when the girlfriend see's the boyfriend's instagram with him and his make up girl out for drinks, that was ok, but almost everything else was so blandly delivered, honestly how do you expect me to keep watching because of that?","user":"richardadesmond","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Very good movie!","rating":10,"date":"25 June 2019","review":"I really enjoyed watching this movie, it was interesting from beginning to end, the actors are very talented and fun to watch. Highly recommended!","user":"jump-48986","rank":[5,35]}]
