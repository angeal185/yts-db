[{"title":"Where's the Croc.","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"If you're going to have a movie about a giant croc you should probably show it once in a while. The series took a big slam from the cgi over the time but honestly I still found them all fun and felt like it stayed in tune with the original plot up until now. I do like the series and so wanted to like legacy but it failed terribly. They had solid acting but obviously no budget for the cgi so I ask why make the movie at all. When they do show the croc it's blurred and unrealistic and you wait until near the end to finally see just how bad it is. The plot started out somewhat ok but went to crap quick. Why they went where they did (into a giant bunker) was I guess a diversion cause they had no budget to show the croc. Most of the kills scenes don't even show the croc and are inside in a dark bunker. I hope this isn't the legacy for real of this series. They need to go back to the roots with the local towns people and add in a couple of big city folks with the dark comedy and it would be a pleasure if we even got back past cgi budget. I gave it a 2 for the acting and only watched to the end because I'm a devoted fan. I Know the rating will drop to around 3 as it sits at about 4.4 due to cast and friends voting. Comon bring back Betty White and keep the action outside.","user":"wolfmanrtcw-35431","rank":[24,31]},{"title":"How do I get 90 minutes of my life back?","rating":1,"date":"3 September 2018","review":"This is 2018 and the original Jurassic Park (1993) looks far more real than this\nThe animal is 100% computer generated, most probably on a ZX Spectrum.<br><br>Absolutely terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible waste of my time..","user":"happyjoe-70843","rank":[30,41]},{"title":"My mistake!","rating":1,"date":"29 August 2018","review":"Rubbish movie and it's ain't the mistake of producer it's mine that I dared to watch it; what a wastage of time and money!","user":"masud-nishat","rank":[21,30]}]
