[{"title":"A well-crafted film deflated by the Matrix-sodden expectations of an effects-obsessed audience.","rating":14,"date":"14 July 2000","review":"I feel compelled to speak up for this film against the spoilt ravings of the it-said-it-was-like-the-Matrix-but-I-didn't-see-any-cool-computer-graphics-a nywhere crowd that have dominated these pages.<br><br>There seem to be two schools of thought on the use of special effects in movies.  The prevalent theory - depressingly common among film goers and film-makers alike - seems to be that a good effect should stand out of a film and make the audience coo like a pigeon.  If you subscribe to that theory, fine, watch the Matrix and be happy.  If you think that a special effect is a means to an end, a way to portray a fictional vista as a believable realism, then watch eXistenZ and marvel at how a grotesque and visceral world can be made so engrossingly real and intriguing.  This film has its fair share of effects, but they are so well grafted into the ethos the film evokes that you just won't notice them on first viewing.  And in contrast with the current trend towards computer-generated effects, Cronenburg knows the value of his tactile world; the physical creativity involved in the gristle-gun building scene is a fantastic example.<br><br>Okay, so virtual reality has been used many times as a concept - and by films that actually came BEFORE the Matrix too - but the totality with which this film portrays its own organic brand of VR is truly engrossing.  Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh are utterly watch-able and the chemistry between them is the perfect vehicle to lead an audience through the admittedly gruesome situations the film describes.<br><br>There is an element of old-fashioned escapist fantasy in this film that manages to be strangely endearing despite the gore and I suggest that this is where the film triumphs - a triumph that can be attributed to clever writing, intelligent acting and characterisation, a compelling story, charismatic leads, a vivid and disciplined imagination and the discerning use of effects and visual style.<br><br>If the Matrix is an `oooh, aaah' sort of film, then this is more an `oooh, eeugh' movie - but don't allow the glare of the Matrix to dull your senses to the darker appeal of eXistenZ.","user":"dbignell","rank":[215,253]},{"title":"Truly unique","rating":10,"date":"9 April 2002","review":"Everybody seems to compare this to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it I would have agreed -- I was expecting The Matrix and was a little disappointed.  But upon repeated viewings my respect for this movie has grown immensely.<br><br>The thing to keep in mind is that The Matrix is a great action movie with some philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in.  The 13th Floor is a passable action movie with some slightly more interesting philosophical mumbo-jumbo thrown in.  Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as many seem to believe) about \"reality\" or any such \"deep\" concept.  It's about the human tendency to intentionally replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and in its behavior) world of make-believe.<br><br>The most chilling moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller repeats her \"scripted\" line.  It's at that point you realize that the people in the game have voluntarily surrendered their free will in order to participate in a story.  This is made even more frightening at the end when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) comments on the possibility of spending one's life in the game.  I sympathize completely with the \"realist\" philosophy, that providing interesting worlds in which people simply locate the correct predefined path to the end goal is ultimately a recipe for a soulless existence.  Living \"in the game\" is not living at all, but is a tempting way to spend one's time on earth.  As Allegra comments about the real world, \"there's nothing going on here.\"  Might as well jack into someone else's imagination, and pretend to be doing something interesting.  (Although I have to ask whether Cronenberg considers this a self-indictment, considering that he himself offers up worlds to be experienced in 90 minute snippets.)<br><br>Upon leaving the theater after first watching this movie, I thought it was one of those movies that was watchable only to see how it ended.  But having seen it a couple more times (thank you SciFi Channel) I've realized how much deeper it goes.  Seriously, if you've only seen it once, it deserves another viewing.","user":"bjrubble","rank":[189,226]},{"title":"an existential psychotropic trip","rating":10,"date":"26 January 2004","review":"David Cronenberg, much like colleague David Lynch, is an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes like reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death, is bound to get the most extreme reations from audiences. He proved this with films as The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (capital X, capital Z) and more recently, Spider. It's best to see eXistenZ with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot, or it'll be ruined for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg takes you on a trip down into the world of videogames that acts as a metaphor for any kind of escapist behaviour. Living out fantasies is something people always dream of, but how far can you go into it, before reality gets blurred and the fantasy takes over and turns into a nightmare? Those are the themes touched in eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies being invaded by disease and most importantly, reality itself.<br><br>The story and directing are excellent. Cronenberg knows his trade very well and succesfully brings to life an artificial world, avoiding the usual pitfalls and clich√©s linked to stories such as this. The film shows some pretty disgusting stuff, but is unusually low-key in the gore department in comparison to Cronenbergs other work. The shock effects he plays on are never over the top and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative. It's not the most intellectual movie ever, but it will leave you thinking about it, wondering and pretty confused.<br><br>The acting gets two thumbs up as well. Both protagonists, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their parts perfectly and cleverly portray their character's shifting moods and identities. The dialogue may seem a little stale and clinical at times, but that is part of the effect Cronenberg was going for, to create a disaffected and alien atmosphere that puts you quite at unease. Supporting actors as Ian Holm, Don McKellar and an especially creepy Willem Dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbingly familiar performances.<br><br>This movie takes some getting used to, but if you can appreciate the dark tone, blood-curdeling imagery and existentially warping story, you'll love it.","user":"peter_vangoethem","rank":[135,167]}]
