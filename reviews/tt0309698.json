[{"title":"Explanation","rating":9,"date":"27 May 2005","review":"OK, everyone seems to be confused about this movie so let me explain it for everyone. The killer has a multiple personality syndrome, and was being treated in a psychiatric home. They have tapes of him portraying many different personalities, and they believe that one of his many personalities is the killer. The reason everyone has the same birthday is that every person is really him, all of these characters are made up in this guys mind. The way they figure they can cure him of his multiple personalities is to have them all come together inside of his head and hopefully they will all be killed off, with the risk that the killer will be one of the personalities killed. Let me repeat, the point of that motel, is to have all the personalities come together hoping that they will all die except for one, that one takes control of his life. As each character dies, that is one less personality he has left. In the very end they think he is OK because all of his personalities are dead, except for the girl. But really that kid is still alive, and he kills Amanda Peet. The exercise that they tried to do was complete, all the personalities died inside of his head, unfortunately the only personality that survived was the one that was the killer. I hope that clears it up a little bit.","user":"WatchinMovies01","rank":[205,234]},{"title":"Like a hit to the head from left field","rating":8,"date":"23 January 2007","review":"This movie totally surprised me on every level. I had never even heard of it until recently; when an observant video store clerk noticed how many thrillers I was hiring and suggested it. <br><br>Having missed it at the movies, I figured it would be the usual B-grade mystery murder flick, a bit of fun at best. Instead this movie had me hooked from the opening sequence; I almost thought they'd put the wrong DVD in the box! <br><br>The story is like one big twisted, turning tunnel- with barely a glimmer of a light at the end. The cast is great, the setting appropriately scary- with no short measure of red herrings to keep you guessing. <br><br>The cast really delivers too; the characters are diverse and given enough attention to keep you engaged but not so much as to slow the action down. John Cusack is in fine form as the easily likable ex-cop trying to hold it all together; Jake Busey plays the psychotic to perfection as usual. <br><br>I don't usually go in for gore, but there's really barely more than a few hints of blood &amp; guts. Definitely one to watch in the dark with a group of friends to scare the hell out of yourselves. You won't regret this one.","user":"the_yellow_brick_road","rank":[136,156]},{"title":"Edge of the seat thriller","rating":9,"date":"11 November 2004","review":"I've never before seen a film that made me sit on the edge of my seat practically from the opening credits. And I never got to sit back.<br><br>This was a psychological thriller of the best type. There is plenty of opportunity for you to nominate the \"bad guy\" and while you may be right in a sense you will probably also be wrong. The ending is a real shocker - and I suspect that the typical reaction of many viewers is to say \"No way\" - but if you think about it, it is the only possible ending. But you have to think about it - and the film is so action-filled that you never have time. SO the realization must come after the closing credits roll.<br><br>I'd never seen John Cusack in anything but a comedy before (except for a film called \"Max\", but I saw that before I knew who Cusack was). He pulled off drama equally as well as he does comedy. An impressive talent.<br><br>And an impressive film.","user":"gardenwriter","rank":[254,306]}]
