Zoo eschews the typical zombie movie cliches and focuses instead on how the end of the world affects a lone couple, already on the brink of a failing marriage. Solid acting by both main characters.<br><br>Spoiler\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.<br><br>.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nMy only question is why they didn't go out through the hole in the roof.","user":"TenPin1969","rank":[21,29]}]
