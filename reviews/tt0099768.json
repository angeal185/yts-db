[{"title":"Excellent","rating":10,"date":"16 May 2002","review":"Just great political drama.  It takes place in 1987 Belfast.  A human rights activist (Frances McDormand) investigating British brutality against the Irish, and a police inspector (Brian Cox) are investigating the murder of one of her colleagues.  They find a huge conspiracy that leads to the highest people in government.<br><br>I know only the basics of the conflict in Northern Ireland, but I was able to follow the story.  They shot on location and the accents are, at times, incomprehensible, but it actually adds to the movie.  The movie looks grimy and bleak...as it should.  The movie is VERY critical of England.  McDormand and Cox are superb and the movie is very realistic...especially the ending.<br><br>Sadly, this movie bombed big in America.  It came out before McDormand hit it big with \"Fargo\" and Cox before \"In the Name of the Father\".  Still, this is well worth seeing.  Don't miss it!","user":"preppy-3","rank":[43,53]},{"title":"A First Class Political Thriller","rating":10,"date":"2 April 2009","review":"Hidden Agenda has long been on my list of films to see. As a fan of the political thriller genre I was intrigued by its premise. Now, having finally found it and had the opportunity to see it I was presently surprised. The film surpassed my expectations and easily ranks amongst the best political thrillers I've seen.<br><br>The performances are the staring point of this phenomenal film. Frances McDormand gives a marvelous performance as American civil rights activist Ingrid Jessner as Brian Cox as Kerrigan, the top investigator investigating the death of Jessner's boyfriend. The result is that, together and separately, they give two highly watchable performances that keep your attention focused on the screen. There's also the supporting cast including Brad Dourif as the murdered boyfriend, Maurice RoÃ«ves as the mysterious army officer Harris who has all the secrets plus Bernard Archard and Patrick Kavanagh as two politicians at the heart of the film's conspiracy.<br><br>The film is, if nothing else, a conspiracy thriller. What may seem like an odd murder in Northern Ireland soon turns out to be mired in the politics of Thatcher era Britain. The film, while fictional, seems to be far too real for comfort. Writer Jim Allen has crafted a thriller that blends fact and fiction together and so well that the fine line between the two is blurred when it comes to the issues of 1980's Northern Ireland, how Thatcher got herself elected and how governments deal with terrorism. Of even greater surprise is that the plot doesn't overwhelm the dialogue. Unlike some political thrillers, in this film scenes come alive not just from the performances of the actors but from the words on the pages themselves. While it deals with 1980's Northern Ireland one can't help but see the relevant issues ever present in the film nearly twenty years on.<br><br>On top of the script there's the documentary like approach that makes the film too realistic for comfort. Clive Tickner's cinematography is the main reason this succeeds so well in that it never feels like a Hollywood film. The result is that (thankfully) one gets the feeling of being a fly on the wall for many of the scenes which makes the blurring of fact and fiction even more successful. Add on the realistic costume and production design along with the tight editing of Jonathon Morris and the result is an all too realistic thriller.<br><br>Hidden Agenda is what a political thriller should be. With its combination of fantastic performances, well written script, its realistic design work and especially its documentary like cinematography make it too realistic to be ignored. While it may deal with 1980's Britain in Northern Ireland it's a thriller with a message too strong to be ignored. It's a first rate and a must see for fans of the genre of the political thriller.","user":"timdalton007","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"conspiracy of lies","rating":9,"date":"21 February 2014","review":"Ken Loach has made a career out of directing movies about politically charged topics. A lot of his movies have addressed class issues in the United Kingdom, but he has also looked at foreign policy. One example is \"Hidden Agenda\", about an investigation into the murder of a human rights lawyer in Belfast. Loach not only indicts the British occupation, but also finds time to take a swipe at Margaret Thatcher's government.* While I was watching the movie I assumed that it was based on the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane. It turns out that the movie is a fictional story, but it still makes sure to show the sorts of things that had become commonplace in Northern Ireland. I read that Loach had the cast members meet with people who had gotten abused by British forces to give them an idea of what the movie was dealing with.<br><br>Ken Loach also looked at Ireland in \"The Wind that Shakes the Barley\", about Ireland's war for independence in the early 20th century. Both movies take unflinching looks at what the English did to the Irish for over 800 years. To be certain, \"Hidden Agenda\" features a scene that should give people pause in the era of the so called war on terrorism: a man sings a song that has the line \"you take our land and call us terrorists for resisting\". I recommend the movie. Other movies focusing on Northern Ireland that I recommend are \"In the Name of the Father\", \"Bloody Sunday\" and \"Breakfast on Pluto\".<br><br>*After Thatcher died, Loach proposed that her funeral should be privatized, since she would've wanted it that way.","user":"lee_eisenberg","rank":[15,17]}]
