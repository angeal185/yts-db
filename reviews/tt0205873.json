[{"title":"An opportunity to use the word \"nice\" in a positive way.","rating":10,"date":"13 October 2000","review":"As with all \"true story\" movies, I have no idea how much of this is actually true - particularly in relation to the crises just before the actual moonwalk.  But frankly, I don't care, because \"The Dish\" as a movie is a splendid experience.<br><br>Being heavily promoted as \"from the makers of 'The Castle' \" may get a few extra punters in the door - particularly here in Australia where the exploits of the Working Dog team are rightly well known and loved; but those expecting \"The Castle 2\" will be in for a surprise.<br><br>But a pleasant one.  This film is much more ambitious, much larger in scope. As is to be expected, the writing here is very sharp - a likeable group of characters are defined very well very quickly, the simple plot flows smoothly, and there is a constant stream of funny (and some downright hilarious) moments.  Much of the humour is distinctly Aussie, and much of it arises from the culture clash between the locals and the visiting Americans. Yet despite this, the film does not stoop to the level of \"Ocker clich√©\" which plagues several other Australian films.  There is a core of simple humanity here which makes it very engaging.  It is for this reason also that I think the film will play very well in other countries.<br><br>The cast is also very impressive, from the habitually sound Sam Neill, who projects an immense dignity, and Patrick Warburton as the pressured NASA official sent to oversee the operation, right down to the Mayor's son, reeling off technical details of the spacecraft to his bemused dad.  It is a credit to the cast, and to Rob Sitch as a director that I was rarely aware that I was watching a film, I was simply drawn into the experience.<br><br>Those, like me, who wanted to be an Astronaut when they were little, and maintained an interest in the space program, will enjoy seeing the famous footage again in a new light.  Those looking for a comedy will find many laughs herein.  Those curious to understand the nature of being Australian will find some clues.  And those just looking for a film to make them feel good could do much much worse.  In short, \"The Dish\" is one of those rare movies which will appeal to pretty much everyone.  I can't really think of any serious criticisms, and left the cinema feeling... well, \"nice\".  I have no doubt it will play well in Australia, but I also hope it does well overseas too, in the US and elsewhere.  I'd recommend it to everyone I know, and everyone else.<br><br>When this one comes out on DVD I'll be getting a copy, and it'll be going straight to the pool room!","user":"MoneyBaby!","rank":[62,64]},{"title":"A priceless moment in Australian Cinematic History","rating":10,"date":"31 January 2003","review":"The Dish delivers the way some of Michael Crichton's best novels do : Take a true story and build fiction around it so you can entertain the reader/viewer with technical accuracy and focus on the fictional characters, and the role they play. And boy, does The Dish entertain.<br><br>First credit must go to Rob Sitch's absolutely brilliant direction. On one hand it comes as no surprise that part of the old \"D-Generation\" line-up (Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy) wrote a comedy full of sharp wit in the tradition of the infamous \"Late Show\" that ran on the ABC (Ch 2) in 1992-1993. Glen's (Tom Long) question \"Who's the guy ?\", when Al (Patrick Warburton) volunteers his admiration for Neil Armstrong and that he'll be walking on the moon is on a par with the Late Show \"It's academic\" 1993 sketch where the Santo/Rob/Tom Ivanhoe College team is faced with the challenge : \"How much change do you receive from 7 Dollars if you purchase 7 items at 98 Cents each ?\" - Rob's answer \" What are the items ? \" is unforgettable.<br><br>That same team performed at its best yet when The Dish's script was written. The Dish is also quite unique as a movie that can be watched over and over again without the need to skip many parts of the story. This could mainly be attributed to the story's characters, and how we are compelled to care about each and every one of them, no matter how insignificant they might seem.<br><br>The core of The Dish revolves around Neil Armstrong's first historic steps on the Moon at 12:56 PM, Monday 21 July 1969 AEST. When 600 Million people (1/5th of mankind at that time) tuned in and witnessed the TV pictures from the Eagle Lunar Module, 3 tracking stations were receiving these signals simultaneously. They were CSIRO's Parkes Radio Telescope, Honeysuckle Creek tracking Station near Canberra and NASA's Goldstone station in California. During the first 9 minutes of the broadcast, NASA alternated between these 3 stations. When they switched to the Parkes pictures, they were of such superior quality that NASA remained with them for the rest of the 2 1/2 hour Moonwalk. Of course the audience knows the good outcome to the events, so the writers can fully focus on the fictional part of the story and remind us how human nature can marvel by putting a man on the moon and safely return him home.<br><br>The Dish is so refreshing because it doesn't need to resort to adult themes, violence or excessive profanity to flag your attention to the townfolk of Parkes, their involvement in the mission and how they are \"over the moon\" about it.<br><br>The film accurately portrays the spirit of Aussie people in 1969. I found the camerawork simply stunning at times, capturing the beauty of Parkes : the dusty road to the Telescope, the farmer with dog and sheep, the (empty) Fuel station and Parkes' sleepy shops. The wonderful soundtrack attends to the \"missing pieces\" with songs like \"Good morning Star shine\" and \"Come on\". Dramatization is resourcefully completed by Edmund Choi's composition and direction of The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (under Jane Kennedy's guidance).<br><br>The Dish succeeds in a non-pretentious and honest way to convey its great emotion and charm to the viewer. Working Dog excelled itself and surely must face great difficulty to surpass this masterpiece. \"Frontline\" and \"The Castle\" were very clever indeed, but The Dish is perceived by me as the best Australian Movie ever made, a priceless moment in Aussie Cine history.<br><br>Charles \"Bud\" Tingwell's cameo appearance as the Priest is the icing on the cake. The amount of research to realize the Dish must have been extensive, to adhere for example to the 2.2825 GHz Apollo 11 frequency, the solid minus 90 dBM signals etc. in the script.<br><br>It is worthwhile to note that NASA delayed the Parkes pictures by 6 seconds before its worldwide broadcast, in the event of an accident. Australian viewers saw mankind's giant leap 6.3 seconds earlier than the rest of the world !! (A 300 mS delay for the INTELSAT satellite link from Sydney,Australia to Houston,USA was incurred).<br><br>I still watch The Dish regularly and the movie, if nothing, conveys greater emotion than it first did. Highly recommended : great acting across the entire cast, almost flawless camerawork, fantastic soundtrack, fast paced yet non-engaging script, witty comedy. A treat for the whole family. 9.5 out of 10 !!!","user":"microbit","rank":[79,83]},{"title":"A Perfect Little Film!","rating":8,"date":"8 February 2003","review":"Most of us who were over 5 years old at the time, remember where they were when Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the moon. This monumentally emotional moment for mankind, albeit thoroughly superfluous scientific achievement, is the background for this beautifully constructed film.<br><br>The thing that makes this film so special is the fact that there isn't a character that appears on screen that you don't care about, regardless how small the role. That takes true writing and directing talent!<br><br>\nThe entire small town of Parks, New South Wales, Australia is all atwitter, because their radio observatory dish has been chosen to be NASA's official link to the Apollo 11 mission in the southern hemisphere. The mayor's wife comments, while serving her joint of lamb, that man being moments away from landing on the moon makes their problems seem mundane... That's the beauty of the film, you care so much about these people; their problems are anything but mundane - you cheer-on the techno-nerd asking the town beauty to go out with him; you ache inside because the head of the observatory lost his wife a year ago and she can't be there to revel in his glory; you love the fact that the out-of-place NASA official is the only one who realizes that all the mayor's rebellious teenage daughter really needs to chill-out is an ounce of respect.<br><br>This is the best kind of feel-good film. An absolute jewel that you'll want to watch more than just once.","user":"tim.halkin","rank":[28,28]}]
