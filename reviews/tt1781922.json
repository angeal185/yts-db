[{"title":"No Escape","rating":8,"date":"14 February 2020","review":"One of my favorite movies of 2015... A fantastic movie about an American expat family trapped in an unnamed South East Asian country after a civil war had broke out; fighting for survival and a way out of the war torn country. Owen Wilson's should be given credit for acting in roles that are out of his typecast. Wilson's acting really shines in this movie. While Brosnan played a convincing Blackops operative that indirectly fueled the fire to a revolution/coup. I would recommend anyone to watch it at least once... I would greenlight a prequel to the backstory of Hammond (Brosnan's character) if given the opportunity because it would be an amazing movie. Even a spinoff sequel focusing on the other expats trapped in that same country would be watch worthy.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[40,41]},{"title":"Review from a Vietnamese: Good movie but just no there yet","rating":7,"date":"3 November 2015","review":"No Escape has me on the edge of my seat for several moments. The intensity of the movie is real. Well done producer, but you still miss the shot by that much. <br><br>The story is about Jack Dwyer and his families traveling to a South East Asian movie to settle down so he can work for a water company there. However, they soon find out that a coup has broken out and local rebels are trying to kill all foreigners they see because those foreigners are making them slave by control the water sources. Jack has to walk through hell, fight off enemies to escape to Vietnam. <br><br>Cool, really good plot. However, it can be much better. I want to know better about the villain, not just mindless criminals. I want a bit of side story and explanation. Although Mr.Hammond did explain a bit, I feel that detail is just too shallow and it is not developed good enough. I feel that bit is not necessary, a normal coup for power is fine for me. Don't mark everything America with star, stripes and eagle.<br><br>The movie also has several errors. Such as when Annie told her daughter to hide in the bathroom and lock, she ran the opposite direction in the bedroom, but later the wife was standing in front of the bathroom next to the main door (hotel, 1 bathroom only).<br><br>Also when the sniper try to kill them, Hammond and Kenny did a terrible job on keeping an eyes out. Moreover, if I am a rebel and I know they are staying up there, I will send several men to get them right there, not just staying in the tower and shoot. That is a terrible strategy. <br><br>Hammond was really cool character, but he does not have enough screen time, which is a total let down. <br><br>The ending scene was not well played, I feel it rushes too much and I feel they take only 5 minutes to get to Vietnam border. And the truck was chasing, if they planned to kill, why don't they just shoot when the boat still on the other side? What hold them back? I would prefer the ending scene on a road than the river. As I want to see a bit more standoff between Vietnamese force and rebels. <br><br>LIKE: Good plot Decent Acting Good \"South East Asian\" Atmosphere Hammond Intensity and violence Vietnam is safe haven<br><br>DISLIKE: Plot was not well developed in side story Movie errors and nonsense Screen time for Hammond was not enough Ending scene<br><br>OTHER STUFF FOR DISCUSSION: OK, the country in the movie, is not real. So calm down guys. It was filmed in Thailand, people speaking Laotian and minority languages and all the signs are in \"up side down\" Cambodian Khmer. <br><br>It is a movie okay? There is no country's city has direct fly from US and couple of miles away from Vietnam, of course.<br><br>I personally like this movie, it reflects partly the truth of several South East Asian countries now. Cambodia is going through big political war between the current gov and the politicians who want to wage a war with Vietnam. Thing was really tense at Vietnam's border couple of months ago. <br><br>I saw someone rated this movie bad and said it is a racist movie because white people escapes. Calm the f*ck down, it is an action movie, not a lovely soft humane story. Don't bring the refugee crisis in here, movie is movie, real life is real life. <br><br>Rate it 7.5/10","user":"kevinheroes0504","rank":[154,183]},{"title":"Unexpected... Bravo!","rating":7,"date":"4 November 2015","review":"Going to watch a movie with Owen Wilson starring, you usually expect some kind of comedy or romance. Not this time. I was really worried that he would not be up to the task with this one, but this was not true, not true at all!<br><br>The movie was fascinating, completely plausible, filled with amazing scenes that keep you at the edge of your seat. The things that this family goes through were unimaginable but very well executed during filming. <br><br>Owen was that good that you could actually empathize with his suffering and anxiety and put yourself in his position struggling for his family. Pierce Brosnan was AMAZING! Just the right amount, just as much as needed, to complement a really thrilling movie!<br><br>Recommended for sure! Can't wait to see more stuff like that from Owen Wilson!","user":"palavitsinis","rank":[84,105]}]
