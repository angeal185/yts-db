[{"title":"A good film","rating":14,"date":"14 January 2001","review":"I honestly don't understand all the bad reviews this show has gotten.  I think it's a great flick.  Their sets and props were amusing (i.e., using birthday cake candles for torches and credit cards for doors), and it was interesting to see the world from a little person's point of view.  The plot was very good, as was the acting, and the Borrowers' accents just added to their charm.  You really should give this film a try.","user":"Witch Hazel","rank":[28,30]},{"title":"A very fun film with a great look","rating":4,"date":"4 July 2000","review":"I was charmed by this movie and cannot understand the venom unleashed upon it by some of the other reviews.  I don't have any kids, nor do I spend a whole lot of time watching movies geared towards them, but most \"kiddie fare\" seems so saccharine and preachy, with screeching soundtracks and day-glo color schemes all designed to work as commercials for happy meals and action figures that this one stands out because it's just plain fun. The production design and special effects are unique -- and purposefully so. Some reviews have complained that the film is not set in a readily identifiable time or place, but that's the charm; set in a kind of timeless anywhere that is both familiar and foreign, with the kind of hazy details and warm glow that suggest a fond childhood memory/fantasy.  If you expect some Dizneefied, pre-fabbed, pre-digested offering that hits all of the right beats at the right moments with such predictability that you can set your watch to them, skip this.  (Or watch \"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,\" because it sure mimics the form while subverting the content.)  If you want something fun and imaginative, different from the usual, give this a try.  And if the kids complain that it's boring, send them to bed and watch it yourself.","user":"kinophile-2","rank":[24,26]},{"title":"Inventive And Real-Looking","rating":8,"date":"25 April 2006","review":"When this first came out, almost a decade ago, I thought it was the best job I had seen of making miniature people look real. This showed how far technology had come in films and now, of course, we see a lot more amazing special effects.<br><br>It was fun to view how these \"borrowers\" moved about, using ordinary household items to propel themselves around a normal-sized house. It's all pretty ingenious.<br><br>John Goodman plays a cartoon-like role, a role that is generally funny to watch. The cast has a mixture of American and English actors, with a setting of 1940s Britain. I first saw this on VHS and then later on DVD, which was improvement not only video-wise, but audio, too, as it somehow went from mono to surround sound. This might be considered a kids movie but a lot of the humor is more adult-oriented.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[26,29]}]
