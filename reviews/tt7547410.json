[{"title":"Dora You Really Did It","rating":9,"date":"14 August 2019","review":"Rating 9.1/10\nSurprisingly entertaining. This movie is just amazing and the acting from everyone was great. Dora have a good role model for everyone in this world. For me, this is one of the best movie based on cartoon tv show Dora The Explorer since 2000. I think no matter what you do, that there is always room for a good nickelodeon movie. It definitely worth to watch.","user":"ymyuseda","rank":[242,284]},{"title":"WAIT, THIS WAS ACTUALLY DECENT???","rating":6,"date":"12 August 2019","review":"OK, joking aside, we all thought this was gonna flop spectacularly. Dora has had a very rocky reputation and a live-action version sounds like a terrible idea. But to my surprise this was a very charming and pretty funny movie. It is mainly aimed at kids and that meant a bit of cringe-worthy moments here and there, but the whole product is just a lot of fun, and I'm saying this as someone who despises Dora The Explorer. Give it a watch, you may end up liking it.","user":"CriticalOfEverything","rank":[69,83]},{"title":"Remember who this movie is for","rating":9,"date":"11 August 2019","review":"As a toddler, my daughter adored Dora. My son loved Go Diego, Go. Now, as older elementary students, they had a blast at this movie, and I did too. I thought the talking Swiper was weird, but it was one of my son's favorite parts. This movie was about being positive and being yourself, and the movie boldly said, 'I'm not going to try to be something I'm not.' It was entertaining and fun, and my kids came out singing and dancing. Isn't that the point? With so many violent and intense movies these days, this proved a refreshing change.","user":"mmcox81","rank":[105,133]}]
