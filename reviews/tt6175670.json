[{"title":"Enlightening.","rating":10,"date":"22 May 2017","review":"I thought this documentary was excellent. I watched it with my father who grew up at 118th &amp; Central (1946). I later lived at the same address with my Grandparents. I remember the second uprising but knew little about the first. I appreciate the film maker for composing this documentary. I will not spoil, but in my opinion the late, great Mayor Tom Bradley had the best quote in this documentary. It is worth it to watch this documentary just to hear his quote.","user":"techsquadcom","rank":[14,27]},{"title":"I can't believe the racist people that are writing reviews here. Regardless, this movie will truly open your eyes.","rating":9,"date":"5 March 2018","review":"I've only really heard about the problems black people face when dealing with the police and from a few videos of police shootings that were completely uncalled for. This gave me a much better perspective of what is actually happening.\n The movie was filmed as you would see on an hour long special on the history channel. It's a bit above average production. I don't generally watch these types of films but the trailer for this movie intrigued me enough and the source material is something that I feel everyone should know more about including myself. And after reading these other reviews, do you guys have family in the LAPD or something?","user":"deelish-23399","rank":[7,12]}]
