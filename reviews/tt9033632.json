[{"title":"Not forced and thoroughly enjoyable","rating":10,"date":"25 November 2018","review":"There was something so different in this Hallmark film than in any other. The acting wasn't over the top and the romance didn't appear forced or random or awkward at all. The characters were all really likeable and genuine. Even the moody royal stereotype was portrayed in a way that made you like him not think \"oh here's another tv royal guy\". The direction given to the characters on their behavior was just real and relatable.\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film and hope Hallmark makes more with this direction.","user":"AnnTWillis","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Meh","rating":5,"date":"5 December 2018","review":"Another royal fantasy starring actors who have previously already filmed basically the same story.\nSo why sit through such a blah movie? Brittany Bristow is gorgeous. And her smile could launch a thousand ships. Again she plays the second banana and way outshines the star.","user":"rightisright","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Conquering Your Fears","rating":8,"date":"24 November 2018","review":"All the characters conquer their fears and along the way enjoying the holidays. It is an up and down set of challenges revolving around a skater and a crown prince. Toss in some great friends and the king's 10 year old daughter for smiles, you have a good Hallmark movie.\nI give this movie 8 out of 10 cups of hot cocoa-with lots of marshmallows.","user":"parksidedrive","rank":[5,6]}]
