[{"title":"Frozen","rating":10,"date":"15 February 2020","review":"Believe the hype - Frozen is not just a fantastic Disney film, but a fantastic film in general thanks to it's catchy soundtrack, quirky script, realistic characters and important theme of acceptance.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[38,40]},{"title":"Ok but not anything special","rating":6,"date":"26 December 2019","review":"I watched this a few years ago and remember it not really holding my attention, so much so that when I watched it again recently it was like a new film - as I didn't recall much of it at all.<br><br>For me Frozen is a forgettable Disney film, which I think would probably be an unpopular opinion! It's got lovely scenes and characters but I just honestly don't see the major draw.<br><br>It's ok, but as I said; forgettable.","user":"WhoMadeYouGod","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Could have been much better","rating":5,"date":"3 February 2020","review":"There are many much more thought out reviews that say the same, so just a brief summary. I'm a 35+ guy. I still love many Disney and other animated \"kids'\" movies that I get to watch, they are often much better and thoroughly thought out than \"normal\" movies and usually have food for thought &amp; gags for adults as well. Frozen had promise as well, but there were weak developments throughout and the big plot twist and everything after it were insulting to a viewer's intelligence.White became black, because the plot required it. Death was revoked with no explanations,because the resolution required it. It is pretty to look at and I even did like the songs, but targeting younger audience should not be an excuse for blatantly subpar story-telling.","user":"VisionThing","rank":[6,6]}]
