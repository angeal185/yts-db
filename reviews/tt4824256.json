I usually only comment on horror scripts because i don't mind watching bad horror flicks. But i read some of thw positive reviews here and I am fairly certain that they are written by people involved with the film, because i can't imagine anyone finding anything good about this movie. I turned it on because it says it's about mma, but an hour into the movie and there was no mma yet.\nPreachy, poorly acted, directed and written. I gave it a 4 but it could be a 1 if you dont even like mma.<br><br>Edit - Actually, it is a 2. It is also a poor representation of mma.","user":"Delareese","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"STOP!! Don't waste your time!","rating":2,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"Horribly written, acted and filmed. It's a cheap knock off of soooo many other films, but, done much worse!","user":"jdhalliwill","rank":[9,10]}]
