[{"title":"Horror movie without any horror.","rating":3,"date":"18 October 2019","review":"I know, from the poster, the plot, you definitely would expect a zombie movie right? Is it a bad thing if one of these such productions would focus less on gore and more on something else, like Altered Skin did?<br><br>Sadly, the case here managed to show a movie that mostly felt like someone was just followed around with a camera, without any idea what the next step is, just rolling with what they got: a conspiracy movie, and barely anything else. Zombies will appear on screen little over 5 minutes total, the rest relies solely on a quest to find out the truth, even tho it is revealed from the very start of the movie.<br><br>It has no tension, it doesn't build into anything, it feels so empty, I couldn't believe my eyes. Close to no action whatsoever. I can not possibly recommend this, as it is one of the most boring movies I've seen all year.<br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[6,7]}]
