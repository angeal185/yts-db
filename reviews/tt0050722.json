[{"title":"On the A-list of B pictures","rating":8,"date":"13 November 2001","review":"Of course The Monster That Challenged the World is slowly paced. With a budget of about twenty dollars there's a lot of filler. But what little budget there is, is well used in creating a great animatronic monster.<br><br>The story is basic but well-structured and it works. I can watch this one over and over without wanting to throw things at the screen or yell at the characters for doing stupid things. My intelligence is more seriously insulted by modern horror films and their idiot protagonists than it ever is by The Monster That Challenged the World.<br><br>Among low-budget sci-fi flicks of the 1950s, The Monster That Challenged the World ranks near the top!<br><br>Jan Strnad (aka J.

This film is much better than what most fans of 'creature features' might suspect.  The mutated mollusks really do have that creepy look to them and the cast seems to take their roles rather serious.  Tim Holt, who was better known as a 'cowboy' from the early days of film is Commander John Twillinger and while rather short and stout, he hardly fits the bill of a lead, but does a nice job with this role.  Audrey Dalton plays his love interest and Hans Conried is the scientist attempting to help the Navy destroy these beasties.  This really is a fun film and trust me, there are far worse things you could watch and this film is really enjoyable.<br><br>This film was actually based on a true story!","user":"ClassixFan","rank":[41,43]},{"title":"Giant molluscs threaten the world","rating":30,"date":"30 June 2004","review":"After giant ants, spiders, dinosaurs and various aliens, it was the turn of giant molluscs to threaten the world in this enjoyable movie.<br><br>An underwater earthquake in the Salton Sea releases prehistoric and radioactive giant molluscs.  They then start to kill people by feeding on their bones.  Navy officers and scientists from the nearby remote naval base investigate and try and stop them, but they escape into the nearby canal and start to threaten the world.  Meanwhile, an unhatched egg is brought to the naval base for examination, but this hatches after a little girl raises the temperature of the water tank its kept in by accident, releasing another monster and threatens her and her mum before it is killed.  The other unhatched eggs in the sea are destroyed by divers, and the other monsters are eventually killed.<br><br>The monsters in this movie don't look too bad, despite the low budget and the movie is quite eeire in parts. <br><br>The movie stars western actor Tim Holt, Audrey Dalton as his love interest, Mimi Gibson as her daughter and Hans Conried.<br><br>I taped this movie when it came on channel 4 during the early hours and have seen it several times.  A treat.<br><br>Rating: 4 stars out of 5.","user":"chris_gaskin123","rank":[35,37]}]
