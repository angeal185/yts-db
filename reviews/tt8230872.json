[{"title":"Beautiful","rating":10,"date":"4 December 2019","review":"First of all I loved the storyline, and the attention to detail - particularly within the dialogue. It's slow realism, so won't appeal to the mainstream audience (maybe). So glad I've seen this. Very surprising for Netflix indeed.","user":"hunter_m","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Brilliant film","rating":10,"date":"1 December 2019","review":"I loved every minute of this film. The acting was so realistic and believable, I liked that it was filmed in real time as well as it was like you were with them looking in.\nVery good.","user":"mal-86345","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Not nominated for Feel Good Movie of the Year","rating":6,"date":"1 December 2019","review":"Being a slow burn, this film is best for a (possibly mature) Canadian or Indie film fan and features superb acting. Kudos all around.","user":"bakedtart","rank":[7,11]}]
