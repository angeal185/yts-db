[{"title":"not nearly as bad as you would think","rating":20,"date":"20 October 2001","review":"This was one of the first films that I saw when I came back from the Persian Gulf War.  It is listed as among the biggest money losers of all time and when it came out it generated some of the most scathing reviews of all time. When Bruce Willis made The Last Boy Scout later that year, one reviewer said \"He gets punched in the mouth so many times, he must feel like he's still reading reviews of Hudson Hawk\" Willis wrote the story for this film, so I'm sure this must have particularly hurt him, this film put his career in the toilet before Pulp Fiction revived it. I don't think the film was all that bad myself, even though it wasn't Citizen Kane and wont go down in history as a classic I am at least hoping that it might generate a cult following. At least it attempts to be original, you have to give it credit for that. So many movies these days are just rip offs. Willis gives an engaging performance as the cappachino-drinking, wise-cracking cat burglar who is forced to pull off one last hiest. I really laughed at the scene where he and Danny Aiello pull off that robbery while doing such a wonderful rendition of \"Would You Like To Swing On A Star\". Aiello is a great actor as is Andie McDowell and James Coburn who also give great supporting performances. Coburn has a lot of fun spoofing his tough guy image. It sort of reminds me of In Like Flynt. My best advice is leave your brain at the beginning of the movie and just have a good time. Yes this film wont cure cancer or anything like that, but its still a lot of fun if you just give it a chance.","user":"dtucker86","rank":[121,140]},{"title":"Misunderstood...","rating":8,"date":"23 May 2005","review":"This movie is a classic farce (something Hollywood hasn't done much of in a while - at least, not intentionally). Situations and characters are so far over the top it's amazing they don't just float off into space. Bruce Willis is in cute smile / sarcastic wisecrack mode - more like his 'Moonlighting' days as opposed to his current action hero motif - he gets to deal with psychotic billionaires, the \"MTV-IA\", (somewhat) organized crime, and attractive nun from the Vatican. They play this one on cable quite a bit lately, and I still get a kick every time I channel-surf to it - it's good for a good chuckle several times a minute. Watch it, sit back, have fun, but don't try to take anything even remotely seriously!","user":"erik-imdb","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"You will either groove on its knowing brand of low comic silliness or you'll hate it","rating":10,"date":"13 August 2005","review":"Just sprung from prison Hudson Hawk finds himself being chased by an insane and insanely rich couple, the CIA and the Vatican in a mad chase to get bits of a gold making machine made by Da Vinci. Along the way stupid jokes are told, the plot is ignored or twisted in the name of a joke and the entire cast winks at the audience repeatedly as if to say that even they can't believe the silly things they are doing in the name of fun.<br><br>When this movie opened it was crucified by critics across the country as an unfunny vanity project. It sunk the promising career of the director and made people take a second look at Bruce Willis. very few people braved the reviews and saw this in theaters. Me? I'm one of the six people in America that went to see this on opening night. I've loved this movie from the first and my opinion has grown with each viewing. I remember arguing with people for weeks afterward that they should see this movie because it was damn funny. No one listened to me, and it wasn't until cable and home video that people discovered this wrongly dismissed gem. This is more proof that sometimes critics don't get it.<br><br>Then again all humor is subjective and what one person finds funny is not what other people find funny. I love this knowingly dumb, puny, go for the obvious, nothing is sacred or too stupid to try collection of jokes and gags. Other people are offended or utterly bored by its often infantile antics. I find it charming and harmless, other people find it cruel (Bunny Ball Ball!). I can't say which camp you'll fall into, but I think that you should ignore the critics and just see this movie. Its mindless fun of the highest order.","user":"dbborroughs","rank":[100,133]}]
