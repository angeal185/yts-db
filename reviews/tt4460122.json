[{"title":"Morality plays","rating":3,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"This movie is a series of morality plays that eventually come together as one story. As in all morality plays, the choices made, have consequences. It's a lengthy film and I feel as if the quality of the acting and writing was sacrificed. The acting and dialogue was wooden and and forced as if reading directly from cue cards. I didn't feel anything from or for the characters, just empty. There was so much potential here. I feel a better budgeting would have made this film as good as it should have been.","user":"vmalast","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Absolutely Terrible","rating":2,"date":"30 September 2019","review":"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, overly long, I got angry just watching it. Why someone would make a movie like this baffles me. Do not watch. PLEASE","user":"jschnepp-00161","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Meh it's bleh","rating":1,"date":"2 April 2020","review":"The people from this film are from \"the playground\". Weak performances and hackneyed filmmaking","user":"lr-31161","rank":[0,0]}]
