[{"title":"Geez, Erewhon....","rating":10,"date":"7 January 2005","review":"Let's face it: Hauer enjoys it. It's not about wasting his talent, it's about earning money doing fun stuff that people will watch over and over again through the years when it shows up on SciFi or Spike because it's tongue-in-cheek fare that makes no bones about being anything deeper or more meaningful than an alien's irrational fear of toilet paper.<br><br>Not everyone is going to watch 'Remains of the Day' at 2AM. There's a time for everything--for intellectual gratification, for aesthetic stimulation--and for just plain blowing the snot out of all things alien and toothy.<br><br>On the 'mindless debauchery' scale, this film gets a 10.","user":"NeuroMortis","rank":[83,98]},{"title":"enjoyable fluff","rating":6,"date":"19 December 2005","review":"If you don't like B-movies, then you should stop reading this review right now, and drop any interest in Split Second.<br><br>If you do DO like B-movies, check this one out, because it is a quintessential cult flick. Great hammy acting by Rutger Hauer and some of the supporting cast. (Note that great hammy acting is considerably different than great acting). The director actually did pretty well, establishing the post-apocalyptic mood with reasonable skill. The effects are godawful, but neat, just as it should be in this kind of movie. Lots of great one liners, especially from Hauer.<br><br>All in all, if you enjoy those good-because-they're-bad sci-fi flicks, this is a mighty enjoyable one. If you're looking for meaningful cinema... ummm.. well what are you doing looking up a movie about an alien serial killer?","user":"revcosmo","rank":[42,49]},{"title":"Split Second, all it takes to like this film.","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2004","review":"This is one of those films you see on ITV at 2.20am Thursday morning. Its consigned to forever be overlooked, stepped on and pushed away. But it's also a b-movie of extraordinary magnitude. A mix of horror, action, breasts(Kim Cattral's, not Rutger Hauer's!) and witty one liners. It never seeks to be better than it is, and in doing so is all the better for it.<br><br>With a name like Dick Durkin in the credits, you know you're in for a treat. True, the ending crumbles somewhat(kinda like monty python + holy grail i thought), but the rest of the film is low budget gold. The use of London is great, and the supporting characters such as Cattral and Pete Postlethwaite lend some gravitas to the movie also.<br><br>Its a fun way to spend a few hours if you dont have the company of a good women.<br><br>Any film where a police officer can call a guard dog a 'dickhead' has to worth it's weight in platinum....<br><br>Remember....if you're gonna watch it, be sure to get some BIGGER F**KING GUNS!!!!!!!","user":"spanky_boz","rank":[92,113]}]
