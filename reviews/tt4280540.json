[{"title":"Don't do it","rating":1,"date":"2 June 2017","review":"This movie freaking blows, I bought it because the case looked like it may be a good movie. Not only do the actors suck, but none of the scenes on the case actually take place in the actual movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy. I wish I could have both my time and money back.","user":"danielwilkinson-97050","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"A 10 For Worst Acting","rating":1,"date":"6 May 2017","review":"I've seen many low budget independent films but this has to be one of the worst. Not just a few bad actors, but everyone is wholly without talent. The dialog is stiff and forced with absolutely no realism. I keep picturing this as a play, but even most stage actors could pull off performances better than this ensemble.<br><br>How the director, and those producing this film, could have gone through the entire process of making this picture and not realize it had no spark, whatsoever, is completely beyond me.<br><br>Edward D. Wood Jr.'s \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is always touted as the worst film ever made, yet I have always found it charming and entertaining.<br><br>\"Western World\" truly is in the category of horrendously awful and most worthless films ever!","user":"siys","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"if you need to wash your hair do that instead","rating":1,"date":"4 May 2017","review":"In a nut shell this is not worth any ones time. I would not say it was bad acting but rather they can not act. I am sure that your children's school play would be better than this production.<br><br>The story line is very slow and none captivating in the least. For the scenery it is mediocre and not really used in the story line.<br><br>The only good thing about the production is that they gave people a job and chance to earn some money.","user":"chopaz","rank":[11,13]}]
