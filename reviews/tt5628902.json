[{"title":"It's the pits.","rating":2,"date":"25 October 2019","review":"They might be rabid horror fans, but the Soska sisters were a poor choice for directors of the first-ever remake of a David Cronenberg movie. Cronenberg is a true innovator of horror, having directed more than a few genuine classics; the Soska Sisters, (or 'Twisted Twins', as they like to market themselves) have one decent film to their name(s) - American Mary - the bulk of their output ranging from the mediocre (slasher sequel See No Evil 2) to the downright awful (Tarantino inspired exploitation trash Dead Hooker In A Trunk). Rabid is possibly their worst film yet.<br><br>Set in the world of high fashion, Rabid 2019's central character is Rose (Laura Vandervoort), an aspiring designer hoping to get her work noticed by her boss, G√ºnter (Mackenzie Gray). One night, while leaving an event, Rose is involved in an accident that leaves her face horribly disfigured; however, after volunteering for revolutionary stem cell treatment, Rose's natural beauty is restored, and better still, G√ºnter chooses her designs for his latest show. Life would be perfect if it wasn't for Rose's strange hallucinations, her newfound hunger for blood, and the vicious tentacle that lives in her armpit.<br><br>Clumsy direction, gimmicky editing, an overlong running time, obnoxious characters, a ham-fisted tribute to Cronenberg's Dead Ringers, and weak make-up effects all contribute to a hellish viewing experience, but what made this film really unbearable for me were the fashionistas and the models, all of whom could have come straight out of cult comedy Zoolander (or worse still, Zoolander 2). If I thought for a minute that the Soskas were going for giggles, then I would probably think better of the film, but I don't think this is the case: any laughs seem to be purely unintentional. G√ºnter is an embarrassingly bad caricature -- Will Ferrell's Mugatu is positively normal by comparison -- and the scene where Rose slashes at a dress with scissors to realise her boss's vision would be genius if this were a satire. But it's not.<br><br>I honestly think that the Soska's believe their own hype, but as the film descends into asinine zombie territory, it becomes clearer and clearer that the twins have bitten off way more than they can chew. The final scene, in which Rose discovers the true horror of her condition, is let down by more terrible make-up effects and the directors' misguided belief that they have crafted a truly shocking movie. The only thing that is shocking about this film is that it got made in the first place.","user":"BA_Harrison","rank":[32,40]},{"title":"Just nah.","rating":2,"date":"28 November 2019","review":"NOPE.\nD+<br><br>Unquestionably vapid, a vividly unnecessary film w copiously over saturated cheap stylizated CGI gore.\nThe acting is so wooden I could carve a dozen stakes out of it and go hunting w James Woods....<br><br>All the worst pacing elements you'd expect out of semi low budget modern horror that didn't learn anything from The VVITCH, Hereditary, Mandy, even the new Halloween was a masterpiece compared to this lol üòâ....<br><br>Characters w zero charm or charisma... You literally will give zero damn about these talking NPC robots 5 minutes in...when that gets old.. boom spice it up.. just add cannibalism *poof\nNow you got fast mutating plague zombies.... via 2006 Sweetness üëç<br><br>Oh, yeah, the setting takes place in the world of high fashion &amp; couture (because, Suspiria &amp; Black Swan was artsy yo).... I swear I thought the secondary male actor was Steven Tyler doing a horrible German impression... Sadly it wasn't.... sadly... It was like they were trying to add the plot of Ms.45 in for some reason? ... Not well.. don't worry.<br><br>Then the movie rips off rips off EVERYTHING from the bandaged nurses from Silent Hill in a rabies induced fever sequence.\nThe victims infected by rabies all act like extras from World War Z (on bath salts) and can transform via Dusk Till Dawn style... 'cause cool.. Someone DEFINITELY went to the red Rob Zombie school of lighting for good measure at the end of this crap show...\nThe mood at time is a dead rip off of the Neon Demon, that features a Dead Space necromorph looking prop. I would say this movie definitely took everything it could via Guillermo del Toro's The Strain...This is way more in connection w the Strain than that would be coming considered anything Cronenbergian...<br><br>Oh yeh, you gotta add with a nonsensical dramatic love interest...this is a TONE DEAF MESS too..<br><br>RABID 2019 was a buffet of everything wrong with new school horror...AND it ends with Ave Maria!!!\nHard Pass...<br><br>Kicking it while it's down.<br><br>The sound design &amp; overall audio quality was sh**... I could not hear anything when more than two inputs were being cued up...Celtic Frost demos were mastered better than some of this movie...<br><br>Some of the dialogue was clear but, the music was talentless &amp; the mastering overall was abysmal...<br><br>Regarding the Soska Sisters... Kinda hack stuff at this moment... I will admit American Mary was unique when it debuted... Whoever in Vancouver gave the rights to this classic film to be destroyed.. you accomplished your goal!<br><br>I'm not going to go into why, especially, the early Cronenberg films are such classics, including RABID, you know...<br><br>Yeah, I'd rather watch Bruce Willis in Eli Roth's Deathwish again....or a Wrong Turn movie Than ever... Ever...Ever turn this remake on again....\nOut...","user":"jonathan-missall","rank":[25,32]},{"title":"blame the directors","rating":4,"date":"2 December 2019","review":"Not close to the original atmosphere and tempo,\nvery disappointed of the works of directors since American maRY\nI SUGGEST to check the 70s version first.","user":"surfisfun","rank":[19,25]}]
