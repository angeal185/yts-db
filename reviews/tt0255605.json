[{"title":"Interesting take on a classic.","rating":19,"date":"19 April 2003","review":"First I want to say with a certain amount of authority (50 years of movie-watching) that the total of about 37% \"1\" and \"10\" votes for this movie are equally bogus. It is neither. The median rating of near \"6\" or \"7\" is about right.  <br><br>I like Kristin Kreuk (Lana Lang of Smallville TV series), she is so cute, she is a perfect pick for Snow White. I expected to see essentially the same story as told in the classic Disney animated feature, but it is quite different. On the DVD extra the writer/director explains that this version is more in line with the original Snow White tales that were handed down from olden times. <br><br>It is quite well done in places, and the use of \"days of the week\" to name the 7 dwarves, the use of rainbow colors to identify them, and the inclusion of one 6 ft, 4 inch \"dwarf\" help make it interesting. Maranda Richardson, known best for her work as Ms Tweedy in CHICKEN RUN, is really good as the stepmom who wants Snow White dead.  <br><br>In summary, while not a great film, interesting enough to spend time watching.","user":"TxMike","rank":[21,26]},{"title":"Screenwriter must have been on LSD","rating":3,"date":"2 October 2013","review":"I bought this from the $5 bin at Walmart, and watched it at home, all the time expecting something much closer to the fairy tale. <br><br>The production values were good, including the sets, costumes, and props. The seven dwarf characters ranged from mundane to absolutely annoying. The bear seemed superfluous entirely. Snow White's father was a complete wimp from beginning to end, although looked the part of a fairy tale king. Queen Elspeth was one dimensional, making a convincing totally self-absorbed beauty, but seemed to soft pedal her evil.<br><br>The story itself was okay, and serves as a stand-alone movie as long as the viewer has never once read the original fairy tale or seen any other version of it (even the famous Disney animated masterpiece), but somehow just doesn't fit together in this production. There is no bad language or nudity, so it's OK for kids, but would probably be a confusing thing for them to watch, at best. 3 out of 10 only.","user":"kirbyskay2012","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"The movie bit the apple","rating":3,"date":"3 September 2006","review":"Snow White has a few nice turns of dialogue, a plot that feels heavily padded, a few competent actors (Miranda Richardson, Clancy Brown, Warwick Davis), one or two decent effects -- and almost no life at all.<br><br>Maybe the movie should have been named \"Sleeping Beauty,\" as it features some nice sets and locations, but they are inhabited by actors who intone their lines almost expressionlessly in an almost stationary, dreamy, sleepwalking fashion.<br><br>The only actor who seems to be having any fun is Vera Farmiga, and she dies in the first five minutes. She reappears playing Miranda Richardson being her -- again, for about five minutes. She can't save the movie.<br><br>The dwarfs are lifeless and uncompelling. They haven't much to say or do except look uncomfortable, say silly (not funny-silly, but dumb-silly) things, and occasionally participate in a very awkwardly-done special effect (Director: \"Everybody crouch a little, then stand up and lean left together; they'll turn you into a rainbow later. It'll look cool, I promise!\").<br><br>My advice: unless saying \"Huh? Okay, whatever\" for ninety minutes is your idea of fun, don't bother.","user":"BibChr","rank":[5,5]}]
