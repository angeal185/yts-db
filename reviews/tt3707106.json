[{"title":"The sea is the best thing that happens","rating":5,"date":"8 May 2017","review":"I kept waiting for something to happen to these two beautiful people. They are bored, and apparently not attracted to each other any more, but staying at a beautiful place surrounded by gorgeous scenery. They are unhappy, though. It's hard to empathize with these characters. Then they become obsessed with the newlywed neighbors, watching them have sex through a hole in the wall. Brad and Angelina become voyeurs, a turn-on, but not enough for their relationship. We find out later, it's because she's \"barren,\" in a scene that is almost laughable. Kept waiting for Angelina to show some emotion. I became bored early with her wooden performance. First saw this movie before their break-up, and saw it again recently. I can recommend it based on foreshadowing of the cracks in their marriage, leading up to the real life break-up. So much can be seen between the lines. For the beautiful scenery, I would definitely recommend. But for anyone who doesn't appreciate slow-moving films, you will probably not enjoy.","user":"belalugosihouse","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"A tender and accurate portrayal","rating":8,"date":"30 March 2016","review":"I won't say what everyone else has said about this film. What I will say is that it was a beautiful portrayal of some of the darker emotions in life. <br><br>Maybe others hate to see their own loneliness on screen, by two actors they've deemed unworthy before they've even watched it, or they have never experienced themselves the emotions portrayed in this film. <br><br>Melancholia is the last film I can remember portraying depression accurately. This film is the same, though it's not as simple as, she has depression or she is lonely. Her character was real to me and Angelina portrayed her well. <br><br>If you've ever met someone and loved them more than they love themselves and despite their own thoughts of themselves then maybe you will feel something when you watch this. If not, there are plenty more films out there for you that require a lot less emotional range.","user":"jlshenstone","rank":[63,77]},{"title":"Great movie. Perfect pace for the subject matter. And great, natural acting.","rating":9,"date":"21 April 2016","review":"I have actually studied movie direction during my college years. Kindly clear your mind before reading this review and do not buy a single word of those wannabe critics trashing the film for random reasons they'd pulled out of you-know-where. The film has a great, beautifully evolving story. It handles its own subject matter beautifully and in a relevant way. Angelina and Brad act exactly as if it were happening in real life. Scenery is beautiful. Melanie Laurent does great. But most of all, I'd like to praise Angelina for picking such simple but great camera angles and not trying to overdo it, or over-elaborate the direction. The bartender/owner in the movie also did a great job. <br><br>Afterall, smarta**es will always say it had been done before unless it's a superhero movie based on their favorite comic books. Life has been done before, idiots. Movies about reality and subject matter like this should be judged on the accuracy and beauty of their portrayal of it, not on whether they break some new grounds by discovering a magical new aspect of reality. Great movie. Watch alone or with your loved ones. Pick a calm and cool type of night. Acting: 10/10 (for realism), Direction 9/10, Scenery 10/10, Casting 9/10 and Editing 8/10. A 9/10 movie for supreme realism.","user":"tarekderbas-603-133650","rank":[60,74]}]
