[{"title":"Snow Chick","rating":10,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"A\nAnother penguin documentary? Really? Isn't it time we moved on to, I don't know, foxes or badgers or something?\nAt least, this is how I expected to feel about Snow Chick: A Penguin's Tale (BBC One). But within seconds of laying eyes on the dramatised documentary's fluffy little subject - the youngest, smallest Emperor penguin baby to emerge from one chilly mating season - this Antarctically cold heart had melted like a doomed ice cap. Just look at him! So cute! So fluffy! So vulnerable!\nit was pure feathery fun for all the family right down to Kate Winslet's cosy voice-over, and felt more like a Disney blockbuster that happened to be real than a serious nature documentary.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[18,18]}]
