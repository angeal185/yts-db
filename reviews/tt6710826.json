[{"title":"A really good film that doesn't deserve the hate","rating":7,"date":"7 July 2019","review":"This was solid, the characters weren't amazing, but they had some traits and most of the acting was really solid and everyone (mostly) was trying. The effects are really good, everyone says they aren't. but this all takes place in a virtual world which explains if some cg isn't amazing, so quit it. this was really well paced and was never boring. the story could have been a little more unique, but I never once was bored or felt like this was a copy. check it out","user":"craftboytde","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Awesome Hunger games meets Jurassic park","rating":8,"date":"19 September 2019","review":"Great movie. Good characters, good plot. I wasn't expecting it too be good but it was suspenseful, exciting and thrilling.","user":"northsidequeen","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Expect little, enjoy the ride","rating":8,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"If you expect great cinema, plot, character development, intrigue, original concepts, or ANY hallmark of quality artistic cinematography, boy, are you in the wrong place. One-dimensional characters, blah writing, and utter predictability are the only trains leaving this station. HOWEVER, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's just a good way to kill an evening on the couch with popcorn. Also, the girl who plays Joy clearly actually has a BIT of talent, as does the Host. They're alright, and ALMOST break a second dimension of the characters. But who cares! If you've seen Running Man, that's a much better expression of the same ideas. Society sucks. The good guy wins. Huzzah!","user":"thaduke2003-1","rank":[7,7]}]
