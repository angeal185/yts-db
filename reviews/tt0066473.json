[{"title":"One of the best WW2 movies ever.","rating":21,"date":"21 October 2004","review":"Tora! Tora! Tora! has long been a favorite of this WW2 buff. Considering I have had 34 years to study and learn about the war since the film first was shown, I still maintain it is almost unbeatable in terms of realism and historical accuracy. An added attraction for me has always been it's total lack of a love interest. Unlike the recent \"Pearl Harbor\", T!T!T! is not complicated by any silly love stories. While by recent standards the movie may seem slow paced and plodding, the details of the events leading up to the attack is gratifying to see and actually educational. The attack action is thrilling, well paced, and in its use of models, actual planes and other equipment,is extremely realistic with few distracting anachronisms. Be aware that this is definitely not a movie to watch if you are in a hurry.","user":"ljcjpjlj","rank":[146,148]},{"title":"\"Why Are The Winds And The Waves So Restless?\"","rating":31,"date":"31 January 1999","review":"On Sunday 7 December 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the US Pacific fleet in its moorings at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  At the time, no state of war existed between the two nations.  An ingenious pre-emptive strike, as the Japanese 'hawks' saw it, was condemned by the world as one of the greatest acts of treachery in modern history.<br><br>\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" meticulously traces the build-up to Pearl Harbor by examining the diplomatic, military and intelligence events and developments on both sides.  The film is unimpeachably even-handed, telling both sides' stories simultaneously, and interleaving the Japanese and American versions with intelligence and an almost total absence of jingoism.<br><br>Japan's warmongers considered their country to be trapped by history and geography.  As the industrial nations surged forward in terms of prosperity and military might, Japan was in danger of being outstripped, having few natural resources of her own.  If Japan was to compete with the USA and USSR, she would have to 'reach out' for the raw materials available in southern Asia and the Pacific, but this would mean confronting the USA, the great maritime power in the Pacific.<br><br>The film explains all this very well.  We learn that the Japanese have an age-old tradition of striking against their enemies without warning, and that air superiority is the new doctrine.  The brilliant Japanese planners such as Genda (played by Tatsuya Mihashi) have grasped the lessons of the European war and know the vital importance of naval air power.  By 1941, battleships have become a liability - slow, lumbering dinosaurs which invite attack and cannot defend themselves against aircraft.  The way forward is mobile air power, and that means aircraft carriers.  If the Japanese can catch the American carriers at Pearl Harbor and destroy them, then the war will be won before it has properly started.<br><br>The Americans take a fateful decision to send out their carriers on reconnaissance missions.  This strips Pearl Harbor of protection, but paradoxically ensures that Japan cannot win the war - no matter how spectacular the success of the surprise attack, the mission will fail if the US aircraft carriers survive.<br><br>Throughout the build-up, the Japanese navy chiefs such as Yamamoto (So Yamomura) have a snippet of classical Japanese poetry on their minds: \"If all men are brothers, why are the winds and the waves so restless?\"  They take this to mean that it is the rule of nature for man to attack his fellow man.  By the end of the film, Yamamoto has abandoned this view and now believes that \"We have aroused a sleeping giant, and filled him with a terrible resolve.\"<br><br>The film catalogues the accidents and mistakes which combined to make Pearl Harbor a worse disaster for the USA than it need have been.  American aircraft are bunched together in the middle of the airfield in order to reduce the risk of sabotage near the perimeter fence, but this helps the Japanese bombers to destroy them on the ground.  Radar equipment cannot be placed in the best locations to give early warning, and in any event the radar data are misinterpreted when they predict the attack.  Because the attack falls on a weekend, it is difficult for middle-ranking officers to contact military and political chiefs, and the contingency plans are inadequate.  Radio Honolulu broadcasts through the night to guide a fleet of B-17's to Hawaii, inadvertently acting as a navigation beacon for the Japanese warplanes.<br><br>If the painstaking build-up to the attack is a little slow and ponderous, it is certainly epic in scale, and when the action erupts it comes as a mighty climax.  The tension is palpable as the Japanese planes take off from their carriers, black against the ominous dawn.  What follows is a breath-taking cinematic coup as Pearl Harbor is ravaged.<br><br>Verdict - A historical account of almost documentary accuracy culminates in vivid action scenes.  A marvellous film.","user":"stryker-5","rank":[185,195]},{"title":"If you really want to know what happened...","rating":10,"date":"10 June 2001","review":"...see this film. <br><br>Whether you want to waste time seeing Brucheimer and Bay's self-indulgently long PEARL HARBOR with its totally extraneous fictional romance -- that's up to you. But whether you see it or not, the real history of the human stupidity on both sides of the Pacific that created the attack is clearly portrayed in TORA! TORA! TORA!<br><br>The new DVD edition has insightful commentary by the director plus a documentary about the attack. This film is tensely paced and displays and excellent cast. The Jerry Goldsmith score is kept to a minimum but is very effective. The special FX for the attack are all the more impressive considering they were done before the advent of computer generated FX such as those in PEARL HARBOR -- and they equal those of PEARL HARBOR.<br><br>If you want to know the real story, see this film and then also check out the companion stories in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY, DESTINATION TOKYO, and THIRTY SECONDS OVER TOKYO.","user":"mermatt","rank":[137,144]}]
