This movie is shot at the Grand Wailea where I married my wife and taught my new son to swim just like Danny did in the movie!","user":"kepyslap","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"A very funny romantic comedy.","rating":10,"date":"3 January 2019","review":"Sandler and Aniston play off each other with warmth and charm, while Nicole Kidman almost steals the show as Aniston's frenemy.","user":"punchp","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Better than expected","rating":8,"date":"12 February 2011","review":"First of all, it is an Adam Sandler movie. If you hate Adam Sandler movies, then you won't like this.<br><br>I gave it an 8/10 because it was one of the better Adam Sandler movies. The plot and storyline was better than I expected; the development was pretty good as well. There were definitely a lot of points where I had to slap my forehead b/c it was silly funny.<br><br>Yeah, its highly unrealistic, but if you expected realism, whats wrong with you? Sure, Jennifer Anniston is the \"uglier chick,\" which is like saying a million dollars isn't that much money, but she did a good job in the movie.<br><br>The only complaint I had was Adam Sandler used all the lines I planned on using with the girl I took to see it!","user":"stratozyck","rank":[150,222]}]
