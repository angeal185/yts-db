[{"title":"Not the truth, but still inspiring.","rating":23,"date":"23 August 2003","review":"Make no mistake, Cool Runnings is not the true story of the Jamaican Bobsled team.  It is inspired by it, but this is not a documentary.  Still, despite that, it does capture the spirit of the team and the derision they faced. In a fun and entertaining way, the filmmakers displayed the true lesson of the team:  if you have a dream, go after it, no matter what anyone else says.<br><br>This isn't the greatest film ever and it's full of cliches; but, they work. If you can't get caught up in the emotion and excitement of the film, it's because your heart is frozen.  There are plenty of laughs and general silliness, but there is also good drama and fine performances.  John Candy showed he could deliver an emotional performance instead of just schtick. During the bobsled runs, you can't help but find yourself cheering for the team.<br><br>This film is a pleasure to watch and will bring a smile to your face.  Is it good?  Yeah, mon!","user":"grendelkhan","rank":[117,128]},{"title":"Funny, strong and endearing characters","rating":9,"date":"3 July 2005","review":"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and loving it. It is one of those feel good movies that you think is corny but somehow avoids that label. The characters are funny and endearing. John Candy balances the broken side of his character along with the inspirational side of his character very believably. Doug E Doug has some hilarious dialogs. You feel yourself rooting for the team with more feeling than you expect. The director does well by not focusing on the racial aspect of the movie and converting it to just another movie of black vs. white. Obviously you cannot expect any brilliant acting or movie making but all in all this movie is a must see for families. Four Jamaicans in a bob sled is more entertaining than it looks.","user":"shrav86","rank":[41,44]},{"title":"Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, get on up, it's bobsled time.","rating":10,"date":"16 August 2003","review":"Just saw this movie again on HBO, haven't seen it in almost a decade, and was surprised at how much slipped by me the first time. It's only sad point is to be reminded of what a loss we movie lovers suffered with the death of John Candy. Imagine what he could have done with a little more time on this mortal coil. This movie is uplifting; it's about the human spirit, its strengths and weaknesses. It explores the parent-child conflict, superstition, ambition, love, hate, patriotism and a gamut of other themes. The story telling is good, the camaraderie authentic, and the celebration of life inspiring. Follow your dreams, wherever they may lead you. When things seem impossible, just remember that there's a Jamaican bobsled team.","user":"cobram-1","rank":[88,103]}]
