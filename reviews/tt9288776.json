Although there is still a long way for this kind of movie ,but I think it gives me both a visual and mesmerizing feature","user":"y-29012","rank":[36,42]},{"title":"A beautiful, entertaining, sexy, a sophisticated animated film intended for adults","rating":9,"date":"17 February 2019","review":"Recently I saw a Chinese animated film \"Bai She\". I give this movie a 10/10. I loved it. It was beautiful, entertaining, sexy, a sophisticated animated film intended for adults. The quality of the animation was superb. I was truly blown away. I don't think I've ever seen an animated film as good as this. I hope that everyone around the world gets a chance to see \"Bai She\"!","user":"candiyar-26004","rank":[23,33]},{"title":"This movie, for people who don't know \"White Snake\", is still a wonderful animated movie!","rating":10,"date":"6 March 2019","review":"The legend of the White Snake is a household name in China. The animation of this film, very Chinese characteristics, perhaps this is why some people are not used to it. However, if someone says the word \"disgusting\", I really do not know if such a person's aesthetic is not a problem or what other reasons. Come on, people like that. Learn more about Chinese traditional culture, look at Beijing opera, look at ink painting, and then carefully understand the legend of the White Snake. It is believed that such a person will change his mind and enjoy the film.","user":"njitjsj","rank":[21,30]}]
