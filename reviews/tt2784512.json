[{"title":"The Pulp Fiction of horror spoofs","rating":6,"date":"24 May 2015","review":"Spoof movies are becoming a lost art. Lately we've been force-fed crap like Scary Movie 5, the Haunted House movies, and even more deplorable knock-offs like Paranormal Whacktivity. Yeah, that exists. The problem with these movies is that for every one joke that hits, there are a hundred that miss. Why? Because they're doing the same sh*t over and over again. There are only so many paranormal jokes you can make before they get old. <br><br>However, schlocky old-school B- monster movies are an untapped resource in the art of spoof. Sharknado and Piranha 3D tried their best, and they did provide a few laughs, but no matter how many flying sharks or naked big-breasted swimmers you have in your movie, it doesn't help if the movie itself isn't all that funny. While Zombeavers doesn't have any flying sharks, it has virtually everything else you could possibly want in a so-bad-it's-good movie and then some.<br><br>I'll sum it up as quickly as possible. Zombeavers is to horror movies as Naked Gun is to police dramas. It's insane, it's over-the-top, hilariously gratuitous, vehemently stupid, gloriously horrendous, and infectiously entertaining. The acting is perfect for this kind of movie, the writing is surprisingly clever, and the cameos are brilliant. Bill Burr and John Mayer: sounds like a weird combo but who knew John Mayer was freakin' hilarious? I know I didn't until I saw Zombeavers.<br><br>To sum up, if you like to laugh, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching Zombeavers. It's the quintessential horror-spoof stoner-comedy that you can watch with friends and have a blast. As far as creature satires go, Zombeavers puts Sharknado and Piranha 3D to shame. <br><br>...quite possibly the most ridiculous sentence in the history of language, which is only a testament to Zombeavers' utter greatness.","user":"lnvicta","rank":[78,86]},{"title":"Funny Silliness","rating":5,"date":"22 January 2016","review":"Two reckless truck drivers transporting toxic chemical products hit a deer on the road and one barrel falls off in the river and is carried to a beaver's dam. The college mates Mary (Rachel Melvin), Zoe (Cortney Palm) and Jenn (Lexi Atkins) travel to a cabin nearby the dam that belongs to Mary's aunt Myrne Gregorson (Phyllis Katz). They swim in the lake and unsuccessfully seek a beaver at the dam; however they stumble with a bear and the hunter Smyth (Rex Linn) saves them. During the night, their boyfriends Sam (Hutch Dano), Tommy (Jake Weary) and Buck (Peter Gilroy) arrive at the cabin and Mary and Zoe have sex while Jenn has an argument with her unfaithful boyfriend. When Jenn goes to the bathroom, she is attacked by a beaver but Tommy kills the animal that appears to have rabies. On the next morning, the group goes swimming in the lake and they are attacked by zombie beavers. Will they succeed to escape?<br><br>\"Zombeavers\" is a trash slasher that entertains. The silly story is funny and the screenplay is typical of a B-movie, with breasts, sex and original deaths. In the end of the credits, there is a hilarious scene with the \"zombees\". My vote is five.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Zombeavers – Pânico no Lago\" (\"Zombeavers – Panic in the Lake\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Well, I'll be dammed.","rating":7,"date":"30 May 2015","review":"This movie pretty much delivers on its promise; anybody who watches something with THIS title expecting serious genre fare is sorely misguided. As this kind of cheesy, self-spoofing entertainment goes, it's actually pretty funny, enough of the time to make it a pleasant viewing.<br><br>The characters are pretty standard issue - they're young, attractive, and horny. The girls are a little more serious minded, and their boyfriends are obnoxious. The script rarely wastes any time; once the zombeavers are introduced, the pace is effective. What is nice is seeing old school makeup effects and puppeteering where one would ordinarily see CGI nowadays.<br><br>Mary (Rachel Melvin), Zoe (Cortney Palm), and Jenn (Lexi Atkins) are sorority sisters who travel to the country for some R &amp; R, and they're soon followed by their boyfriends Sam (Hutch Dano), Tommy (Jake Weary), and Buck (Peter Gilroy). They begin to be attacked over and over by mutated zombie beavers, who were made that way thanks to a runaway barrel of chemicals.<br><br>That's all the plot you need to know for this amiable nonsense, which the cast is able to perform with the straightest of faces. That helps the most when it comes to the movies' most memorable line of dialogue:<br><br>\"We can't turn against each other. That's just what the beavers would want.\"<br><br>The characters are annoying at first, but soon become more endearing. Adding to the fun are Rex Linn as a friendly hunter named Smyth and Brent Briscoe as area local Winston Gregorson. Palm supplies T &amp; A for interested viewers by baring her breasts.<br><br>Perhaps the most delicious twist occurs just before the one hour mark. This viewer certainly chuckled in appreciation. A brief assortment of outtakes run before the end credits; for those who stick it out through those end credits (which are accompanied by an uproarious Sinatra-imitation theme song), they'll be rewarded with a hilariously groan inducing coda.<br><br>Seven out of 10.","user":"Hey_Sweden","rank":[29,35]}]
