[{"title":"Yip it is one of those!","rating":3,"date":"29 September 2019","review":"Yes an artsy horror-thriller or so it would like you to believe.\nIn reality it is just a bit of a confused drama about bi-polar disease and its spiralling costs to mental health and family.<br><br>It is quite disturbing but not in a gratuitous way as I think the director is actually trying to make a film about mental illness and in that way it succeeds as it has a very slow and measured pacing but it really just becomes a bit of a weird exercise in experimental filming!<br><br>If you like your movies weird, disturbing and full of strange visual scenes with bleak and depressing settings then this may be for you. Whilst I did find it a bit tedious it does have a certain bleak and weird attraction but I doubt it will appeal to many viewers!","user":"omendata","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Great plot twists!","rating":10,"date":"23 November 2019","review":"A gripping indie horror thriller with an unexpected ending and many twists and turns. This film is a jarring look at mental illness, single motherhood and the countless effects of the recession. Standout performances by Emmy and Golden Globe winner Kathy Baker and Hollywood bad guy Jasper Cole. I highly recommend this film!","user":"gvida","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"All he wanted was a dog.","rating":9,"date":"11 April 2020","review":"This film is much better than \"they\" would have you believe. It is an artsy, yet bleak, deep-dive into the world of a crafty, bipolar single mother struggling to raise her son in a \"stable\" home environment. A smart and imaginative take on mental health, and the importance of adhering to one's prescribed pill schedule. Seriously. Some clever plot twists, and great performances by all involved. Almost passed on it based on the cumulative score, but glad I gave it a chance. Recommended.","user":"stattshimself","rank":[1,1]}]
