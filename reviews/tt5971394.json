[{"title":"Too much music!","rating":2,"date":"6 January 2020","review":"Another movie where there's music in the background of EVERY SCENE! I'm only 15 minutes in and I don't know if I can finish. Pls end the music insanity!","user":"Pensluvr","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Yikes! Turn the music volume down!","rating":3,"date":"7 January 2020","review":"The music was so load it was hard to hear the dialog. Sounded like it was on a loop and repeated over and over. And NEVER stopped. I wear hearing aids and they came out about two minutes after it started. My hearing isn't that bad. And just about the time there was a pause in the music, it would start right back up again. It's like nobody checked the audio.","user":"gordonb-59587","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"LOVE this movie! But...","rating":9,"date":"11 January 2020","review":"Was pleasantly surprised that this movie was as amazing as it was. Such a great cast and story, and such great acting. But for the love of God WHY have music in every scene?? First off it is louder sometimes then the dialogue and it overshadows the actors who are doing a phenomenal job, it's just ruined everything I wanted to love about this movie. I stuck through it and loved the movie anyhow but that God awful overpowering music was VERY unnecessary. Like who was in charge of editing this?! Epic fail.","user":"jenniferannkoch","rank":[1,1]}]
