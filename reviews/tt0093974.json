[{"title":"I couldn't decide whether to give this movie a 1 or a 10.","rating":1,"date":"6 July 2003","review":"This movie is so awful it's fantastic. It has everything -- a lead actor who moves his eyebrows up and down to convey strong emotion, unnecessary (ludicrously unnecessary) nudity, idiotic death scenes (the best one is when Ricky shoots a car with a handgun and it flips over and explodes). Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, and the script is outstanding. Watch for a provoked Ricky saying, \"Punish!!!\" and \"Garbage Day!\"<br><br>If you get a chance to see this one, don't miss it. It's one of my favorite movies ever.","user":"amykatherine","rank":[49,53]},{"title":"Beautifully Bad","rating":29,"date":"29 December 2004","review":"Upon originally rental of Silent Night Deadly Night 2 a friend of mine and I were warned by the video clerk (which caught both us off guard since it's something that had never happened to either of us before and hasn't happened since) not to rent it; that people said it was really really bad. Needless to say we didn't heed her warning and rented SNDN 2. When we got the tape home we debated about even watching it. Maybe the video clerk was right and we should save ourselves the agony / it wasn't too late. Finally giving in (even mumbling through the FBI warning)we prepared for 88 minutes of torture.<br><br>To her credit the video clerk was right ~ SNDN 2 was bad but it's beautifully bad and it's tongue is so deep in it's cheek that it's pure hilarity. Half of the movie a recap of the original SNDN (I had never seen SNDN @ this time so it didn't bother me and still doesn't) The new footage is 100% camp gold. Boom mics and movie crews (which have been clean up on DVD) drop openly into shots. Eric Freeman's eyebrows and nostrils chew up every frame they're in and his over the top delivery makes brilliant catch phrases out of something as simple as 'RED CAR' and 'GARABAGE DAY' (I still imitate him when putting out my trash.) W/ this one viewing this movie became a personal favourite and take it in just about every Xmas since (and occasionally throughout the year / I did originally see it in July)","user":"Alexander_Keith","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"Garbage Day","rating":10,"date":"19 July 2004","review":"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Eric Freeman is such a bad actor it is laughable. the way he moves his eyebrows when he talks is priceless. there is a scene in which Ricky is walking down the street that is worth the rental fee or buying it. i don't want to spoil it you have to see it for yourself. there are so many lines in this movies that you will remember forever. Ricky is a character you will never forget and is played brilliantly bad by Eric freeman. i don't want to spoil all the funny scenes in this movie. <br><br>the bottom line is Silent Night Deadly Night 2 is hilarious and if you are in the mood for a funny cheesy 80's horror film this is perfect for you. 10/10","user":"skidiskadisss","rank":[21,23]}]
