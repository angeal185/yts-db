[{"title":"Moderately Satisfying","rating":5,"date":"18 January 2019","review":"There is nothing big about this film except maybe the body type of the main character. It is a film about desperate persons try to get back the control of his life.<br><br>The script did not have any exceptional thing in it but you kind of like the story. As the casting was alright and the narration style was somewhat funny, one can easily enjoy the film. Gene Pietragallo (Tony Duran) did a good job portraying that his life is in the dumps.<br><br>It is an average film but one can watch it for light entertainment.","user":"niaz_islam","rank":[0,0]}]
