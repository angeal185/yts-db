[{"title":"Couldn't Connect With the Characters Here","rating":4,"date":"21 March 2017","review":"This romantic comedy is probably more of a fantasy tale than anything else. There were a few chuckles and some sweet moments along the way, but, unfortunately, I found most of the film to be quite unfunny even annoying at times.<br><br>Two cousins Vivien and Chloe, Aimee Teegarden and Krysta Rodriguez respectively, lost their parents on the same day in an accident, and were taken in by their Aunt Isabelle, who owns a long established bakery in Brooklyn. However, when Isabelle suddenly passes and leaves the shop to her two nieces, she also leaves a huge debt load to the bank, who is looking to foreclose on the property asap. Thus, Vivien and Chloe will race against time to find a way of keeping the bakery afloat.<br><br>There's actually a large ensemble cast here, whose characters all intersect with each other throughout the movie. The film was directed by Gustavo Ron, who also co-wrote the script with Paco Zegers.<br><br>Overall, as mentioned, there are some moments to like here but the movie just came across to me, for the most part, as too awkward and staged, so that I couldn't connect with its characters.","user":"larrys3","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"A TV movie","rating":2,"date":"19 April 2018","review":"It's a sort of feel-good rom com with a dash of fantasy -they missed that bit out of the blurb! - but it's short on the feel-good, the rom is set out and obvious and although it's light, there there's really no com.<br><br>It's a TV movie if anything, something to waste - sorry, while away - an afternoon when there's absolutely nothing else on the telly. I kinda like the conceit although I suspect I'm in the minority, but it could have been much better.<br><br>The fantasy addition is sorta weird and some of the set pieces jar - such as cooking without aprons (as if you would) but having no flour or marks on your clothing.<br><br>It's light, not as fluffy as a souffle should be and, unfortunately, nowhere near as tasty.","user":"iantrader","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Sweet Movie","rating":9,"date":"13 March 2017","review":"I really enjoyed this sweet movie of a sweet shop and two cousins who inherit it. Great themes of love and family. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a ten out of ten is the odd subplot with the decorator and the couple with something under their carpet. I think the somewhat clumsy assistant could have been given another way to win the decorator's heart over that would have made more sense.<br><br>Still it was light, enjoyable and with a nice ending. (I swear Krista Rodriguez could be Aubrey Plaza's twin - and born only a month and 3,000 miles apart).","user":"kbeck8261","rank":[9,11]}]
