[{"title":"Rip Off","rating":1,"date":"14 October 2017","review":"This entire movie is a total rip off of \"Sleeping with the Enemy\", and a horrible version at that. They had a couple different twist but its the same movie. Although the actors in the movie are all beautiful, and they tried to do a good job but its just a bad movie. It definitely touches domestic abuse issues but it sometimes become unbelievable. Don't dare pay for this one just wait it out I'm sure it'll be on BET soon enough...","user":"BabyGirll45","rank":[29,32]},{"title":"Copycat script","rating":11,"date":"11 February 2018","review":"No imagination from the writers, it's the Black version of SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, STARRING JULIA ROBERTS. Julia character fakes death by drowning, this version fake by car accident. Instead of Julia's character stealing apples, this version the male neighbor steals lemons. Instead of Julia's mother in the hospital, this version, the father's in the hospital.it goes on, and on and on... I mean really disappointing!,,","user":"onlyveneziame","rank":[31,36]},{"title":"Save Your Money","rating":1,"date":"4 October 2017","review":"This movie is a poorly produced and written rip off of \"Sleeping With the Enemy\". If you like \"crappy\" movies, then this review may not deter you from supporting \"Til Death\". There were too many transitions between scenes, the story time line was off, and the movie was not believable AT ALL. Please save your money and wait for it to come to Bounce TV, BET or TV1.","user":"phreespyryt","rank":[31,36]}]
