[{"title":"\"Annihilation\" is transformative, gritty, the best!","rating":10,"date":"20 October 2017","review":"Patton Oswalt has been a long time favorite comedian of mine, following him through his career and life. <br><br>When his wife Michelle died tragically in her sleep in April 2016 at age 46, Patton was faced with the daunting task of being sole parent to their kindergarten daughter, Alice.<br><br>Patton handles his material with grace, anger, intelligence, humor and honest heart-wrenching grit. I laughed and wept, was angry alongside him and felt buoyed with hope in spite of it all.<br><br>Because as Patton explained Michelle's philosophy of life as \"It's chaos. Be kind\" in a bit thru which he walked the thin line between humor and sadness, with looks from people in the audience who were trying to stifle polite &amp; nervous laughter, he brought the audience through to the other side. Because there is no place else to go...<br><br>Patton's \"Annihilation\" is the best of what I love, respect and admire in comedians: they bring us to a place out side our comfort zones, encouraging us to look more closely, leading by example that a best lived life, is the examined life, and a life examined with humor.<br><br>\"It's chaos.

Oswalt's genius is taking us through such a horrible tale like becoming a widower - and, yes, one knows logically he's done this material in other clubs and venues, but not for a second do we doubt he's only barely holding himself together on stage as he tells us and the Chicago audience about telling his daughter her mother is dead - while still weaving in enough jokes that the line between a usual bit with set-up and payoff and simply... laying it all out for us, is blurred.<br><br>It's also not *all* about the \"I'm-now-a-Widower\" state he's in, as he also riffs wonderfully on Trump (just enough that it doesn't get tired), a fight outside a triangle of bars that had an epic, DC/Marvel superhero event quality in the weirdest way possible (at least to how I saw it), and what happens if you want to pitch a G-rated kids movie but using porn descriptions. Hell, he does crowd work at one point - I have to think part of that was the conscious level of, 'well, how in god's name to I transition into \"my wife is dead\" material', but at the same time it feels like he's being doing it forever - and this is the first I can remember seeing him do it that didn't involve a heckler, and it's all in a warm, mocking spirit.<br><br>There are a handful of times that I can think a joke didn't land *quite* as hard as Oswalt meant to, but I could care less; this is his most outstanding work since 2009, and the piece about the late Mrs Oswalt, Michelle McNamara, is among the great pieces I've ever seen in a stand-up special. It goes beyond stand-up into that achingly painful terrain Lenny Bruce mined decades ago.","user":"Quinoa1984","rank":[8,17]},{"title":"A personal drama is just not funny and should not be included in a stand-up comedy","rating":4,"date":"9 May 2018","review":"In the description it says this is Patton Oswalt's best show. Well if it is so then I won't watch any other of his shows because I didn't think there were much funny moments in Annihilation. Lately I've been watching alot of stand-up comedies and this one was the one I liked the least. When you just watched a Jim Jefferies show and then you watch this one it is like watching Premier League soccer followed by a soccer game from Luxemburg. Patton Oswalt had a couple okay jokes about Trump, but for a strange reason this show became just unfunny. That he just lost his wife is a tragedy and I honestly think he should not have included that in his show, nor the daughter stuff he spoke about. I don't want to hear sad stories when I watch a stand-up comedy, and that was exactly what it was, and not just for a couple seconds. No he would just continue with that story, adding some jokes that were way too long and not really funny. I guess this will be my only Oswalt show then if this was his best work.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[4,7]}]
