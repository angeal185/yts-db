[{"title":"Genre bender plus!","rating":8,"date":"30 October 2019","review":"An engaging and entertaining movie, but not for the squeamish. The storyline effectively combines elements of social realism, thriller/suspense, gruesome black comedy and a bit of kinky humour. Technically very high standard (even though apparently made on a low budget) with a solid cast. But it's worth watching the movie for Sarah Bolger's great performance alone.","user":"biljao258","rank":[10,17]},{"title":"Actress is good","rating":5,"date":"26 November 2019","review":"The way she look and the character in the movie is a perfect match. A young widow with no hope in her life pursuing the truth of her husband death. She demonstrated a very weak side of a widow but turned strong at the end. It's not the best movie but Sarah did draw my attention.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"AMAZING FILM.","rating":9,"date":"1 November 2019","review":"One of the best films I have seen In ages!\nSo interesting.
