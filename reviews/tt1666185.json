[{"title":"Like a mashup YouTube documentary","rating":2,"date":"30 June 2017","review":"The hype about this movie was unreal. Things like \"We will make Biigie's movie look like a cartoon\" were flying around everywhere....<br><br>What a colossal disappointment. To have the life of such a person and character like Tupac and mess it up this bad, takes a special kind of bad. I thought that a small scale studio would have done a better job in exploring some unknown past but instead it focused on all the mainstream points of his life trying to shove a song anywhere they could.<br><br>The whole movie had zero flow, nothing seems to connect to the previous or future scene. It just feels like a mash-up documentary that someone made on Youtube and threw in a few Tupac songs. <br><br>The point of the movie was to make people discover and appreciate the personality, vision and spirit of Tupac. To show that he was a visionary and more than just another \"rapper\" from the block who cares about money, ice and women. Tupac was like shown as someone who is only hungry for glory and needs to settle some score instead of reaching out to people and connecting with them through music.<br><br>I can't really find one good thing about the movie except the Tupac's mom who only felt like a real person. The rest of the cast is flat out trash with no previous experience acting anywhere. <br><br>If you are a fan of Tupac, avoid this garbage at all costs...","user":"arabnikita","rank":[76,84]},{"title":"Terrible film. Just bunch of random scenes with no story","rating":2,"date":"20 June 2017","review":"Damn!! Had the so called pleasure of seeing this so called Biopic of Tupac today, and well as you can see by my rating and the title it is not good. But do not think i am a hater, I love most films. And for the people who know me, they know how much I admire and love Pac. So it was incredible disappointing to see this garbage. It baffles me how even the actors involved were okay with this. This film has just bunch of random scenes, which have no connection to one an another and no introduction to lead them in, it was like the writers, and i do mean writers! because there was 3 decided to put random scenes and then were like \"How are we going to connect them? what will be their part in the overall story\" and the director replied \"Who cares, we will show the audience the progression from Tupac from child to adult and have it in between interview with him, trust me it will look cool\" But it didn't. Not only that, but some of them were not introduced or had any real meaning to the story, while others were complete lies. Jada Pikett-Smith came out and said every scene involving her was a lie and never happened! What?! Gotta be joke, right?... Nope, its true. She came out and publicly said it. I cant believe that after such great story telling biopics like Notorious B.I.G and N.W.A we get this piece of trash! I'm sorry but this movie was terrible. They made Pac look like an idiot. its that simple, he listened and agreed with people in the film from first contact, his actions and rise to fame were overlooked by him acting like a spoilt brat. his charisma and portrayal of thug life, gangster type was non-existent as he coward back from any real decision in the film. Do yourself a favor and watch Tupac: Resurrection 2003 documentary then this film! It is much better.","user":"sam_smithreview","rank":[110,125]},{"title":"Need To Re-make Tupac BioPic Immediately !","rating":2,"date":"20 June 2017","review":"This movie was a huge disappointment. <br><br>Not only was it choppy and all over the place, but it didn't even get basic elements of the story right. The guy who played Tupac was decent but failed to capture the magnetic and charismatic part of Tupac's personality (which is the most important part). The other actors were also 'decent'. The fault of this movie lies solely on the director. Now its a very tall and difficult thing to portray Tupac's life in 2 hours and 30 minutes, but this was a HORRIBLE attempt. The movie's scenes flowed inorganically from scene to scene, and many of the things portrayed did not even happen in Tupac's actual life. While Jada's actress did a good job acting, almost all of her scenes actually were untrue and did not happen in real life ! Also, it seems as though the director doesn't even intimately know Tupac. The movie failed to focus on the charismatic and important parts of Tupac and solely focused on the hard/thug side. There was no scene about Poetic Justice, him living in the shelter, or the tragedies in his childhood from Baltimore. There is no mention of his projects to bring the community together and stop gang violence toward the end of his life. No mention of him prophetically predicting his own death. No mention or description of his decent into misery and hopelessness. There was a lack of the community part of him and an emphasis of the hard and thug side. <br><br>One of the biggest things about Pac, was the way he talked and used God-like metaphors when he was speaking. It was prophetic and brought a certain chill to his words. This was taken completely out of the movie! In the Death Row East interview, they literally changed what he said and took out his comparison of Juda was to Jesus, and altered what he said for absolutely no reason! When you listen to the real interview and the fake interview, they changed it and actually made it worse than the real one. What could possibly motivate the director to change the real interview for a fake one? <br><br>There were multiple characters introduced without a backdrop or explanation of who they were. I will not mention the scenes due to spoilers but there were two characters (who were unexplained and not introduced) that would randomly come and give him advice, and be shown committing confusing and unexplained acts of violence a second later. <br><br>The director is to blame far more than the actors. The actors would have been decent if given a better script and direction. It is a tall order to fit all of Tupac's life into one movie. However, this did not pull off an average or decent attempt at it. It was worse than average and offended Jada Pinkett Smith and disgraced Tupac's legacy. <br><br>Somebody has to re-do this movie as soon as possible !!!!!","user":"bukharihassan36","rank":[56,62]}]
