The movie starts off already grasping my interest with asking the W's. It leads in to different characters going through their own difficult situations yet somehow they all connect. This film has a little bit of everything between family, friends, death, romance, etc and left me with puffy eyes from ugly crying. An absolute must watch!!!","user":"mirandareyes-09605","rank":[9,17]},{"title":"Beautiful","rating":10,"date":"9 April 2019","review":"Beautiful, thought provoking, full of glorious twists and turns...wonderful deep and grounded performances.
