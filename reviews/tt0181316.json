[{"title":"very good","rating":8,"date":"23 April 2003","review":"I dont know why this movie is hated by so many people.  It's funny, action packed and Martin Lawrence and the rest of the cast give good performances. Sure it's pretty unbelievable but so are most movies out there.  Also, the film has a solid car chase scene at the end which is a solid way to end a fine film.  The opening heist scene is also pretty good as well, a good way to start the film.  Also the shootout at the grocery store is very funny, as well as several other scene's.  Highly Recommended,  for anyone who likes action-comedies.  4/5","user":"shakey_jake53","rank":[69,79]},{"title":"Good mindless fun","rating":4,"date":"4 August 2002","review":"Personally I enjoyed this.  I often just want to sit down, relax, ad watch a film that I don't have to think about and will make me laugh.  This fits the bill perfectly and I throughly enjoyed it.<br><br>A lot of people wold put down this film, mostly in my opinion to make themselves look sophisticated. I think if most people were honest they would say they had liked this film, at least to a certain extent.","user":"robinlinacre","rank":[62,73]},{"title":"SO FUNNY","rating":1,"date":"1 November 2000","review":"HILARIOUS! HILARIOUS! HILARIOUS!  That is all I can say about Blue Streak. Martin Lawrence and David Schapell did an excellent job acting together! Martin did an excellent job playing his part.  When he lied(throughout the entire movie) it looked as if it was coming right off of the top of his head in a real life type situation.  If you want a good laugh or two for an hour and a half, you HAVE to see this movie.","user":"hurte001","rank":[40,52]}]
