[{"title":"Fitting tribute to a man dedicated to trying to hold back the tide of history","rating":9,"date":"23 May 2014","review":"Out of the ordinary western in that Native American-European conflicts are told mostly from the former's point of view. However, there is a fictional European narrator who steps in periodically. He is former Major Twist(John Lund), who spends considerable time with the Lakota Sioux after they nurse him back to health after being nearly fatally wounded by a Shoshone arrow in the back. As you would expect from such a film that borders on a documentary treatment, humor is virtually non-existent, and the dialogue and acting tend to be a bit stiff. This is all about the doomed desperate struggle for survival of the northern plains Native American's free roaming way of life. We only have the striking-looking Suzan Ball as Little Fawn/Black Shawl: Crazy Horse's girlfriend, then wife, to provide a bit of respite from the serious goings on.<br><br>Although the story sticks to the facts much more so than most Hollywood films of this era with purported biographies to tell, inevitably, some aspects are fictionalized. For example, the Fetterman massacre is portrayed as a conflict resulting from the discovery of gold in the Black Hills. Historically, it was actually related to a prior gold rush in the Virginia City, MT area, back during the late Civil War and early post-war period, about a decade before the Black Hills gold rush. The subsequent important dramatized treaty of Fort Laramie was the culmination of this war period, when Red Cloud was the top Lakota chief. <br><br>Also, the skirmish at Rosebud, which occurred only a week before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, was more of a stand off than depicted. As in most western films, the important role of cooperating Native Americans in many of the cavalry victories goes unsung. In this engagement, numerous Crow and Shoshoni: traditional enemies of the Lakota, were included in Crook's force, and are said to have been critical in averting a massacre similar to that suffered by Fetterman's patrol. <br><br>In the final scene, where C.H. is trying to escape, after learning that he has been deceived, rival Little Big Man is shown bayoneting him in the kidney, thus concluding a long-standing animosity which the film dramatizes. Historically, this rival actually grabbed C.H., who was then bayoneted by a soldier.<br><br>Some may be disappointed that the Battle of the Little Big Horn is glossed over with just a shot of charging 'Indians', then of the foreboding sky overhead, then the strewn-about cavalry bodies. Of course, other films had or would concentrated on this incident in detail. Thus, it was better to spend time on less well known aspects of C.H.'s life.<br><br>It's apparently true that, like Wyatt Earp and George Washington, C.H. seemed to defy the odds of being killed or even wounded in battle, in an era when the enemy usually focused on killing the lead chief, knowing that this usually caused the whole war party to soon disintegrate.<br><br>The film fails to make the point that, as a child, C.H. stood out physically: being unusually light skinned and with brown curly hair. This probably was significant in fostering the notion that he would become someone special....C.H. was named after his father and grandfather(not as told in the film). But, in the film, his father is given the name meaning 'worm'! That's true! When his father decided his son had earned the right to be called by an adult name, he transferred his name to him, adopting this seemingly self-deprecating name for himself.<br><br>Victor Mature was a good choice to play C.H., with his swarthy Mediterranean looks, gift for profound speeches, and proved track record as a leading man in a variety of roles. The other key Lakota leaders were also played by Europeans, as was typical of this era....Interestingly, Mature starred in another film that same year : \"The Last Frontier\", which also included the Fetterman massacre, although it wasn't acknowledged as such. Mature was on the European side in that one. <br><br>The beautiful Suzan Ball, cousin of Lucie Ball, was OK as Little Fawn/Black Shawl, which was the real name of C.H.'s main wife. This was her last film of about half a dozen, before dying from cancer at the advanced age of 21. One leg had been amputated in an unsuccessful effort to stem the cancer spread. Thus, a double was used when necessary to hide the fact that she had only one leg. With her darkish looks, she mostly played ethnics, including several 'Indian' maidens.<br><br>The background music is often rousing, and the cinematography is great, mostly shot appropriately in the Black Hills, with its occasional bison herd. Directed by the veteran specialist in second feature and low budget films: George Sherman. All in all, a decent tribute to a courageous man clearly doomed in his lifelong quest to preserve his people's traditional free-ranging way of life.<br><br>Little Big Man, who was a real Lakota adversary of C.H., should not be confused with the fictional person of the same name, featured in the film \"Little Big Man\", which is strongly based on the book of the same title.<br><br>Presently viewable at YouTube","user":"weezeralfalfa","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Bio of the Lakota Sioux warrior whose home in the Black Hills was threatened by the White Men","rating":6,"date":"20 November 2018","review":"Decent chronicle of a strong fight between the Lakota tribe and the US cavalry in the struggle for the west , paced under completely Indian viewpoint . This is a true story , photographed in the Black Hills of the Dakotas where is actually happened . It is the story of an American , a leader of his people , one of the great generals of all time -Chief Crazy Horse of the Lakota Sioux . Crazy Horse's territory was invaded by Western expansion and the constant breakment of government treaties . In Fort Laramie commanded by General Crook , Indians are forced to form a volatile alliance in their life-or-death struggle . However , some USA officers and Indians are reluctant to this unusual alliance and they distrust having Indians and soldiers as allies . When ambitious prospectors and mean traders get evidence of gold in the sacred Lakota burial ground Indians go warpath . As war chief , Crazy Horse, along with Teton Sioux leader Sitting Bull lead the Cheyenne and Sioux against George Armstrong Custer at the battle of Little Big Horn . Crazy Horse leads his brave warriors on a wild chase across the plains and hills in this saga of the old west . They elude capture , but famine , cold and constant harassment by troops lead to crazy Horse surrender and death in 1877 , betrayed by both the Whites and some of his own people . He Hurled The Lance That Smashed Custer That Historic Day At Little Big Horn!<br><br>This moving movie is an epic portrait of the historic story about celebrated Indians Lakotas against the US cavalry . The picture gets Western action , shootouts , a love story , breathtaking raids , overwhelming battles and results to be quite entertaining . It's a medium budget film with good actors , technicians , production values and pleasing results . The film is pretty well , being told from Indian perspective , though some historical events take a back seat to Hollywood scriptwriting . At the ending , when take place some battles , possees all the sweep , grandeur and noisy action of the greatest Westerns of an age long past . Acceptable and passable main cast . The usual wooden Victor Mature gives stature to the role , providing sincerity and bravura . And Suzan Ball as his Indian wife , who died early at 21 by cancer , being these ¨War arrow¨ and ¨Chief Crazy Horse¨ both of them directed by George Sherman , his last films . Support cast is frankly good , such as : John Lund , Ray Danton , Keith Larsen , Paul Guilfoyle ,David Janssen ,Morris Ankrum , Robert F. Simon ,James Westerfield , Stuart Randall , Dennis Weaver , Robert Warwick and Pat Hogan<br><br>This thrilling and stirring Western was beautifully shot by cameraman Harold Lipstein . And an original and shining score from Frank skinner . The motion picture was professionally directed by George Sherman in B-style , though has some flaws . Sherman made reliable low-budget fare for Columbia between 1945-48, then moved on to do the same at Universal for another eight years , where he directed this ¨War Arrow¨ . Sherman specialized almost exclusively in \"B\" westerns there , including the \"Three Musketeers\" series, which featured a young John Wayne. George directed lots of Westerns as ¨The Last of the Fast Guns¨ , ¨The Lone Hand¨, ¨Santa Fe stampede¨ , ¨Red skin¨ , ¨Chief Crazy Horse¨ ¨Calamity Jane¨, ¨Relentless¨ , ¨Comanche Territory¨ , ¨Dawn at Socorro¨, ¨Border River¨ and many others . He also made occasional forays into action and horror themes, often achieving a sense of style over substance . The only \"A\"-grade films to his credit were two westerns starring John Wayne: ¨Comancheros¨ (1961) (as producer) and ¨The big Jack¨ (1971) . His last films were realized in Spain as \"Find That Girl\" , ¨The new Cinderella¨ and ¨Joaquin Murrieta¨. Rating : 6/10 . Well worth watching .<br><br>Other biographies about Crazy Horse are the followings : Crazy Horse 1996 by John Irvin with Michael Greyeyes , Jimmy Herman , Wes Studi , August Schellenberg , Irene Bedard , Steve Reevis . Crazy Horse and Custer : the untold story 1990 with Slim Pickens , Mary Ann Mobley an Michael Dante .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Victor Mature's tragic warrior of the prophecy","rating":6,"date":"16 July 2005","review":"This fine western traces the life of the Sioux warrior, from the time when he received his vision as a boy, his battles against red and white enemies, and finishes with his betrayal and murder by a fellow Lakota. Victor Mature is good as the Lakota warrior who is one of the most tragic figures in western history. The film examines the petty disputes among the Indians who could not present a unified front in the face of white westward expansion, especially the rush to the Black Hills in search of gold. The film shows two of Crazy Horse's famous battles, the Fetterman and Rosebud engagements to good effect but the Custer fight gets only a brief mention and is glossed over almost as an afterthought. The widescreen CinemaScope is excellent and bathes the beautiful landscapes of the Black Hills and the Badlands with beautiful color. The music by Frank Skinner is a dramatic and heroic accompaniment to a fine film that pays tribute to a great American.","user":"NewEnglandPat","rank":[21,27]}]
