[{"title":"One of My Favorite All Time Films","rating":4,"date":"4 August 2004","review":"I first saw this film on television as a kid in the 1960s and loved it. I have seen it many times since, and am now blessed to watch it on DVD in wide screen on an LCD display, and I continue to enjoy it. Okay, it has some corny lines, and Sophia is just too beautiful... but more than that, this film tells a wonderful story of broken promises, hidden agendas, and betrayal from others we believed were above reproach... and there is some terrific character development in the dialog, I feel I know these people. For me, it is one of the most atmospheric films I have come to know. I feel the hot Sahara sun in that Lybian desert, the wind blowing sand in my face, the coolness of the water in the oasis, and the quiet beauty of a desert twilight. This film is haunting to me... and it is one of my very favorites.","user":"inoldhollywood","rank":[43,55]},{"title":"Wayne, Loren, and Brazzi; Lost in the Desert","rating":5,"date":"29 August 2006","review":"Legend of the Lost is a film that could have been pretty good, but was destroyed because of the lack of chemistry between the leads, John Wayne and Sophia Loren. They don't relate or react to each other at all, and every \"intimate\" scene between them seems forced.<br><br>On the bright side, you have cinematographer Jack Cardiff's gorgeous on-location Technirama cinematography. The deserts of Libya never looked so good. And the script by Ben Hecht was actually quite good.<br><br>But Legend of the Lost is a member of an entire genre (or sub-genre) of films that might best be called \"Two-person Films.\" That is, the entire film centers on two or three characters that are somehow isolated from society and exist on their own in some desolate or deserted place. John Huston was a master of this genre, and his films The African Queen and Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison may very well be the best examples of the genre. Unfortunately for Legend of the Lost, this type of film mandates that there be great chemistry between the leads, or the whole film breaks down. Look at the great chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn in The African Queen and the great chemistry between Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr in Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison. This is where Legend of the Lost begins to come apart. Wayne was an actor who was legendary for his ability to relate to his leading ladies on screen. Throughout his six decade long career, he played opposite a wide variety of actresses (from Jean Arthur to Marlene Dietrich to Lauren Bacall to Katharine Hepburn) and was able to light up the screen with just about all of them. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the chemistry between him and Loren just wasn't there. In hindsight, of course, its easy enough to clamor for Maureen O'Hara (who had done similar roles in the many \"Arabian Knights\" type adventure films she had spent most of the 40's doing), but I do give Wayne credit for taking a chance on the then almost unknown Loren. Unfortunately, things just didn't work out.<br><br>Veteran director Henry Hathaway directed Legend of the Lost, and after its failure placed most of the blame on Loren, saying something to the effect that she was gorgeous to look at, but wasn't a very good actress. Although he might have had a point, Hathaway was also likely trying to deflect blame away from himself for the failure. The fact remains that he failed to overcome the casting problems that beset the film. And this is why Hathaway is remembered as a good, but not great director (and I say this as Hathaway's biggest fan). The great directors have the ability to elevate a film above script and casting problems, and Hathaway failed to do that here. Of course, Hathaway would say that given the material and genre it would have been very hard, if not impossible to do that here. And he may very well be right. In hindsight it might have been better to get John Huston himself to direct the film, though considering Wayne and Huston's equally disastrous joint project The Barbarian and the Geisha was still waiting in the future, perhaps its better Huston wasn't involved here.<br><br>I've always felt that Legend of the Lost was Batjac's attempt at a \"prestige picture.\" I think that Wayne was trying to impress the critics by producing an \"artsy\" film that would appeal to them, and when it failed, he went back to the familiar places and faces that he had found success with earlier in his career. It was probably a very wise decision on his part.<br><br>Legend of the Lost is not for everyone. With different casting the film could have become a classic. As it is, it survives best as a remembrance of \"what might have been.\"","user":"ejgreen77","rank":[55,72]},{"title":"A Desert Character Study from John Wayne (SPOILERS)","rating":7,"date":"25 August 2005","review":"Wayne is a desert guide in Timbuktu and anxious to get out of town for good. Loren is a local lady of questionable morality. Brazzi is a pious visitor seeking a guide to lead him into the deep reaches of the Sahara; he's searching for a lost treasure, the location of which was disclosed to him in a letter from his beloved, saintly father who, he believes, probably died at the site. Brazzi wants the treasure to help the poor and sick, i.e., to carry on the work of his father. Early on, Wayne makes it clear he has no respect for Loren and she returns the feeling, but Brazzi treats her in a kindly way and tries to save her soul. Wayne regards Brazzi as a hollow do-gooder. A very long trek through the Sahara eventually leads them to the treasure site which turns out to be a Roman settlement. There they find the treasure but they also find the body of Brazzi's father entwined with the remains of a woman, a lower-class (or worse) woman judging by the cheap jewelry that remains on the body. Brazzi's father had been stabbed in the back. There's also a love letter in the woman's effects that makes it clear Brazzi's father and she were having an affair. For reasons that are not entirely clear to me, Brazzi's image of his father (and, derivatively, of himself) collapses and he loses his mind. His father is transformed from saint to sinner and everything about him is revealed as a lie. He no longer wants to save Loren's soul, now he wants her body and he's willing to bribe her with the vast wealth he's discovered. But she wants to stay saved -- she rejects Brazzi's advances. Brazzi decides Loren's really in love with Wayne so he tries to shoot him. In the ensuing confusion, Brazzi steals off with the pack animals, the jewels and the water. Wayne and Loren set off on foot and catch up eventually. I reiterate the plot at some length to clarify two issues raised by other reviewers. First, Brazzi's mental breakdown is dissimilar from that of Fred C. Dobbs in Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Dobbs was motivated by greed and it was his essential paranoia that ultimately worked its way to the surface. Brazzi's character broke down because the core of his personality, i.e., the self-image of the faithful son longing to live the life of his beloved father, disintegrated when he learned the truth of his father's affair. Second, Brazzi and Wayne are not rivals for Loren's love. For most of the movie, Brazzi is protecting Loren from Wayne's ill treatment because he respects her soul; he isn't in love with her. When, later, Brazzi lusts for Loren, he's out of his mind and Loren knows it (she says he's drunk). Legends of the Lost turns out to be a really interesting character study with a fairly clever storyline, good acting by all, and, as many have noted, some gorgeous Technicolor photography. One strange note -- the music sounds like a 50s sci-fi or \"chiller theater\" score. It's not bad but, at least to me, it sounds out of place.","user":"oldmovieman","rank":[22,27]}]
