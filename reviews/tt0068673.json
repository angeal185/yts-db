[{"title":"Despite a horribly low IMDb score, this is a good film","rating":6,"date":"19 July 2008","review":"Fred Williamson was unusual for a \"blaxploitation\" star because in real life, he was just as tough and good looking as the people he played--having been an NFL star and multiple black belt! And, having been a Playgirl centerfold, he was studly enough to play the part as well.<br><br>Here, tough but decent guy Williamson plays the title character. Hammer is discovered by a boxing promoter and offers to train him. However, Hammer is naive enough not to realize that the promoter (Charles Lumpkin) and his sidekick (William Smith) are evil--and you NEVER disappoint or cross them...or else! When the mysterious \"Mr. Big\" (who Lumpkin works for) demands that Williamson takes a dive, Williamson's trainer refuses--and nearly is beaten to death. So, now it's \"Hammer Time\"! <br><br>This film is a bit different from some, in that the cops are NOT the bad guys and the detective on the case is a Black man. Also, there's very little not to like or respect about Hammer--he's a stand-up guy. However, like the average blaxploitation film, \"the Man\" is White and controls many of the Black men in the film--a theme that resonated with Black audiences of the day. Plus, like other similar films, there is a sprinkling of sex to spice things up--though a little less than usual.<br><br>Technically speaking, this is a pretty well made film. The acting is pretty good, the story is predictable and familiar (there have been many boxing films like it) but it's still very engaging and the film is entertaining throughout and better than the average blaxploitation film. In fact, I'm not even sure I'd consider it exactly this genre--as it's a decent film regardless and a little less violent and packs a positive message. Pretty good stuff.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"A Quite Entertaining Blaxploitaion Movie, Not The Best But Still Good.","rating":24,"date":"24 April 2005","review":"This Blaxploitation film may not be considered as one of the best, but it's still a good one and very entertaining.The action and fight scenes are good in a realistic way, the acting is not bad, and the story is easy to follow. <br><br>Good action, excitement, nudity, a funky soundtrack and cool dialogs,<br><br>the fans of Blaxploitation will enjoy it.<br><br>Fred Williamson does a fine job,<br><br>he's one bad dude.<br><br>Its Hammer time.<br><br>7/10","user":"kitie7","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Boxers. Detectives. Vonetta McGee; Watch this. Now.","rating":11,"date":"11 October 2010","review":"You like films about boxers, and like them guys? Then 'Hammer' sometimes promoted as 'B.J. Hammer' is for you. It's got boxers. The kind with the gloves what whale the snot out of one another while mob guys who wear them tinted 'psycho shades' all the time hang in the back and get rich, placing bets.<br><br>But Hammer, adroitly played by Fred Williamson, transcends to boxing genre to make this film worth watching again and again. Forget Rocky I through XVII. Stick with Hammer. He kicks the snot out of the competition.<br><br>You like Detectives? Well, you got plenty detectives and cops walking around this film. They offer advice to Hammer. He takes it. Look, pal, when detectives see fit to convey to you advice based upon their decades of experience, knowledge, and instinct forged in the crucible of streetwork, you graciously accept it and comply. Right? Am I right. You know I'm right. So quit contradicting me, already. <br><br>Now, a visual treat. The late Vonetta McGee in an early role. Yeah, you remember her as the mysterious repo secretary and double agent for the sinister Hermanos Rodriguez in 1984's 'repo man'. But here, she plays a great role as loyal mate to the protagonist, and a real beauty at that.<br><br>Saw \"Hammer\" over the weekend on THIS TV, so it likely will be airing again shortly. <br><br>Don't miss it, or else the detectives will have some questions to ask you. And you don't answer them right, Hammer might just wail the snot out of you. <br><br>So get straight. B.J. Hammer is the man.<br><br>Paul Vincent Zecchino Manasota Key, Florida 11 October, 2010","user":"paul vincent zecchino","rank":[3,3]}]
