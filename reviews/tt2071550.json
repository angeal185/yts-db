[{"title":"Great film - if you like your films smart, suspenseful and grisly.","rating":7,"date":"5 December 2013","review":"I stumbled upon this film knowing absolutely nothing about it, and I think that's exactly the right way - perhaps the only way - to approach this bleak, suspenseful tale. So I won't spoil anything for you and concentrate instead on my impressions from the film. Firstly: great production values; set and sound design can compete with anything you normally see in big Hollywood productions. Secondly: fantastic actors, and if you're into dark, disturbing films, great story. I don't understand how a gem like this - which was obviously very well made - could fly under the radar and miss a wide theatrical release; a film of this caliber and with such a great cast should be seen in the theater. The current rather low IMDb rating bugs me and I think it will go up as soon as more people have seen the film. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a well told gritty story - I rate it a solid 7 out of 10.<br><br>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br><br>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br><br>Fun B-flicks/low budget films: http://www.imdb.com/list/YV1Lxq7WLkU/<br><br>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br><br>In an ideal world, movies would be made without the aim for a certain rating.

The less you know about this movie the better.<br><br>I came across this movie knowing nothing more than the IMDb plot summary. Hence I did not know what to expect. And that is exactly the mindset \"Open Grave\" will work best for. It is hard to say something about this movie when every statement regarding the story, characters or structure could potentially reveal too much...<br><br>\"Open Grave\" is a smart movie. Its well thought out narrative structure invites you to constantly try to solve the puzzle. This suspense is maintained all the way until the last ~20mins of the movie. The story and heavy atmosphere are supported by the superb acting and skilled cinematography. It is almost impossible to not get immersed in the movie's microcosm. There are also a few good scares and action sequences to ease the pacing and give your brain time to relax.<br><br>...<br><br>Are you still reading? GO WATCH THE MOVIE! ;-)","user":"genji-hth-106-891191","rank":[124,192]},{"title":"Be ready for a slow burn....to the grave","rating":6,"date":"21 November 2015","review":"Film quality was average and the scenes set up well. The acting starts a bit rough and ends up a bit above mediocre. Story was somewhat original, but was not presented very well. There were many unnecessary plot points and interactions that made it a bit frustrating to watch, as they didn't provide any substantial information until the end. The plot points that were necessary were explain haphazardly and were convoluted. The setup and trailer makes this seem like a SAW movie, but its quite far from it.<br><br>It's a decent film, just don't go into it with any expectations. If you can help it, the least you know about it, the better as the trailer for example will give a bit too much away.","user":"markprivinius","rank":[5,5]}]
