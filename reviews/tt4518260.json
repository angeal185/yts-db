[{"title":"Colourful great visuals,not to dark & heavy in story,a beautiful horse.","rating":5,"date":"4 May 2017","review":"Disappointed. I liked parts of the movie however it seemed to fall apart it could have been great perhaps it was rushed due to cash running out.Parts needed rewriting so everything flowed better,leading role was convincing as were most characters,wardrobe had some obvious flaws, more money more time is always the battle.","user":"babywarriors","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"Poor concept & final product","rating":2,"date":"13 June 2018","review":"Camera, lighting, art dept &amp; locations looked great! Unfortunately, the overall storytelling &amp; tone lacked a steady hand. Great work by the editor BTW who cut nonsensical scenes together coherently. The pacing is maddening as new characters are introduced too fast to grasp all the new lore they try to add with walls of exposition. Costumes look like they were made or bought yesterday. Story jumped all over the place from present day to dreamscapes to fantasy world to portal to music montages and more. I'm not sure what this was supposed to be- Comedy? Adventure?","user":"aaronmarquette","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Nice concept, poor execution","rating":3,"date":"10 September 2018","review":"I really wanted this to be a good movie. I really did. It's got a nice premise with an interesting world, but it just felt so... BLAND. I struggled to connect with the main character, Evie. All the characters felt so cookie cutter, so two-dimensional. There was very little emotion, at least that the audience could connect with. You could tell that the characters were having emotions, but unless they told you outright (which they frequently did) it was difficult to tell what they were feeling. And characters frequently changed emotions in rapid succession with no indication of how they got from one emotion to the next. When Evie meets the Queen, she goes from angry to suddenly hugging the Queen with no change in expression. And Eremon switches sides without any indication of an emotional or internal struggle, just an explanation. The characters all had to explain their motives to the audience! And even then it wasn't all that convincing. I was seriously disappointed in this, especially considering that it had so much potential.","user":"firefairy723","rank":[4,4]}]
