[{"title":"Really this was awful in every way, scripting, plot, acting","rating":4,"date":"4 December 2019","review":"First of all I can see I am the first actual review (not counting the review by a single use throwaway account by someone involved in the film created solely to give this worthless film a ten star review).\nMy grandfather was an immigrant, married to his US born wife, so I thought I'd give this a watch hoping to see some part of that type of experiences both poignant and humorous. There is none of that. Just the culture of complaint backed by no redeeming quality.<br><br>Lastly, what the heck is with Val Kilmer?","user":"random-70778","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"Iranian-American conflict comedy!","rating":6,"date":"4 December 2019","review":"1st Born is a funny and relatively short movie dealing with the political and cultural misunderstandings and issues of Iran and USA starring some famous actors like Val Kilmer and Knepper etc.\nOf course the humor could be a little bit hard to notice at times if you're not familiar with Iranian culture and community and cultural/political differences which create irony.\nAlso the movie is fast-paced and assembled well by the director Ali Atshani.\nThis makes for a good 1 hour and 20 minutes entertainment if you're not watching it to nitpick.","user":"juwedy","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"It really makes you laugh","rating":7,"date":"5 December 2019","review":"Before watching it, I though \"1st Born\" might not be funny but I changed my mind after I watched it. I don't want to talk about what happens in this movie but there are some scenes that make you laugh because they're really funny. I hope we can see more movies like this from Iranian directors.","user":"nasimsadeghi","rank":[2,5]}]
