[{"title":"Finally, a good, accurate game/film crossover.","rating":9,"date":"20 April 2006","review":"First off, the downsides: Some parts of the movie seemed a little drawn out, the film was two hours, and at certain times, you could feel that. It's far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying \"that was a stupid movie\". (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which brings me into the 'upsides': This movie certainly had it's 'wow' moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were almost identical. If you've played the games you will get a lot of deja vu. (For example, the camera goes crooked at exactly the same time and place it does in one of the scenes in the game.) Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The entire feel of the games is preserved in the film, and you will have trouble keeping your feet on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven't played any of the games, this movie will scare you in new ways.","user":"phayke","rank":[712,951]},{"title":"Best Game Movie Adaptation Yet!","rating":10,"date":"20 April 2006","review":"I'm not sure what the original comment leaver saw last night, but it certainly wasn't Silent Hill.<br><br>I saw a critic screening last night, and must say I was highly impressed. As a fan of the games, and anything related to them, my faith has been firmly established in Gans and Avery, and I can only wish for sequels.<br><br>The atmosphere was perfect, the acting was on point, the creatures were amazing, well, everything was amazing.<br><br>The town itself looks just like the town we love, and it's almost like coming home again. You'll see what I mean when you finally get to see the film.<br><br>Just be prepared for a disturbing, bloody (oh man, the blood), and genuinely creepy ride.<br><br>I'd say more, but giving spoilers would be like slapping you in the face.<br><br>Go see it!","user":"SadisticCaberet","rank":[866,1]},{"title":"A very surprising, dark and gruesome movie!","rating":10,"date":"21 April 2006","review":"You have to approach any movie adaptation of a video game with extreme trepidation. Think of the other corkers we've all caught on TV in the past: Super Mario Bros., Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil. Stinkers, one and all. Doom was vapid, but at least got close to the source material.<br><br>So what about Silent Hill? The movie opens with music lifted straight from the game itself - in fact, the entire movie contains original tracks from the game as well as some remixed score. Just as it was a fantastic and brooding background when playing the game, it works very effectively on screen.<br><br>As for the film itself, the story is a composite of story elements from the first and second games, but the final act is a monstrous and highly original thirty minutes that kept me guessing (as well as being completely grossed out). Indeed, the violence is pretty gruesome.. clever mixtures of CGI and fully made-up monsters which really add to the foreboding atmosphere.<br><br>At first, I felt nervous watching this.. not because of the visuals (which are absolutely SPOT ON.. I've never seen ANY movie adaptation that is this close to the source material.. all the comic book movies from the past few years still stray furiously).. but because of the weak opening. After I'd resigned myself to the fact that the movie was going to be disappointing, I was pleasantly surprised as soon as the main character Rose gets to Silent Hill itself. If you're a fan of the game, you won't be disappointed. If you're a horror hound, you'll love the creatures and the visuals. If you're expecting a deep movie about the relationship between estranged mother and daughter.. you're in the wrong theatre.<br><br>Highly recommended. Best horror movie I've seen in a long time.","user":"recrimination","rank":[357,488]}]
