[{"title":"I cannot recommend in any way this zombie-crazies or whatever lunatic concept they tried on 13/13/13","rating":30,"date":"30 September 2013","review":"You can see from the very first minutes that the production values of this film are very bad, as the movie goes on, (with the exception of Erin Coker) we see that none of the actors have an ounce of talent for a long feature film. But curiosity got the best out of me, since at the beginning gave me a little jump, I decided to give it a chance, thinking \"as soon as I get bored I will stop watching it\".<br><br>I remember \"The happening\" from M. Night Shyamalan, one of the biggest missed opportunities for weird circumstances, and 13-13-13, with all the bad acting, low budget, and else, and being a poor man's film, was being better than Shyamalan's failed attempts to recover and prove himself as a good writer and director. Yes, the lines and situations are absurd, but as a viewer you feel compelled to keep on watching, why? You may ask; well, I have watched some many movies, that for me is so difficult to find something interesting and driven, and tired of the \"regular\" zombies, criminals, and scripts full of dirty jokes, I look for something that can keep me from snoozing off. ButÂ… oh, disappointed again! One of the major flaws is the overacting from Trae Ireland, he plays the \"state the obvious\", over-thinking, bossy, overprotective \"hero\", too slow to realize the gravity of the situation, wasting time when he should be running for her daughter's safety and definitely I also blame this on the terrible direction. Phrases like \"nice catch\" and other witty lines made me smile in mockery, really I wished that he have been killed on the hospital's hallway so \"Candace\" gets to deal with the whole situation, this way the unnecessary characters of Quentin and Joe could have been eliminated from the script. I cannot recommend in any way this zombie-crazies or whatever lunatic concept they tried, and one thing is for sure I will never watch another film where Jody Barton (Quentin) is involved with.","user":"alshwenbear1","rank":[33,40]},{"title":"A struggle to sit through","rating":1,"date":"12 October 2013","review":"That 13/13/13 had a decent enough premise was the main reason for seeing it in the first place. With the right execution the movie may not have been too bad, though seeing as this is The Asylum we're talking about that was going to be unlikely. And sadly 13/13/13 joins the endless list of movies that have \"good premise but bad execution\", and is yet another movie that shows why Asylum movies are hated on so much. The production values throughout are really cheap, the whole movie is very dully lit, the editing is abrupt-looking and sloppy and the photography never rises above amateurish TV quality. The special effects and the like are at best risible, and the make-up is fancy-dress sort of fashion. The script and story are also major debits, as well as the direction and acting. The script is very, very weak, it is very stilted and has no subtlety of any kind. It is also littered to the brim with cussing, some of it gives it some flavour but it's overused and quickly gets tiresome, reading often of being there for the sake of it. The story is to sum it up in two words dull and predictable with a touch of annoying over-silliness too, if you're looking for any thrills, tension or fun look for another movie because they're not anywhere in 13/13/13. The direction shows no sense of character or style, the external review said along the likes of it being too reliant on the acting than on the dialogue and that sums it up perfectly. Unfortunately, apart from Erin Coker who is reasonable, the acting is pretty terrible, especially from Trae Ireland who overacts and is also a bore. With Tiffany Martinez, there is shades of talent that are not used well here, where all she's talented at or is made to do is cuss with conviction. This she does but the performance is never anything more than that. Jody Barton and J. Scott suffer from not just being annoying but that their characters, none of which in 13/13/13 are you able to root for, serve no real point. The music is generic and at times over-bearing and the sound effects and quality are bizarre and lowly-mixed. Overall, initially 13/13/13 may not have been so bad judging from the premise but from the way it was executed on screen it ended up being a real struggle to sit through. 1/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[19,23]},{"title":"No/No/No","rating":3,"date":"3 October 2013","review":"I went into watching this movie with some high hope thinking that this movie would be good after all the other garbage that we had to watch this year. But this movie was a complete let down. The cast I will leave alone cause I saw no one that I can relate to....plus the acting could have been better. The whole world coming to an end and we all turn up acting like crazies is like ...What is happening right now or these guys just rip headline news stories and try ( and rather poorly) to convince me (the viewer) that this what's going to happen? NOPE! Save your money and your download time for something better I give it 1 star.","user":"alesclavon","rank":[22,29]}]
