[{"title":"A real gem, original, absorbing and disturbing","rating":8,"date":"4 November 2019","review":"I'm glad I ignored the low rating this movie has on IMDB. This movie is made to very high standards and the script, acting, cinematography and direction will not disappoint.\nThere's no dramatis personae introduction at the start of the movie, so you have work out who the characters are, and their relationship to one another. Keep up, because they're changing!\nYou will need to pay attention to get the best out of this movie, and you will need patience, but your efforts will be rewarded in the end.","user":"Fourstrawberries","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Messed Up Love Story","rating":6,"date":"31 January 2019","review":"I'm a big fan of Wild Eye Releasing, but I didn't see it coming when it came to Dead Love. This is one messed up love story set in the mountains in Colorado. I was expecting vampires or other monsters of the night, but I was fooled! The ending is a total flip and a freaky one at that.<br><br>Wild Eye is surprisingly well made for a low budget movie. The cinematographer, original music and acting is really good. Also loved seeing Kate Linder. She really steals the show here.<br><br>I recommend Dead Love for all lovers of the genre who want something fresh and different. Go watch it!","user":"dylanaron","rank":[1,2]}]
