[{"title":"Be the empty vessel","rating":6,"date":"5 November 2004","review":"This is the story and journey of a lone man, Cord (played by Canadian Jeff Cooper), who is in search of Zetan and his book of knowledge. Along the way he meets many people and has to overcome several trials.<br><br>The story was original conceived by Bruce Lee, with help from James Coburn. In the meantime Bruce left for Honk Kong (Golden Harvest) to make what would be his series of movies that would immortalize him. This movie was resurrected after Bruce's untimely death.<br><br>What would have been Bruce's role, as the blind mystic/martial arts flute player with a bell on his toe, went to the universal Bruce Lee role acquiring machine that is David Carradine. In David's defense he does play 4 roles in this movie and is the saving grace of the movie. Jeff Cooper painfully interprets Cord, the hero. He almost lacks any emotion even when annoyed or angry his face is strangely serene and on the verge of a smile. He obviously spent time working out, but little to no time in a dojo. Also what's up with the hair ?? David's problem lies in his \"martial arts\" skills and his fortune cookie kung-fu babble. The movie seems like an extended version of the TV series that David was in (Kung Fu). <br><br>There are problems with this movie. Initially the movie was to take place in the East (China, Thailand, etc) to correspond with the various themes of the movie (Taoism, Zen Buddhism, etc). Instead the movie was filmed in Israel. The landscapes and backdrops are at times breathtaking, just out of place. This along with the crappy martial arts choreography (think Dolemite) and the repetition of extras gives the movie the feel of a Conan knock-off.<br><br>There are also some nice cameos by Roddy McDowall, Christopher Lee and Eli Wallach. The man in oil scene is priceless. Throughout all this if one pays attention, one can pick up a lot of Bruce's beliefs and philosophies. One can only wonder how good this movie would have been if Bruce would have been able to make it. I highly recommend this movie for fans of Bruce and the martial arts genre.<br><br>-Celluloid Rehab","user":"CelluloidRehab","rank":[19,23]},{"title":"The more you see it, the deeper it gets","rating":25,"date":"25 October 2003","review":"I loved this movie. I loved just about everything about it. It has the perfect mix of philosophy, humor and martial arts. It's not, as far as I'm concerned, a martial arts movie.<br><br>It's an attempt to explain Eastern teachings to Western audiences. Whether it succeeds or not, depends on your attention span and how carefully you're watching. This is NOT a movie to watch while doing other things.<br><br>My favorite scene in the movie is Eli Wallach, who plays the man in oil. He's sitting in a cauldron in the middle of the desert, punishing himself for his own lust. Too funny.<br><br>I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking for something deep and different.","user":"dreamseq","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"\"Nothing is Self...\"","rating":16,"date":"16 August 2000","review":"This film is outstanding, if not a cinematic work of excellence. The level of camp it displays works well with the oddly exotic Israeli background it was filmed upon. Many stories are offered about how Bruce Lee and James Coburn struggled to move this project forward, and how David Carradine capitalized on his fame in the TV series \"Kung Fu\" to pick up the story rights, but the work also honors what Lee felt was the essence of the martial arts. This film is mistakenly classified as a \"martial arts\" film, and subsequently knocked for Carradine's friend and co-star Jeff Cooper's lack of grace and skills in both fighting and acting. \"Circle of Iron\" also has its flaws in direction and incidental music but shines in its eccentricity, cast, zen precepts, and Cord's awakening that \"there is no meaning in life except the meaning that man gives his life by the unfolding of his powers\".","user":"Tensman","rank":[22,28]}]
