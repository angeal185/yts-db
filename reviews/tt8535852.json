[{"title":"Wow. Just...wow","rating":1,"date":"5 December 2018","review":"I don't think that I've ever seen anything quite this badly done. It has the feel of two twelve year olds who've gotten a hold of some inferior animation software and a Dollar Store CD of Christmas music and daddy's Christmas stash. Truly, utterly awful on every level. Hopefully, the creators have decent day jobs.","user":"ImNotDeadYet","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"There should be a zero star option","rating":1,"date":"10 November 2019","review":"...Or even negative stars. My son is 2 and I'm really trying to introduce him to Christmas. This was THE worst movie to watch with him. I didn't make it more than 10 minutes through. I'm still uncomfortable. The animation is terrible, the voices are creepy. Santa and the \"reindeer\" are straight out of a Christmas horror. My husband didn't believe when I told him it was terrifying. He had to look himself. Now he can share in my nightmares.","user":"kimmergibbler","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"So bad it's good!","rating":1,"date":"17 December 2019","review":"The opening scene with jawless reindeer is awful, but don't worry, it gets worse. The red nosed, red tailed pink rabbit, dancing naked is the stuff of nightmares. Attempts to show crudely animated, non-synced characters do the Macarena, strum air guitars, and twerk only make things worse, worser, and worseth (yes this film rates a new word to describe it). With the right attitude, sub-basement expectations and a bit of extra rum in your nog, this film actually fits in the \"it's so bad it's good\" category.","user":"oldkirby","rank":[2,2]}]
