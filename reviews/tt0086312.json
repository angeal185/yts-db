[{"title":"America the beautiful","rating":9,"date":"31 July 2004","review":"The lives of working class Americans are shamefully under-represented by Hollywood, and when a poor person is depicted (as something other than a criminal), it's almost always with the subtext of hope and the American dream.  But hope isn't what drives someone, like the real-life Karen Silkwood, to risk her life working with plutonium for the only employer in a company town.  Silkwood didn't find hope, but she did get scared, and angry, and put her job (and those of her colleagues) at stake to uncover dangerous practices before dying a mysterious death.  'Silkwood' the movie doesn't give us the glib conclusions of a conspiracy thriller (it refrains from giving an opinion on her cause of death), but it does give an excellent portrait of life at the bottom, and the mounting sense of claustrophobia and paranoia that accompanied Karen's perilous voyage of discovery.  Meryl Streep does an excellent job in the title role, portraying a woman gradually losing her sanity, and the whole cast is good, even Cher in an unglamorous role.  In conclusion, this is a serious and important film; and a reminder for the fortunate how hard, and ugly, life can be, even in the \"land of the free\".","user":"paul2001sw-1","rank":[59,61]},{"title":"what you have done for others","rating":13,"date":"13 February 2007","review":"I saw \"Silkwood\" again recently, and it seemed to make sense of the past 25 years of my life -- I finally understood why I began doing what I do.<br><br>When I was sixteen years old I broke both legs, and was out of school for two months. But twice a week my father, who worked nights as a security guard at the Kerr-McGee office building, took me downtown to the federal courthouse in Oklahoma City, to watch the proceedings of the Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee trial during morning sessions. He insisted I go, he said, \"So you'll learn something.\" I learned a lot about people then, and about the law, and the experience certainly took my mind off my own physical discomfort.<br><br>Mr. Paul, an excellent corporate lawyer, represented Kerr-McGee, which leased the operation of the plutonium plant in Crescent, Oklahoma, about thirty miles north of here. Mr. Spence represented the children of Karen Silkwood. Mr. Paul and his six associates seemed to change their suits every day. Perhaps they didn't want to see like the \"great gray wall\" -- which was the stereotype of corporate lawyers. But the net effect of seven men striving to seem individual was that of a great plumed serpent preparing to devour any small creature in its path. Mr. Spence, on the other hand, wore the same buckskin fringed coat each day. Each day he would place his Stetson on his table. He and the hat sat in splendid silence while the Kerr-McGee attorneys conferred and whispered.<br><br>Both men counted on the sentiments of a working-class jury. Mr. Paul figured people would recognize the contribution made to the community by Kerr-McGee, a locally owned business with world-wide influence, which provided many jobs to people here. Mr. Spence counted on them harboring deep suspicions, after having been treated like throw-away people for so many years by other employers of the same size as Kerr-McGee. My father was such a person. He worked for Kerr-McGee, but he distrusted corporate politics, and rightly figured they'd let him go right before he qualified for a pension. Later, that's exactly what happened.<br><br>Mr. Spence has sued the corporation for 2 million dollars. But the jury awarded him, and Karen Silkwood's children, five times that much. Later, thanks to an excellent foundation laid by Mr. Paul, Kerr-McGee was able to get the conviction overturned, then eventually settled for a payment of 1 million dollars to the grown children. Of course, Mr. Spence took about half of that, and after taxes, I suppose each of the three children had about enough to get a college education, or to buy a new truck and have a down payment on a house.<br><br>That's what happened to me. My father died not longer after being let go by Kerr-McGee. There was enough insurance money to pay for my college education. Then my mother died. For many years the social atmosphere in the Kerr-McGee offices, where one of my friends worked as a draftsman, prevented anyone from ever saying anything good about Karen Silkwood. I will not repeat was generally said about her, or her social life, her motivations or her politics. <br><br>I never met her, but I did see and hear the people who were for Karen Silkwood, and those who were against her, at the trial. It was clear to me that whatever else she may have been, she was a courageous person. By the time the movie was released, I was a junior in college, and suddenly changed my major to drama. After graduation, I found work with a film production company which filmed herds of cattle -- \"Video Auction\" was its name. Then I went to California, where I taught drama, or worked as a stage manager, for twenty years.<br><br>Watching \"Silkwood\" last week, for the first time in 24 years, reminded me of what the trial, and later the movie, showed me -- the part of you that lasts is what you have done for others. The lawyers will take everything else.","user":"marycadney","rank":[87,93]},{"title":"Fear on many levels","rating":9,"date":"28 March 2004","review":"Anytime someone asks me what I'd consider the scariest movie ever, I say \"Silkwood,\" and they say \"But that's not a horror movie.\"<br><br>No?<br><br>There is so much to fear here, and scariest of all, probably, is the fact that the title character lived just a few decades ago, in modern-day America.<br><br>There is the fear that comes from living in poverty, or right on the edge of it.  Silkwood, her cohorts, and most of her coworkers have little education; they live humble lives of church revivals, rebuilt cars, and \"mystery meat\" sandwiches brought for lunch in brown paper bags.  The nuclear plant where they work is the only game in town (or the entire state), in terms of wages and benefits.  And so, every day, they live in fear of losing their jobs. They have spent their lives being instructed to trust authority and submit to it.  They are intimidated by the managers and supervisors who frown on camaraderie, and positively scowl on their labor union.<br><br>\nThere is the fear of the unknown at the plant -- trucks being dismantled and buried behind barbed wire, under guard and under cover of darkness. Management gives the workers the minimum amount of information they need to perform their jobs, and often withhold or disguise facts that are essential to their very survival.<br><br>Karen, a somewhat rebellious, less-than-conscientious worker, is shocked into activism when her co-worker Thelma, becomes exposed to radioactive contamination, or \"cooked.\"  For me, this sequence is one of the most disturbing.  Thelma is probably only in her 40s, but she looks like she's ready for retirement, due to the hard life she has lived.  Her daughter is dying of cancer, and she herself wears wigs most days, because her hair is falling out.  It's hard to watch the weeping, pleading Thelma being forcibly scrubbed head to toe with a stiff brush, water being shot into her eyes and nose, in a dubious attempt to \"decontaminate\" her.  She is then patronized by a doctor who straight-facedly assures her that she has only superficial exposure and will be just fine.<br><br>There is fear when Karen sticks her neck out -- talking to union reps, traveling to Washington, and being sent back to work with a dangerous assignment: to gather evidence.  At one point in the film, absolutely no one is supporting her.  Her roommate feels resentful and rejected; her boyfriend has moved out, jealous of her involvement with the sophisticated people from Washington, and her co-workers treat her like a pariah, afraid that being seen talking to her will brand them as troublemakers, endangering their jobs, or even their lives.<br><br>Their worries seem more and more valid as the movie progresses.  She walks into a roomful of supervisors, and they all fall silent.  Suddenly, every time she walks past a radiation monitor, the alarms sound and she, like Thelma, is dragged to the dreaded decon room, where her skin is scrubbed raw -- torture chillingly disguised as medical necessity.  Even her home is no longer safe.  Plutonium is found in a urine sample that she brings from home, and every item in her house--right down to the wallpaper--is emptied and taken away from her.  Her stone-faced, smooth-talking boss is right there, encouraging her to sign a statement that will undoubtedly absolve the company of any responsibility.<br><br>The headlights Karen sees in her rear-view mirror are not the last thing we see that frightens us.  It's her wrecked car being slowly towed past the restaurant where a union meeting is still in progress.<br><br>\nThe movie hits so many of our fear buttons: Helplessness, loneliness, rejection, vulnerability, and finally, the bottom-line thing we all fear the most.  The most encouraging note is the awareness that anyone who sees this movie will come away with.  It's a blueprint for empowerment.<br><br>e.w.","user":"rwd4evr","rank":[87,93]}]
