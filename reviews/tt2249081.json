[{"title":"Worth watching. They tell an incredibly important story well.","rating":10,"date":"22 April 2018","review":"The story of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission should be required viewing as far as I'm concerned. The actors and director clearly care about this story and they have told it well. I'm a white South African with family that were in the police and military during this time. I think this movie is incredibly well done. Don't worry about the camera angles and makeup; just watch, enjoy, and maybe even learn something. <br><br>My favourite exchange:\n\"Do you know what Paradise Lost is?\"\n\"A nightclub?\"\n\"No, you clutch plate. It's a poem... about me!\" <br><br>Cheers,\nPierre","user":"sutherland-pierre","rank":[39,45]},{"title":"A must-see!","rating":10,"date":"12 August 2018","review":"This movie evoked many emotions, good and bad. It depicts what we as human beings are capable of at both ends of the spectrum. A difficult one to watch if you're a sensitive, caring person but, trust me, there IS a pay off in the end! Faith and love always.","user":"baileyl-35500","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"A worthwhile watch and one extraordinary scene at the end.","rating":7,"date":"22 May 2018","review":"I had a job to recognise Forest Whittaker when the movie started because the make up was so good, and his normal facial expressions and mannerisms were just not there for this movie, quite rightly so to because he portrayed Desmond Tutu so very well.<br><br>Eric Bana's portrayal was so brilliant that you really hated the man and became engrossed in the interplay between him and Tutu, which in itself was interesting to watch.<br><br>I won't go into the details and spoil everything, but one of the scenes towards the end of the movie was one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I have ever seen in any movie, anywhere, and surely the actors must have received a standing ovation from the crew after it was filmed.<br><br>Don't be put off by the poor reviews, because this is a movie worth watching and you may well learn something along the way.","user":"philsk","rank":[21,25]}]
