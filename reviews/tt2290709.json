[{"title":"better acting in my fish-tank","rating":1,"date":"13 April 2014","review":"Take all the actors out and replace them with ones who can act and use more than one or two facial expressions then possibly it could work. Oh and a corpse that doesn't breathe, although by far she was the better actress so that says a lot. Worst film I have seen in ages. Says I have to write ten lines before I can submit this review. ...I am not sure I can come up with anything more valuable to persuade you not to waste your time. If you do have a fish tank then perhaps buy some popcorn and settle down in front of it and enjoy an action packed fish frenzy of aquatic pleasure. It will be a far more valuable use of your time. Is that ten lines yet? I have put more effort and time into this than the whole film . Right.....off to sprinkle some fish flakes........","user":"alec-817-763002","rank":[70,82]},{"title":"Is Acting Really That Hard?","rating":4,"date":"27 October 2014","review":"There's something to be said about how bad a film is, when the first ten minutes pass and you're wondering more about how it got made than the plot itself.<br><br>The acting is bizarre. It reminds me of drama classes in high school, where a prompt to \"look happy\" means smiling maniacally whilst staring at a single point in the distance like a crazy person. Or the instruction to be the \"stoner chick\" ends up like the only knowledge the actress has of drugs is a \"Just Say No!\" education commercial.<br><br>An early scene sets the tone. A curious girl and some guy (...boyfriend? I honestly have no idea) wander into an abandoned, haunted house. The script has the girl stating at least 5 times how weird the place is, even though it actually doesn't resemble anything other than an old house with cobwebs. Seriously, it's not even dark in there. <br><br>Then we're introduced to a couple who have moved to the area following a \"tragic event\". Fair enough, but when we see the wife in the bathroom looking upset, music suddenly roars into life, completely obliterating the mood. Is it background music? Is it a CD the wife put on? Where the hell did it come from? And WHY IS IT SO LOUD?! <br><br>Still, I'm only fourteen minutes in. <br><br>The next scene shows the wife making breakfast and the husband doing his best not to act in any kind of realistic way, by stating that he can't share breakfast as he's late for work, but then weirdly taking absolutely ages to drink a glass of OJ and take two bites of toast. Sad wife (I think, she's got that weird look in her eyes again - and not because of her acting) looks at a photo of her daughter (ah, so that's the tragic event) and then runs out of the house, and then just appears in the middle of a country road with photo in hand. But this isn't lost time, or a fugue state. She's just...walking there.<br><br>I've got another hour and a quarter of this. Can't wait.","user":"Arfpint","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Don't expect anything extraordinary to appear here...","rating":3,"date":"15 April 2014","review":"While there are far better and worse possession movies out there, then \"The Appearing\" really didn't bring anything new to the genre, nor did it manage to differentiate itself from many other movies in the genre.<br><br>The storyline was easy to follow, perhaps a bit too simple at times, but it was weighed down by the fact that the movie never really got up into gear and left its mediocre pace in its wake.<br><br>The acting in the movie was wooden at best, and there weren't really any particular performances that stood out in any way. There was an shadow cast over the entire movie, from what appeared to be a fact that people weren't really putting their souls and wholeheartedly efforts into this movie.<br><br>The effects were actually adequate, as were the storyline of the movie. Well, don't go and expect multi-million dollar effects here though, but the effects were used to good extend and did their jobs well enough.<br><br>If it was deliberate that there were absolutely no chemistry between Rachel (played by Emily Brooks) and Michael (played by Will Wallace), then director Daric Gates did a good job, because there were absolutely no on-screen chemistry between these two at all. It does put a notion into the mind though; was it because the characters were growing apart and becoming estranged because of the death of their daughter, or if it was because of the lack of talent of the actors, well...<br><br>For a horror / thriller movie, then \"The Appearing\" was frightfully devoid of anything even remotely scary or shocking.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[16,20]}]
