[{"title":"A poor man's James Bond","rating":5,"date":"11 October 2005","review":"Playing a cross between James Bond and Jackie Chan, Sho Kosugi is likable enough, but unlike Jackie when he does a stunt the camera is too far away from him and it's hard to know if he is doubled or not (if you stick around for the end credits, you'll discover that he WAS doubled on at least two occasions), and unlike Bond the action of the movie is limited to one location (Malta) most of the time, plus there isn't too much of it. Jean Claude Van Damme makes an awesome villain, but his two major showdowns with Kosugi are rather disappointing. In the role of a female CIA agent, Doran Clark handles her two opportunities for action capably - she should have gotten more. The funniest thing about this film is that Kosugi shows little chemistry with his on-screen kids, even though they are his kids in real life as well!

Its plot, acting and direction are enjoyable but not really memorable.<br><br>And I'm no expert in martial arts movies, so I can't review Sho Kosugi and Jean-Claude Van Damme fighting performances in this flick.<br><br>But I nevertheless find it to be an entertaining and refreshing movie because:<br><br>a) It is slow-paced compared to movies churned out by Hollywood nowadays. I can't stand shaky cam photography nor \"frantic\" editing. I find 1980s pop-corn flicks quite relaxing.<br><br>b) It is full of nice sights of Malta, a location you very rarely see in motion pictures. Its fortifications, distinctive architecture, sunny beaches, beautiful landscapes... It's quite refreshing to enjoy the beauties of an oft-overlooked location in movie-making. Malta is the real star of this picture.<br><br>c) Doran Clark. She's a beautiful woman and quite convincing as the CIA agent \"babysitting\" the two kids. Why we haven't seen her in more movies is beyond me.<br><br>All in all, this flick is a guilty pleasure, but for good reasons.","user":"naughtyjimmy","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"watchable,but nothing spectacular","rating":5,"date":"7 April 2011","review":"this action movie staring Sh√¥ Kosugi and Jean-Claude Van Damme was not all that exciting,but it was watchable enough.there isn't really a lot of action in the movie.Van Damme plays one of the villains here and has two showdowns with Kosugi.both fight scenes are OK,but not thing spectacular and of very short duration.the movie itself wasn't boring,but it wasn't exactly exciting either.it's one of movies where you can take it or leave it.i doubt i would watch again anytime soon.it has a rating of 3.2 here on this site.i would rate it a bit higher than that,as i didn't find it awful,just underwhelming.for me,Black Eagle is a low 5/10","user":"disdressed12","rank":[6,6]}]
