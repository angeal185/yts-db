[{"title":"Some Pretty Skinny Women yes","rating":6,"date":"6 April 2019","review":"But it is a horrid display of touristic propaganda at its best Simply calling something a romance doesn't make it one. You actually need to supply romance and feelings, not a handful of obvious biased opinions. Very see-through if you've ever actually done something romantic. Poor job, shame on the studio for allowing this tripe.","user":"frejuphotr","rank":[115,167]},{"title":"The Only Thing This Film Had Going For It Were the Women","rating":22,"date":"22 September 2019","review":"They were not low-brow and trashy and did not have neck tattoos and calf tattoos and nose rings and so on and so forth.<br><br>Otherwise, the story was shallow and clearly a product placement exercise by Singapore tourism.","user":"tremoncyprian","rank":[44,60]},{"title":"Not A Film For Me","rating":26,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"I wasted my money and should not have watched it.<br><br>Everything I hate is in this film: backstabbing, lying, gold diggers, people who think wealth and being rich is cool, Christians, piano music etc. etc.","user":"lxsjhyad","rank":[243,375]}]
