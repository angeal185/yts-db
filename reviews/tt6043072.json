[{"title":"Untogether....more like...Uninspired and Undirected!","rating":1,"date":"26 April 2018","review":"I was at a screening in Tribeca and barely made it through this incredibly boring movie. If you thought Jamie Dornan was a terrible actor after 50 shades wait till you see the homeless version of Christian Grey (That beard.....god!) in this movie having a \"Friends with Benefits\" relationship with the disgustingly sloppy Jemima Kirke. The two have as much chemistry as Bin Laden and George W did and there is nothing original about this story or its predictable conclusion. It's clear this director must have had a \"Friends with Benefits\" relationship with someone to have gotten this made. Billy Crystal was it's only saving grace and everytime he appeared it was like being given a glass of ice water in hell!","user":"anonymoustipster-04593","rank":[35,69]},{"title":"Don't waste your time","rating":1,"date":"10 February 2019","review":"This is one of the worst movie that I ever seen. The script is poor . Finally I understand why did they wait more than two years for show this movie. The only good in the movie is Jamie Dornan, but if you want to watch this because of him, go and see A private war or My dinner with Herv√©. Don't waste your money and your time on this movie, it's not worth it. They should rename it for Unwatchable.","user":"szasza-11403","rank":[14,25]},{"title":"Jamie was a superB only in fifty shades","rating":1,"date":"14 April 2019","review":"This is not his style. A messy man with messy beard. He was horrible.\nFifty shades made both Jamie and Dakota the symbol of Love, sex and beauty.\nBut don't waste your time and money for this horrible movie","user":"mdghargh","rank":[11,19]}]
