[{"title":"what a waste ?!","rating":1,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"Unfortunately there are no more options than ZERO here for rating :).\ni would give this trash -10.\ni am always wondering how IMDB agree to ad these kind of movies on page.<br><br>Any ways .. DO NOT waste your time to even see the TRAILER of this joke.","user":"nicetime2u","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Could only get through the first 20 minutes.","rating":2,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"I'm dumbfounded how this movie currently has 7.3 stars and three favorable critic reviews. It was so amateurish and painful to watch that I just couldn't continue and had to turn it off. When I finally said \"That's enough\" and stopped it my girlfriend wanted to know what took me so long. The first 20 minutes were awful and based on the level of filmmaking competence shown I don't see how it could have improved. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.","user":"alanfiske","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Total crap","rating":1,"date":"2 January 2020","review":"Even if this movie was for the kids they too would scratch their hair off with such stupid story plot and below average acting. What would you expect from a 72 mins movie. Nothing but a baseless movie. I don't know who invests their money on making such movie.","user":"emadasgar","rank":[2,3]}]
