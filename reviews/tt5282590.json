[{"title":"An interesting thriller/romantic comedy/a lot of other things","rating":7,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"I won't spoil a thing for you, but a while back I got the chance to see this film at the Knoxville Horror Film Festival of 2018. I didn't expect much going in, but it quickly subverted my expectations. What really holds this film together are the stellar performances and a tight/solid direction. The film has a few missteps here and there, but nothing too distracting (certainly nothing that makes the film any less enjoyable).<br><br>Sorry for the vague review, but I genuinely think it's best for the viewer to go in blind with this film. I did, and I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely on my list of movies to pick up once they're released (hopefully physically). Fingers crossed that this film gets picked up for distribution.","user":"allenlopez-16028","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"Started off ok","rating":4,"date":"16 February 2020","review":"Starts off ok. Decent acting and a plot thickening. Then just suddenly goes down hill at full speed with pathetic acting and unbelievable stupid desicions that you just can't sit back and enjoy it for what it is, it just goes right off the rails into a brick wall.<br><br>Don't bother.","user":"MikeHunt1075","rank":[4,8]}]
