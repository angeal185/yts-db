[{"title":"Greatest Terrible movie EVER!!!","rating":10,"date":"28 November 2005","review":"Writing this comment is the hardest thing I have ever had to do. The magnitude of this movie cannot be defined. It has it all: Japanese/Mexican Crime Lord with Mullet? Check. Guy who dies 4 different times because they didn't know enough people who wanted to be in this movie? Check. Random nurse scene with even more random clips of black partner's facial responses to nurse's comments about size of samurai cop's \"sword\"? Yes, that too is in it. Basically, if you ever saw a terrifically bad movie, and liked it, you will bow down to the awesome power of Amir Shervan's cinematic genius.<br><br>Smaurai Cop spares no expense. It gives you what you really want: Boobs, Racial Comments, Excessive Groping of Handgun by a Lacky, Fight scene with obvious continuity issues, Pimp Van in fast motion chase scene, Disturbingly Effeminate Waiter, 4 different samurai wigs, Matt Hannon acting, and too many other priceless moments to recount.<br><br>I am not sure how Amir got Robert Z'Dar and Gerald Okamura on this film (considering their \"star power\"), but thank God he did. This movie does not get the credit it deserves. It is one of cinema's greatest gems and should be recognized as such. Please, if you have watched this movie, and loved it, comment now!","user":"ill_bite_your_nose_off","rank":[103,108]},{"title":"A must for trashy film completest!","rating":10,"date":"16 April 2005","review":"Written and directed by one Amir Shervan, SAMURAI COP is the kind of cinema I live for. An action picture so wrong headed and mixed up that it is hard to believe anyone kept a straight face while making (or screening) it. It is a movie so bad that B-movie queen Melissa Moore leaves it off her resume to leave room for more respectable titles such as Hard to Die, Evil Spawn and The Invisible Maniac. Heck, she even thought Vampire Cop was worthy enough to put on there.<br><br>Lead Matt Hannon, apparently a onetime bodyguard for Stallone, gives an incredibly one-dimensional performance, mostly relying on his hair to convey his emotions. The problem is apparently Hannon cut his hair halfway through shooting and is forced to wear the funniest dime-store woman's wig ever during huge chunks of the film. The sheer fact that he fails to ever show a single emotion (outside of his hair) is a monumental achievement in itself. The fact that no one on set even bothered to mention this to him is even better. I guess the producers felt his tanned and chiseled body (along with the aforementioned hair) would do all the talking. But you know you have a problem when the male star's swimsuit is skimpier than his female co-star's.<br><br>Of course, his co-stars help him along by maintaining the same level of stiffness. Only Matt Frazer shows some form of life, hamming it up incredibly as Samurai's partner Frank. You can tell that director Shervan walked out of LETHAL WEAPON 2 (1989) that summer with visions of SAMURAI COP dancing in his head. Although the back and forth banter displayed here between partners consists of jokes about Frank's butt (when Samurai isn't making sexual innuendo jokes that is). Robert Z'Dar, sporting a beard and referred to as a Japanese hit-man (!), is relatively subdued when compared to his work in the same year's TANGO &amp; CASH (has anyone tagged both ends of the film-making spectrum like that in one year?). The previously mentioned Moore and single named co-star Cameron (adult film performer Alexis Firestone) provide the requisite nudity. Interesting to see Cameron adopt a more porn sounding name for her mainstream debut. Not to be outdone, Shervan also allows B-movie vets Z'Dar and Okamura to show some skin, something I'm sure their fans have never demanded.","user":"udar55","rank":[46,51]},{"title":"So bad it's genius!","rating":3,"date":"3 April 2009","review":"Second viewing of this trash epic confirms that my initial 10/10 was anything but unwarranted. You know you're getting awfully close to the absolute nadir of b-movie cinema, to that horrifying point of no return beyond all shame and therefore beyond reproach, when your name is Amir Shervan and you go on to follow up your cheapo Lethal Weapon cash-in called 'Hollywood Cop' with a cash-in on Maniac Cop by casting Robert Z'dar in a movie called 'Samurai Cop', a no-budget action crime flick where Z'dar is neither samurai nor cop (not even a maniac for that matter), where even protagonist Matt Hannon, actor in the broadest sense of the term, looks more like a poolboy instead of a samurai. Of course when you make an entire movie for no other reason than to cash-in on the larger-than-frame persona of an actor who made a career playing such refined characters as Igor, Mongoose, Brutis, Cobra Khan, Bongo and of course let's not forget the aptly descriptive Face (!) in Tango and Cash, it's not so much a question of good or bad, but whether it's going to be \"this makes even Battlefield Earth seem watchable\" bad or \"break out the beers - Lady Terminator\" bad.<br><br>Thankfully you don't need to get any further than the opening 15 minutes to know the answer to the above question; a staggeringly amazing prologue of b-movie awesomeness which, among other things, serves to introduce the Katana Gang, which counts within its ranks a red-haired chick whose entire contribution to the gang is announcing the entrance of the boss (\"The boss is here\"), the samurai cop and his mandatory black sidekick indulging in a little sex talk with the blonde helicopter operator bimbette in the middle of a drug bust, sped-up chases followed by amazing dialogue (\"shoot\", \"faster\", \"shoot\", \"go faster\") and a sex scene with underwear on (hey, it's low budget) between blonde bimbette and lovable hunk Matt Hannon.<br><br>What else do you need? Have you ever wondered what the real samurai code is (a real samurai always gets his weapon from his Katana Gang henchman)? Did you always want to know what is the mandatory hairstyle all Katana Gang henchmen ought to keep at all times (a mullet)? Did you always complain to anyone who'd listen that cinema doesn't have enough gay Costa rican waiters cracking jokes about suicide? Were you always itching to see security guards calling for security? The Katana Gang red-haired chick enriching world culture with the line \"I'm going to change the trash\" (!!)? Everyone in the movie getting sliced up while Matt Hannon is too busy canoodling another bimbo in a pool? Nurses randomly asking Matt Hannon if he wants to have sex with them, then belittling him for his circumcised penis? Matt Hannon pondering on whether he should make the arrest during or after the suspect has finished having sex, finally making his mind only to be stopped by a sliding door (!!!)? A beach house transforming into a house in the suburbs between takes? Well, here's your chance.<br><br>Yes, just break out the beers. I've seen quite a few no-budget schlockfests in my time but Samurai Cop stands tall among such venerable classics as Werewolf, Timechasers and American Commando - Angel's Blood Mission 2 as one of the most triumphant displays of unintentionally hilarious genius. See this if you're cool.","user":"chaos-rampant","rank":[28,34]}]
