[{"title":"Wasted effort even after a great cast","rating":4,"date":"7 December 2019","review":"When I first saw its trailer in one of the streaming site, I had high hopes of from this movie with ensemble star cast like Ronit, Abhay, Neeraj Kabi and above all Brendan Fresar.\n15 minutes into watching and got to know that I was wrong, a great potential got wasted . Narrative of this movie is very patchy, no thrill moment, it's like a family drama. Ronit's role was short, Neeraj and Abhay was ok.\nI don't know what makers wanted to show - a family issue, a thriller or action. But found nothing.\nOnly good thing was it's running time which typically was less.","user":"rajat_124","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Not as Bad as Everyone says it is","rating":6,"date":"7 December 2019","review":"Although there would have been much better use of talent available of starcast and story/script written 1000 times better than this linear narration, this one is not as bad as some people have commented.\nIts about a Crime syndicate run by Family Partiarch Prem Chopra who's death leads to fight of succession and struggle between brothers, this is linked with International mafia scene. All could have been done in much better way though.","user":"alteracc34","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Don't waste your time","rating":4,"date":"5 December 2019","review":"I watched this movie because of 02 actors , Abhay and Ronit.\n1. I don't understand, what made Abhay do this film. (Talent Wasted)\n2. Ronit's performance was great as usual, but i found his role too short.\n3. Feels good to see Prem Chopraji on the screen , he looks great.\n4. Coming to Neeraj Kabi , he was just below average , I think this role was not meant for him.\nAgain, a piece of advice Ekavali Khanna \" what are you doing ??\"\nAfter Angrezi mein kehte hain , the audience expects something of that caliber and you ruining it with stuff like this and \"Out of love\"","user":"iSatchit","rank":[6,7]}]
