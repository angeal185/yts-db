So rare they are, but how much damage to my faith in the industry they do.<br><br>All Light Will End has some beautiful retro almost Argento like cover art so I was intrigued from the outset. Combine that with the memorable title and I thought this could be a title to turn 2018 around because it still sits as one of the worst years in cinema history on my analytics.<br><br>It tells the story of................well it has a girl and...............and she has dreams.............and..........stuff..........happens?!<br><br>So yeah, the film isn't exactly easy to follow. I'm not saying it's complex, I'm not saying its intelligent, I'm saying it's an absolute mess that makes absolutely no sense.<br><br>Played out in the real world, dream sequences and visions the story is baffling, the pace is ridiculous and the whole movie is a real chore.<br><br>I may be hard to impress, but it's also very hard to get a 1/10 out of me. That suggests a film has not one single redeeming feature! And All Light Will End ticks that box.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Fantastic cover art<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Everything across the board<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>That singing wouldn't have assisted my sleeping, I'd have been engrossed!","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[47,64]}]
