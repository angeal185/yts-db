[{"title":"wow!","rating":10,"date":"23 August 2014","review":"Responding to the overtly religious criticism/ This movie was about a team that won 150 games in a row. It was based on real life coaching. (This was not a made up part of the story but intrinsic to the coach's point of view).<br><br>To leave family/faith values out of the movie would have been like telling the story of a journey without any information about how the characters were able to get from point A to point B when no one else in history had ever done so.<br><br>Nevertheless the movie wasn't just about the overall journey, but also included the individual stories of the coach and black and white students facing their own challenges.<br><br>The many football scenes through-out the movie were great fun to watch!","user":"thirdgeneration","rank":[34,47]},{"title":"Much More than a Football Movie","rating":8,"date":"21 August 2014","review":"When the Game Stands Tall is about a football team and includes a lot of football footage, but it is not a football movie. Rather, it is an inspirational movie about life, commitment, and the definition of success. In this manner, it succeeds wildly.<br><br>The story would seem predictable: a team achieves 151 wins in a row through incredible talent and maniacal enthusiasm for football. Instead, When the Game Stands Tall dismisses the importance of \"The Streak\" and focuses on the process and commitment by which it was built. Almost preachy at times, the movie can be forgiven because it captures the true story. Caviezel's depiction of Coach Bob Ladouceur as quiet, humble, and overly-focused is spot-on. Its illustration of the team's \"commitment cards\" should be seen as a revelation for every other football team, rather than a sappy distraction. The death of Terrance Kelly was shocking and senseless. And DLS players actually do hold hands as they enter the field and graduate spouting words like \"brotherhood\" and \"love\".<br><br>When the Game Stands Tall is clearly intended as a message movie in a football setting, and it succeeds on both fronts. \"Family-appropriate\", it makes for enjoyable and worthwhile viewing.","user":"nineiningz","rank":[25,34]},{"title":"One of the best","rating":10,"date":"29 July 2014","review":"I saw this movie at a screening and was going with the idea of yeah OK ill go see it... its free. Wow... I was pleasantly surprised with this un-promoted film. I feel this didn't get enough TV ad time as it should have as I fell that this is one of the best football films made. It will make any fan and any family member of a player appreciate the game that much more. It goes to show what the teens really go through to be the best in the game and how the loss effects the team and how they need to get over the loss and move on. With todays society and the \"no one looses\" \"participation trophys\" this film is a must. Show the character effects of how people need to LOOSE and over come it versus no everyone wins. Pretty close film to \"undefeated\" but better.","user":"ahurry","rank":[38,61]}]
