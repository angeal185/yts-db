[{"title":"My Old Lady is a Treasure...","rating":8,"date":"3 October 2014","review":"I went to see this movie as I am a huge fan of Maggie Smith &amp; she is delightful in the film. However the true star of the film is Kevin Kline. I thought that his performance was one of his best ever in a movie. Also wonderful in this film is Kristin Scott Thomas. Her performance is subtle &amp; moving. And the fact that it is filmed in Paris is just a wonderful bonus. I found the storyline to be complex &amp; makes one think of life's choices made along the way. I realize that this Israel Horowitz's first directorial film &amp; I give him high marks for that reason. It is based on a play that he wrote &amp; he also did the screenplay. He is in his early seventies. What a treat!!!","user":"grammykathy01923","rank":[42,49]},{"title":"Poignant and funny","rating":9,"date":"26 September 2014","review":"The whole film is shot in Paris and many of the scenes are simply drippingly gorgeous. It is a very charming movie, with some heavy undertones and one I will watch again. There's a good message in it. Loved Dominique Pinon as the real estate agent. Kristin Scott Thomas is so good, mixing up mean and nasty with tenderness and self-awareness. Maggie is a stitch and just superb! Kevin excellently portrays a man who is down and out, carrying around emotional baggage. St√©phane Freiss always seems to play a neurotic Frenchman, but he does frenzied well. Many times I laughed out loud in this movie! I've studied French my whole life, but learned a new word in this movie: viager. I am surprised critics have come down so hard on it. But, I am almost as old as Kevin Kline, I adore Paris, I love movies where you can laugh and still be brought to tears and ones that have a good message.","user":"suzie-16","rank":[64,82]},{"title":"Delightful surprise","rating":9,"date":"2 January 2015","review":"Went to see this today based on the trailer, from which I thought it was a comedy. It is funny, but also serious and engaging. Liked it much more than I thought I would and would definitely recommend it. At the end I realized that I would want to watch it again to see the themes of relationship as I then understood them with hindsight. The three principal actors are all excellent in their roles and in their relationships with each other. It felt honest and not pretentious or 'preachy', but definitely deep and engaging.<br><br>No one ends up the hero in this film, but that is often how real life often turns out.","user":"rogersfa","rank":[37,46]}]
