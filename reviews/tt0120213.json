[{"title":"What a wonderful film!","rating":5,"date":"16 May 2006","review":"This movie is the type of good clean adventure kids today need. Happy endings are rare these days and kids need to experience HAPPY !! A group of kids take on the responsibility of Slappy The Seal after being found mistreated. Again, I think children need to see more of this......the need for humans to have compassion and sympathy for others, and a desire to do the right thing. Soon Slappy becomes an integral part of their group and the movie depicts their adventures (imagine how hard it is to keep a seal from being discovered by your parents for example). Predictable, yes......a little thin plot-wise, yes, but sweet and lighthearted just the same.","user":"blueaugust","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Great family entertainment!","rating":10,"date":"22 March 2006","review":"Slappy and the Stinkers is one of my 10 favorite all-time movies. My grandchildren and I have watched it over and over. In these days of sex, violence and objectionable language, it is so refreshing to find a movie that one can feel comfortable sharing with others, especially children. Slappy is a delightful and funny seal, being hidden (and disguised) by a group of youngsters, trying to protect him from those who would do him harm. A strict and unfeeling school master, along with gardener (Branson Pinchot) add to the enjoyment. Watch as once again good triumphs over evil! Clean, wholesome and upbeat comedy, a good addition to one's video library.","user":"LittleLouLou-2","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Your standard motley crew of stereotypical kids go up against the stereotypical bad man and his henchmen fare.","rating":7,"date":"27 December 2011","review":"After watching only 10 minutes of this movie with my 5 year old son, all I need to know is that he was laughing out loud almost continually, not to mention his mother. The child acting is not Oscar worthy. The adult acting is child like but for a kids movie it is perfect but none of that matters. The seal is a scene stealer. If you have a child who likes to see bad people do bad things stupidly and good triumph over ineptitude along with fart jokes and so on, then this is the movie for you! The script is packed jokes and situation comedy. I was apprehensive about watching it but I'm glad I did. Overall, I think this is worth a watch when you have over watched Up, Cars, How to train your Dragon and so on. PS, the dog deserves his own movie.","user":"dezease","rank":[5,6]}]
