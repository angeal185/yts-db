[{"title":"Disappointing","rating":4,"date":"26 April 2019","review":"Obvious low budget, poorly edited and dis- jointed. If you take the violence out there's nothing else to see.<br><br>Terry Stone was as reliable as ever but sorry this\nWasn't even average.","user":"les-74218","rank":[25,30]},{"title":"Continuity of scenes please","rating":5,"date":"23 April 2019","review":"This could have been so much better why on earth do they not hire a decent continuity director. It's so fractious and chops from scene to scene with little explanation.\nIt's like they left a quarter of it on cutting floor what a pity","user":"kilofunker","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"Great skill sabotaged by writing","rating":5,"date":"11 October 2019","review":"Acting and photography in this flick is a very high standard. Dark but lovely and polished. All this counts for nothing though as it's let down by a story that's so disjointed you realise you stopped caring earlier on. The first part of the film I thought was a clever use of some cool cinematic style of weaving stories together. If I put the effort in to keep track, it would pay off as the film went on. But no. There's no story, just things that happen. It's full of pointless dead end scenes. Gangster one beats up gangster two who then beats up gangster one etc and on occasion a random moll appears and disappears. No character background or development either. They start off bad and, well, stay bad and carry on doing things that they did at the start of the film. Two hours....two hours of my life!! I suppose I'm optimistic and waited for that \"ah, I get it\" moment that was never going to come.","user":"grenfern","rank":[6,6]}]
