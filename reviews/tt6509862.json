[{"title":"Genres - Gotta Catch 'Em All","rating":10,"date":"10 October 2017","review":"Mr. Long (Chen Chang) is a highly successful knife assassin working for a Taiwanese crime boss. A job in Japan goes sideways and he's forced to hide in the slums of the city to avoid capture by his would-be targets, psychotic criminals in their own right.<br><br>And from that we get one of the weirdest examples of the fact that it's not always a bad thing to straddle genre lines. Because this film goes from a straightforward Asian action blast to a nihilist drug drama to a sappy romantic comedy, and then all back again. And yes, it is jarring from time to time, but it's meant to be. Life goes from incredibly sappy to gut-wrenching sadness, and sometimes it does so with no warning whatsoever.<br><br>It also helps to have such a crew behind this genre hopping. SABU, the director, has a reputation as a storyteller of the bizarre, this film being a fine example of that. Chen Chang also shines as the silent main protagonist. Long is a man of few words, but this merely enhances his performance, affording him an aura of mystery, danger and solution.<br><br>Is the film for everyone? No, it's not. Is it a bit artsy? Kinda. Is it really good? Absolutely.","user":"Vartiainen","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Beautiful and unexpected portrayal of an assassin","rating":8,"date":"15 February 2017","review":"I was lucky to catch this film at Berlinale Film Festival and when the film ended, there was a sudden eruption of applause that went on for about a minute. Half the crowd stayed behind until the credits rolled and again another round of applause when the final curtain came down. It was THAT good.<br><br>The film was shocking at times of the brutality, heart warming, some really laugh-out loud moments mixed with gut wrenching sadness. All 3 leads playing Long, Jun and Lily were excellent in their portrayal of the characters and you do feel for each of their struggles. <br><br>When a movie really touches you it stays in your mind and I'm still thinking about the film even now after I saw the movie several days ago.","user":"Lenaye999","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"Great","rating":9,"date":"10 January 2019","review":"SABU is one of the most fearless and creative filmmakers these days. Most of his movies were comedies and this one is a bit more serious but his style is just as evident. Definitely of the most inspiring and emotional movies I have seen in a while. Absolutely recommended.","user":"dragoslt","rank":[4,5]}]
