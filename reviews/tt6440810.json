[{"title":"Now I understand...","rating":10,"date":"29 April 2017","review":"A film that reveals why football fans love their team so much. Beautifully shot, wonderful music, terrific story. From Hollywood movie star Ray Winstone to a 100 year old local called Mabel, to the team captain and East End boy Mark Noble, the grip that West Ham has on it's loyal fans and players is immense. And they had to say goodbye to their roots. Heart wrenching stuff.","user":"acbarber-45735","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Love this film...","rating":10,"date":"7 March 2017","review":"I am not a West Ham fan but I love sports documentaries. Iron Men has to be up there with the best of them. Passion, emotion, history and community are all on show in equal measure. This film shows why sport matters, why football matters and why supporting a team matters... Great work.","user":"mark-82906","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Not a West Ham fan","rating":10,"date":"12 April 2020","review":"Not a West Ham fan but thoroughly enjoyed this well made documentary.","user":"mike-cronin100","rank":[0,0]}]
