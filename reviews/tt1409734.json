[{"title":"Hmmm","rating":5,"date":"28 January 2014","review":"Based on real events in a small town where the pastor takes advantage of his female flock.<br><br>Not sure if it's really based on a true story.<br><br>The movie is interesting and maybe worth a look see.<br><br>Some preacher goes around savagely beating to death people from time to time in different places. <br><br>I was never really sure why, nor is any of the violence especially graphic. This last part is what makes it interesting. The filmmakers appear to have been trying to make a serious movie with a low budget. The acting is good.<br><br>After a while, however, it grows a bit tedious. Try it out. See if you like it.","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[14,19]}]
