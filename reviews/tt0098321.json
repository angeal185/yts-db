[{"title":"Hasta la Vista, Baby! Oh wait, wrong film...","rating":5,"date":"14 November 2009","review":"I think it's hilarious that this movie is actually called \"Terminator II\"! This just shows how unscrupulous and shameless Italian exploitation directors were during the late 80's when unleashing their films upon unsuspecting cinema lovers! The real \"Terminator II\", with Arnie Schwarzenegger, was probably already in a much advanced stage of production around the time of this movie's release, but these guys didn't care and went ahead naming it \"Terminator II\" all around the world, except in the USA. I think it's even more hilarious that this \"Terminator II\" is basically more of blatant imitation of \"Aliens\", with just a bit of \"Terminator\" thrown in near the finale. The cast and crew probably thought something like: \"Hey, if we're going to upset James Cameron, we better do it right and imitate two of his films at once\". Maybe it's just my twisted mind, but all this epitomizes the methods of the Italian exploitation cinema during the late 80's. They went extremely far in ripping off Hollywood box office hits only just to drain the formula entirely and make the maximum of easy money out it. I love it. <br><br>To the avid fans of this kind of trash cinema, it really shouldn't come as much of a surprise that \"Terminator II\" was directed by Bruno Mattei; here under his favorite pseudonym Vincent Dawn. Mattei's life mission was to rip-off as much successful SF-horror classics as humanly possible and he literally continued to do so until his death a couple of years ago. Mattei often imitated one and the same movie several times, like John McTiernan's \"Predator\". Although I sadly haven't seen Mattei's entire repertoire just yet, I think it's safe to say that \"Terminator II\" ranks amongst his utmost bonkers achievements. The plot is a hodgepodge of borrowed ideas including slimy mutant monsters, corrupt global corporations, cyborgs, toxic cities, time-traveling and secret experiments. By the year 2000, the once beautiful city of Venice has become an uninhabitable wasteland. The water is heavily polluted and the entire city is covered by a thick toxic cloud. For some reason that must have escaped my attention, a specially trained troop of solider and scientists go back in assignment for the dubious Tubular Corporation. Samuel Fuller, representing the corporation, is clearly up to no good and one of the female scientists recovers an orphaned girl in an abandoned lab, exactly like Ellen Ripley found Newt in \"Aliens\", although unfortunately this girl isn't a mute. There's not the slightest bit of coherence or logic in the screenplay, but that doesn't matter too much, as clearly Bruno Mattei's sole intention was to copy the successful James Cameron flicks as much as possible. The stereotypical rough and tough soldiers are like exact clones of the characters in \"Aliens\" (like the loud-mouthed Bill Paxton, butch lady Jenette Goldstein and good Samaritan solider Michael Biehn) and multiple situations are even identical copies to the ones in \"Aliens\", like when the women are trapped in a sound proof laboratory with a monster and the villainous Fuller discretely turns off the safety cameras or when the remaining soldiers are counting down on their radar how fast the monsters are approaching. <br><br>\"Termintor II\" is great trashy and cheesy fun and comes warmly recommend, but of course only if you have a high tolerance for gratuitous Italian exploitation rubbish. And if you can find it, too, as the film is really quite obscure.","user":"Coventry","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"bad, bad, BAD movie... not to be confused with the 1991 film of the same name","rating":3,"date":"13 February 2003","review":"This movie is not actually a sequel to the 1984 James Cameron movie, but more or less a remake of Cameron's 1986 movie ALIENS.  The major difference between this movie and Aliens is... well, almost nothing actually.<br><br>The plot, lines of dialog, situations, etc. are all completely identical to those seen in ALIENS, such as the mischievous android who more or less plays the \"Burke\" role up until he gets damaged a bit, then he goes on a TERMINATOR-style rampage chasing after the woman and the young girl.<br><br>The actual Aliens here are more like genetic mutations, and they don't really look that bad considering they're just guys in monster suits. Whatever they have to do with the plot is negligible since the movie seems to be more of a post-nuke film having to do with soldiers unlocking some government conspiracy deep in the bowels of a futuristic ruined Venice.<br><br>The cast is uniformly awful, with several Americans (some with South African accents) in the cast who appear to have little or no prior acting experience, sort of the same situation with TROLL 2 or CRUEL JAWS where I think the production company just wheeled through K-mart asking people if they wanted to act in a film.  Only Fausto Lombardi comes across as anything resembling good, though Chris Ahrens and Janna Ryan are pretty amusing bad movie veterans.<br><br>The musical score for this picture I believe was liberated from a number of other 80's films, including Blade Runner and Miami Cops.  Much of the footage (with the explosions, etc.) is taken from Mattei's earlier DOUBLE TARGET too.<br><br>So bad is this film, in fact, that writer/co-director Claudio Fragasso refused to make any more movies with Mattei afterward - and that's saying a lot.  I have to say that I enjoyed it to a certain extent, though it's more fun to wonder how they managed to avoid a lawsuit than it is to actually sit down and watch the movie in one sitting.  A little too depressing and dull to be unintentionally funny - though it does certainly have its moments.","user":"Aylmer","rank":[26,37]},{"title":"\"Christ! They're shooting all over the place\".","rating":3,"date":"21 March 2014","review":"Wow. I'm kind of surprised by its decent rating on this site. But, talk about plagiarism. \"Aliens\" is what it wants to be. And \"Aliens\" it is not. It blatantly lifts scenes, dialogues (\"Please, kill me\"), characters, story arches and ideas. It's that obvious you'd be in amazement. Yeah, you could probably play a drinking game with what it tries to squeeze in. It simply becomes a waiting to see what they rip- off next. And throw in a touch of \"Terminator\". Especially within the film's dying stages and misplaced climax. Well in some countries it does have the title \"Terminator II\". Wonder what James Cameron would have made of it? Director Bruno Mattei and writer Claudio Fragasso are no strangers to trash, and the grungy \"Shocking Dark\" is no exception to the trend. Too bad it's not as exploitative in its visuals. Even though it's on the cheap, daft in every sense, the plot doesn't make a lick of sense and junky as it can be what killed it for me was how flat, sluggish and meandering the action and story came out to be. No great shakes that the acting is wooden (and that constant screaming from the Newt character gets truly unbearable), the genetic monsters look completely goofy and the thrills are more silly than rousing, but it's not as fun as it could have been. Good idea of the setting; a polluted Venice, despite most of the time is spent in dark, dingy and long underground corridors, which is caught by murky photography. Lame-brain, but it gets bogged down too often and doesn't let its outlandish nature implode.","user":"lost-in-limbo","rank":[9,11]}]
