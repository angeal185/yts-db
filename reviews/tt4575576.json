[{"title":"Incredible!","rating":6,"date":"6 March 2019","review":"This movie is beautifully written and makes you truly realize what's important in life. I'm 32 and in a job that is sucking the life out of me currently. It's truly not fair for my son and my wife to have to deal with the stressed out, grump I've become. I've already been thinking about a career change to get back the \"old me\" and it sounds corny, but this movie was a sign to get back to the old me - the happier me. Money and a career is great, but family and friends are so much more important. We've got one shot at this life. Maybe it's time for me to look in the mirror!","user":"nnotheis","rank":[99,102]},{"title":"Bring TWO Handkerchiefs!","rating":10,"date":"22 August 2018","review":"I'm a 53 y old married man, and I saw this film on Monday with my wife. I went back to see it AGAIN on Tuesday, I loved it so much. Also, I teared up so badly on the first viewing, I needed a second fix to catch the parts I missed! Beautifully filmed, this is a must see for any adult still in touch with their inner \"Christopher Robin\". The scenes of Ewan McGregor sitting with Pooh on a log overlooking Ashdown Forest will stay with me forever (and I need a hankie now, just thinking about it!)<br><br>10/10 is not enough!","user":"ludgateman-87622","rank":[314,332]},{"title":"It was great to relive my childhood...","rating":8,"date":"22 August 2018","review":"This was the first movie in ages where they did not focus on a romantic relationship but rather exploring relationships between friendship and family. Though, I do believe that the movie isn't suiting for very young viewers. As it might seem boring to them or rather the message conveyed isn't about them. Christopher Robin forgets about being happy due to his workaholic nature, this could really relate more to high school, college or working people. But, overall it's a great movie! It's great for laughs, reminiscing and a little tears","user":"kimiemegan","rank":[119,128]}]
