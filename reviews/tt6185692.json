[{"title":"Lacks cohesion","rating":5,"date":"4 May 2019","review":"Nice characters but lacking in cohesion. Bits and pieces but not coming together.","user":"fmwongmd","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Great Homecoming Movie","rating":8,"date":"3 December 2018","review":"I thought this movie was very satisfying. Even though it focuses on a minor league baseball player returning to his hometown, I think anyone who has left their hometown for a long time for any reason will connect with this movie. While Dustin and I didn't leave our towns for even remotely similar reasons (I suck at baseball), that feeling of being an outsider in the place where you grew up is one I've felt a lot returning home. Credit to director/writer Michael Doneger for capturing that feeling perfectly. Great movie.","user":"austindavidson-97006","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Terrible ending","rating":3,"date":"4 June 2019","review":"No spoilers here, but I thought it was going to be a sweet Rom-Com kind of thing. NAH. Not a 'happy' film.","user":"memaxbru","rank":[7,9]}]
