[{"title":"I loved it","rating":8,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"Not a new formula, but made with love, passion and emotion. Jennifer Garner plays wonderful and you feel the pain of her character in every scene she is in, but at the same time marvel at her badass fighting skills (that she adapted offscreen, which I like by the way... not everything has to be spelled out, spin your own story). The movie is tight, suspenseful and extremely entertaining, especially since it has a shorter running time than most movies nowadays, which is welcome and takes you back to the 80s and 90s where a movie didn't have to be 150 minutes long.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[50,52]},{"title":"Not nearly as bad as the critics would have you believe","rating":7,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"Peppermint was entertaining from start to finish. I don't understand why the critics have panned it. Is it a life-changing film? No, it most certainly is not. Is it an enjoyable film and does it compare favourably in its own category? Yes, it most certainly is, and yes, it most certainly does. Perhaps people are just uncomfortable with a tough female lead. I recommend it if you're a fan of revenge flicks.","user":"maclock","rank":[458,557]},{"title":"Best Acting Action From Jennifer Garner","rating":8,"date":"19 September 2018","review":"Rating 8.4/10\nThis movie have a very good storyline, best acting action from Jennifer Garner.
