[{"title":"Great movie","rating":8,"date":"22 February 2020","review":"Really great action sequences, with some nice violent ends, and a very interesting story that almost feels like it starts in the middle, leaving you guessing about his past. It kind of has a very John Wick feel to it, but maybe slightly less over-the-top crazy.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[40,41]},{"title":"A Stylish And Daring Action Thriller","rating":3,"date":"3 October 2014","review":"Antoine Fuqua's and Denzel Washington's paths collide once more as they come together to create a stylish and daring action thriller about a man with a mysterious past, whose quiet life suddenly turns into a rip- roaring adventure of guns and thrills. Both Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz give stellar performances and display perfect chemistry as two friends stuck in a world of crime and violence. Arguably Fuqua's best film since 'Training Day', 'The Equalizer' is a brutal and merciless tale that explores the Russian underworld on the East Coast and the corruption ties within the law enforcement of Boston's police department.","user":"CalRhys","rank":[243,334]},{"title":"Effective and dynamic","rating":8,"date":"16 March 2019","review":"In the inventory of almost normal heroes like Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, Frank Castle, Bryan Mills, John Wick, ... here is a brand new one: Robert McCall a.k.a. The Equalizer. He gives a chance to the unlucky ones against the villains, by 'equaliz'-ing the forces. In this first opus, he meets by chance a prostitute as young as lost and ... hop! hop !! hop !!! ... he annihilates the Russian underworld of Boston. Wooooow!. Sounds easy!! The result is rather successful. I loved it.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[22,26]}]
