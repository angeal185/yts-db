[{"title":"30 minutes of story streched out to 2 hours","rating":4,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"I honestly haven't finished this, but I will. I am about 3/4 of the way through and I can only stand it in 15 minute intervals. I hate robocalls, but I cannot relate to the main character who handles this situation like a complete dumb ass. I must admit it is the hope for a real gory ending where the robocallers get their comeuppance, but that is doubtful as well.","user":"burleygroup12","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Something new and realtable","rating":10,"date":"10 October 2019","review":"This film was interesting and slowly built up. It had some periods where it was rather sad to think that when we grow old there are rarely any true friends around. I would recommend this feature.","user":"JaredKush","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Worst Indie Film of the Year","rating":1,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"I thought this would be an interesting film with technology but it was boring waste of time. GT acting is awful and blain. Story drags out forever and is painful to watch. Production looks like a logistical nightmare and someones bad dream turned into a screenplay. Stay away from this movie and save 2hrs of your time for better flicks.","user":"TommyLongShots","rank":[0,0]}]
