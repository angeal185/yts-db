[{"title":"I now truly understand the meaning of \"DISAPPOINTMENT\"","rating":1,"date":"7 August 2013","review":"90 Minutes of my life I'll forever be trying to claw back. Badly acted, badly cut and edited The so called \"fight scenes\" &amp; \"special effects\" would have been more at home on a SYFY Channel production. The whole thing looked as though it had been made by kids working on a school film project. After reading a review and recognising quite a few of the actors in the movie I was looking forward to watching another good BRIT GANGSTER movie as I am a big fan of the genre, but I have to say that had this been the first film of this type I had ever watched, then I would definitely NEVER have watched another. This is absolutely the worst film I have seen all year.","user":"daguvnor-1","rank":[24,36]},{"title":"very different but very good","rating":10,"date":"15 August 2013","review":"Brothers Lucky and Raphael have always lived on the wrong side of the law.

Very impressed with the acting.<br><br>A good twist to the story at the end as well.<br><br>Afer reading this i thought i would have a look. Very good acting and not too Hollywood.<br><br>Look forward to getting this on DVD, worth another look.","user":"westhambill","rank":[13,22]},{"title":"Don't bother","rating":1,"date":"7 August 2013","review":"Think about all the worst things to do when making a film and this does them all. Bad everything. Acting, directing, writing, plot, casting, editing, photography, the list is endless. Just astonishes me why people still make or are interested in watching clich√© British gangster films. That ship sailed long long ago. And who would be stupid enough to put up the money to make this drivel? Please can we move on, and invest in good plausible stories. Doesn't have to be Jane Austen or a romantic comedy. Or cost an absolute fortune to make. They can be thrillers, crime stories, violent, whatever. Just as long as they are well made with a decent script. This film should be shown to aspiring film students as an example of how to get it totally wrong.","user":"nick-614-618452","rank":[16,33]}]
