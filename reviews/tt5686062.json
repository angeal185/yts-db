[{"title":"Healing for my broken heart","rating":10,"date":"29 June 2018","review":"My father passed away 10 years ago. He was a difficult man to walk this earth with. This movie made me feel that others walked the same walk as I did with their father. It made me feel less alone in this world. Thank you for sharing your story.","user":"dreckley-1","rank":[82,102]},{"title":"What's wrong with people?","rating":10,"date":"21 October 2018","review":"This is a good movie, why the low rating? Maybe people watch too much superhero garbage and can't tell what's good anymore.","user":"w-bogdan","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"Thoroughly enjoyed!","rating":9,"date":"28 June 2018","review":"Totally refreshing and absolutely made my day seeing this film.
