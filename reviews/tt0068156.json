[{"title":"Excellent, and remarkably accurate to history!","rating":9,"date":"21 December 2004","review":"As a person who has gained a college degree in History, I first fell in love with this movie when I saw it as the stage play with the Broadway cast in my junior year in high school, in 1976. The movie is surprisingly accurate with direct quotations from key congressional members, such as Adams, Franklin and Jefferson as borne out in David McCullough's \"John Adams.\" Yes, there were a few licenses taken with history such as the dramatic scene with Wilson,Dickinson, and Franklin when Wilson is forced to decide the entire question of independence on his vote. But it is these few licenses that bring out the true seriousness of the founding of our nation. One particular scene that I am glad was restored from Jack L. Warner's shameful caving in to Richard Nixon is the piece \"Cool, Cool, Considerate Men.\" That piece clearly fleshed out the Conservative's viewpoint in Congress. William Daniels is perfect for the part of John Adams. His Boston twang (even though he was born in New York) is excellent. One cast change that I am glad they made is putting Blythe Danner in the role of Martha Jefferson in the movie version, in place of Betty Buckley. No offense to Ms. Buckley, I love her as an actress in her roles, but her voice comes across too nasal and strident in her singing of Tom's qualities. (I own the stage play LP to make this comparison) The rest of the cast is perfect. Donald Madden was excellent as John Dickinson, even if you can forgive his singing voice in \"Cool, Considerate Men.\" I will always think of Howard Da Silva and Ken Howard as Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, respectively. All in all, it is a movie that should be seen by everyone in their High School History or Civics class.","user":"cbruble","rank":[50,53]},{"title":"I see fireworks,pomp and parades","rating":9,"date":"30 June 2005","review":"I promised my mother that I would once again put this wonderful movie on the video player this week end. There is a wonderful comment in the book \"Lets put on a musical\" about the fact that half way through the story you wonder if you really do know how it is going to end! <br><br>William Daniels,is of course spectacular as John Adams,the linchpin of the show. Howard DaSilva and Franklin is just jaded enough(read dirty old man), and Ken Howard is delightful as Jeffrson. One person who was not in the stage production but is a definite asset to the movie is John Cullum as Rutledge.especially in his big solo number,Molasses to Rum.<br><br>A real treat for eyes and ears ,and a history lesson to boot.","user":"laholly","rank":[29,30]},{"title":"Witty and Humanizing","rating":9,"date":"8 September 2005","review":"I have seen \"1776\" both on Broadway and on the screen as well as having acted in it as an amateur. The piece humanizes people we often look upon as flawless icons. Well, they did have flaws. The North's hands were stained with the blood of slavery as well as the South's. Delegates sometimes tended to represent their colony's interests over those of the collective group's. Today we fail to realize that independence from the mother country had never been successfully accomplished. If some had reservations, they had good reason. \"1776\" brings this out. In the song \"Molasses to Rum to Slaves\", South Carolina delegate Rutledge (John Cullum) reveals the complicity of New England in the triangle trade. In his showstopper \"Is Anybody There?\", John Adams (William Daniels) encapsulates the conflict between delegates while expressing his vision of a nation where all are free. Based on Adams' own writings, this song resonates long after the final scene.<br><br>The wittiness of this piece also endears it. One scene is particularly noteworthy, for it lampoons the New York Legislature with uncanny accuracy. Space forbids me to elaborate but any New Yorker, or anyone else frustrated with politicians, will enjoy it.<br><br>Although based on historical facts, \"1776\" entertains and helps us understand the real people to helped bring forth \"..a new nation, conceived in liberty...\"","user":"kenbarr-ny","rank":[17,17]}]
