Even if there is some artsy explanation for including this, it does not serve the story; in fact it halts the narrative entirely.<br><br>They end up going all in with this nonsense, Terrence Malick-style, at the end credits: another dance sequence, this one even more bizarre and unnecessary. <br><br>Had they left out this ridiculous, pretentious, utter baffling garbage it would have been a half decent, albeit very boring film.","user":"webmaster-1100","rank":[162,202]},{"title":"Just didn't work for me","rating":5,"date":"22 March 2018","review":"Most of us (including me), when we heard about the new film 7 DAYS IN ENTEBBE, thought to themselves \"didn't they just make this film a few years ago...?\" The answer is yes. A similar film to this - RAID ON ENTEBBE - was a TV movie made a few years ago - 42 years ago, to be precise. It starred Peter Finch, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden and good ol' Charles Bronson. Made a mere few months after the true events, this slapped together movie was an old-fashioned \"shoot 'em up.\"<br><br>This film is most definitely not.<br><br>7 DAYS IN ENTEBBE tells the true story of the 1976 Air France Hijacking of (mostly) Israeli citizens that settle in Entebbe, Uganda (under the leadership of crazed dictator Idi Amin) - refusing to negotiate with terrorists, the Israeli government plan, stage and execute a daring rescue mission.<br><br>Sounds like a pretty good plot for a Charles Bronson shoot-em-up.<br><br>In this version, Director Jose Padilha (the 2014 remake of ROBOCOP) decides to focus most of his attention not on the hijacked Israeli citizens, but rather, a pair of German hijackers juxtaposed against the political infighting in Israel between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Defense Minister Shimon Peres. The Israeli governmental infighting was interesting to watch with intriguing characters and cat-and-mouse back-stabbing politics while the plight of the kidnappers was underwritten and underwhelming. Consequently, this film was \"just okay\".<br><br>Oh...and it had about an hour-fifteen minutes of content stretched over an hour-forty-five minutes, so to stretch things out, Padilha decided to cut back and forth between the action (what there was of it) and a modern dance recital. Clearly he was trying a metaphor of the dance punctuating the emotions and actions elsewhere. It just didn't work for me.<br><br>Neither did this film. Skip this one and check out the Charles Bronson shoot-em-up.<br><br>Letter Grade C+<br><br>5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","user":"bankofmarquis","rank":[81,104]},{"title":"I don't know how you wreck a story this good.","rating":5,"date":"26 March 2018","review":"Should have been good...but it wasn't. As a 15 yr old I was early in my social consciousness when this hijacking took place. I remember the concern and the tension felt even here in the US over the fate of the hostages and the jubilation I felt when they were rescued. The real life events had it all...the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, a bold hijacking, a daring and unlikely rescue, even the flamboyantly dangerous Idi Amin! All elements for really good cinema but it didn't work in this case. A lot of effort was spent on humanizing the hijackers/terrorists but little on the humanizing of the hostages. Yes we all know that terrorists are fighting for a cause. It's their methods that are so objectionable. They kill innocent people to make their point, which is never justified; I don't want to identify with them. The artsy odd dance routine was excellent and interesting. Unfortunately, it added nothing to the story, it just distracted from the human drama. The movie was poorly done enough that it became a welcome distraction toward the end.","user":"jbaird-69485","rank":[141,187]}]
