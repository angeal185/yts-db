[{"title":"Wow","rating":1,"date":"8 March 2020","review":"What did I just sit through? I seriously cannot believe that this film was made let alone the studio thought that it would make money. This film makes the Batwoman TV show look good and i didn't think that was possible.","user":"dnl_hggns","rank":[396,587]},{"title":"A Disgracful Chick Flick for Most Comic Books Fans.","rating":2,"date":"9 April 2020","review":"I don't believe this movie is any good or remotely enjoyable for DC fans or even any fan of Harley Quinn, having a female writer and director should be a big giveaway that this will end up being a chick flick, the movie title to begin with should've been, Harley Quinn and (insert any name here) because simply it has nothing to do with being a Birds of Prey team movie, the plot is simple, a crappy version of \"Harley Quinn\" vs. a shallow (g) portrayed version of \"Black Mask\" with some shadowed presence of the \"Birds of Prey\" who only relate to the comics by just their names.<br><br>The movie sadly takes a feminist point of view but in a more lame yet offensive approach, every lead male character in the movie is never straight! Either (g) or (b) while the minor male characters are just plain jerks! The plot is weak and the acting is mediocre and feels very cheesy at some scenes, the casting choices are way off the authenticity of the original team members in comic books, as if they wanted to compile all races in one movie, this way no one feels left out...so let's choose Cassandra Cain instead of Barbara Gordon. The scenes decoration is too colorful in a wrong manner, I can understand that a Harley Quinn movie should be colorful and chaotic but there's a huge difference between an artistic chaos, this is why the decoration of this movie feels like it was designed by a crazed extravagant fashion designer! while the directing was clearly all over the place.<br><br>I'll never change my mind when I say that Margot Robbie is a poor choice for Harley Quinn character, she doesn't look like Harley - Harley has a round face while Margot has more of a square or a bit of an oblong face - she doesn't feel like Harley Quinn...Harley is a very dangerous, sadistic character...too dangerous that many times the Joker himself is scared of her, she even beat him up in many occasions. Completely different than the childish spoiled brat which depicted in this movie and sure as hell Margot Robbie does not sound like Harley Quinn! I'm sure the only reason why many are drooling over her is because no one has seen any other depiction of Harley Quinn on the big screen. Just like how people were fascinated when Jack Nicholson played the Joker...No one back then knew there will be Heath Ledger or Joaquin Phoenix who owned the role in their own way!<br><br>Since they decided to cast Margot Robbie again for this role even after this disastrous movie, at least they should ask her to go learn from Arleen Sorkin how to say Mr. J and Puddin' ! and for F's sake give her an adult oversized mallet to crush skulls with instead of that childish toy she carried in few scenes in this disastrous movie.","user":"Impartial-Critic","rank":[70,97]},{"title":"Boring and forgettable","rating":4,"date":"6 February 2020","review":"While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable.","user":"Ndetzzz","rank":[1,1]}]
