[{"title":"Bad, But I Loved It","rating":6,"date":"31 August 2019","review":"Totally sappy, cheesy, silly, but sometimes you need a movie like that, right? This had me laughing at quite a few moments, because it really was sooo sappy. It's kitsch, but you should totally watch it on a night where you are entirely ambivalent to what you watch, and you think to yourself, why not? If my rating was based purely on the enjoyment I received from this movie, it would be much higher.","user":"theunnamed-18793","rank":[105,120]},{"title":"Cute, feel-good romantic comedy","rating":9,"date":"7 September 2019","review":"I loved this movie. I'm a little surprised at all the people who watched it and are leaving such negative reviews. What kind of movie did you think you were watching? No, it's not suspenseful or an Oscar winning film, but that's exactly what you want sometimes. It's fun to watch and makes you feel hopeful. I wish there were more movies like this. If you like Hallmark Christmas movies you will love this movie too. I know they're cheesy when I'm coming into them, but I enjoy them and they make me feel good. This one was cute and I liked the charming setting of New Zealand. Enjoy it and don't be so jaded!","user":"amandamonson","rank":[52,60]},{"title":"A place where everyone knows your name...","rating":8,"date":"5 September 2019","review":"Come on you guys with the low ratings -- don't be so critical and snobbish. Enjoy the sweet love story and beautiful scenery of New Zealand. The village and the residents were charming. Makes you want to live there. So what if it was somewhat predictable. The lead couple was attractive and made you root for them. The story was simple, entertaining, and satisfying, with a happy ending. As for the film overall, I found it refreshing because there was no swearing and vulgarity.","user":"delores96734","rank":[21,23]}]
