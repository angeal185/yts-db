Low budget crap, worst viking movie ever, worst acting ever, worst story ever, very bad directing and no nudity with pretty girls to balance this crap even a little :) so you would not be sorry to waste your time on this crap. But we are not so lucky :). 1 hour and 43 minutes of crap.","user":"cashovina","rank":[42,47]}]
