[{"title":"A late masterpiece from Bellocchio","rating":9,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"Perhaps only a director who has lived as long as Marco Bellocchio could tackle the subjects of death and grief with the degree of empathy that's shown here. A young boy, Massimo, is devastated by the sudden death of his mother; years later, as a man, he must try to come to terms with his grief. \"Sweet Dreams\" is, indeed, an old man's film; there is a lifetime of observation and affection on view. This isn't the kind of film the enfant terrible that Bellocchio once was might have made but a slow, measured, grown-up and deeply moving view of childhood and what lies beyond and as the very young Massimo, Nicolo Cabras is quite extraordinary, (as the adult Massimo, Valerio Mastandrea is also outstanding in what really is a superb ensemble). It's also a decidedly old-fashioned film; there is nothing ostentatious about it. It is a film full of memories but they aren't handled in the tricksy fashion of so many younger directors. Indeed, this is the equal of anything in the director's canon and if we are speaking of late masterpieces this is certainly one. It really shouldn't be missed.","user":"MOscarbradley","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Good acting, psych drama, Italian issues","rating":7,"date":"8 February 2019","review":"This movie held my attention, and the acting --especially the little boy's--was excellent. The thematic of the movie is lying about tragic events, or-- if you prefer a different wording-- a \"closed\" and secretive attitude towards them. In some cultures, there is a considerable degree of openness about cancer, suicide, and death in general. (For example, see Ikiru, a great Japanese movie). In other cultures (and I would say Italian is one of them) these situations are treated with great secrecy, and the individuals most directly affected by them are not told the truth. I think most Americans will guess pretty early in the movie what really happened and the revelation at the end will not be a surprise at all. This made it a little hard for me to relate to the central issue of the movie, though I think it was probably very moving for many viewers, and of course we can sympathize with a child who has lost his mother, regardless of the circumstances.","user":"bobbie-16","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Deep psychological drama","rating":7,"date":"25 February 2018","review":"A nine year old boy is deeply affected by his mother's death and keeps missing her very much. Even after reaching adult age he is upset by his memories of that.\nHe becomes a successful journalist but is often panic- stricken and asking for help. The story develops itself through frequent flashbacks and flash forwards keeping our attention firmly attached to the action developmenr. The performers' acting is rather good and the movie good enough to be seen.","user":"valadas","rank":[3,4]}]
