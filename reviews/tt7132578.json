Only watch if you want you grandma dead","user":"cravenmcmillan","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Great movie for kids.","rating":9,"date":"2 April 2019","review":"I saw this at the cinema last summer and have now watched it again on DVD. It was, I remember, extremely popular during the summer much to the chagrin of Spanish film critics who tend to be terrible snobs when reviewing Spanish films.\nThe comedy works, the story entertains and the characters draw you in.\nWell worth watching if you want to spend a fun two hours.","user":"chelseazaragoza","rank":[2,2]}]
