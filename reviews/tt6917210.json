Having said that, it feels safe, too safe; from a generic villain boss, (two) damsel in distress, to emotionally instructive score (good ones, fortunately) with moments meant to achieve ideas bigger than what its capable to accomplished.\nWell at least they gives cliche a good name.\nGood thing that they has its moment-the fight choreography is superb with long duration, cool action scenes, and there are even some excellent explosions.\nFun to watch. Don't be too angry if you guys found the drama as \"too much\".\nCan't wait to see more from this \"world\".\nThe job done quite nicely, hopefully some improvements would be made in the next movie.","user":"Waokelah","rank":[13,24]}]
