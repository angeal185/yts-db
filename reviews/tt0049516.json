[{"title":"What is wrong with everybody, this is a good movie!","rating":8,"date":"10 May 1999","review":"I can't help feeling that everyone is jumping on the bandwagon saying this is the worst film ever made etc.<br><br>I viewed this film for the first time on laserdisc on a video projector in a darkened room with some mates and we found it to be entertaining different atmospheric in parts. John Agar for once has some good lines and does well. The script is a fairly complex one far more than other film of its vintage and budget. We thought the writers should be commended for using such plot devices as intolerance to light and the sub-culture within a sub-culture. Even the ending is unexpected and different. It even has an opening prologue which is a lot of fun. While this film does not hit its target on everything it tries to do, we thought the creators had a pretty good go at it.<br><br>I do not honestly understand why so many people think this film is so bad. Maybe seeing it projected on a big screen in a darkened room made a difference, I don't know, but if you have never seen the film before try it with an open mind you may well enjoy it as much as we did.","user":"BigSteve-64","rank":[85,89]},{"title":"Great 1950s semi classic sci-fi monster movie.","rating":7,"date":"9 June 2005","review":"I've seen this movie several times over the years. It's a real semi classic, great example of 50s sci-fi monster movies. You do get a good look at the actual mole monsters and see quite a bit of them. As good as the mole monsters are, they are only a small part of this film. It's also an adventure movie about exploring for a lost civilization. Most of the plot involves this civilization which also happens to include the Mole People. This is good stuff. The stuff that used to scare and entertain in the 50s. The thing is, if you've seen a decent amount of horror/sci-fi films from the 50s and early 60s and haven't found much that you liked, \"The Mole People\" is not for you. If you're a fan of 50s B movies, you'll love this one. It's a real must see.","user":"ChuckStraub","rank":[54,59]},{"title":"The Fires Of Ishtar","rating":6,"date":"15 December 2010","review":"The Mole People is one of those science fiction cheapies that you wish had a bigger budget. I found it to be one of the most imaginative of science fiction films of the fifties. It would get a far better rating from me if a few more dollars had been put in.<br><br>A team of scientists on top a mountain in what would be ancient Mesopotamia, today Iraq find on top the mountain a cave leading to an ancient Sumerian civilization which has survived their almost for 5000 years. Probably the greatest archaeological find ever, imagine finding some ancient Egyptians hidden away, clinging to their cultural traditions. The greatest opportunity ever to research a culture.<br><br>Of course some of these are not quite human, they've returned to being mole like humans and they're the slaves. It's a slow punishment for the bad, a quick punishment is the hated fires of Ishtar. You're sent into what looks like an oven and you're burnt away to ashes.<br><br>The film does a marvelous job in building up the viewers fears of the fires of Ishtar so in the end when the scientists are flung into it, we're scared witless.<br><br>John Agar, Hugh Beaumont, and Nestor Paiva are some of the scientists and the high priest of Ishtar is Alan Napier. What is the fire of Ishtar? That's not a question to be answered here. See the film and find out.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[13,13]}]
