[{"title":"Powerhouse Performances Pack a Punch","rating":7,"date":"22 February 2007","review":"While the film itself certainly has it's shortcomings, Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance embodies the film's title. While a lesser actor would have taken the role of Rusty as a caricature of gay and transgender stereotypes, Hoffman performs the role with deep sensitivity and respect for the trials of someone living a misunderstood life. Robert De Niro is also believable as a gritty police officer recovering from a stroke.<br><br>The most powerful thing about this film is that it doesn't gloss over stereotypes, but still makes the viewer feel compassion for both characters. Deniro's cop goes through a huge transformation from homophobe to someone who learns the value of people whom he may not fully understand, and does so with a delicate, nuanced touch.<br><br>I love this movie, even if only for the scene with Hoffman talking to the Log Cabin Republican about their own bias against more flamboyant gays. It's powerful and true, and one of the only films to address the issue, even if only briefly.","user":"loudprincess","rank":[28,28]},{"title":"Offbeat movie with a point","rating":7,"date":"15 May 2000","review":"Â‘Flawless' is an offbeat story about Walter Koontz (Robert De Niro) an ex-cop who suffers a stroke and loses partial ability to speak.  In an effort to regain some of his speech capabilities it is recommended to him that he take singing lessons.  So he decides to ask his neighbor Rusty (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is a female impersonator, to give him singing lessons.  This is an unlikely pairing because Walter is a belligerent homophobe.<br><br>This film was written and directed by Joel Schumacher.  His story, though peculiar, makes some powerful points.  This is a story about hatred, bigotry and reconciliation.  Walter learns through his disability who his friends really are, and who they are not.  It seems that the people he hates treat him a lot better than the people he thought he loved.  Ultimately, he is able to look past his prejudices to find the human elements that make him and Rusty not so different after all.<br><br>This was an excellent character study of both main characters, giving a lot of insight into the motivations and lives of each.  Unfortunately, the story meanders too often to irrelevant characters and scenes that don't really contribute much (like the Gay Republicans).  Schumacher would have been better to concentrate on the relationship between Walter and Rusty rather than digressing so frequently into Rusty's relationships with his friends.<br><br>De Niro was outstanding in this film.  Not only was he excellent in the emotional portrayal of a man having to deal with a sudden debilitating stroke, but he was very realistic in his portrayal of the physical disability itself.  The combination of his struggles to do the simplest of tasks and the obvious look of anguish and frustration on his face was poignant and affecting.<br><br>Hoffman brought a lot of emotional energy to his part, and his imitation of a drag queen was passable, though somewhat forced and unnatural.  Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who played Cha-Cha, the winner of the Flawless contest, was a much more convincing queen.<br><br>I rated this film a 7/10.  This is a good film that helps us understand that the remedy for the fear wrought of our differences is understanding, not hatred.  In that respect it makes an important contribution.  If cross dressing and blatantly gay themes put you off, perhaps you should defy your inclinations and see it.","user":"FlickJunkie-2","rank":[38,43]},{"title":"Awesome Acting 101","rating":16,"date":"16 January 2001","review":"I am sorry to say that I saw this movie for the first time today.  You know they say hind sight is 20/20.  I remember when the previews for the movie were out and I thought that looks like a really great movie.  It was an incredible movie.<br><br>De Niro is exceptional as the homophobic former hero cop with a speech impediment due to a stroke.  Hoffman is wonderful as the singing drag queen. The chemistry between the characters is true to life and heartfelt.  When they come together, we see that their dissimilar lives are not so dissimilar at all.  They are both overcoming some of the same trials and tribulations just over different things.  They develop an amazing bond that will help them through the tough times.<br><br>A Flawlessly Beautiful Movie.","user":"cherry2x","rank":[55,64]}]
