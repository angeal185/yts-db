[{"title":"A little slow","rating":5,"date":"4 May 2019","review":"There are some good things here but the film drags for the first hour and once the action takes place, there isn't a lot and what there is seems a little style-ized like John Wick. Unfortunately there isn't much background to explain how the hero gets his abilities. And the villains aren't exactly formidable so that prevailing over them isn't a big deal.<br><br>That being said, the story was OK and I liked the Aztec references. It's a good idea and I hope they do the next one with a little more thought.<br><br>If you want a film with a more authentic feel, try \"Avenge the Crows\".","user":"drjgardner","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"Basically Mexican \"Batman Begins\", but not as spectacular","rating":5,"date":"6 May 2019","review":"Was hoping this would be a surprise hit but it was pretty lacking. Takes way to long before it kicks into gear since most of the major events/details are done previously in the background. So the audience is always playing catch-up blind. But when the action comes it is nicely violent and gory. Then the movie is over just as quickly.<br><br>I didn't particular care for the story, which involves rival gangs, the cartel, and the mystery of the lead's twin brother's death (not a spoiler, it is established very early on and this site's synopsis isn't exactly comprehensive). The movie opens with them as kids one night, then jumps forward in time 20 years. Unfortunately, we see nothing of them growing up so you don't get a good grasp of the relationship drama that the film wants to portray. Some of it felt overly convoluted/confusing, other times like basic scene padding.<br><br>But on the other hand, this is a decent origin story so if there's ever a sequel then they should be able to skip all this fluff and really knock it out.","user":"piggulu","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"A Punisher rip off!","rating":4,"date":"4 May 2019","review":"Okay, I went into this movie with high hopes. Watching the trailer reminded me of the Marvel character The Punisher and the Netflix hit series. The first hour of the movie was a snooze fest. It dragged on and took forever to develop the story. Once we get to some real action we find that the fight scenes although good in my opinion were not shot very well.<br><br>If you were going to see go to see Kate Del Castillo as a drug lord forget about it. The scene of here in the trailer is the extent of here active participation in this film. The acting in general was wooden and unconvincing and One other annoying aspect of this film was the the main character kept having flash backs to the same exact scene of his childhood over and over again. This is definitely a one time watch for me. If you go in not expecting much you may not be disappointed.","user":"chatpilot","rank":[18,29]}]
