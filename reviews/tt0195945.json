[{"title":"Actually quite funny without Chris Tucker","rating":10,"date":"16 March 2002","review":"Next Friday is actually pretty funny even though it lacks the film's first scene stealer Chris Tucker. Ice Cube makes a funny script with the help of new scene stealer Mike Epps who plays his cousin Day-Day. All in all if you just want a good time check this one out.","user":"DunnDeeDaGreat","rank":[17,24]},{"title":"Hope the crackakillers pay well, or its back to the ghetto you go!","rating":19,"date":"19 June 2000","review":"First off: Why is Craig smoking? Why is Craig pimping? Why is Craig beating up Pinky? Where are the good Female Characters? Where is Smokey? Where is F. Gary Gray? Why is Craig's dad poop gag (good in the first one) so played out? Why is Baby D a rip-off of Felicia? Why is day-day's gf a rip-off of Craig's gf in Friday? Why is the soundtrack not as good as the first one? Why, in spite of all this, it's still funny!!!! If you haven't seen/don't like Friday, check it out. It's cliched (fat girl, crazy white guys, crazy mexican guys) but it's pretty good. 7/10","user":"SpackerMatt","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Close, but not quite there.","rating":5,"date":"5 June 2000","review":"You have to give Ice Cube credit. He tried to make a good sequel, but somehow it didn't quite work. It was close though, and fairly funny.<br><br>At one point, in narration, Craig says, \"I sure miss Smokey.\"<br><br>We do too.","user":"Banky-4","rank":[8,11]}]
