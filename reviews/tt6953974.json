[{"title":"don't go ! it's actually good ;)","rating":7,"date":"1 March 2019","review":"So I've found this movie, saw the trailer and was excited about it. It seemed like the movie I've been looking for a long time. Then I decided to read User's review beforehand (just to be sure) and almost decided not to watch it.<br><br>first of all, there are some flaws, yes but to me it doesn't deserve this kind of rating (like really ? worst than street fighter ?) at all. I get that it wouldn't touch everyone the way it touched me but it's not a bad film.<br><br>Two people in a bed for a day, giving a shot at complete honesty, and falling in love. the story is really good, I like it and wanted to see a movie like that for a long time, it reminds me of Two nights stand a bit (if you liked it give it a shot).<br><br>The moviemaking is not bad either, as I said not flawless (there is this weird 'let's take a look at the outside so we can fast-forward'), but pretty good. loved the dialogues, actors are good, not that much nudity even though they're naked during the whole movie, nor sex, at least not explicit.","user":"pierreboudehen","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"I really liked it","rating":8,"date":"13 June 2019","review":"I don't understand why the low scoring. This is a good movie in my opinion, with great acting, and an interesting story about connecting with people in our times.","user":"iuliafacebook","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Amazing acting","rating":10,"date":"19 May 2019","review":"Such an extraordinary well-directed movie i almost didnt watch because of the ratings. However, the acting, the idea of depicting two lives, past and future in a studio room is brilliant. Actors did a wonderful job... Not a typical faorytale movie with a happy ending, but definitely a life as it is. Thousands congrats to the crew and a big thankyou to the director...","user":"melitaaleksa","rank":[6,9]}]
