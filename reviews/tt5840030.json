[{"title":"Actually quite believable","rating":8,"date":"3 August 2017","review":"This is one of the better Lifetime thrillers. It's actually believable. A concerned mother is worried about her 18 year old daughter and her new boyfriend. Things are moving fast and they want to go an a trip. But little does she know there is a twin and evil twin brother. The evil one had killed their parents in a car crash and then switches place with the good one during a visit. Of course the idiot daughter still won't think there is much wrong after the switch even when the evil one acts more aggressive. It's a little frustrating how long it takes for the good one to prove he is who he is but if it were any faster the story would be over. Anyway the direction is quite swift and things proceed to a satisfying conclusion. Brigid Branagh is the concerned mother. The guy who plays the twins is quite good. Even though they don't have a different hair style or anything you can tell them apart.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Good Movie","rating":9,"date":"1 February 2017","review":"While the story of twins has been used multiple times this was quite enjoyable. The way the evil twin (Derek) set the tone by continually claiming to be his brother Tyler set up Tyler so that when the actual Derek pulled off the change of places everyone was so used to the claim \"I am Tyler\" everyone ignored the complaint. The hospital staff totally ignored the complaints of the normal brother and as usual there solution was to either tie him down or drug him. The mother was always suspicious but the girl friend seemed oblivious. The question would be after that has happened it would seem the mother would be concerned about insanity in the family. Overall fast paced and interesting even is a bit predictable.","user":"sweeney-james","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"***","rating":8,"date":"18 January 2017","review":"Why in the name of heaven wasn't a blood test taken to see that the complaints of the twin being held as his psychotic brother was all true? It took more than half of the film until this was done and then we see the mental hospital full of making apologies for not believing the normal brother. The head nurse there looked like she could have played Nurse Ratched in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\"<br><br>We're dealing with an evil twin ran his car off the road, killing his parents and girlfriend, he believed that the girl loved his brother and that the parents favored the brother.<br><br>Not only does he change places with the brother, but he goes to the home of the latter's girlfriend and her mother becomes suspicious at once when she witnesses unusual behavior. One inmate at the asylum believed that the brother had changed places in the tradition that sometimes the patients of medical institutions are more attuned than the professionals working there. This all comes with the mother, abandoned by her husband 10 years before, begins a budding relationship with her neighbor. The latter even gives a gun to our impostor for shooting practice. With it all, total mayhem is finally avoided.","user":"edwagreen","rank":[6,10]}]
