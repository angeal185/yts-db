[{"title":"Great acting and sense of reality. But story?","rating":6,"date":"24 February 2019","review":"No spoilers because... what would I spoil?\nBasically just followed around a dude his last 40 days in Prison.\nIt was very much real life.\nBut we could be watching any characters last 40 days, why this guy?\nThe why isn't super clear.\nStill a good film.\nBecause of the nature of this portraying reality, reality offers much beneath the surface that different people connect with and see.\nTherefore I believe every 10 star review is justified. I personally watched the credits roll with a resounding, \"well. Ok.\" in my head.","user":"isaacthe","rank":[30,39]},{"title":"Jeffrey Wright is one of the greatest actors of our generation.","rating":9,"date":"25 February 2019","review":"This film felt like cinema at its finest. The moral and psychological dilemma's the main character, Louis, was going through played out in a beautiful nuanced way. Jeffrey Wright once again becomes the character he is playing in a way that makes you feel for them. Great film among the noise.","user":"jonnywalker-70280","rank":[24,34]},{"title":"Riveting","rating":8,"date":"24 February 2019","review":"It was very well written and the actors performance were strong. There was great depth to the characters even-though the story line was not complex. Yet, it presented just enough suspense to keep you uneasy. The scene with his victim's sister was amazingly honest. The cinematography gave it a documentary feel. Job well done HBO!","user":"frankwhitek","rank":[26,41]}]
