[{"title":"An unspoken plagiarism","rating":3,"date":"10 April 2018","review":"Although the initial synopsis sounded intresting on a psychological level, the movie very quickly showed lack of character depth and back-up stories as well as stereotypes : the two main sister characters are just very caricatural in their exhuberant&amp;successful VS introvert&amp;envious dynamic. There are huge narrative ellipses that make it quite hard to give credit to the development of the storyline. And last but not least, this movie borrows a great deal from \"Always Shine\", a 2016 movie directed by Sophia Takal and starring Caitlin Fitzgerald. So it definitely feels like a \"deja vu\".","user":"demone-01827","rank":[5,10]}]
