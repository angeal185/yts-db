[{"title":"It is THAT bad. How did did it get a 6.5 rating?","rating":3,"date":"13 February 2018","review":"A sci-fi thriller with a 6.5 rating...it sounded awesome. I persisted. And persisted. Annnnnd persisted. <br><br>What a waste of 90 minutes of life. <br><br>Spare yourself the pain.","user":"kcspam","rank":[34,41]},{"title":"I fell asleep","rating":1,"date":"1 January 2018","review":"Cannot remember any movie where I just fell asleep without being tired. This movie builds up so slowly that it really is a cure for sleeplessness! Honestly, if you have sleeping problems just watch this movie. Acting is also terrible. It missed everything but the main reason why I rate this movie 1 star is because those behind this movie tried to put some kind of emotion into it by putting a lot of attention into certain scenes but actually got the opposite. A shameful and laughable approach to a situation that is very serious when it happens to anyone in real life. Makers of this movie, do something else!","user":"chameleonaram","rank":[27,34]},{"title":"Not awful but not great","rating":4,"date":"28 October 2017","review":"The main thing this film seems to me to be is a vehicle for the director to show his liking for Juanita Ringeling. Some of her scenes could be outtakes from a Calvin Klein underwear commercial.<br><br>She can act decent enough, but there's really no need to see her in her pants quite so much.<br><br>The male actors were not great in this. The husband was annoying: he is studying the phenomenon concerned but still doesn't believe his own wife when she says she's affected by it???? Idiotic.<br><br>Effects are decent. It's shot beautifully. But it's a pretty weak attempt at a not too bad film idea.<br><br>You could take or leave this sci-fi/horror film very easily. But I guess it's a way to while away an empty couple of hours that's not too offensive. Do yourself a favour though and watch William Eubank's 'The Signal' instead.","user":"Dextronix","rank":[16,19]}]
