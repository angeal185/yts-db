[{"title":"Better Than Expected","rating":7,"date":"5 March 2010","review":"Clutch Powers is Lego City's best explorer. His latest mission is to capture a criminal mastermind who is also a wizard. Teaming up with other Lego characters such as Brick, a weapons expert, Peg, a smart botanist and Bernie, Lego's best engineer, they travel into space and into medieval times to stop the wizard and his comical sidekicks, Skully &amp; Bones, two skeleton warriors. It is better than it sounds. Humorous and lots of fun, this was a lot better than expected, with some standout scenes and interesting characters, this Lego homage to explorer films is a lot of fun for kids and adults.<br><br>Rated G Some Scary Scenes.","user":"rickytrapp","rank":[22,22]},{"title":"A cinematic masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"22 February 2019","review":"Best movie ever made. Te world has never seen a more glorious hero than my boy Clutch Powers, blessed be his holy name.","user":"samkomracka","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"The greatest Lego movie devised by man","rating":10,"date":"18 August 2017","review":"This movie is the magnum opus of reality itself, after 13.8 billion years of celestial progression and biological evolution. The fact that other critics are not rating this a full 10/10 baffles me on a spiritual level, but it just goes to show how blind our current society is to the truth. Clutch Powers is my hero, my idol, and he is owed all of the respect in the world. <br><br>First off, the Adventures of Clutch Powers does an unspeakably excellent job of depicting the fragility of man, and how our souls are weighed down by Earth's gravity (Sieg Zeon). From start to finish, this interplanetary adventure showcases an astounding amount of philosophical value that I will not get into in this review simply because this review is weighed down by a maximum of 1,000 words, much like how our souls are weighed down by Earth's gravity.<br><br>The only minor gripe I have with this film is that the other characters are not as good as Clutch himself, so they tend to hold him back from his true potential at times. But aside from that, the plot is well thought out and riveting, the animation is of a level of quality several orders of magnitude greater than what you'd see from Pixar, and the soundtrack is perfection incarnate. <br><br>Spoilers: I still believe that Kjeld Playwell was the one who murdered Clutch Powers's father. I wish this were expanded upon in the film, but the sequel may explain this and set my soul at ease.<br><br>I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, it is a cinematic masterpiece in every sense of the word.","user":"nio-37498","rank":[8,8]}]
