[{"title":"Collage of protests","rating":6,"date":"27 April 2014","review":"The movie is like a documentary collage of different civil movements all over the world, including Cairo, Damascus, Tehran, NY and Madrid. We also would hear a narrative of one of Femen group leaders and the difficulties she encountered during her activism of her own way. For me, except being impressed by different styles and forms of protesting, the movie was so inspirational in a way that it was informing its audience how they can act as an individual toward a change. But still, if you expect a movie or a documentary with a concrete plot or something new to say, you wouldn't find it after watching \"every day rebellion\". One last thing that bothered me was that I don't personally like the movies who put the audiences in the position of crying, by endless dramatic-tragic scenes. This movie did that to me.","user":"parisadarya","rank":[1,2]}]
