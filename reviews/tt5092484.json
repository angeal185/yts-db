[{"title":"Slow.","rating":6,"date":"9 August 2019","review":"I don't know, the acting was good, the cinematography was good, but the story lacked any real depth, and unfortunately the characters were also severely under developed. I actually didnt care for the whole premise of this film, because it was about a well off narcissistic white couple, who flips properties using undocumented Latino men to do the work. But instead of paying their hires, they imprisoned them, they terrorized and tortured them, and when the work was finished, they killed them and left their corpses to rot under the houses. One can see here why racial hatred is such a cancer on society, because it's things like this movie that help to desensitize people and perpetuate pigeonholing a group of people based solely on their race. Prejudice is a sickness of fearful, narcissistic, self entitled, elitists; it's weak minded people who take all they can when it serves them, no matter who's left drowning and destroyed in their wake.","user":"kryptonarie","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Disturbed reality.","rating":5,"date":"28 April 2019","review":"This films takes a real life scenario, undocumented immigrants working for below minimum wage to scrape a living, and turns it into a disturbed thriller. I won't go into details about the content, but I will say that the female lead is a total nut job!\nThe scary thing about this film is the fact that it could happen, maybe even has to some degree.\nReason for the 5 stars? Slow start, lack of depth in the \"immigrant\" characters and a poor finale. The film deserved more... a good story, but needed more.","user":"Samthesham67","rank":[32,56]},{"title":"Hey, not bad !","rating":7,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"Leave aside the overuse of \"Thrilling Sound effects\" it's a good Indie movie. The cinematography is great, the tension is present all over the movie - you really wanna kill that woman- and the message is good. It's good to see something new is the thriller scene, which became sadly empty the last couple of years in my opinion. It won't mark me, but it's just a bit of fresh air.","user":"jeremieschuler","rank":[10,15]}]
