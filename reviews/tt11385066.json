[{"title":"Brutally dull.","rating":2,"date":"1 January 2020","review":"It sucks in every way, boring actors, screenplay, plot.. terrible mix of a melancholy soundtrack that contrasts the screenplay in various scenes.. A ghastly experience.","user":"andrew-dodge58","rank":[54,55]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"9 January 2020","review":"When you think it can't get worse he can win the challenge. It looks terrible. The worst movie I've seen in the last 10 years.","user":"colarusso-1","rank":[26,26]},{"title":"There's bad, and there's this.","rating":1,"date":"30 December 2019","review":"I kept watching because it's so bad. The story is all over the place. It feels like a 3hr movie and it's just over an hour. If you want to know how not to make a film, or write it, watch this. How do things like this even get made? Who's the person that convinces producers that this is something solid?","user":"Seppe_VB","rank":[55,58]}]
