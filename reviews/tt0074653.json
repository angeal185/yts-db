[{"title":"Most Competent Rudy Ray Moore Movie","rating":6,"date":"12 August 1999","review":"I've seen Dolemite and Disco Godfather as well as Human Tornado...I'm something of a Rudy fan.  I must say, however, that Human Tornado is the most competant Rudy Ray Moore movie I have seen (admittedly I have not seen Petey Wheatstraw or Monkey Hustle).  The direction, camera work, and acting, while still substandard is no where near as atrocious as in Dolemite or Godfather.  The story is simple and routine, but the dialogue and rapping is high-larious.  My favorite scene for all out ridiculousness was when Rudy and \"Miss Wonderful\" get naked and....excercise in bed. Literally.  I must say, however, if you're looking for the highlarious incompetency of Godfather, it won't be found here.","user":"DrSatan","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Yes, Comedy Gold.. no, Comedy Platinum!","rating":10,"date":"13 February 2013","review":"Now who could criticize a Rudy Ray Moore film? Why would you want to? You can't have accidentally wandered into it. And if you did you could walk out in the first two minutes and just forget about it. Why go out of your way to squawk. Makes no sense. Rudy Ray is what he is. This is burlesque: low comedy and semi-nude ladies. You don't wander into a burly-Q show and then squawk because it isn't Shakespeare or the King James, and if you do you're showing a real serious lack of intelligence. So, since I use a binary reviewing method, ie ON or OFF, I hereby give this appalling grindhouse classic a score of 10. Particularly comic is Rudy Ray's absurd vocalizations when he does his faux Kung Fu stuff, and the speeded up segments for the fight scenes. Everybody in the flick looks to be having fun. And why not?","user":"deletewindowson","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Mr Moore and his hush puppies!","rating":8,"date":"8 December 2003","review":"Who said sequels suck? Not Rudy Ray Moore who IS the human tornado! You better hope you never meet Dolemite just before he drops one of his ass kickin', head beatin' rap soliloquay's, as this would warrant a reversed film jump onto a rooftop with a sloppy slap to the mouth, while his topless beauties sit in the background laughing it up in what must be the (intentionally) funniest Blacksploitation film ever (yes funnier than the original Dolemite film!)<br><br>You will not only laugh at the fight scenes, but the dialogue is hilarious! Forget competent filmmaking as that adds for all the enjoyment!. All serious expectations should be left at the front door when watching this.<br><br>A true gem that  will never be recreated except in the music video's of Snoop dogg. (and thats a good thing!)","user":"aswerve","rank":[5,6]}]
