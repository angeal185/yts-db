[{"title":"An Avant Garde Homage to Horror Films of the Past","rating":10,"date":"17 September 2012","review":"Inspired by the great Dario Argento, Joseph Tito brings an artistically tense and understated horror to the 21st century. Set in the beautifully old and lavish Caravaggio, the film is set in an old hotel, where a Canadian with a haunting past arrives to further her religious studies. A list of murders ensue, each depicting a scene from the powerful paintings of the Baroque artist, Caravaggio. Playing on the mystery and magic of religion and art, the colorful cast and profoundly chilling background, you are brought into a story that mixes the reality with the surreal. Maria Grazia Cucinotta, from the acclaimed \"Il Postino\", plays a quirky role, definitely expanding her acting capabilities and is a pleasure to watch. Silvio Oddi plays the handsome detective, his delivery and performance keep you on your toes, as he tries to unravel the web of mystery. The lead Canadian May, played by Natasha Allan, is perfect for horror, her screams and doe eyes, instill trust and faith in her predicament, as well as keep you rooting for her all the way to the end. The supporting cast of odd-ball characters that are staying at the hotel, add humor, sexuality and mystique to the already evocative cast. Beautifully shot, the rich, dark tones of Caravaggio's work are weaved throughout the movie, creating unease. The horror is highlighted powerfully throughout the film, honoring the old gore of yesteryear, mixed with simple shots that simply make your skin crawl. In a genre that has been overtaken by special effects and the more gore the better, it is refreshing to have a suspenseful thriller add more artistic flair, a powerful cast and powerful visuals. Bravo, Joseph, I want more!","user":"josie-houpt","rank":[10,22]}]
