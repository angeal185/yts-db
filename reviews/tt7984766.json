The work simply becomes reality and it is like being in the theater all the time and time flies. A stellar cast that plays its part in a credible and passionate way. Timoth√©e, once again, confirms to be one of the most promising stars of the current decade and Michod has only done what was not done since the days of Ridley Scott's Gladiator.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[47,53]}]
