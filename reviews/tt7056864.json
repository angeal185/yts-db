[{"title":"Horror-able!","rating":5,"date":"25 March 2018","review":"The real Cocaine Grandmother, Griselda Blanco was known for executing literally hundreds of men, women, and even children who either interfered with her drug smuggling empire, or who simply pissed her off. In reality, being remotely involved with Griselda Blanco and her drug cartel empire was enough of a reason for considering a person to already have one foot in the grave including her sons and various husbands.<br><br>This loosely based biography has the attractive Catherine Zeta-Jones attempting rather poorly to represent Griselda Blanco as the bi-sexual mother and wife as well as the vicious and extremely homely real-life cocaine grandmother. What results is a less than inspiring attempt at a high level historical adaptation of the cocaine grandmother, her sons, husbands, and lovers outwitting the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agents) for decades all rolled up in a two (2) hour film I would call a non event, worthy of only a mediocre 5 out of 10 rating.","user":"Ed-Shullivan","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"Worst drug movie I have ever seen","rating":3,"date":"22 December 2018","review":"Total garbage.

About all I can say is that if you're not from Medellin, Colombia you will never capture the flavor of its people, good or bad. Likewise there are many untruths in the movie, Alberto Bravo was not killed for infidelity nor that way. And La Madre never worked for Pablo Escobar. He actually muscled in on HER territory. At lease give her her infamous credit where it is due.","user":"crowjake-07362","rank":[27,38]}]
