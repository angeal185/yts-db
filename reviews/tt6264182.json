The mask looks great, courtney gains does a good job, and the carnival setting looks cool.<br><br>The bad. Terrible fx and an inexcusable CGI blood effect. Underused Tony Todd and PJ soles. Terrible action, amateur editing and sound mistakes, and a completely wooden supporting cast.<br><br>That being said, I am interested to see what the director does next. He had some great core ideas and I think he has the stuff to make a good movie, it just wasn't this one.","user":"tcondit-49882","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Dread Central and Bloody disgusting","rating":2,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"Have to stop putting their names behind terrible genre movies. If you are true fans of the genre you need to align with true horror movies, better scripts. Better actors. Better made films. Tony Todd, PJ Soles and Courtney Gaines can't save this piece of garbage. But again, none of them have been known for their acting abilities now have they?!? This only cost me bandwidth and time, save yourself and read a book instead","user":"mdbourke-282-899973","rank":[20,27]},{"title":"The only thing good about this movie is...","rating":4,"date":"25 September 2019","review":"Pancho Moler as Dr.Death and certain kills and Jacobs costume and mask...stale acting and scores.<br><br>Constructive Criticism is a virtue.","user":"morrish-49324","rank":[7,8]}]
