[{"title":"Awesome","rating":10,"date":"1 March 2019","review":"I went to see this in ESO planetarium in Munich. Very very good and simple illustration of Newton's and Einstein's theory. I think the story is very well suited for people who don't know too much physics. Also, very updated information since the gravitational wave was just awarded Nobel prize in 2017.","user":"u-59024-49826","rank":[2,2]}]
