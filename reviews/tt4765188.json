[{"title":"Starts okay to finish awfully","rating":3,"date":"25 June 2018","review":"I thought the first half of The Haunted House On Kirby Road was all right, with a couple good laughs and not much (or any) horror at that point. The acting wasn't bad either, not spectacular but not annoying either. And then came the second part. The part that is supposed to be the horror side of the movie. Now, that was pretty lame, if not awful at some point. The acting changed completely from being okay to bad. The horror scenes, if you can call them like that, are very badly done, quite the opposite of the first half of the movie where I thought the cinematography was more than decent. And even if you would like to pass the horror scenes as humor it didn't work at all, it was just bad. The movie ratings dropped at that point. Before the 'horror' I would have rate it a six but now a three is more than fair enough.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"indie horror","rating":5,"date":"19 August 2017","review":"Six young friends watch a video of a haunted house on the internet. One of them recognizes the person in the video. They decide to check out the haunted house on Kirby Road.<br><br>It's a low budget Canadian indie horror. The setup is fine if rather plain. The condom scene has one hilarious laugh. It's a good start but it stagnates upon arriving at the house. It takes awhile for the horror to start. In fact, it's well into the second half. The actors are ready to scream but the house is not up to the challenge. It's an indie horror that fails to be scary.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Indie Horror at its finest","rating":9,"date":"30 May 2018","review":"Its been awhile since I've seen a horror film that didn't seem like its sole purpose was to out gore all those before it &amp; The Haunted House on Kirby Road was a refreshing break from that. For me this movie delivered exactly what I anticipated, a sort of Scream-esque mix of light-hearted funny scenes mixed with enough scary ones that made me momentarily afraid to look in the mirror when I got out of the shower later that day. A Horror movie that can stir up your imagination enough to still creep you out hours later rather than just make you nauseous with blood and guts to me is film worth watching!","user":"akemp-39645","rank":[10,20]}]
