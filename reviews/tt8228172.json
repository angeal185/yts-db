[{"title":"Better than most","rating":6,"date":"3 September 2019","review":"This movie has a unique plot to it and is quite well made. The lead actors are solid and the tension and gore don't fail to deliver. Boom!...there goes your head.\nGive it a go.","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[37,49]},{"title":"Why in THE HELL is this rated so low!!??","rating":9,"date":"1 December 2019","review":"I wasn't asking either. I was scolding! ☝🏼 What was there not to like? I'm a picky person. A horror snob. I haven't seen a slasher movie to give me these kind of feels since the early 90s. THIS was old school slasher style. I covered my eyes twice, screamed in a pillow and ran in place! Girls get kidnapped and put in coffins that sit in the middle of an isolated field and men in scary masks with hatchets, machetes and axes are hunting them down. But if that wasn't enough for you there were also cringe-worthy kills! How are you not impressed? How were you not entertained? I hardly ever like anything new but this was a rare gem. When it was over I felt like Horror Santa left this for me because he knew I was being good this year and I deserved this. Thanks Santa. 👍🏽","user":"rocabella-60777","rank":[24,34]},{"title":"Awesome!!","rating":7,"date":"4 September 2019","review":"This was one pretty hardcore slasher flick. The gore and intensity was excellent. Definitely a new favorite film of mine. I didnt really recognize anyone in this one, but it was perfectly acted and filmed. These kind of movies where people are hunted down throughout the whole thing, are so much fun. I really enjoyed it!!","user":"kyleallencole9","rank":[26,40]}]
