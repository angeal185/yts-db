[{"title":"Heartfelt Triumph!","rating":9,"date":"17 December 2017","review":"For me this movie hit close to home as my sister and I lost our mother suddenly, when we were young, and at a time we were expecting many more years of love! I am sure this is the case for many losing a parent can be a hard fact of life at any age. J.K. Simmons always seems to rise to the occasion of any role he plays. This one is no different as you feel like you experience the pain with him at moments in the movie. Great effects as just like in real life there are memories that trigger the hardship of losing a loved one, and it is sometimes hard to get your balance! I felt the story as a whole was very well done as it starts out with J.K. Simmons taking his son packing up, moving, and trying to start elsewhere by leaving the home that him and his wife spent over 30 years in. As we all know running away from something doesn't help until we face tragedy head on. Some great acting also by Josh Wiggins (who I recently saw in Walking Out) who plays the son. I though the cast was well thought out, and and the movie gets support from all of them with some great acting. I especially liked the part of Carine who is played by Julie Delpy, many of you might remember her playing Carine in the Before Sunrise, Sunset, and Midnight Trilogies. Also her being French and being cast as the French Teacher in this one was a brilliant move. All in all an experience well worth watching as I liked the way the movie developed and took us all on a memorable ride and experience. Like I said one that many of us have been taken on a similar ride in a part of life that can be tragic and one that we deal with in many different ways. This one exposes many of the other characters realizing we all are dealing and surrounded by other's who can be hurting from life in different ways. Again a great Heartfelt triumph, very well done!!","user":"horizonbts-206-628336","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"Two romantic comedies in one","rating":22,"date":"22 December 2017","review":"This film tells the story of a man and his teenage son, who struggles to cope with the death of their wife and mother.<br><br>It is unusual to have a romantic comedy set in such dire backdrop, but in here it works. The two budding romances are convincing and engaging. I enjoyed watching it.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"Wow! A Must See Movie But Have the Kleenex Ready at the Wonderful Ending!","rating":10,"date":"23 January 2018","review":"Although the movie portrays the pain, anxiety &amp; frustration when dealing with depression, there are many scenes of caring, empathy &amp; domestic love, especially between the dad(so superbly played by J.K. Simmons, an Oscar and Golden Globe winner best known as the character Vern in the HBO prison drama OZ, the psychiatrist in Law &amp; Order &amp; of course as the spokesman for Farmers Insurance TV ads) and one of the best young actors today in Hollywood, Josh Wiggins in the role of Wes. Not only are the performances of these two leads absolutely outstanding but the on screen chemistry made this movie a delight to watch. I will always watch any movie that Simmons is in as well as\nJosh Wiggins whom I've had the pleasure to watch previously. J.K. Simmons makes other actors with whom he performs that much better. Casting, directing &amp; writing kudos especially with two of the main supporting cast, Jean Kelly(French teacher) &amp; Kevin Dunn, a Hollywood character actor mainstay, as the Headmaster. I'm sure, as with others watching this movie, I can personally relate to those close to me suffering from depression. Sadly, my \"partner\" of 11 years, Kris, eventually lost his battle and passed away on October 13, 2017, age 43. He, like many others left behind, as depicted in this movie, would want us all to be strong, cherish happy memories &amp; carry on with life. Yes, it's tragic when we lose the one(s) we love, such as the mother in this movie, but what's important is to \"Celebrate their Life\", no matter what form it takes and not dwell on their passing. Congratulations on a heartfelt movie and outstanding performances.<br><br>Robert C. Thompson, Victoria, B.C. Canada(robert23@shaw.ca)","user":"robert23-1","rank":[8,11]}]
