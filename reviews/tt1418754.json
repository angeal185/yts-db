[{"title":"Food for Thought","rating":8,"date":"23 June 2014","review":"After reading the plot and seeing the few good actors in the movie I felt it was something I could give a shot, it might be good. Well after 90 minutes of my life I don't feel disappointed. In fact it has made me sit in silence (for a solid 15 minutes) just thinking more and more of the meaning.<br><br>It surely doesn't have the effect as say \"Her\", in a thought provoking sense, though it is a solid movie.<br><br>What honestly can be done to forgive someone for such heinous crimes, if you know they will commit them again? This movie asks that question and more.<br><br>Over all the movie had some shaky shots, little over the top acting conversely not enough acting, some shots were not needed and could have added a bit more background to the story in a few places but I still ended up questioning myself after. Which I always find as a good sign.<br><br>Whats a good movie without a good afterthought?","user":"MrEnjoy","rank":[102,120]},{"title":"Worth a look","rating":10,"date":"20 June 2014","review":"I must admit to being a bit perplexed by some of the reviews for this film. I found it extremely compelling and confronting, perhaps audiences and critics no longer want to be challenged to think when they see a movie?<br><br>It seems to me that the only way this film wouldn't resonate with you was if you had managed to get through your life without ever feeling victimized at any level.<br><br>I would highly recommend an open mind if you do choose to see this title as well as the willingness to think about your own morality and level of participation in society, this is not a gentle film, it is film that will challenge you on a number of levels.","user":"whitelight_33","rank":[151,189]},{"title":"Absolutely outstanding!","rating":10,"date":"26 June 2014","review":"John Doe: Vigilante is an amazing film. <br><br>I will begin by saying that I am generally more interested in lower budget films compared with big budget blockbusters so I may be a little biased. However I feel some of the reviews I have read online for John Doe are incredibly unfair.<br><br>The subject matter dealt with in John Doe was addressed in a highly effective way. The film was able to make a situation, seemingly out of the realm of possibility for most of us seem as if it were unfolding in reality. <br><br>This film is not just an excuse for glorified violence and bloodshed. It makes a powerful statement about the ineffectiveness of the Australian Justice System. <br><br>I felt so strongly after watching that I immediately went to the website and chose to review the film (firsts for both).<br><br>If you like to think about what you are watching, both during and after then be sure to check out John Doe: Vigilante. There are some fairly confronting images used without being obscene. <br><br>I am a film student in Australia and am genuinely inspired by this film and highly recommend it.","user":"jackr003","rank":[98,126]}]
