[{"title":"As if there wasn't enough Islamophobia already","rating":1,"date":"10 March 2020","review":"Yet another movie depicting the positives and pride of muslim women freely making decisions into something oppressing, disgusting, and just WRONG. Muslims suffer enough at this day and age because of things that hold people out of their religion at fault. Yet here we are, throwing more stones.. Throw away.. Throw away. I know hundreds of muslims but why doesnt this film have anything to do with the absolutely magnificent lives of those that I know. You just portray this really dark, over the top exaggerated picture. You should be ashamed.","user":"imnever","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Not surprised","rating":1,"date":"6 January 2020","review":"Just when I thought I could watch a movie depicting a Muslim girl's daily struggles with practicing her religion in the west and hoping to see her win in the end, I'm not surprised with the outcome.\nJust once, I'd like to see a movie showing that a girl does actually feel free with her hijab on and that she doesn't need to take it off to feel empowered.\nHorrible movie. Second half of it was a mess. I got bored during many scenes. I didn't understand why they had to show her getting close to her teacher as well. What was the point of that?\nIt was pretty sloppy.","user":"hbakhit","rank":[24,35]},{"title":"Very Disappointing","rating":1,"date":"24 January 2020","review":"In one line: A Hindu religion girl chooses to act as a Muslim teenager, who do not know how to speak URDU properly. Movie is trying to show that a Red-light stop means nothing in life, keep driving even when you see Red signals, utter nonsense of a movie.","user":"abrarnadir-383-335451","rank":[12,16]}]
