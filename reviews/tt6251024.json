[{"title":"Unexpectedly Entertaining","rating":7,"date":"6 September 2018","review":"Twisted humorous zombie flick. That's really all you need to know. Lots of B-Grade zombie stuff that when cooked up just right comes out better than expected. This is kind of like taking Office Space style workplace lampooning to a much more ridiculous level. Brenton Thwites as the young office slacker hits it long here. It moves pretty quickly past the usual setup of merging with that magic downsizing. Just a stupid romp that ends up scoring. Also worth noting: the talented Zachary Levi gets his screen time to show how whack he can reach playing control obsessive accountant A Nusbaum gone power mad.","user":"AudioFileZ","rank":[72,93]},{"title":"Meh... Nothing special","rating":4,"date":"8 January 2019","review":"Anyone considering watching this movie should watch Mayham (2017) instead. This movie tried what Mayham succeeded to accomplish.","user":"randomuser_54213431","rank":[19,23]},{"title":"Should have been a comedy","rating":6,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"This film tells story of an office worker for a weapons manufacturer, whose co-workers are turned into zombies by an energy drink. <br><br>The film actually starts out not too bad and quite funny. However once the horror/zombie bit comes in, it falls apart. The horror effects are good. Plenty of blood and gore but it gets a bit dull. Some of the effects are pretty poor. The jokes fall flat. There is little action. Its not really that scary or gory.<br><br>Although it was well acted, I had no connection to the characters. I really didn't care by the end what happened to them. <br><br>It is a shame as there is some great acting and the first bit of the film shows promise. It would probably been better if it had been kept as a straight office comedy rather than trying to make it a horror.","user":"LLgoatJ","rank":[64,88]}]
