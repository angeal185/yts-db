[{"title":"More Bounce To The Ounce","rating":8,"date":"4 April 2007","review":"The Absentminded Professor was the second film that Fred MacMurray in his second career rebirth with Walt Disney as the midwife. He scored an enormous success in The Shaggy Dog and Disney films together with his My Three Sons TV series established MacMurray as the quintessential family father figure which would endure for the rest of his life.<br><br>I do remember seeing this in the theater back as a youngster and back then the younger ones in the crowd were looking at Tommy Kirk who was at the height of his Disney popularity. <br><br>Nevertheless MacMurray gives a delightful performance as science professor Ned Brainerd who's accidentally invented a variation on rubber which has a great deal more bounce to it.<br><br>He's so wrapped up in his experiment that he's even forgetting his wedding day to Nancy Olson, AGAIN. She's about had it with him and ready to fall for the wolfish English professor Elliott Reid.<br><br>MacMurray has his own troubles. Other than helping his college win a basketball game with a team that they are way overmatched against, he's not quite decided what use this stuff he calls flubber is good for. But wealthy Keenan Wynn sure wants to get his hands on it.<br><br>Funniest sequence in the film is Keenan Wynn after MacMurray and Olson trick him into wearing flubberized shoes is seeing bounce slowly into the stratosphere before a quick thinking Tommy Kirk devises a way to counteract his flubberized dad.<br><br>The AbsentMinded Professor was so popular with audiences that Disney did another version with almost the entire same cast in Son of Flubber.<br><br>That one was almost as funny, but this still has a lot of laughs even after almost fifty years.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[20,20]},{"title":"Good Fun for the Whole Family","rating":4,"date":"4 September 2004","review":"It has been years since I have seen this movie! I am glad to see that it is still fun and my girls really enjoyed (4 &amp; 6). What was kinda neat was that the Alonzo Hawk character also returns in Herbie Rides Again (same actor, same personality). Small coincidence, because the movie was also directed by Robert Stevenson.<br><br>So, if you are looking for a film that will not offend, and offer a few chuckles and will captivate your child's attention, check out The Absent Minded Professor.<br><br>Also, IMHO, do not wast time with the Flubber remake.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>C","user":"c2bryan-1","rank":[26,28]},{"title":"Classic MacMurray","rating":30,"date":"30 October 2003","review":"This is probably one of the best live action films Disney has ever released. Fred MacMurray once again proved how great a comedic actor he was and this film is just a confirmation of it.  Also, Nancy Olson was great as his frustrated fiancee, Betsy.  However, the real scene stealer in this film is Keenan Wynne as old man Hawk.  Mr. Hawk was probably one of the biggest weasels in cinematic history and Tommy Kirk is also great as his son Biff.<br><br>\nAlso, the best scene in the whole film is the basketball game.  That scene alone is what makes this film a classic comedy.","user":"Sargebri","rank":[23,26]}]
