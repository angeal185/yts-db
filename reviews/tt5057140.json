[{"title":"Read the book if you are confused.","rating":6,"date":"30 September 2018","review":"I read the book a few months ago and then discovered the movie on Netflix. The movie does follow the book fairly well, but the book just seems to explain things better and provide better background details so you don't feel so confused. I realized the ending of the movie skipped over a lot of details.<br><br>Blond woman who was in the hut helping Core recover from the arrow injury was the mom of the Medora and Vernon, who are twins and in an incestuous relationship. In the end, the twins wander off into the wilderness to live in secret and have another child to start over with. The first son's death is eventually simply accepted and the two move on. The mom provides them supplies. Throughout the movie there are implications about Medora messing with evil and such, and it's primarily because of her relationship with her brother and their child. She was instructed to kill her own child (I think by the wolf killer guy if I remember correctly), and she did. The wolf masks were more like curses in the book. The old lady who was killed was more of the local witch doctor or medicine woman who knew about the incest. <br><br>Very odd book, but the book definitely contains a better ambiance for understanding things.","user":"michellelcalvert","rank":[573,614]},{"title":"Explanation Post","rating":8,"date":"19 April 2019","review":"Smart, well edited, and it held my attention. I read some previous reviews, mostly negative, some positive. Nevertheless, I am here to explain the points and subplots of this movie.<br><br>1) Husband and wife are indeed brother and sister. Same hair, Norwegian, same eyes, a small part actor pointed that out 3/4 of the movie in. Picture of two young blond children 2/3 of the movie in. Wife tells main character traveler, she doesn't remember a time not knowing her husband, 10 mins into the movie.<br><br>2) Reason mother killed her own child. Main character traveler says \" sometimes wolves kill the young pups in order to protect the pack.\" Mother killed the child because child was a murderer at that age. 1/2 through the movie a scene of father and son shown after a hunted kill. Father asks son \" how did that feel\" son replies \" it felt great. \" Son asks father \" is it okay to kill?\" Father replies \" only to protect something you love. \" Hidden meaning, within the first 5 mins mother writes a letter to traveler stating \"there have been TWO OTHER children taken by wolves.\" Her son killed the other children.<br><br>3) Traveler was saved by people not wolves at the end. There are some quick edits at the last 4-5 mins of the movie where it shows a group of women tending to his wound. 20 mins into the movie traveler comes across pack of wolves who do not attack when he falls within striking distance. The women in the hut tending to his wounds are the wolves spiritually. Wolves find him turn into people help him and turn back into wolves. White woman at the end who take travelers boots, that were the husbands to begin with, was the mother of the wife and husband who are brother and sister. Take a second, this one is tough to follow, and understand, but it's true!<br><br>Please add whether this is helpful or not. Thanks for reading if you read the whole thing. :)","user":"aguti-09325","rank":[200,211]},{"title":"Boring and baffling","rating":4,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"Let me start by saying that this movie is not completely garbage. It has something to it that keeps you going. For some reason, despite an unintelligible plot and amazingly slow pace, you still find yourself watching the movie waiting for it to redeem itself. It doesn't. The more time you invest in this adventure, the more painful it becomes to admit that this movie is beyond redemption, that nothing normal is going to happen and that you wasted two hours of your life.","user":"gbortoli","rank":[715,857]}]
