[{"title":"\"Moon-spinners/Spin me a moon tonight...\"","rating":7,"date":"15 January 2001","review":"From Walt Disney, an overly-involved story of jewel thieves and a young girl swept away by intrigue while vacationing in Crete. I understand why some say the film is sluggish or dull; it does drag, and has one too many plots going on, not to mention far too many characters who may-or-may-not be what they seem. However, Hayley Mills is enchanting as intrepid Nikky Ferris. She gets her ire up, gets to be silly, trades quips with Pola Negri (looking regal). Also fabulous: the dizzying sequence where Mills escapes villainous Eli Wallach by jumping from a windmill (beautiful camera-work and direction). Not a taut Hitchcockian mystery, but a good attempt at one. Terrific Terry Gilkyson theme song, fine supporting work from Wallach, Joan Greenwood and young Peter McEnery, who gives Hayley her first screen kiss. *** from ****","user":"moonspinner55","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"Delicious Mystery in Crete","rating":10,"date":"26 October 2003","review":"This movie is one of my favorites from the 1960's and I watch it again every once in a while.  It's also one of my favorite Hayley Mills movies.  The locations are beautiful, interesting and different.  The story is a solid mystery with sympathetic characters, and Mills plays a feisty, strong young woman.  The production values are a bit wanting, however, especially during the windmill scenes.  There's delightful humor, also, especially in some unexpected sights.  And Pola Negri gives a fine performance.  I love this movie and recommend it for anyone who likes a good mystery or Hayley Mills or Crete.","user":"ph0hunter","rank":[28,33]},{"title":"Here's to the Ladies","rating":7,"date":"22 February 2001","review":"No classic, but very pleasing, old-fashioned, middlebrow entertainment of a kind we used to take for granted. A little comedy, a little romance, a lot of action, plenty of eye-filling locations, and, in particular, a trio of wonderful women. Hayley's charming in one of her first puppy-love roles; Joan Greenwood, of the delicious voice, is, as always, indispensable; and Pola Negri does some spirited scenery-chewing in a prominent cameo. They thoroughly outclass the men, including a hammy Eli Wallach and a pallid Peter McEnery.<br><br>Nothing about it is exceptional, but everything about it is at least competent. The direction is a little obvious: Every time a Maguffin appears in the script, Neilson pulls in for a close-up. Perhaps that's a sop to help the kiddies follow the story, though, despite the Disney imprimatur, it's not really a little-kids' film. On the contrary, it's one of Disney's least cloying, and one of the most appealing for grownups.","user":"marcslope","rank":[18,22]}]
