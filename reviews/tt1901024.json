[{"title":"Two years later the ratings drop down","rating":7,"date":"3 June 2018","review":"This movie was initiallly released in Europe. In 2016. Up until then the ratings had it at 7.6\nThen it gets re-released to US and worldwide as Dark Crimes. Then the ratings and reviews drop it down to under 5.\nSo you understand the differences of opinion here.\nI liked the movie. It is slow paced yes, but it does not drag too long. I enjoyed the filmography and the direction of scene (it actually reminded me of Mr Robot) with a slight twist at the end.\nAll the shot/reverse-shot scenes between Jim Carrey and Marton Csokas were amazing. And Jim Carrey playing the cold detective is also very good. \nI recommend it, unfortunately, others do not becuase it's not an American cop drama with lots of shooting explosions etc. If you expect that, do not see the film","user":"john-demetriou-jd","rank":[197,227]},{"title":"Sad but true","rating":8,"date":"16 May 2018","review":"A film that in a blunt and true way shows what the real world is. It's sad but true. The world is not Wonder Woman, the world is brutal, if you are weak then you lose. It annoys me that all reviews of the film criticize the violence against women and the bluntness shown. Why? This story had to be shown just like that. The film is based on facts and these facts were brutal. Why are all reviewers so politically correct today? It limits directors! Hypocrisy is shocking because the same reviewers do not mind violence against men or bad exploitation of men but are obsessed with women. Stop. Stop to see everything through the prism of political correctness.","user":"foxyking93","rank":[294,390]},{"title":"A BROODING DARK THRILLER & A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE BY JIM CARREY","rating":8,"date":"7 August 2018","review":"Wow what a different JIM CARREY we have here!!! &amp; he was Excellent in this very dark crime Thriller, i think Carrey is great at Drama &amp; this movie really shows how good an actor he really is, feels like we're FINALLY getting to see the REAL jim carrey,the Jim Carrey he always wanted to show on screen!!! \nI grew up watching Carrey like EVERYONE did as the rubber face crazy comic genius but there is NO trace of that Carrey here at all!!! \nHere is a powerful performance by the \"New\" Jim Carrey &amp; i loved it.\nDark Crimes itself is a very dark &amp; dreary Crime Thriller &amp; I'm not going into the story because this should be watched not knowing really anything about it except it's a dark crime Thriller &amp; that's how i watched it, i didn't read or watch a single review i just heard about Jim Carrey doing this very serious crime Thriller &amp; waited to buy it on dvd. \nSo yeah this is a very good Thriller with a very moody atmosphere &amp; very dreary &amp; dark with a serious &amp; excellent JIM CARREY who gives a fantastic performance with an accent!!!
