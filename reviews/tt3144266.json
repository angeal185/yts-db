[{"title":"Slow, boring, and on the border of parody","rating":3,"date":"17 February 2015","review":"The movie is about a horror movie writer that into a big old haunted house with a creepy mysterious blind woman living on the top floor. His friend and companion states \"sounds like a good plot for a film\", unfortunately the film we are watching does not seem to confirm her statement. The film is slow moving with out taking advantage of its pace. Long drawn out scenes of your main character walking on the beach and finding messages in a bottle set to indie music, and conversations going over the previous scenes fill a majority of the film. While acting and camera work isn't bad, there simply is no substance to the film and nothing new is brought to the table. There are no scary moments in the film, unless you count a slamming door as scary. Once the ending of the film came around, I wondered if the movie was somehow a misplaced joke that wasn't funny. You will see what I mean when a near replica of a certain Halloween scene is done.","user":"chaosbaron","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Writer and Director should slink off in embarrassment","rating":1,"date":"19 February 2015","review":"Should be labeled as a comedy because we spent the whole time laughing. Several minutes of bad music with ridiculous shots of main character. <br><br>Dumb, dumb, dumb. A limited budget is not an excuse for this junk. I'm angry that we even sat through the first few minutes, let alone the whole \"movie\". This \"film\" shouldn't ever have seen the light of day, let alone on a major streaming service. <br><br>Writer and director should be ashamed and needs to hide away into oblivion for this crap. Trust me, you would be more entertained by looking out into the dark sky or an American soap opera for more drama or entertainment.","user":"Fancytower","rank":[25,36]},{"title":"Very Low Budget Movie","rating":4,"date":"31 August 2016","review":"The screenwriter John Davies (Lee Bane) leaves London and rents an isolated manor in the countryside for two months in a location where he used to visit when he was a child. The real estate agent Mrs. Connelly (Tessa Wood) shows the two-floor house but informs that in the attic lives another tenant, the reclusive Agnes (Vivien Bridson) that is blind. John decides to stay and in the afternoon he meets the beautiful neighbor Cassie Konrad (Georgina Blackledge) in the garden. John invites Cassie for a tea and soon they get close to each other. However, during the night, John is haunted by nightmares and supernatural events. One night, he decides to break in the attic and Agnes discloses the secrets of the manor. <br><br>\"The Last House on Cemetery Lane\" is a very low budget horror movie with a story of haunted house. The storyline has potential but the cinematography, camera and effects are very poor and the plot is confused. Who is haunting the house and consequently John is the most important unanswered question since Cassie has fallen in love with John. My vote is four.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[7,8]}]
