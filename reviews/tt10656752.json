[{"title":"Disappointing","rating":1,"date":"2 August 2019","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this. I really expected so much more from Discovery. There are so many parts of this dramatization that are so far off base, it was almost comical. No captain worth his salt would encourage someone to \"stay in the water\" because the air is colder. Nor would he ever apply a tourniquet to a viable leg to prevent infection spread. You could've done so much better.","user":"numberredmonmom","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Just sad","rating":2,"date":"1 August 2019","review":"The Discovery channel hyped this a lot for Sharkweek. The movie has no substance and is very poorly acted.","user":"sfarmer1228","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"SharkWeek should be embarrassed","rating":1,"date":"1 August 2019","review":"Just a bad movie period. Bad dialogue, bad acting, bad effects. Just bad. I know it's based on a true story and I'm sorry for those that were lost, but the movie just didn't make you feel particularly compelled by or sorry for the characters. Josh Duhamel is a good actor not sure why he signed on to this project. The movie did not educate people about sharks or dispel any myths about sharks which is what shark week was, is suppose to be about. You could do so much better Discovery Channel..","user":"cobbweb-15874","rank":[15,20]}]
