[{"title":"Don't blame the Kid","rating":7,"date":"17 September 2017","review":"If you get pregnant, you may be angry at the baby in your belly or the guy who put it there. The English title may be a bit vague and that is not a bad thing. It's one of the weirdest Rom-Coms you probably will watch. And made the main actress a bit of an attraction for America too. Right now she's doing shows and what not. It didn't happen overnight, but movies like this surely helped.<br><br>She may seem annoying (especially to male audiences), but her character is flawed for a reason. And still feels as real as possible. As human as possible if you want to call it that. It's not hard to guess what the inciting incident is, but the movie still has some surprises along the way. The acting is solid and the script works too. It may have some bumps along the road to the end, but overall it's a good movie","user":"kosmasp","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Really amazing!","rating":10,"date":"21 January 2017","review":"I click on the movie on Netflix by accident, when I realized it was a Mexican movie I decided not to watch it, because I'm not really into new Mexican films; however, I gave it a try and keep watching and I do not regret doing that because this movie takes a really worn out plot, adds some irresistible elements, and funny situations, to turn it into a great story. It was really funny and enjoyable, and also a bit romantic. The characters are cool, all of them are very definite, specially the two protagonist. The end is a bit awkward, but it's still very amusing, besides of being a little touching. I highly recommend this movie!","user":"crazy_vegan_ratlover","rank":[12,18]},{"title":"Exceeded expectations, good watch to relax","rating":8,"date":"2 February 2017","review":"During stressful periods in my life I usually watch documentaries, comedies or romantic comedies (even though I am a man :P). I've seen plenty already and decided to watch this one to relax a bit after yet another stressful day. <br><br>First of all, I love the cast. Especially Maru, she is beautiful. She doesn't look fake or whatever and made me smile in every scene. <br><br>The story is simple and yet still somehow original. It was quite funny as well and not so much 'American' (no insult ;)) The end is awkward but lovely and last but not least: I love the language even though I don't understand a single word of it :)<br><br>Good watch, would recommend and Karla Souza looks gorgeous :)","user":"mail-419-231113","rank":[8,13]}]
