[{"title":"True Story People!!","rating":10,"date":"15 April 2008","review":"Yeah you heard me... Footloose is based on a TRUE STORY. Unlikely as it seems, it really happened in the small town of Elmore City, Oklahoma in 1980. My dad, Leonard Coffee (a.k.a. Ren McCormack a.k.a. Kevin Bacon...all breakfast items? what a coincidence...lol) was a junior at Elmore City High School. This was a minuscule town, with a population of around 750, and there were about 50 or so Baptist churches...so naturally the town's rules and regulations were a bit extreme. There was an archaic town ordinance that banned dancing in public, and it hadn't been abolished. Elmore had never had a junior/senior prom! So my dad fought the system with the help of his best friend, Rex Kennedy (the junior class president), and they were allowed to have a prom for the first time, and Elmore has had prom every year since. I don't know who sold the story, but unfortunately we got no money lol! There were a few things in the movie that didn't actually happen (Ariel Moore, Reverend Moore, the book burning, oh and playing chicken on the tractors!), but it is mostly accurate. The kids did have to go to surrounding communities like Pauls Valley and Lindsay to dance and party, and my dad drove the exact same car that Ren drives in the movie! So there you have it, the REAL story of Footloose. If you haven't seen it...watch it!","user":"cheyennecoffee","rank":[34,36]},{"title":"Great 80s Flick!","rating":8,"date":"5 February 2018","review":"Small town America where dancing is banned. New kid in town conquers high school, catches the eye of the preacher's daughter and attempts to plan a school dance.<br><br>Such fantastic music!

I looked at my uncle dancing round his living room to some of its music and asked myself if anybody expected me to take that seriously. It's got a place in movie history even for the title song alone, though, so I decided I couldn't live with myself unless I gave it a chance. It was definitely worth it.<br><br>The style is reminiscent of a whole host of other '80's teen flicks, but only a handful are better. Most of the cast do great things with their roles. Kevin Bacon actually manages to make the clich√©d concept seem kinda cool, here showcasing an easy charm that was to become the hallmark of much of his later work. Crucially, the music is actually pretty good too! (Even if I am torn between wanting to cringe and dance when I hear the theme!)<br><br>On reflection it's no cheesier than something like \"All the Right Moves\" (which has a great cast doing their best but suffers from a plodding story) In fact, it's miles better! At least the music in \"Footloose\" gave the makers a viable way to pep things up whenever the story begins to flag. This film is much, MUCH better than I had been led to believe, so give it a chance if you ain't seen it yet but thought you knew the score. Chances are, you don't...","user":"Howlin Wolf","rank":[95,130]}]
