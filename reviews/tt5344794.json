[{"title":"Just watching your six.......figure sum......","rating":1,"date":"3 May 2016","review":"Remember when Seagal used to make films where he appeared to be pro-active and actually put some effort into his fight scenes and running scenes?<br><br>Where you one of those people who just yearned for a Seagal film where he would be sitting down for 90% of his screen time' and be wearing sunglasses for 99% of his screen time?<br><br>Well after 28 years of appearing in films, here's the one you've been waiting for.....<br><br>And it's not that Van Damme either.....<br><br>When the mission to rescue a U.S. Congressman who has been kidnapped by the Taliban goes sideways, Army sniper Jake Chandler and his injured partner are left behind. <br><br>Now, on their own, they must survive in enemy territory and wait for their unit to come back for them........<br><br>Terrible is one word to describe this film, others would be using obscene language, so I'm not going to go down that route. The film is split into two different stories, one involving a spoilt little rich girl who wants in on the action, whilst the grizzled soldiers are like 'no way....no way.....no way........go on then'.<br><br>The other is involving (ha ha involving) Seagal and a sweaty partner who cannot walk just sitting in a room. He sweaty partner is a walking (pun intended) clich√©, talking about being back home and blah blah blah, and Seagal sits there, in his sunglasses saying nothing.<br><br>And there is literally one point where he gets up and goes to the shop.<br><br>This is a real new low for Seagal, he is once again dubbed, he's hardly in any shots with other people in the film, and he could've been using a double half the time as his face is that obscure.<br><br>But it's worth watching for the sheer audacity of a once reputable name in Hollywood doing something so lazy, so meaningless, and so offensive toward his loyal fan base.<br><br>He knows his fans will see this no matter what, and he's just sitting there, and I for one, felt unhealthy just looking at the man.<br><br>Absolute trash from beginning to end....","user":"FlashCallahan","rank":[70,80]},{"title":"Sniper : special ops w/out sniper","rating":1,"date":"6 May 2016","review":"The first scene looked quite promising, but after that, It's so bad it's horrible.<br><br>The sniper rifle is only used during this first scene, after that Seagal use an automatic rifle and he doesn't even bother to aim ; he sprays bullets at random in a prerecorded sequence that is used again and again.<br><br>Actually, Seagal doesn't do much ; he babysits his comrade from a safe place, for the major part of the movie, while another lame movie is playing with Rob Vandamme and an annoying spoilt journalist who can do it all.<br><br>Sniper:Special ops, is a low cost and boring movie that use a guest star to sell copies, but don't ask too much from them.","user":"loreleysherry","rank":[42,52]},{"title":"One of Seagal's worst films, unbelievable cast, bored actors and non-existent budget spell disaster","rating":2,"date":"15 July 2016","review":"Overall plot could have been interesting but direction and casting was incredibly poor. Main actors were decades too old and obviously overweight and out of condition to be remotely believable as active duty soldiers let alone the top-shelf special forces they were portraying.<br><br>Soldier ranks and chain of command was completely wrong for the situation and even the most obvious military tactics such as securing a perimeter, finding cover/laying prone during a firefight or trying to avoid an obvious ambush were mostly ignored.<br><br>Character development was nil and supporting women only served to annoy the main characters without a hint of romantic interest or sex appeal which might have at least distracted viewers from an overall lackluster film. The audience was given little reason to care who won or lost and there was no interesting subplot, character drama or anything all that interesting to see in terms of actors, vehicles, aircraft or weapons.<br><br>In spite of the cast including 7th Dan Aikido black belt Steven Seagal and WWE pro wrestler Rob Van Dam there is never a single physical altercation, only a series of lackluster gunfights.<br><br>Some smaller problems the US weapons were obviously not government issue: barrel lengths, flash hiders, sights were all wrong as was the lack of typical support weapons on both sides. <br><br>Weapons usage was strange even for b-movies, most rifles were never fired full-auto, characters seemed to have ample ammo but most fired sparingly while the \"sniper\" was spraying everything in sight with full-auto fire. Later no one remembered to reload a nearly empty M9 pistol before starting a new gunfight...the same M9 pistol which proved far more accurate and deadly than any of the scoped M4 assault rifles the soldiers were firing.<br><br>Tim Abell showed some great acting skills and was a likable character as Sgt Mosby but unfortunately he was still far too old and out of shape to pull off the role.","user":"etackle","rank":[19,29]}]
