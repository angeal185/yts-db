[{"title":"Proficient little chiller","rating":7,"date":"7 July 2003","review":"Hammer Studios will always best be remembered for the horror movies they made but their ventures into other styles were by no means negligible and this neat little mystery is a good example of the thrillers they embarked upon now and again. Kerwin Matthews is Paul Farrell ,an American stranded in a small French village in the Camargue ,where some four years earlier a young girl had been raped and her attacker murdered by her father ,who is languishing in prison for the crime.The girl works at the hotel/bar where Farrell is staying and she falls in love with the personable young American who in turn is attracted to her mother ,Eve ,played by Nadia Gray.Together Farrell and Eve plot to help her husband escape and flee the country  so they can be free to pursue a relationship. The plot goes awry and soon they are coping with a body in the trunk of their car and mysterious activity in their garage .The twist ending is neat and unexpected . The acting is a little under powered but the whole thing is a neat little piece of double bill fodder that will keep an audience diverted till the main feature arrives.","user":"lorenellroy","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"xxx","rating":15,"date":"15 June 2002","review":"Hammer apparently wanted to branch out from the \"Grand Guignol\" gothic horror thrillers they were cranking out at the time, and began turning out several psychological thrillers vaguely in the PSYCHO/DIABOLIC mode. PARANOIAC (1963) and HYSTERIA (1965) are two examples along with the film in discussion here; MANIAC. MANIAC stars Kerwin(7th VOYAGE OF SINBAD) Mathews as an unhappily American in France who gets involved with a married woman named Eve Beynat whose husband is locked away in a mental hospital for the welding torch murder of the man who tried to rape his daughter Annette. Mathews gets tricked into helping Eve's \"husband\" escape from the mental hospital thinking this will allow him to have Eve to himself. As can expected, not all is what it seems. I won't reveal much more cause that would be a spoiler, but the film has good twist ending.<br><br>MANIAC is not the best of Hammers psychological thrillers, but it is still interesting and worth viewing. Kerwin Mathews who was fine in films with lots of physical action is a bit out of his depth here, but  over all he gives an acceptable performance. This seems to be the last film of the lovely Liliane Brousse. She seems to have disappeared from the screen after this picture.","user":"youroldpaljim","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Triangle of Love","rating":7,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"When the American painter Jeff Farrell (Kerwin Mathews) dumps his girlfriend in Camarga, France, he meets the eighteen year-old waitress Annette Beynat (Liliane Brousse) in a bar and decides to stay in the town on vacation at a bed and breakfast owned by her stepmother Eve Beynat (Nadia Gray). Jeff feels a great attraction for Annette but soon he is seduced by Eve and has a love affair with her. He learns that three years ago Annette was raped by a man called Janiello (Arnold Diamond) and her father Henri (Donald Houston), who is locked in an asylum, killed the man using an acetylene torch. After visiting Henri, Eve tells to Jeff that he accepts to let her go with him provided they help him to escape from the asylum driving a runaway car to the harbor. Jeff decides to help Henri but soon he is visited by Inspector Etienne (George Pastell) and discovers dark secrets.<br><br>\"Maniac\" is a combination of film-noir with psychological thriller by Hammer having a triangle of love to complete the big picture. The sexual tension between Henri, Annette and Eve is constant and the relationship of Henri with the two women is unusual and strange. The plot has many twists and is engaging. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Maniac\"","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[6,6]}]
