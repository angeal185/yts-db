[{"title":"Entertaining and engaging enough","rating":7,"date":"19 March 2016","review":"I saw The Preppie Connection tonight, and found myself enjoying every bit of it. The fact that it was a true story made it an easy sell for me, but I particularly appreciate that the film makers didn't present anything fantastic or over the top. Instead, you really feel that what you are watching is probably what actually took place, no more, no less. In short, the risk the main character takes in traveling abroad for the purpose of drug trafficking is presented clearly and thoroughly for the viewer, and this serves to make the film engaging.<br><br>I've read a review elsewhere that regards the acting in this film as weak. I don't agree at all. I thought the acting was great, the kids were believable, and I especially liked the soundtrack.<br><br>To sum up, I probably wouldn't go handing out Oscars to the actors and crew, but in my opinion the film entertains all the way through, and is definitely worthwhile watching.","user":"go_titans","rank":[29,35]},{"title":"Drugs are bad, mkay...","rating":7,"date":"21 April 2016","review":"Movies based on a true story are always more interesting then the odd fictional movie. In The Preppie Connection it's all about a simple guy, Toby (played by Thomas Mann), that tries to fit in with the other high class students. He's secretly in love with Alex (played by Lucy Fry) and tries to impress her and her entourage by scoring weed, then cocaine, and later by smuggling the white powder from Columbia. It's an interesting and entertaining movie. The cast is well chosen and the storyline is very easy to follow. It shows what some people would do to impress others or to fit in, and it shows how cocaine can destruct a lot of lives. Certainly worth a watch.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"It is an entertaining film about first world problems and drug trafficking","rating":6,"date":"24 March 2016","review":"Based on a true story, a poor white kid tries to get in good with the rich privileged kids going to a fancy prep school by smuggling in drugs for them to take.<br><br>I seen this drug tale before a dozen times, but the film is quite interesting to watch despite. Especially the lead actor Thomas Mann, who became big from Me, Earl, and a Dying Girl. Just like that movie, Mann's character narrates the story, in a very very similar fashion. <br><br>Lucy Fry also played an interesting character as well as Logan Huffman who played one of the rich prep school kids. He did a fantastic job of being very unlikable to the point were you like to not like him. very nice.<br><br>Worth sitting through.","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[7,13]}]
