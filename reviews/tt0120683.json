[{"title":"Lacks the heart & the magic of the original..","rating":5,"date":"17 February 2010","review":"The feeling of nostalgia one experiences watching the original \"Gloria\" with Gena Rowlands, is sadly not present in this modern remake. Noticeably gone is that sweeping, dramatic score for the original, which added a sense of sadness and later, a sense of hope for Gloria and her young companion. \"Gloria\" first and foremost, is a New York story, and the city plays the largest part. Face it, the gritty, diverse and savage NYC that existed in 1980, is sadly no more. And that is why this 1999 effort lacks the heart, the quality that made the original a classic. Sharon Stone is quite good here, but she is too young here to play the middle-aged, world-weary Gloria; she simply does not look all that much like a woman who has had a truly rough life. And the young actor Jean-Luke Figueroa, while being very adorable, and a fine child actor, isn't always convincing as the streetwise, Spanish kid from the Bronx. Sometimes he reveals himself as a spoiled, very Americanized kid who has never seen the inside of a ghetto in his life. Remember John Adames, the kid from the original? Now that little guy was the real thing, seemed like he had lived all his life in the barrio. I believe his acting was weak because he wasn't an actor, just a real kid cast as a character like himself. The realism that made the first so great is lost here, in a remake that is too slick, and too stylish to have any real heart. Another thing that is missing is the grittiness, such as the hotels they are hiding in when the mob is chasing them. In the original the sleazy flophouses and shady hotels Gloria and Phil were staying in really added to the level of danger and desperation. This time around, Sharon Stone and 'Nicky' (they changed the boys name for some reason?) are staying in 4 star hotels! Generic and a bit boring. Of course the weakest thing about the remake, is the total lack of connection between Gloria and the boy. They don't seem believable here. In the original the little boy actually falls in love with Gloria, almost in a romantic way, and that was the sweetest, and most endearing thing about their relationship. Maybe in this day and age it was thought inappropriate to go that route. And the ending for the remake does not really work. For the audience to believe that the mafia would simply release a boy who witnessed them murder his family, they would have to be pretty gullible. No, the boy was 11, and all would assume that in a few years, he would return to avenge his family. notice in the original, Gloria and Phil planned an elaborate escape, where the mob would assume they were both dead, which added an extra level of suspense. For the average viewer, 1999's Gloria is a fun, enjoyable movie, but was a pointless remake. seeing this I can only pray that some idiot doesn't try to remake \"Taxi driver.\" What a disaster that would be, for the same reasons that this one failed...","user":"Falconeer","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Insulting a master","rating":1,"date":"24 January 1999","review":"The 1999 remake of \"Gloria\", is an insult to the great John Cassavettes, who wrote and directed the original in 1980.  Sidney Lumet proves that he is not even in the same league as Cassavettes.  This new version completely lacks the energy and the intensity of the original.  Ridiculous melodrama and overblown sentimentality is the only thing Sidney Lumet has to offer.  And Sharon Stone's acting ability seems laughable when compared to Gena Rowlands, who originated the role in 1980.  Rent the original and skip the remake.  Make Cassavettes proud.","user":"Hawk-31","rank":[34,56]},{"title":"Not an original set up but actually quite good despite the syrup","rating":30,"date":"30 April 2003","review":"Gloria is released from prison having done her time the right way and never mentioning anything about her mobster boyfriend Kevin or his boss Ruby.  She returns to find that he has not kept his end of the bargain.  Also in Kevin's custody is Nicky Nuñez, a 6 year old boy whose family was killed for a disk of incriminating information.  Gloria feels that the murder of a child is a step further than she can deal with and takes him and the disk. As the mob hunt them down Gloria realises her chances of survival are slim and tries to work out how to save Nicky.<br><br>I expected nothing from this when I sat to watch it  in fact I was genuinely surprised when I saw that Sidney Lumet had directed it, as I had expected a trashy thriller-come-comedy of some sort.  However the mood of the piece is set out early on when Nicky's family is murdered by Sean.  This is a powerful and unpleasant scene in the film  not overly gory but moving. The main thread of the film is the old `hooker with a heart of gold' type of thing and I must admit that this element is often it's weakest part. It's here that I felt old ground was being treaded and that the sentimentality was allowed to get a little out of hand.  This is particularly evident in the final 10 minutes (awful ending by the way) but it raises it's head several times during the film where `Gloria learns valuable life lessons about herself' etc.<br><br>Happily for the most part this is offset by a some good thrills  such as some good car chases, moments of violence and a good sense of menace from the mobsters.  Stone has a difficult role.  It is one that could be swimming in it's sentimentality.  She doesn't totally succeed (her accent is a little forced at times) but she carries it reasonably well.  Figueroa has an even harder role in being the cute kid.  Sadly for the most part he is the `cute kid' and is a little irritating but he does have a few strong scenes that show there is more to him and he is good considering his age.  Northam is OK, Starr brings real menace, Scott and Moriarty have clearly both been cast to add some class to the film but only have small roles.<br><br>Overall this is a reasonable film.  To some extent we've seen it before and the sentimentality really threatens to sink it at times.  However a real sense of menace and some strong scenes make this a better film and the thriller scenes, although not great, are solid enough when combined with these to make the film watchable  just don't expect this to be without big areas of weakness though.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[13,20]}]
