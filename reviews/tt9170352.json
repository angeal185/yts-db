[{"title":"Assured, sensitive and often funny","rating":9,"date":"13 June 2019","review":"I had little idea what to expect when this premiered on the big screen in Sydney (June 2019) and found an assured well-crafted story with lots of heart, no baloney, and a good few laughs along the way. The subject matter is quiet and low-key, but never dull, and the storytelling clear and smart (one example: a sequence intercut between a few hesitant ukulele notes developing into a tune, and a character getting to grips with performing his work). The intent of every sequence is clear, often with a dash of sly wit. Marshall Napier in particular gives a flawless performance as a very real character. The style owes a bit to \"Boy\" and \"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\" (not a bad thing) and the delicate balance between low-key realism and warm comedy is hardly ever strained. There's so little to quibble about, all relatively trivial (a horrible cut in one sequence, a slightly out-of-style use of hand-held camera in another) that the main impression remaining is the obvious assurance of the writer/director, however long he's been at it. More to the point, experiencing this film was so evocative and entertaining that I've logged in afresh to write this first review in the hope that others might also enjoy it. And no, I have no connection at all with the production, though I wish I could say that I did.<br><br>Derek Morton","user":"derekmortonmash","rank":[25,28]},{"title":"me-e-e-and the farmer","rating":6,"date":"10 February 2020","review":"They sang once from a british band in the 1980's, and this nz rural farmers realism feature film, are basic stuff, and it a low budget, but still a film that you canrelate to on the human level. the premises, the farm, is all thats needed to make a farm film, you put some actors on the location and well its a film.<br><br>loss and grief are the main topic, and the story delves into the sensations with bravour. not the screamingly meltdown sorrow, just the calm self absorbing grumpy old man have always been kinda sorrow..<br><br>grief does usually mend itself over the years and the way things develop between father and son gives high hopes for the future.<br><br>its a farm film, but also a film on the human mind, so you wont regret having a look.the grumpy old man did and it felt ok.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Good Sunday afternoon viewing","rating":9,"date":"1 March 2020","review":"It's true that this is a slow burner, and its story is woven with care and attention to detail. Some of the actors are not known to me, but some were familiar faces - a good mix. I did feel a similarity to Hunt for the Wilder people to start with, but that soon went on its way, and it wandered along its own path. I found I was engrossed and anxious that nothing would interrupt my viewing - and the scenery and birdsong were beautiful. The characters were particularly well-drawn and the rural community were obviously written by someone who knows them well, and portrayed accurately too. I have seen some very good NZ productions over the past few years and this has to be up there with the best - perhaps I might edit it to a 10 after a second viewing. (I must ask someone about Cows' sense of humour though)","user":"selffamily","rank":[1,1]}]
