[{"title":"A Trump bashing mixed with some social and culture takes.","rating":8,"date":"9 July 2018","review":"Just watched this latest HBO stand up special from Bill Maher which was his 11th and I must say that it was typical Maher a committed left wing liberal it was mostly a lot of jokes and a fun bashing of current president Trump. Still Bill has guts by making a trip into a red state like Oklahoma, it still was a funny show that even challenged the left to be better. And of course Maher attacked religion and he spoke on topics like marriage, kids, and had plenty of jokes about masturbation even! Overall a good special for \"HBO\" as if you like Bill Maher you will enjoy this special so catch it sometime.","user":"blanbrn","rank":[13,20]},{"title":"Huge Maher fan but not his best performance","rating":6,"date":"9 July 2018","review":"Bill Maher is a phenomenal talent and I've been a fan for a long time. This performance was not up to Maher standards. His jokes didn't \"flow\" like they normally do when Bill is at the top of his game, and the delivery was just subpar. Also a lot of the material was just unoriginal and overly predictable. \"Trump sucks, Trump's a dictator, Trump's crazy, Republicans are crazy, blah blah blah\". I know the anti-trump thing is his schtick these days so maybe I shouldn't be surprised, but was just hoping he would tackle some new material for a major new standup special.","user":"jgoldstone9","rank":[14,24]},{"title":"Dissapointing","rating":3,"date":"9 July 2018","review":"Mostly Trump this, Trump that. Old stuff, not funny nor imaginative.\nYou could feel the crowd was just enjoying being present at such an eminent (I guess) show, not really enjoying the \"jokes\". You could also see that it was clear to Maher that he wasn't getting through (no surprise there though). he was sweating something awful.","user":"SamoKu","rank":[14,25]}]
