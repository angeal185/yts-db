[{"title":"Don't cross this war","rating":1,"date":"20 September 2018","review":"Did not want to dislike 'Cross Wars'. It was again not a bad, if not new, premise, Vinnie Jones has given alright performances in the past and Danny Trejo has saved (or nearly) bad films (and he has been in a lot of them). It had potential to work, and would have done with effort being obvious and like those in front of and behind the camera had their hearts in it.<br><br>Neither of which can be seen with 'Cross Wars', something that is really quite unforgivable. Being one of the worst films seen recently and nearly ever, 'Cross Wars' is being a very poor film with no redeeming traits and a lot of things done absolutely terribly. There is not much to add to what has been said very well already and the review is at the risk of repeating what has been said. Just for the record, 'Cross Wars' was watched with an open mind and not without the intent or want to dislike, let alone hate, the film, quite the contrary. <br><br>All the acting ranges from insipid to terrible, nobody looks engaged or at ease. Jones phones in and lacks vigour and intensity for a role needing both for it to work, while Trejo tries the hardest of everybody but hams it up so much it's like he belonged somewhere else. In all fairness the characters are clich√©d and are never engaging or easy to get behind, didn't care or endear to any of them. <br><br>The chemistry is static, likewise with the barely existent direction that indicates someone who took part in a bet/dare and lost it by a landslide without realising the amount of work needed in making a film. The script is from start to finish is a cringe, weep and toe curl-fest.<br><br>Furthermore, the story has no tension or suspense whatsoever, is very lifelessly paced and executes a very derivative if slightly intriguing idea with no imagination or originality. Basically non-stop indifferent dullness and predictability that is so overdone in the cheesiness and silliness, if it was meant to take itself seriously that was not done. 'Cross Wars' has a very dreary, one-note and less than slick visual style with well below average visuals and no attempt at authenticity. The sound is monotonous and over obvious, while the lighting lacks atmosphere and consistently and the photography lacks focus and often static in the more dramatic scenes.<br><br>In conclusion, awful with a noticeable lack of effort (apart from Trejo who goes overboard with it). 1/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"prize winner!!","rating":1,"date":"11 February 2018","review":"I think we should give them credit for making the worst movie of the 21st century.\nIt will take a long time to beat this achievement.\nWell done !!!","user":"zatoulis","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Clearly a prank or parody ...","rating":1,"date":"20 July 2017","review":"....or the result of a bet, to make the worst thing ever made in the history of anything ever recorded by a camera.<br><br>The good reviews on here are so funny I actually laughed myself to a little tear.
