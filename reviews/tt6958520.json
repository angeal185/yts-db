Total waste of time","user":"edmorley","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"My only review posted","rating":1,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"I just had to write this after trying to watch this awful movie . If you could take all the feminist ideals about how evil man is and how perfect women are and put them into movie form this is it. Men are beasts that only want to cage women. Women are innocent creatures only wanting to be free from ALL men. I don't know what snowflake university backed the funding for this film but it's definatly the most hateful biased piece of drivel I've ever watched.","user":"willhunter-53699","rank":[31,46]},{"title":"Dry dream-chasing","rating":3,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"Ordinary tale that end up forgettable, all the way to some of the most uninspiring or dullest finale seen in flickdom.","user":"collinsburns57","rank":[13,20]}]
