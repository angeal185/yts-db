[{"title":"Perhaps the finest film ever made on the Spitfire.","rating":10,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"Perhaps the finest film ever made on the Spitfire. From its entrancing story line, to the mesmerising aerials, a transcendent score and a stellar cast of thoughtful reflective, respectful people - you are left feeling both inadequate and inspired. The film makers should be applauded for capturing this exceptional story so sensitively before the door closes forever on the last of the few.","user":"chrisdbriley","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"Spitfire Me Up","rating":10,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"A pleasure to be able to have the opportunity to experience this once in a lifetime cinematic showing. A fantastic documentary telling the story of the bond and relationship of the legends (men, women and machine) who were tasked at a very young age of protecting our skies, island and future. From start to finish I was fixed to the big screen and hair stood up on the sound of those Merlin engines roaring throughout. Thank you to the cast and crew for bringing this extraordinary story to the big screen and allowing the general public to have a greater appreciation and insight of the sacrifices made.","user":"stea-86302","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Lest we forget","rating":10,"date":"24 October 2018","review":"I applaud the film makers for bringing this brilliant documentary to our screens. It is a very worthy tribute to the iconic flying machine that was designed by a genius , built and maintained by master craftsmen and flown by heroes.\nIt was heart rendering to listen to the remaining 'few' recall their experiences of flying the spitfire and how they regarded it as the most famous and beautiful combat aircraft ever built and reminding us all that it was first and foremost a weapon of war.\nIt was a pleasure to watch and it certainly brought a tear to my eye.\nA very fitting tribute to the brave and remarkable generation of people who flew and fought in our skies during World War Two.","user":"chrisjbennett-97788","rank":[10,10]}]
