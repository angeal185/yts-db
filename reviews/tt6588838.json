[{"title":"Gritty and harsh","rating":9,"date":"14 August 2019","review":"Gritty and harsh, that's Hesperia for you. A thriller set in the desert, drugs and crime. Great acting, some stunning scenery, a really cool film for an indie production!","user":"jblockbuster","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Raw, dark and very real","rating":8,"date":"3 August 2019","review":"There's a reality at the center of this film that not everyone may be comfortable with. That's OK. Leave the movie for those of us who can handle a darker reality. The story and twists were great. This isn't a phony Hollywood movie but very much an indie. That's a really good thing.","user":"directortim2012","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Aggression vs vulnerability","rating":8,"date":"14 August 2019","review":"I really enjoyed how this movie portrayed the juxtaposition of aggression with vulnerability. There's a nice color pallet that's used in the film to really draw the viewer into the mood and characters emotional state. It's a bold script, filled with grit, and is a wonderful example of fine indie filmmaking.","user":"cbax123","rank":[7,8]}]
