[{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"8 April 2018","review":"This feels like a middle-schooler tried to write a Woody Allen script. Dialogues are ripe with stuttering, unfinished sentences and in general feel like they're 100% improvised - by actors who failed improvisation class. One of the worst movies I ever watched (I actually hit STOP at halftime, something I pretty much never do), if this even classifies as \"movie\" and not \"outtakes from high school impro class 101\". Avoid.","user":"facebook-336-885041","rank":[4,4]}]
