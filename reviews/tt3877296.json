[{"title":"Enjoyed watching this movie, recommend","rating":9,"date":"18 October 2015","review":"Enjoyed watching it and learning about the story of the school hostage crisis. I have not heard about this incident before. The movie is based on the real accounts of people who went through it, and if they say that they saw angels who helped them survive, I believe them. Those who make fun of the first-hand accounts should keep it to themselves. We had a school hostage crisis in Beslan in 2004 and it resulted in tragedy with lots of deaths. I liked what they said at the end of the movie, that there were lots of lepers in Jesus' day and not all of them got healed, but when one gets healed we should learn to recognize the hand of God. Fine movie, recommend!","user":"nicolaskonstantin","rank":[33,50]},{"title":"Inspirational-Spoiler","rating":8,"date":"31 October 2015","review":"This film is based on an actual event which was covered by national media as it was playing out. People do not need to be religious to see this film, but it is a very compelling story about a disgruntled high IQ guy assisted by his gullible, lower mentality,esteem-less girlfriend. The man has a long planned scheme to force ransom money from the nation, with fragile hostages in mind. The actors were believable and the film was made on location where the event occurred, and while the event happened maybe a decade ago, the event might have happened just yesterday.<br><br>An absolute feel good movie.","user":"HoosierBob","rank":[25,37]},{"title":"Great true story, Good actors and worth the watch!","rating":8,"date":"21 January 2016","review":"I found this movie to be a feel good great movie and yes the acting and effects were not the best I still found it engaging and tugged at the heart strings<br><br>This movie was not made to win awards or make celebrities, this movie was created to let people know of the miracle that happened on that day 30 years ago and I believe it did just that for me.<br><br>There are a few parts that could've been adjusted probably with a larger budget, but if i wanted CG graphics and special effects I would watch something else<br><br>The fact that I had never even heard of this real life miraculous story until now makes me rate it even higher. <br><br>I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested, the world could use a little more movies like this.","user":"chasetraining","rank":[17,25]}]
