[{"title":"Fun For What It Is","rating":7,"date":"14 September 2018","review":"I actually thought this film was fun for what it is. Sure, it's cheap, some of the cinematography is poor, and the sound in a few parts is bad, but overall, it felt very much like a slasher flick from the 80's. Those were all about getting a group of dumb teens together in an isolated location and killing them off. That's what this is. If you're not a fan of that type of film, then definitely stay away from this. The gore and acting was better than what I've seen in many indie horror films. <br><br>Reading some of the reviews already posted, I see people giving this a 1 because it's predictable or whatever. From what I can tell, it's pretty obvious this film has been presented as an 80's style slasher. Look at the poster and plot description. I don't think they were trying to do anything new. They seemed to want to make a straightforward slasher and that's what they did. It looks like many IMDBers love to give indie films 1's because they are used to production values and stuff that you see in The Nun or whatever else makes it to theaters. Of course a film with a $10,000 isn't going to look like one of those high budget films. Giving all these little indie films 1's is asinine. <br><br>Anyway, if you are a fan of slasher films, I'd say check this out. There are some issues, but I really thought it was fun, gory ride.","user":"amberberne","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Fun Indi teen slasher","rating":7,"date":"4 May 2019","review":"I checked this film out on Amazon Prime and it was a fun short 1 hour 10 minute ride. The acting is decent and while this isn't \"horrifying\" it's a fun throwback slasher flick that does what it sets out to do which is entertain. I'm interested to see what else the director has to offer with his other films.","user":"mikey-53259","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"What a lame party.","rating":3,"date":"14 October 2018","review":"Party Night attempts to emulate the body-count slashers of the '80s, wherein a group of carefree teens are gorily sliced and diced by a masked maniac, the grisly special effects being the real stars of the movie. A strong plot isn't a necessity just so long as the blood flows (the more creative the death, the better), and at least one of the actresses gets nekkid to take a shower and/or have sex.<br><br>Writer/director Troy Escamilla follows this simple template with a generic plot about three high school couples driving to a remote lake house to hold their own private post-prom party only to be attacked one-by-one by a murderous masked maniac wielding a machete. However, he fails to deliver when it comes to the kills and the nudity: while bloody, the slayings are dull and repetitive, and all we get in the way of T&amp;A is one actress in her underwear and a coy sex scene in which the girl keeps her bra on. Worse still, when the killer isn't at work, his intended victims spend most of their time bickering or playing cards, which isn't exactly fun.<br><br>With no scares, zero atmosphere, and an ending that leaves the viewer none the wiser about the identity of the killer or their motive, Party Night is a weak addition to the slasher genre.","user":"BA_Harrison","rank":[5,6]}]
