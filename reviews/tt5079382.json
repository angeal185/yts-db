And the part with his daughter almost made me cry","user":"Jessicanu94","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"An impressive showcase.","rating":8,"date":"10 August 2018","review":"This film is an impressive showcase of this mans fitness level. Having comprehension of what this really takes, and then seeing him do it is incredible to see- this man is a workout boss, an Olympian God. I have heard his name and seen him compete on television but when I saw the title for the movie I didn't know it had anything to do with CrossFit, let alone it be the focal competition. Seeing him through the lens of a CrossFit athlete, a person, and a husband/father is interesting. He wants to know what's next, I'd like to see him on a bicycle- the DKXL gravel race in KS would be a nice test. Watch this if you enjoy fitness- this is fitness defined and the character is a likeable guy.","user":"matteveland95","rank":[2,6]},{"title":"Not seen a better fitness movie","rating":10,"date":"18 August 2018","review":"I have watched Pumping Iron and other similar movies, but this tops all. Just tops all. It doesn't just show the competition like a lot of oldies used to do, they used to hide their workouts like it was some kind of secret, but this movie actually teaches a lit and entertains at the same time. I never cared for crossfit before this movie, but this changed my view, and it was a huge motivator.","user":"puneet5997","rank":[2,7]}]
