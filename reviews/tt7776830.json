[{"title":"Unintended hilarity","rating":3,"date":"28 July 2018","review":"In a moment of weakness I watched this fluffy, unbelievable, wreck of a movie. The basic premise could work: teenage counterfeiters use their criminal skills to buy a bunch of expensive swag with phoney money. But the execution is often unintentionally laughable. The last time I watched a movie where I thought \"that would never happen!\" so often was Sharknado. Tweens may enjoy this, if only because every adult in the film is clueless, inept, or both.","user":"Davemaurer26","rank":[9,14]},{"title":"Would be good for young teens and \"tweens\"","rating":6,"date":"3 July 2018","review":"This movie is something that would be good at your 14 year old daughter's sleepover. The two main characters are pretty static and predictable but the antagonists and supporting characters are entertaining especially near the end. The acting depicts teenagers how a 12-14 year old would think of teenagers which would explain why older people are less entertained. Not unlike the depiction of teenagers in riverdale. Also bonus points for attractive people.","user":"theoneandonlyemprila","rank":[8,15]},{"title":"Pretty Good Flick for a \"B\" Movie","rating":8,"date":"3 July 2018","review":"I would not say this is a perfectly written script, but, frankly, the plot points are solid and the acting is pretty good. What strikes me the most about the story is the base realism the high schoolers display in thinking (to paraphrase), \"We're too smart to get caught. No worries.\" As a teacher, I see that as a very realistic viewpoint for many young people today in our \"freebie society.\" <br><br>Bravo!<br><br>Jim Hoffmann\n\"The Boy in the Box: America's Unknown Child (3rd Edition)\nEt al.","user":"jvhoffmannjr-11515","rank":[7,16]}]
