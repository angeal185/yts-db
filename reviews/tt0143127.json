[{"title":"Superior to B&R","rating":14,"date":"14 January 2000","review":"To start with, the animation is fantastic. The story is exciting and fast paced. Not as dark as the previous animated film, but it was like the way Batman acts in the comics and show. He solves the crime, looking for clues and has a great fight with the bad guy. This could have been a big screen contender but because Batman and Robin failed, Warner Bros. said no and released it to video. But this is still great and superior to Batman and Robin. They have to make another animated Batman film, and not that Batman Beyond film they're talking about. Recommended for all.","user":"Op_Prime","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"A truly great Batman movie.","rating":10,"date":"3 May 2005","review":"Alongside Mask of the Phantasm, this movie is a great tribute to the Animated Series that brought Batman into children's lives. This movie, even though it was animated, was serious, realistic, and had a great plot. The fact that it came out after Shcumaker's Batman &amp; Robin, is a shame, due to the fact that this movie, an animated movie, blows the big screen movie out of the water. Just goes to show the difference between a great movie and director, and a horrible movie.<br><br>The voices for the characters were picked perfectly, and unlike the Freeze of Batman and Robin, this Dr. Freeze was perfectly in alignment with the mentality and actions of the comic book villain.<br><br>Kevin Conroy sounds just like you expect Batman to sound like, blowing George Clooneys frankly oddball and campy rendition away. Conroy acts like people expect the real Batman to act, assuming of course you are not Joel Schumaker or anyone who thinks said directors movies are good.","user":"thedarkknight-89","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"An Okay Film","rating":6,"date":"2 May 2017","review":"this film was sort of film that you find difficult to describe as a good or a bad film, it was an okay film with both okay story and action scenes, But my biggest problem with this film was the story line which is the same story line in every film or TV episode the MR. Freeze starring in it . And i kept asking myself the whole time while watching it why producers decided to made it even it was released a year after ( Batman &amp; Robin) which was made exactly a year before this one ( maybe the wasn't happy about because it was a big flop). Anyway i only recommend this film if you're a Batman fan, it's a fine film with fine action scenes but please don't except to watch a great film such as Batman Make of the phantasm.","user":"waelkatkhuda","rank":[5,5]}]
