[{"title":"Extraordinary for its era....","rating":8,"date":"12 November 2004","review":"1961 in England. Homosexuals were routinely jailed just because they were homosexuals. It was still the love that dare not speak its name.<br><br>Blackmailers had a terrific open season on gays - extorting funds for silence. It is incredible that this movie was made - on two levels. One being the obvious, who would want to star in such a controversial film?<br><br>Enter one Dirk Bogarde, putting both his reputation and his career on the line. He moved deliberately beyond his \"Doctor in the House\" series of light romantic leading men to make this benchmark film.<br><br>It may seem dated today to some eyes, but it captures an authentic London of 1961 and is filmed on location in the streets for most of it. One can see the barriers, goofophiles, holding the passersby back from the location shooting! \"Flower Drum Song\" is featured on a marquee in one of the scenes.<br><br>The suspense is carried along beautifully, you are never sure how it is all going to turn out, there are no easy solutions, there are some wonderful sub-plots, unexpected little surprises, like the childhood friend of a victim staunchly loyal against his wife's homophobic wishes.<br><br>The husband and wife story is beautifully depicted and completely non-formulaic. I love the rush and buzz of London surrounding the taut, tense story. Groundbreaking film. 8 out 10.","user":"wisewebwoman","rank":[83,85]},{"title":"Ground-breaking movie","rating":3,"date":"3 February 2004","review":"It would be easy to view this movie as nothing more than a somewhat dated film. However, for it's time, this movie was ground-breaking, for any number of reasons, including its superb acting. Dirk Bogarde and Sylvia Syms, in particular, were perfect in their parts.<br><br>What many don't realize is that this movie is credited with helping to decriminalize homosexuality in Britain. When \"Victim\" was released, it started a nationwide discussion about homosexuality and associated blackmail. At the time, approximately 90% of all blackmail cases involved homosexuals, and Bogarde's character was a classic example of a blackmail \"victim\". The point of the movie wasn't that all homosexuals were victims, but they could only be victims so long as the law permitted it. The blackmail wasn't merely because they were homosexual, but due to the harsh prison sentences a homosexual could (and often did) receive. How often does a movie get the opportunity to help create such a profound change in society?","user":"deano-10","rank":[79,83]},{"title":"Predator And Prey","rating":9,"date":"7 July 2006","review":"From what I have read, this was the first British film ever to use the word \"homosexual\" in the dialogue. That may, or may not, be technically true. Regardless, in 1961, overt gay references were risky to filmmakers, at least in Britain and the United States. Thus, the most amazing thing about \"Victim\" is the simple fact that it was made.<br><br>The film's theme is anything but subtle. Viewers in 1961 learn that government laws punish gays and encourage blackmailers, who function as predators to extort money from those whose instincts are out of sync with societal \"norms\". The film thus portrays gay men as prey, and tending to be secretive, scared, nervous, and sad. Dirk Bogarde gives an excellent performance as a powerful married barrister, secretly gay, who thinks he himself is on the verge of being blackmailed.<br><br>But while the film thus has obvious educational benefits, it is also quite entertaining, thanks to the plot rationale, which revolves around trying to guess who the blackmailer is. It's a whodunit mystery. Well into the film, a rather strange looking young man appears on a motorcycle and proceeds to chastise a barber for trying to escape from impending blackmail payments. But is this young man the real blackmailer, or just an envoy?<br><br>Adding to the entertaining plot line is the wonderfully off-kilter, noirish lighting from DP Otto Heller. The B&amp;W cinematography conveys an appropriately moody, sometimes sinister, tone, consistent with the film's theme.<br><br>Some films try to be educational but end up preachy. Other films succeed at being educational, but lack entertainment value. \"Victim\" succeeds both as education and as entertainment, owing to its daring and absorbing screen story, its excellent direction, its good performances, and its effective cinematography.","user":"Lechuguilla","rank":[54,56]}]
