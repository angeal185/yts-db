[{"title":"Bloodsucking Frisbees Thrown By Man with Lampshade For a Head","rating":5,"date":"9 August 2000","review":"This very weird drive-in flick directed by Greydon Clark is pretty creepy, in a brainless sort of way. Predating the \"Predator\" concept by a number of years, \"Without Warning\" involves a mysterious alien presence lurking in the woods, claiming campers and backpackers with the use of living, tentacled flying discs it hurls at potential victims. <br><br>The fact that the killer is an alien gives it a faux sci-fi twist, but in reality this has more in common with \"Friday the 13th\", albeit with flying alien discs. The alien itself spends most of the movie offscreen, throwing its frisbees at people, then harvesting them and storing their bodies in a convenient old shack normally used by the water department (who are marginally less frightening than murderous aliens). <br><br>The obnoxious characters might get on your nerves, particularly the stereotypical shell-shocked vet portrayed by Martin Landau. The young male lead is also pretty irritating (bad-movie junkies may recognize him from \"Roller Boogie\"). One of the biggest pleasures of the film is the presence of numerous b-movie personalities and character actors, a number of whom also appeared in Greydon Clark's second alien thriller of 1980, \"The Return\". Palance and Landau, light years away from their Oscars, really ham it up big time alongside Larry Storch, Neville Brand (\"Eaten Alive\"), Ralph Meeker (\"The Night Stalker\", \"Food of the Gods\"), Cameron Mitchell (God, where to begin??). Look fast for a very young David Caruso as an early alien snack. Further linking the film to \"Predator\" is that the alien in this film is played by the same actor who played The Predator, the late Kevin Peter Hall.<br><br>It's definitely a low-rent affair, but there is some good stuff here. The atmospheric photography helps, although the low quality video transfers that are circulating out there do a lot to detract from it. The script takes some welcome short cuts in the early stages, wasting no time in getting one half of our dual teenage couples bumped off and leaving the remaining two on the run. The action takes place in a number of dark, desolate places. At least the counselors at Crystal Lake had a few bungalows to take refuge in. The protagonists of \"Without Warning\" scurry through old shacks, dark open fields, abandoned cottages, and rundown redneck bars. Brrr. The \"bloodsucking frisbee\" effect is fairly well done, too.<br><br>Then there's the matter of the alien. It's very silly looking in full light, but they don't really let you get a good look at it, and it's vaguely creepy the way it's photographed. In one scene, we catch our first real glimpse of it as it's approaching on the other side of a swinging pendant lamp, a la \"Psycho\". The lamp swings up and momentarily illuminates the weird, grasping figure. Eerie. There's also a great shot at the conclusion where Jack Palance exacts his revenge on the visitor by planting dynamite outside the shack. He grapples with the deranged Landau, until suddenly they both look up, and standing there in the distance is the alien, watching them. Unfortunately, the scene is defused by the campy overacting and dialogue.<br><br>We have yet to get a quality home video release for \"Without Warning\", at least in the United States. It seems to have slipped through the cracks, or is tied up in a matter of studio ownership. My only regret is that I never got to see this one at the drive-in, which is obviously where it was meant to be enjoyed. It meets that lofty goal very nicely.","user":"GroovyDoom","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"Drive In Classic","rating":1,"date":"1 July 2005","review":"Saw this one at the drive-in back in '80 and knew as I was watching it that I was watching a drive-in classic. I seem to recall (in my mind anyway)as 1980 being the last great drive-in horror movie year. I had already seen Humanoids From The Deep that summer and Phantasm there the previous year. I recall that the film had a nice updated 1950's sci-fi feel to it (like Humanoids, a little atmosphere, some laughs (frisbees etc.), hammy performances (Landau Palance) and Larry Storch. The ancient grainy Kingston Trio 'Things Go Better With CocaCola' ad at intermission seemed to fit in with it well. I can't recall what was on the bill with It Came Without Warning; but I recall leaving pretty satisfied. I've looked through many video stores to rent or buy it but can't locate it. Nice to see some other folks fondly remember this one and would like to see it on DVD,too.","user":"mcdamsten","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"They're coming to take you away!","rating":7,"date":"15 April 2004","review":"\"Without Warning\" is a cheap American b-movie horror from 1980 about the terror striking the beautiful American countryside... some people are brutally killed and mutilated by an unknown stranger, and it's the turn of a bunch of teenagers and war veterans to find out that an illegal alien has landed and is hunting for humans for his horrible collection...<br><br>Although this movie shows lots of stereotypes and well-known topics from many horror movies from the 50's to the 70's like \"It Came From Outer Space\", \"The Thing\", Jack Arnold and Roger Corman cheapos, \"Night of the Living Dead\", \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", \"Three on a Meathook\" and even \"Alien\" and the new wave of high school slasher movies like \"Halloween\" and \"Friday the 13th\", it's an entertaining and thrilling affair.<br><br>There are some old movie veterans like Jack Palance, Martin Landau, Ralph Meeker, Cameron Mitchell and Neville Brand involved with Palance and Landau playing the mad alien hunters, and a young David Caruso in his very first movie role. The alien is played by Afro-American actor Kevin Peter Hall who also played the monster in \"Predator 2\" (1990). Director Greydon Clark never had a big break-through movie, but photographer Dean Cundey had a big time in the nineties with jobs for \"Apollo 13\", \"Casper\", \"The Flintstones\" and the Spielberg hits \"Hook\" and \"Jurassic Park\".<br><br>All in all it's a nice midnight movie and a small highlight for fans of seventies' paranoia horror films in the wake of the remakes of old alien, monster and disaster film productions. No more, no less.","user":"Mikew3001","rank":[16,17]}]
