[{"title":"Poorly Done","rating":1,"date":"2 April 2019","review":"Michael Jai White is a decent actor with incredible martial arts skills. Please get him a script for a good movie!!!!!!!","user":"darren_averett","rank":[24,29]},{"title":"Let's throw all the cliches and see which ones stick","rating":1,"date":"11 March 2019","review":"Poorly written, poorly directed, terrible acting by almost everyone and the most outrageous collection of cliches I have come across in quite a while. Sadly, it doesn't fall in the \"it's so bad it's good\" category. It's just bad.","user":"saima_pyke","rank":[27,34]},{"title":"A waste of good talent","rating":1,"date":"20 May 2019","review":"The first movie by Jai White that I find boring to the grave. A waste of Jai White's time.","user":"kefaouma","rank":[7,8]}]
