It doesn't even have a plausible story line. Supposedly, the entire world has forgotten about the Bible, and Jesus. And, somehow a psychopath has taken over the entire world, preaching on TV and pretending to be Christ. The director is terrible, as every single scene is at least 3 times longer than it should have been. This should have been a 30 minute short, not a 99 minute monstrosity.<br><br>DISCLAIMER: No Bibles were harmed in the making of this movie.","user":"Kaelum","rank":[2,4]}]
