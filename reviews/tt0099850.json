[{"title":"Internal Affairs: A tense, fearless police thriller and a showcase for Richard Gere.","rating":7,"date":"30 April 2006","review":"Internal Affairs is a thriller with a lot of nerve. It takes risks, presenting the audience with a grim and violent story of police corruption. It doesn't care if you like it or hate it, just that it does its job of getting under your skin. The main reason the movie is so effective is because of Richard Gere's powerhouse performance. It caught me off guard, since before I saw it I'd always seen him as the hero or love interest, far from the territory he's in here. I'll get more into Gere's performance later, just let me clear up the plot.<br><br>Gere is Dennis Peck, respected vice cop, father and husband, determined to do the job. Oh, he's also the dirtiest cop on the force. He plants evidence, shoots suspects, sets up his fellow officers, doing it all without a shed of remorse. The hero of the movie is Raymond Avila (Andy Garcia), newly assigned to the Internal Affairs division of the LAPD and a friend of Peck's partner, Van Stretch (Stephen Baldwin). When Stretch introduces Peck and Avila it's obvious they don't like each other. Not getting along becomes an understatement as Avila starts to uncover Peck's corrupt behavior and looks to put a stop to it. But Peck won't go down without a fight, and he'll do whatever he can to keep Internal Affairs off his back.<br><br>As far as police thrillers go, Internal Affairs is one of the meaner kind. Rather than put us into the normal day of a cop it decides to put us into the normal day of bad cop, a really bad cop. This is a guy who would kill a man for stepping on his shoe. He'd probably kill his family too, and laugh while he was doing it. Think I'm exaggerating? Not so much. Peck is the embodiment of all the bad guys in police thrillers and none of the cops in them.<br><br>Of all of the actors you could find to play a guy like this, who would have guessed that a likable actor like Richard Gere would ever fit the bill. Does he ever. He gives that kind of against type performance we see a lot from normally good guy actors. We've seen it from Denzel Washington (Training Day), Tom Cruise (Collateral), and Robin Williams (Insomnia) in the past few years. Each of these guys have given performances that have altogether changed how we see them as actors. Gere is no exception here. He seems to be having a blast too, chewing the scenery every chance he gets.<br><br>He's surrounded by some good supporting work. Andy Garcia gives Avila a kind of determination you'd expect from a guy who's life has been wrecked by a guy like Peck. As his partner, Laurie Metcalf is likable and isn't as wasted as she could have been.<br><br>But when it all comes down to it, this is Gere's show, and he shines in his only truly villainous role to date. He probably had enough of playing the villain by the time he was done with this movie. That would make sense. After playing a guy like Dennis Peck, any actor would need time off from playing the bad guy. I'd like to see Gere play the bad guy again though, and give us another surprising and terrifically evil performance.","user":"livinitup2589","rank":[37,39]},{"title":"Mind games. Manipulation. Corruption. Welcome to the world of Dennis Peck.","rating":9,"date":"28 June 1999","review":"I have never quite seen a movie like this before.  In it, Richard Gere plays his most sinister role and I think his best character in years.  There are many disturbing elements in this film and most of them are perpetrated by Richard Gere's Dennis Peck.  He knows how to manipulate people to get what he wants and if that doesn't work he uses other measures.<br><br>The story goes like this:  Richard Gere plays a cop that everyone owes a favour to.  He is everyone's friend and everyone's silent worst enemy.  He also lives a little above his income should allow him too and this is why he is being investigated by internal affairs.  Enter Andy Garcia as Raymond, in a mesmerizing performance.  These two know they are going to square off in the film and Peck has fun tormenting him.<br><br>Peck is a charismatic, good looking, wealthy play boy.  He knows how to use what he has to his advantage, and that eventually means playing with Raymond's head to make him think that he is sleeping with his wife.  Did I mention that he is intuitive?  And this is established so brilliantly in one of their first meetings together that it makes you cringe.<br><br>Peck introduces himself to Raymond and at first he seems very co-operative assuring Raymond that he realizes Ray has a job to do just like he does. But the conversation takes an abrupt turn when Peck begins to hit too close to home when he begins to question how good Raymond's love life is right now.  He knows he spends too much time at the office and that he has a beautiful, young wife that may be neglected.  The scene works beautifully and sets up the psychological battle that takes place between the two as the film goes on.  The next scene they have with each other is enough to make every man cringe at the cruelty of it.<br><br>Internal Affairs is a character study at it's finest.  There are few films out there that can compare to this one and that can be attributed to the director, Mike Figgis.  He hits every note perfectly and the performances he gets from his cast is such a joy to watch.  I am surprised that Andy Garcia hasn't gone on to be bigger than he is because he was outstanding here.<br><br>This is an absolute must see for anyone that hasn't had the pleasure of doing so yet.  But beware, there are some scenes that will get under your skin, especially if you spend too much time at the office and you have a beautiful woman waiting for you at home.  What is she doing right now?  Who is she with?  Are you paranoid or are your concerns real?  This film has fun with that paranoia.","user":"baumer","rank":[61,71]},{"title":"Figgis blurs the lines between good and bad in this dark thriller","rating":4,"date":"4 February 2002","review":"Dennis Peck is a street cop who seems happy to stay at that level, and yet he spends significantly more money than he makes on his cops' pay.  When IA officers investigate Peck's partner Van Stretch for planting drugs on a suspect and using unnecessary force, they decide to look into Peck more. However Peck knows how to exploit weakness in those around him and begins to clear up the loose links around him while pushing all Raymond Avila's buttons.<br><br>This was Figgis' first American film and he made an excellent start.  The dark plot is pretty simple in terms of beginning, middle, start.  What makes it so much more than that is the characters are so well drawn.  Peck and Avila both become like each other the more we know about them, their methods, their thoughts and their weaknesses are all similar.  It makes it harder to fit everyone into the mould of good guys and bad guys and keeps everything more interesting.  The various twists don't always make sense but the film is forceful enough to keep everything moving.<br><br>Gere is on best form here, playing a character against type he is the embodiment of corruption, deceit and murder.  Garcia is also excellent as Raymond, who blends his actions well from good into bad.  Metcalfe is excellent as Garcia's partner who may or may not be motivated by the hatred of Gere's macho personae.  It's also good to see Baldwin, Travis and Xander Berkley have good roles.<br><br>Overall this is a dark thriller that blends characters into one mess of corruption in the police.  It is an excellent film with great characters.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[42,48]}]
