[{"title":"Warning, avoid this garbage at all cost!","rating":1,"date":"8 October 2019","review":"I am a veteran of low budget film watcher, 35+ years experience in watching them, and I have seen many films with HALF the budget of this which have been much better than this (not to mention half the trash that Hollywood spews forth every year).\nWords cannot express how horrible this movie is.\nScript non existent as well as a plot.\nBore yourself to death.\nWorse Than Passing a Kidney Stone.\nAre the actors even human?\nThe list really does go on.\nThe mystery will forever baffle me.\nYet oddly depresses me too.","user":"psxexperten","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Exploitative and cheap by Lifetime standards","rating":3,"date":"1 September 2019","review":"There is a cheapo exploitative horror feel about this thriller that seems out of place for Lifetime. An aspiring model gets lured into a photographer's out of the way place where she is held and forced to do risqu√© stuff. It's tedious and monotonous.<br><br>Don't bother.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"why oh why?","rating":1,"date":"10 October 2019","review":"Why does Marvista Entertainment consistently produce one garbage after another? As usual the basic story line is pretty good. But the script, the acting the screenplay are plain and simple diabolical.\nMoral of the story: avoid this codswallop!","user":"haroot_azarian","rank":[2,2]}]
