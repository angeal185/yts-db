[{"title":"ugh Give this a BIG miss","rating":1,"date":"1 November 2018","review":"I found this so very dull. The music was really nothing memorable, not a single song through the movie caught me up or drove it's point home and the singing was naff. The story itself was pretty empty. None of the main topics were explored well enough. Her relatshionship with Raymond was all surface stuff, no indepth story about him or his prison time or his time before prison or why he still lived with his mother.\nA random christening and his friend's wife obviously didn't like him but no back story there either. Her sister was just all about sex and no depth about why she was the way she was. Kestrel just made a sudden appearance with no story about him either. Far too much going on and each storyline was skimmed over probably so they could throw some more hideous 'music' into the fold.\nDull as dishwater and no idea how the positive reviews gave it a 10/10 meaning it is THE best film they have EVER seen.","user":"lilyloo-79807","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Annoying musical","rating":3,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"With such a great cast it's a shame three couldn't get away from really cheesy lyrics and a trite plot line and random uninteresting plot devices","user":"appleasha-43846","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"One of the best UK films of 2018","rating":10,"date":"28 October 2018","review":"Been So Long is one of the best British films of the year. It is gorgeously acted, fabulously shot and groundbreaking in its' representations and approach. It captures both the grit and beauty of London and Londoners, and walks the line between being aspirational yet real. Watching it with an audience that reflected the diverse city we see on screen was one of my cinematic highlights of the year because the reaction was huge and joyous. It's a reminder to film commissioners, programmers, gatekeepers - diverse audiences show up for diverse stories. Trust them. It'll reap dividends.","user":"miabays","rank":[17,28]}]
