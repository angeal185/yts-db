[{"title":"So good!","rating":10,"date":"22 November 2013","review":"Vanessa was really amazing in this film! It completely shocked me how good she really was, I wasn't expecting her acting to blow me out of the water, but she did. Her performance really made the film for me, with this and the frozen ground I see her going places. Not only her but the whole cast was really strong. It was a heart wrenching storyline which, delivered by these amazing and strong actors just empowered me I guess. I was really looking forward to watching this as I thought the story line was unique and not clich√© and unlike anything I've watched before. Also the fact that it was based in a true story just interested me all the more to watch it and I can honestly say that I was not disappointed! I would highly recommend anyone and everyone to watch it! It's a brilliant story with a brilliant cast but Vanessa easily outshines the rest of the cast, this is her film.","user":"Browneyes_12","rank":[49,60]},{"title":"Great Movie...sad reality","rating":20,"date":"20 January 2014","review":"This movie is quite believable and Hudgens does a great job, having actually lived in a real shelter prior to playing the part. I think she gained a great deal of understanding doing that and it shows in her part. There are some folks reviewing the movie here who referred to her going through \"Clinton's Village\" subsidized programs, which misses the point of Clinton's Village. Her theory was not based on subsidized govt programs, rather the need for community and all of us to take an interest in helping our neighbors, our schools and to be aware of the folks around us who are either lost or having a tough time. I found that review a slap in the face of the movie and hate to see how you preach in your church as a pastor. Another review mentioned that women and girls should see this. EVERYONE, not least of all MEN should watch this movie. This Wallstreet dad might have behaved differently had he known what his daughter went through until she sought out a better life by finding him. Who knows? Sorry for the rants, but needed to call folks out on some attitudes. perhaps the mother would not have turned to prostitution to survive. Many prostitutes are so desperate to support their kids and it is the only thing they feel they can make it on because of a lack of \"Village help\" and support of two parents. Then they turn to drugs in order to tolerate the abuse and exploitation of prostitution. It is a vicious cycle and one that mostly affects teen moms and kids with low self-esteem. The system does not sufficiently push dad's role and if more men saw this movie, perhaps they would think twice about abandoning the needs of their children, whether planned or unplanned. I find the sexist attitude of folks so absurd. Take responsibility and stop giving the dads a pass!","user":"nkiflemar","rank":[42,52]},{"title":"Vanessa Hudgens goes for an Oscar, the breath taking life story of Gimme Shelter","rating":8,"date":"29 November 2013","review":"Gimme Shelter is a touching and moving film, so inspirational that I think people will want to buy more and more tickets to see it. Even though a low budget film, Vanessa Hudgens is stunning on her performance as Apple. She proves that she has completely left her amateur puppy Disney HSM acting and moved on to bigger future roles that will certainly give her a lot of career options, maybe an Oscar too. And why not? In Gimme Shelter, Vanessa Hudgens, as an actress, portrays all the emotions and characteristics that the Academy of Arts want to see. I wont be surprised if I see Hudgens taking at least a nomination for her stunning, breath taking performance. Gimme shelter, in general, is an indie film that captures all the phases of a difficult life in the streets of a city. Maybe a little bit of 8 Mile or Precious, Gimme shelter reminds a bit of these films, but the motion picture still keeps its originality of story and of course performances.","user":"gioprete79","rank":[43,58]}]
