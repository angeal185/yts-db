[{"title":"Good Spaghetti/Tortilla Western co-produced by Italy/Spain about ordinary vengeance","rating":7,"date":"3 July 2005","review":"The movie deals with a sheriff (Franco Nero) who leaves his work in Texas and along with his younger brother (Albert Dell'Aqua) go to Mexico to revenge the death their father . Both of whom get in a little town where everybody is afraid of Cisco Delgado (Jose Suarez) who has become the local landowner . There , they take on the land baron and his henchmen (Livio Lorenzon, Jose Guardiola , Hugo Blanco) . They're only helped by an advocate at law (Luigi Pistilli) and some villagers.<br><br>It's a typical Spaghetti/Paella Western co-produced between Italy/Spain in which blends the common scenarios , as invincible and tough antiheroes , difficult and fast showdowns with numerous deceases , impulsive and quick zooms as well as musical score with Ennio Morricone influence . The picture has a certain remembrance to the ¨Trilogy of the dollars¨ and ¨Once upon a time in the West¨ by Sergio Leone regarding the avenging theme , there're even similar plots and twists . Besides , set decoration by Eduardo Torre Fuente and Carlo Simi , the same from both movies . It also bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Django¨ (Sergio Corbucci) referring to Franco Nero role in similar interpretation and clothes . The picture was shot in Abril and May of 1966 , in Almeria (Spain), location where during 1960-70 years were filmed hundreds of Spanish-Italian Westerns . Being a Spaghetti/Paella Western , there appears several usual secondaries of this peculiar sub-genre as Spanish actors : Hugo Blanco , Jose Guardiola , Elisa Montes a special intervention of José Suarez and Italians : Luigi Pistilli , Antonella Murgia , Gino Pernice , Ivan Scratuglia and Remo De Angelis . <br><br>Cinematography by Enzo Barboni or E. B. Clucher (author of ¨Trinity series¨ with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer) is well made . It contains an evocative and atmospheric score by Antón Garcia Abril . The motion picture titled ¨Texas, Addio¨, or ¨Goodbye Texas¨ , or ¨The vengeance of Django¨ was professionally directed by Ferdinando Baldi . Ferdinando was a craftsman who directed all kind genres but especially Western such as \"Carambola's Philosophy: In the Right Pocket\" , \"Blindman\" , ¨Il Pistolero dell'Ave Maria\" or \"Forgotten Pistolero\" , ¨\"Django Sees Red\" , ¨Rita in the West¨ and , of course , ¨Adios Texas¨ at his best . The pic will appeal to Franco Nero fans and Spaghetti Western buffs . Rating : Nice and good . Well worth seeing .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"A rebuttal to the previous comments","rating":30,"date":"30 December 2001","review":"While Texas, Addio may not be among the high water mark of European Western filmmaking, I find it baffling that one would completely dismiss a film because of the quality of its post-production dubbing in a language different from that of its country of origin. Filmmakers are rarely responsible for how their film is presented in foreign language markets, so to place the blame on Mr. Baldi and the producers for the relative poorness (which I must also disagree with--there have been much, much worse dubbing jobs) of the dub is the same sort of ill-informed ignorance that says that the Godzilla films produced by Toho Studios in Japan are \"badly acted\" because the American dubbing is sub-par.<br><br>Aside from the dubbing, there's really no other reason to state that the studio and/or producers were incapable of making a Western. While Texas, Addio may not on par with Red River or The Searchers, the film delivers what most Western audiences ask for--a solid hero, a hissable villain, a believable conflict, plenty of gunplay, and a scenic atmosphere (and again, I'm baffled by statements that label the Spanish location as unattractive or, at the very least, not reminiscent of the American West).<br><br>\nIf you're interested in Italian Westerns, I urge you to see beyond the dubbing and invest the time in this film.","user":"paulelena1","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Good Spaghetti Western","rating":7,"date":"7 August 2006","review":"Like almost every Western starring Franco Nero after Sergio Corbucci's 1966 masterpiece \"Django\", \"Texas, Addio\" was marketed as a Django-sequel in Germany and Austria. Although it has neither anything to do with Django, nor is it anywhere near \"Django\" in it's value as one of the genre's highlights, Texas Addio is still a good Spaghetti Western. Besides the great Franco Nero it features typical Spaghetti Western supporting actors like Luigi Pistilli, Livio Lorenzon and Gino Pernice. When It comes to Ferdinando Baldi's Westerns, however, I would personally recommend \"Blindman\" way over \"Texas Addio\".<br><br>Along with his younger brother Jim, Burt Sullivan, a former Sheriff in Texas, leaves to Mexico to search and capture his father's murderer, Cisco Delgado, and bring him to justice...alive. Cisco, however, has in the meantime become a powerful landowner and crime boss.<br><br>Franco Nero has once said that out of all the Westerns he played in, \"Texas Addio\" is the only one that could also be an American Western. This is kinda true, on the one hand, since Nero's character Burt Sullivan is not the typical anti-hero, but a man who is looking to bring his father's murderer to justice alive, rather than just taking revenge. On the other hand some characters, like the grouchy and cynical Alcalde Miguel, played by Livio Lorenzo, are very typical Spaghetti-characters. Franco Nero's performance is great as always, many of the supporting actors are very good too. All things considered, \"Texas Addio\" is a fairly good Spaghetti Western, not one of the genre's highlights, but definitely worth watching.","user":"Witchfinder-General-666","rank":[9,11]}]
