[{"title":"Perfection","rating":10,"date":"13 March 2015","review":"One word sums up this film \"Perfection\". That's it really!! I saw this film in 1987 when it was released and was completely blown away and like Baby I fell in love with Johnny and Patrick Swayze. It has such classic lines as \"I carried a watermelon\" and \"Nobody puts Baby in the corner\" and too many others to mention. I loved the story, the characters, the setting, the dancing, and well Â… the music was phenomenal not one bad song in the whole soundtrack. It just shows that you don't have to spend a fortune to make a great film. Thank you to the cast and crew for making such a wonderful film which makes me smile like a Cheshire cat whenever I watch it.","user":"AgentFalco","rank":[55,58]},{"title":"Original 'Feel good\" dance epic -- often imitated Never Duplicated","rating":10,"date":"9 September 2016","review":"This is one of those rare rare films that needs a 30 year break between the time of production and the time of the review in order to appreciate it.<br><br>Since 1987 I have seen this film 7 or 8 times. Each time it just gets better. As a Prolific Review here on the IMDb, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of films that improve with age like that.<br><br>This is literally the original \"feel good\" dance film -- which spawned dozens if not hundreds of imitations. The script is perfect. The acting is perfect. The casting is perfect. The direction is perfect. And the music score is to die for.<br><br>Nobody puts Baby in a corner? Well, nobody should ignore this film either! Also has an odd note of the \"one hit wonder\" label about it, which in my view only makes it more of a treat than it already is.<br><br>Swayze's career was unfortunately cut short. Jennifer Grey, who practically made this role a part of her DNA, had a nose job and (the cynics say) lost a lot of later roles because the casting directors were afraid no one would recognize her. And the brilliant writer/Producer Elenor Bergstein for whom this was a labor of love (there was a documentary on this) also seemed to hang up her spurs when production wrapped.<br><br>The IMDb rating is a joke. This is no less a classic in its genre than Maltese Falcon or the Matrix.<br><br>See it, rent it, buy it. But don't forget it.","user":"A_Different_Drummer","rank":[57,65]},{"title":"Some kind of wonderful","rating":10,"date":"24 December 2004","review":"I don't really know what it is about Dirty Dancing.. there is some sort of absolute magic in this movie.. I cannot possibly recount the hundreds (yes, hundreds)of times I've watched it, beginning to end... but every time I do come upon it on TV, I am entranced and mystified and sit myself down and there I am, for two hours, loving the movie as if I'm watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey absolutely hated each other throughout the making of this film, they possess a beautiful chemistry on the set.. it makes the viewer enjoy it that much more, to see this passion and commitment.. and I can't help tearing up a tiny bit at the end, when Patrick comes up to the Houseman family and tells her dad, \"Nobody puts Baby in a corner\". (classic moment) For all those people who believe this movie is corny and sappy, maybe in a way it is, but it was the penicle of the 80's films, and put Patrick Swayze right on the map; his performance was immaculate. <br><br>Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !!<br><br>Ps- The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece","user":"superstar418","rank":[216,278]}]
