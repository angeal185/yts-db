[{"title":"It could have been good, but it wasn't.","rating":4,"date":"3 November 2015","review":"I wanted to like this movie, if for no other reason then I spent the better part of an hour and a half watching it. I wont give any thing away, but it had a intriguing premise, Five people in a sort of purgatory trying to figure out how the got there, a fairly spooky atmosphere, eternal night at a deserted beach house. but every time the story could have taken a turn and become compelling it was ruined with some form of cheesiness. All in all it wasn't terrible, but it was far from good. It was disappointing. so I guess if you have nothing better to do then give it a go. but if you are expecting a eye opening experience well this isn't it","user":"brycewise","rank":[45,60]},{"title":"Interesting Premise Ultimately Undone","rating":6,"date":"19 April 2018","review":"Interesting little low budget affair with an intriguing premise unfortunately undone by the simple fact that the screenplay is filled with many clever \"thoughts\" passing themselves of as \"ideas\". It is to be highly commended, though, for seriously trying to be about larger issues even if it hasn't really worked any of them out yet, and ultimately doesn't make sense or hold up to any sort of intellectual scrutiny. This doesn't mean it is not interesting or holds your attention - it manages to do that even as it sometimes feels a little slow or inert. In all fairness, few films that aspire to be about the workings of an Afterlife, and the role of God and human frailty within that context, manage to be deeper than A: questioning for questioning sake, or B: comprised of rather random rules that are never questioned by anyone in the film - and, by extension, the filmmakers themselves. In this case the logical (or theoretical) inconsistencies increase the longer the film goes on trying to resolve its Twilight Zone like set-up, but at least it doesn't cop out and settle for a simplistic summing up or \"twist\". Performances range from good to totally acceptable - no one has anything to be ashamed of on that front; even the initially Hollywood-esque notion that only five attractive people would be in the house is explained away later that they appear as \"idealized\" versions of themselves. Effects are obviously low budget, but not distracting.","user":"seriouscritic-42569","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Good potential, but ruined","rating":2,"date":"20 November 2016","review":"I was very unsure of what to rate this film. As a pure and simple movie it was well done: good acting, decent pace, good FX. Even the premise is promising. However, throughout there seems to be a lot of man-hating, and the end is about as hubristic as one can get. I can only conclude this was written by someone who is still bitter from a strict religious upbringing. The last line in the film seems to sum up its message of despair. Thus I settle on a solid 4. It could have been so much better.<br><br>For a better \"purgatorial\" film, I recommend \"Kingdom Come\" (2014), which has a much better theological logic to it.","user":"grey1066","rank":[19,27]}]
