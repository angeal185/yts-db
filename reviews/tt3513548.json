[{"title":"A horror movie for our time","rating":10,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"What if someone decided you were guilty of a horrible crime? What if the news said you were guilty and your friends, neighbors and co-workers believed it? What if the police tried to bully you into a confession when you were completely innocent the whole time? This is the true story of Richard Jewell, an innocent man who was cancelled by the media long before cancel culture existed. Excellent acting by Paul Walter Hauser and Kathy Bates and of course directed masterfully by Clint Eastwood. If you're not frightened by this movie - you're not paying attention.","user":"meezerfan123","rank":[276,305]},{"title":"Thrillingly underrated.","rating":9,"date":"16 January 2020","review":"Let me begin with stating, how the hell did'nt this make it to Best Picture? How the hell did'nt P.W. Hauser nor Rockwell get a nomination for their work?<br><br>Richard Jewell is a true amazing story of the reality and sadness of the american system in relation to crimes. There is always an immediate search for someone to blame after a crime happens.<br><br>Performances drive the film. Paul Walter Hauser did an astonishing work, having into account both his resemblance to the real Jewell and his amazing acting skills which yet remain unkown to many. Sam Rockwell is one of the best actors working these days, and he should've gotten his 3rd nomination in a row for Best Supporting Actor. Kathy Bates did incredible, she was true and relatable. Others such as Jon Hamm and Olivia Wilde properly fulfilled the picture's ensemble as well.<br><br>Clint Eastwood is simply amazing. Being in the industry for over 70 years and still managing to impress. The plot is handled with intensity, and thrilling scenes are to remain in my memory. Though he did a great work, some particular blocking and editing disconnected me for brief moments. Nevertheless, he handled a properly written script and brought a thought provoking story to life with the great aid of the casting chosen.<br><br>This film is captivating and gripping from the first scenes already, and it manages to keep you hooked and rooting for the good guys from the moment of the incident.<br><br>It's sad to remember this as a true story because it definitively shows how flawed the society we live in is.<br><br>Nevertheless, it works greatly as a cinematic piece and I would love to see it again.","user":"francobulgheoz","rank":[93,102]},{"title":"Great movie fueled by great performances","rating":9,"date":"14 December 2019","review":"The fact that this is based off of a true story makes it all the more emotionally impactful. A man and a hero's life is ripped apart by the media for no apparent reason other than to try and pin a heinous crime on the most convenient person. Seems to be the story of our time. All of the performances in this movie did the real life people this was based off of justice. Paul Walter Hauser was stunningly brilliant as Richard Jewell and elicited about as much sympathy as someone can on the big screen. Kathy Bates also delivered in spades as the emotional mother having to watch her son be wrongly accused by the United States government and the media. It's not often you have three stand out performances in one movie, but Sam Rockwell deserves some recognition too for the great work he did as Richard Jewell's lawyer and close friend. This was a story that holds a heavy message for this day and time, and Clint Eastwood portrays it in a way that is sure to stick with the viewers for a long time.","user":"auburnfanbo","rank":[175,198]}]
