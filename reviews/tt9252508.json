[{"title":"Exactly what it promises","rating":5,"date":"12 October 2019","review":"Tall girl is a movie about a tall girl. Thats the movie, and don't you dare forget it. My favorite part was when the protagonist, Jodi, was tall.","user":"turnthefrogsgayy","rank":[138,149]},{"title":"Not realistic","rating":1,"date":"22 September 2019","review":"As a 6'2'' female this is highly unrealistic. People are not this shallow. This movie made it seem that being tall was a disease. Ridiculous.","user":"ladylions","rank":[211,238]},{"title":"Great butchering of Sweden!","rating":1,"date":"15 September 2019","review":"Next time Netflix desides to make a movie with an exchange student - try casting one that actually speaks the language! The swedish was awful, the accent was horrible! It sounded like a mixture between made up german and russian combined. There is a distinct swedish accent, the actor just didn't have the decency to learn it. And sidenote, Sweden is the second best English speaking country for it not being the first language in the world, so a big part of the swedish population doesn't even have an accent. And also - no person in that young age would be named Stig or Ingvar. Those would be the names of 80 years old men. Is it to much to ask for Netflix to get an accent and a name correct? Instead they are lett with a really unbelievable story. Gör om gör rätt.","user":"soffsskrap","rank":[294,349]}]
