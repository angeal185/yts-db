Wow.","rating":3,"date":"24 December 2018","review":"Holy cow, what a steaming hot mess this movie is. It somehow manages to feel simultaneously confusing, boring, cerebral in a terrible and condescending way, and extraordinarily amateurish.\nI'm not really sure I managed to follow the plot. It starts with a manned mission to Mars in the near-future that goes awry for unknown reasons, moves on to what is basically a one-woman show about an earth-based astronaut (think drone program , but in space) working with an advanced AI to investigate what went wrong during that mission, and finishes with scenes that I think are meant to suggest a 2001-ish symbolism concept.\nBut honestly my understanding is based upon a lot of guesswork. It feels incomplete because if I did understand the basic plot correctly it is just filled to the brim with plot holes and bizarre assumptions. And the last twenty minutes is so dull that I fell asleep.\nI would just avoid the movie.","user":"ivko","rank":[114,135]},{"title":"The last 20 minutes made no sense, or did any of it?","rating":3,"date":"13 August 2018","review":"So I was following it until the Earth blew up, or did it? Then she died or did she and then she was in the cube or was she there all along or previously on Earth and was she a human or an android and did this change? And the ending, what was that about?","user":"fivish-1","rank":[52,61]}]
