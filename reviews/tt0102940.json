[{"title":"Idiotic and Innocent ...","rating":20,"date":"20 January 2009","review":"This is movie is probably generation-specific; I'll bet you could appreciate it much more if you saw it in it's day. Seeing it today, it comes across as innocent and light-hearted rather than laugh-out-loud funny. It's geared towards the slacker mentality of the early 90s: partying, goofing off and women.<br><br>In the movie, there are basically two ski school groups who are at odds with each other: rich/elitist/serious skiers and slacker/party-focused lunatics. They use the Whistler Pageant competition to determine which group should remain at the resort and which should go.<br><br>The film is clearly geared to high-school males. There's beer, nudity and lots of girls (none of which have any real speaking roles). There are a few colorful ski scenes which are interspersed throughout the movie, but the it mainly takes place indoors than on the slope.<br><br>It may appeal to you if you're looking for a light-hearted teen-party movie (and moreso if you like ski themes). Otherwise, there's no point in seeing it.","user":"Vic_max","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Bad acting, stupid story, gratuitous nudity -- I LOVE IT!!!","rating":6,"date":"11 July 2001","review":"I was just browsing my friend's movie collection and came across \"Ski School\".  I almost put it down without even saying anything because I thought it was gonna be a dumb movie about skiing competitions, but I asked him about it and he said \"It's funny, and it's got naked women in it.\"  As SOON as I heard that, I shoved it in.  To my surprise, it was a pretty good movie.  As many have said, it's a very quotable movie:  \"In order to be the best, you must lose your mind!\" -- \"Welcome to my kingdom, I will bed you all before the night is through!\" -- \"You, get beer!  You, get...beer!  You, get...laid!\" -- and many, many others.  With a combination of non-stop jokes, partying, naked women, and skiing, this is definitely the perfect comedy for guys.<br><br>And also to my pleasant surprise, it has an awesome soundtrack -- they play 2 songs from one of my favorite bands, Lock Up, which is guitarist Tom Morello from Rage Against The Machine's old band -- \"Punch Drunk\" and \"Half Man, Half Beast\".  If you haven't seen this movie, you MUST!  It deserves the publicity. 10/10 for entertainment value.","user":"RunningFromSatan","rank":[15,23]},{"title":"Bored to the bone. (spoilers)","rating":3,"date":"2 January 2005","review":"I was surprised how bad this one turned out for me, given that Dean Cameron and Patrick Labyorteaux usually make great under-achieving party animal characters, as they prove to do here. Except, even where the movie follows that party animal meets anal villain story line and completely follows the book on ski movies, nothing much happens.<br><br>At a posh ski school, cabin number 8, lead by David Marshak (Dean Cameron) only has three things on their minds that any slacker guys in an 80s/early 90s comedy romp has on their mind: beer, boobs, and parties. And, usually in that order. The sleazy jerks from cabin one, which could easily be mistaken for Eurofags Lars and Hans, were it not for their American accents, don't want to put up with the antics of cabin number eight. So, Capitan no fun and his gang of merry thugs wage war (somewhere in there) and vow to get them kicked out of the camp, because they're really stealing their thunder. There's not much skiing going on, save a few shots in the beginning, and of course, the dangerous slope competition finale (the pinnacle of any ski movie out of this period). The rest of the time is devoted to cabin eight's goofing off. Seriously, that's about it. A repetition of boobs and parties. They attempted to put a story in there and follow it, although they didn't and the characters had to state the obvious intermittently in the film because they obviously weren't devoting much camera time to it.<br><br>Granted, I usually love dumb comedies like these, and especially with Dean Cameron and Patrick Labyorteaux in the front seat (see 'Summer School'). I could tolerate the clich√© ski school story line. I could even put up with the numerous boob money shots, but damn, they made almost no effort for a story here. That's a no go for me. Over and out.","user":"vertigo_14","rank":[10,15]}]
