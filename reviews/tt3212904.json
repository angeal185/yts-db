[{"title":"An Average Time Killer","rating":5,"date":"29 October 2015","review":"Not a whole lot to really say about this one. It is exactly what it looks like, a survival type movie with some horror mixed in. It's pretty predictable and doesn't really try to do anything new. With that said though it's not terrible, it held my attention throughout, the acting was good enough, and the ending was fairly thrilling.<br><br>I didn't hate the film, however it is one of those movies that I will eventually forget about. Still wasn't a horrible way to kill a week night though. If you want something simple to watch as a time killer you could probably do better than this, but you could do worse as well.<br><br>5/10","user":"HorrorOverEverything","rank":[43,53]},{"title":"Average survival horror.","rating":6,"date":"9 November 2015","review":"As survival films go, this one isn't bad but doesn't bring anything new to the table. It's more of a thriller than a horror because there's really not much blood and gore to speak of. That said, the twist ending is a nice surprise although most of the film plods along quite predictably. There's some great acting and impressive cinematography, so I assume there was a decent budget for this movie. It's just a shame that no matter how much money you throw at something, a mediocre story is still a mediocre story. The script was entertaining though and evoked a real sympathy for the characters, so it's worth a watch if you enjoy this genre.","user":"emberstonepierce","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"Pretty decent survival movie.","rating":7,"date":"22 December 2015","review":"If I had to compare this to another movie it would be \"Open Water\" except in a car with a killer instead of a shark and a more satisfying ending. In essence this is more of a slow survival movie with a faster paced \"survivor girl vs killer\" finish.<br><br>All of the production, acting, directing, etc are well done. However, as others have mentioned it doesn't really bring anything new to the table, but then again, does any movie these days?<br><br>In the end I liked it. If you are looking for a full blown horror movie, this is not what you are looking for. If you like movies like \"Open Water\" and \"127 Hours\" then this is probably worthy of a watch.","user":"maverickz-33-530388","rank":[11,16]}]
