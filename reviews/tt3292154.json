[{"title":"Your 10:00 is here.","rating":7,"date":"20 July 2015","review":"For once, a SyFy original that's funny on purpose.<br><br>If we're lucky, one out of every 200 SyFy originals is decent entertainment because the people behind it knew what they were doing with direction, music, editing, and above all, the script. Sadly, most SyFy orgs feel like a near death experience.<br><br>Sharktopus vs Whalewolf is just as stupid a premise as any other SyFy flick, and the film makers embrace this, turning it into one of the funnier films. And yes, it's meant to be funny. Catherine Oxenberg is obviously having a blast as the hammy Kraut. Casper Van Dien (whose beard is somehow 30 years older than the rest of him) is the Errol Flynn type (the alcoholic Flynn, that is). Akari Endo, for whom this is not her first SyFy rodeo gets to shine as the take-charge badge on the beach.<br><br>The effects are slightly more polished in the CGI department, but it's still CGI and the Whalewolf looks more like a monster puppy than a man eater, but that's part of the charm.<br><br>Highly recommended but don't come into this expecting bad SyFy or even so-bad-it's good. Get ready to chortle!","user":"Mr. OpEd","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"This movie changed my life.","rating":10,"date":"18 November 2015","review":"Before I was a crack addict, living in the ends. But I watched this film and saw Captain Ray, and realised what Id become. Now, I go to AA meetings twice a week, and I'm on the road to recovery. I also had an unhealthy diet of hookers and street whores. But now I only do myself. (out of choice) The vuju guy was a fantastic actor, shame his head was eaten. I wish mine was. (i mean my pepe) i am sad the nurse hooker lady died. CGI 10/10 fo' sho'. Was basically 3D. Better than Avatar. Story line on point. It makes complete sense that a whalewolf would find a home in a stadium. Somewhere where there is no water. Lol. Peace out homies. SHARKTOPUS RIP. (spoiler alert)","user":"shae-davies","rank":[18,26]},{"title":"The Best in the Series So Far","rating":27,"date":"27 July 2015","review":"Sharktopus vs. Whalewolf (2015) <br><br>** (out of 4) <br><br>The drunken boat captain Ray (Casper Van Dien) is thrown into jail after a woman on his boat is killed by the sharktopus. While this is going on, mad scientist Dr. Reinhardt (Catherine Oxenberg) is experimenting with DNA, which leads to the whalewolf character. Soon more dead bodies are piling up while the two large monsters battle one another.<br><br>This is the third film in the SHARKTOPUS series and it's certainly the best. I think what makes this one work is that the film gives a lot of effort in trying to be funny and campy. The first two films in the series as well as many of these SyFy movies seem to think that if you purposely make a movie bad then it's going to be entertaining. That's not the case and that's why so many of them fail. This one here is obviously silly and over- the-top but the film doesn't play it dumb and instead comes up with a few clever jokes that actually work.<br><br>The highlight of the film is certainly the Oxenberg character as the actress is clearly having a blast playing the mad German scientist. Even funnier is a sequence where her big-breasted assistant runs around in slow motion with her things juggling. This here is pure Roger Corman sexism at its finest. Van Dien is good enough in his role and there's no doubt that he too appears to be having fun. Akari Endo is also good in her supporting role. As you'd expect, there's quite a bit of fake looking blood as various body parts are eaten by the two main characters.<br><br>SHARKTOPUS VS. WHALEWOLF is pretty good in its own way so if you're a fan of these types of movies then you're bound to get a few laughs out of it.","user":"Michael_Elliott","rank":[8,11]}]
