[{"title":"Exactly what I was expecting","rating":7,"date":"18 August 2019","review":"Don't understand why people get stuck on realism when they judge this movie. Sure there are a few over-the-top moments, but why does that matter? Not every movie needs to be Oscar bait. It's creepy and menacing, just like it's supposed to be.<br><br>Obviously, Octavia Spencer nails it as a former high-school wannabe, who struggles with breaking free from her past. Naturally most people like her wouldn't take it this far, but I'm from a small town, and that post high-school trauma is very real for a lot of people. And this being a horror movie, why not exaggerate a few things and have some fun with it?<br><br>Juliette Lewis also deserves a mention. She does not have a lot of screen time, but surely makes the most of it. I can not understand why she isn't getting better parts, in even greater movies, because she is fantastic.<br><br>7/10","user":"gaamst","rank":[58,69]},{"title":"Everybody was kung-fu farting","rating":7,"date":"3 September 2019","review":"I think I'm becoming a right old grumpy man, because I'm pretty sure I hate teenagers now.<br><br>The film itself was written very well and the cast were all good, but there just wasn't quite enough suspense. It isn't a bad movie by any means, it just had the budget, cast and crew to be better.<br><br>The story is a slow burn and when it actually gets down to its 'nitty gritty', things become interesting, even if it is predictable and there are those expected moments where all logic and reason goes out of the window so that the story can progress.<br><br>\nSorry MA, but I think it's time to put you in a home.","user":"donttouchmeprimate","rank":[47,58]},{"title":"Missing Something","rating":6,"date":"31 May 2019","review":"I thought Octavia Spencer did an amazing job. I can't quite put my finger on what is missing from the film but it was okay, not amazing. I suppose I was hoping for more horror, less thriller.<br><br>With a tiny $5M budget, they will make a profit.","user":"mawhinney","rank":[125,171]}]
