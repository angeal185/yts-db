[{"title":"Want to play a game?","rating":4,"date":"16 October 2018","review":"Amanda Peterson (KylieRae Condon ) is brought to the St. Petersburg orphanage with a terminal case of possession, not terminal for her of course. The next thing you know, the orphanage is abandoned and 50 years later a group of \"urban explorers\" (Is that an oxymoron?) break-in one night and guess who is still there after 50 years and hasn't aged a day? <br><br>The production is filled with tons of jump scares. The kid is creepy, but it wears off as does everyone being dragged across the floor. It used to be that was the final scene of a movie, now it is every other scene. Eric Roberts' voice appears in the film on a battery-powered tape recorder that still works after five decades without a leaky battery. And how about a fifty-year-old generator turning over? I found those more unbelievable than the demon. <br><br>The film doesn't introduce the characters, instead, we get to know a few on the fly. Once the film gets going, it gets old real fast. <br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"The flashlights were cool","rating":2,"date":"2 May 2019","review":"One star for the groovy flashlights and another for a few good laughs.","user":"kenk64-890-211558","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Lame and typical stupid decisions...","rating":3,"date":"10 March 2019","review":"Seriously, if people are this stupid during trying/scary/emergency times, then humanity really does need some kind of Apocalypse.<br><br>Dumb decisions, and honestly, you're facing possibly dying and yet you feel the need to berate your brother over some moronic high school type drama because he doesn't share every secret with you?<br><br>The ONLY reason I gave this movie even a 3 is because kids scare the crap out of me.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and skip this idiotic movie.","user":"AndyVanScoyoc","rank":[2,2]}]
