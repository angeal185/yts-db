[{"title":"A Throwback","rating":6,"date":"11 September 2018","review":"I'm reminded of the films of William Haines c.1930 like \"Speedway,\" \"The Girl Said No\" and \"Just a Gigolo.\" In these movies the boy won over the girl mainly by stalking and annoying her. I wonder if generations of men were influenced by this genre to pursue women by being obnoxious.<br><br>In modern times, Henry Jaglom is an auteur who plays himself being obnoxious.<br><br>Auteur Schaeffer is extremely annoying in this film as he pursues \"yoga girl.\" He interrupts her class twice to make his pitch. Instead of getting a restraining order, she seems to find this charming. Only in the movies.<br><br>After I saw \"They're,\" I looked up my review on \"My Life's in Turnaround,\" Schaeffer &amp; Ward's first film. I had the same reaction: Effective dry humor, but some scenes go on too long.","user":"kcfl-1","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"One of the best!","rating":15,"date":"15 December 2011","review":"This is simply one of the best love stories! Two washed up movie producers (Spleck and Jason) look for love in New York City, in two different ways!<br><br>Spleck meets this yoga instructor (Diane Davis) who he thinks is stringing him along, but she insists that he needs to curb his enthusiasm. Diane Davis plays this part!! Their attempts fail day after day, but somehow they keep each other going with banter, criticism, witticism and concern.<br><br>They're meeting about four girls per day, but with no luck. They girls on the other hand each offer the guys some advice or insight that helps them along.","user":"brave_warrior2","rank":[3,7]}]
