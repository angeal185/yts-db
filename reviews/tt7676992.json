[{"title":"nice and fascinating independent movie","rating":9,"date":"19 February 2019","review":"This movie is a little sparkling treasure, i like independent movies and good story telling. here it is a story taken from real life. you can relate yourself with the actors. some parts are quiet and emotional and others are turning into action and burstings. like the way it goes. 9/10 !","user":"bastigol_br","rank":[2,5]},{"title":"Needs to have movie soundtrack available.","rating":10,"date":"5 June 2019","review":"I actually grabbed a beer and hung out with them. The music/rap is amazing. That womans voice calmed my dog. Nice! Lots of laughs, and some tear jerker moments as well. I'm going to add this one to my \"If I'm ever stuck on a desert island, my top 50 movies\" list. The ending was unexpected. All likeable characters. Like, there were no bad guys. Ok, 2, but wholly cow, how they were stopped...creative. loved everything about this movie.","user":"deeatwood-06341","rank":[1,3]}]
