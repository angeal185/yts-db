[{"title":"Don't be so Blue","rating":4,"date":"29 March 2019","review":"Simone (Lilly Lumi√®re) and Sam (Louis Rocky Bacigalupo) are twins in search of a housemate. Simone is a pretend vampire while Sam is a dweeb in search of a date. They settle on Ashlee (Christal Renee), an overly bubbly, pop culture lover cheerleader. Marcus (Denis Ark) fears the Reptoids and is a vampire hunter. He uses shoe polish for a beard. The action starts as a home invasion and ends up with the cast at a warehouse.<br><br>The cool albino snake and woman drinking blood from a martini glass have nothing to do with this film. There are about a half dozen films with this title, but none made on a budget this small. The film relies on camp characters reading mildly humorous lines and gag license plates. A sleeper at times. Was that a nerf sound being made when the werewolf was hit by a stake?<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Here we go again with these low effort horror movies.","rating":1,"date":"24 March 2019","review":"Terrible acting, annoying and badly produced and directed. Stupid and pointless. That's all there is to say really. A waste of time.","user":"Rastifan","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"This is something of an acquired taste...","rating":3,"date":"18 June 2019","review":"Right, well given the title of the movie \"Vampz!\" then I had expected that I would be in for a horror comedy. So of course I took the chance to sit down and watch \"Vampz!\" when I was given the chance.<br><br>Turns out that this movie wasn't at all much of a horror comedy. Perhaps it was, but it just failed to sink its fangs into me - pardon the pun. I managed to endure 40 minutes of \"Vampz!\" before I gave up. Why? Well, because the storyline was not overly interesting, and the characters were just flaccid and pointless. Not to mention that the dialogue throughout the 40 minutes I endured was just horrible.<br><br>I have no idea what writers Omar Attia and Leonard Buccellato wanted to accomplish with this story. It just had no appeal, no charm, no glitter. And I must admit that I found myself sitting with my phone in hand checking social media several times throughout the 40 minutes I endured.<br><br>The acting in the movie, well in the 40 minutes I watched, was adequate I suppose, for a movie such a this. Don't go expecting a great Shakespearian performance of grandeur here.<br><br>\"Vampz!\" failed to entertain me, and as such, I have no intention of returning to watch the rest of the movie and find out what happens to the characters that I didn't care one bit about anyway.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[1,1]}]
