[{"title":"Zombie Revival","rating":8,"date":"1 August 2017","review":"Train to Busan was a treat. <br><br>A look into Selfishness vs Selflessness and Individual vs The Collective.<br><br>I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a foreign film this much. The cinematography is excellent, the story is original, and I will definitely be keeping an eye on Sang-ho Yeon's future projects.","user":"mpaulso","rank":[126,145]},{"title":"As Promised.
