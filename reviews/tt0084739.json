[{"title":"A surprisingly good film--albeit cliched","rating":24,"date":"24 March 2002","review":"This movie has all of the elements that you expect from a horror film--and I mean that in the best way! All right, it's admittedly low budget, but the frequent deaths, presented with almost metronomic spacing, are inventive and entertaining. Plus, it is a delight to see a film that really does have a supernatural grounding, instead of the so-tired slasher bit.<br><br>You should definitely watch this movie when you are alone at night--watching it with friends or in the daytime gives you too much chance to let the low budget distract you from the flow...","user":"weltonb","rank":[30,39]},{"title":"I like it even with it's weaknesses","rating":9,"date":"1 July 2004","review":"I like this movie despite it's flaws. This movie is not technically a great movie. The plot is pretty straight, some of the acting is spotty, and there's very little in the way of surprises. The biggest surprise for me was the fact that I liked this movie. This movie is a traditional horror flick, complete with killings by a supernatural \"witch\" that rises from death to administer death on many people who venture near her. This movie tries and succeeds in scaring the viewer, not only by handing out violent deaths, but by intense suspense as well.<br><br>If you like your horror traditional and scary, and you can overlook a few weak spots, then this movie is something that should interest you!","user":"riotrr","rank":[26,36]},{"title":"The witch has her revenge","rating":10,"date":"19 November 2018","review":"My father saw this one in a theather in the 80 s, and told me to see it, i never found it, later on i bought the dvd in spain, and he was right, this is now my favorite horror movie of all time, i now have it on blu ray, bought in germany, fully uncut, its really intense, gorier, i recomend it 10/10.","user":"ruimichael-53784","rank":[4,4]}]
