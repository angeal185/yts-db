[{"title":"One of my favorite shark horror monsters movies and favorite Thomas Jane film","rating":10,"date":"8 December 2017","review":"Deep Blue Sea (1999) is my favorite shark monsters horror film and favorite film of Thomas Jane. I am a fan of the actor and this one The Punisher (2004) and Thursday (1998) are his favorite roles. Carter Blake is my favorite Thomas Jane role he played. It is my childhood movie I saw it as a kid, I never had a problems with the film. It is fast paced, entertaining action horror flick. The idea about Alzheimer's disease making sharks smart was brilliant.<br><br>I enjoy this film it is my favorite shark film, a lot of peoples are going for Jaws this is my favorite monster shark movie. From the actors, the plot, the story, music score, stunts and real practical effects no stupid CGI, I love movies like that. I love this film to death I love it so damn much. If you like Jurassic Park (1993) then you will like this one, this is another film with animals who become smart. A preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.<br><br>In Jurassic Park was breakdown and a paleontologist with two kids in the park has to fight for survival, but in this movie a team of scientist must fight for survival when trio biogenic sharks becomes smarter and they flood the facility now the team must come on surfers and fight for survival. <br><br>Searching for a cure to Alzheimer's disease, a group of scientists on an isolated research facility become the prey, as a trio of intelligent sharks fight back. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on rampage and flood the facility.<br><br>I love this film and it really surprised me with the plot twist: <br><br>LL Cool J as Sherman \"Preacher\" Dudley so surprised me when he was stuck in the accident in the kitchen he dealt with the shark him self who eat his bird.Jumps out of upper oven and swims away, \"You ate my bird!\" lights lighter, throws lighter into open oven and blows up the shark fantastic scene.<br><br>Thomas Jane as Carter Blake was the most smartest, tougher guy, brave shark hunter I have ever seen. He saved those people in the water in the opening scene from shark in which a shark wanted to eat them. I love his character he fought against the third shark and he kicked his ass. He was a brave hero I love the actor so damn much. He gave a good performance of him self. He wrestler the shark in which preacher shot's him with a harpoon and blows up the shark, but my hero survives I love that so much. Thomas Jane is a great actor I love him in this movie. <br><br>Saffron Burrows as Dr. Susan McAlester anti heroine and the tritagonist the head of a team of scientists was excellent as the villain the same time was also a heroine in this film. I love the actress so much. Wonder what happened to her?, I don't see her in any good movies this days since she went making this movie \"Deep Blue Sea\". Saffron Burrows was great as Dr. Susan McAlester she electrocute the second shark with a power cable all by her self that was a bad-ass scene. She sacrifice her self by helping Carter stopping the third shark from escaping. <br><br>This film was directed by Finnish director Renny Harlin who previous directed A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2, The Long Kiss Goodnight and Mindhunters which I thought he did a great job directing it. Music score for this film was excellent by Trevor Rabin.<br><br>Jurassic World (2015) copied Deep Blue Sea (1999) T-Rex was faster and smarter hunter and he tricked people believing he escaped off the fence, but actually he was hunting them, they make, the T-Rex smarter hunter! I already saw that in Deep Blue Sea, when doctors implant the human brains in the sharks. In here they did the same thing with the T-Rex! <br><br>This movie come out the same year as The Matrix come out and of course I went to see that movie in the movie theater with my mom. This movie I ranted in the video store a year later on VHS tape. <br><br>Samuel L. Jackson is in here and he surprised he was eaten again the same he was eaten in Jurassic Park. I thought Samuel L. Jackson will be the lead guy, but I was surprised when he was eaten by a shark.<br><br>Stellan Skarsgård is in this movie from Thor and Thor: The Dark World and he is so young and thin in this movie. <br><br>You have adrenaline-pumped shock waves and of course you have a great explosion, great underwater scenes. Thomas Jane did 100% of him in this movie. Everything was for real no CGI bulls***. <br><br>10/10 I love this flick to death, it is my all time favorite shark monster horror film. You love Jaws I love Deep Blue Sea to death! Especially I love the ending and the conclusion only two heroes survives in this movie. <br><br>I love the song Deepest Bluest (Shark's Fin) that was performed from LL Cool J. for this movie.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[103,125]},{"title":"Fun and entertaining","rating":6,"date":"6 June 2001","review":"After the opening scene of *Deep Blue Sea*, in which (predictably) a shark terrorizes a quartet of partying teenagers on a boat, I decided I was in for a crappy movie. A crappy movie that would contain basically every movie AND horror movie cliche I could think of.  I was right. And wrong.<br><br>I will say that the premise for this movie is great: super-intelligent sharks. Sharks are bad enough, but...smart sharks? Immediately you have terrifying possibilities running through your mind. The sad fact, though, is that this is one of those movies where the screenwriters (and I can't believe it took three people to come up with this) threw some dice and picked which character was going to die next. That's what the plot boils down to: things go wrong; someone dies. More things go wrong; someone else dies. And so on. People whom you couldn't care less about die. People who you really don't want to see die die.<br><br>The people are an interesting band of characters. The female scientist, pleasing to the eye and the ear (I'm a sucker for accents), is utterly consumed by her research. (And for all you testosterone-driven males, she does strip down to her underwear in one scene.) Samuel L. Jackson goes about saying his lines as president of a pharmaceutical company. I just love the way Michael Rapaport talks: he's welcome in any movie. LL Cool J deftly provides the comic relief and was clearly the audience favorite. Sure, there are some other characters, but pretty much everyone's one-dimensional, as expected.<br><br>I think I've bashed this movie enough. It's time to get to the crux of the argument: this is an entertaining movie. As soon as the movie entered the lab facility, I became completely immersed in the film. As the movie progressed, I didn't think about how long it had gone on and mentally calculate how much was left. Once the trouble started, the movie grabbed me and never let go. I was not perhaps literally on the edge of my seat, but no outside thoughts penetrated my mind. It's not that the movie is scary or anything; it's that it's suspenseful. Predictably suspenseful, but suspenseful nonetheless. There is one scene in the film (I cannot conclusively tell whether it falls nearer or the beginning or the middle because, as I said, I lost track of time) during which I sensed the ENTIRE AUDIENCE jumping out of their seats. At the risk of getting off on a tangent, the sharks were believable. And the speed at which they moved unnerved me. They did succeed at their purpose: to keep a continual shudder running through my body. Let's just say you couldn't get me within ten miles of that facility.  Oh, look, I did get off on a tangent, just great. At times I of course found myself wondering why some of these characters were so unbelievably stupid in their actions, but it's all part of the fun. And that's what I ended up deciding about this movie: it was fun. Blood-soaked, cringe-inducing fun.","user":"Polter-Cow","rank":[87,107]},{"title":"Pretty Good Movie","rating":8,"date":"8 March 2006","review":"I thought Deep Blue Sea was one of the best shark movies created. I was very fascinated by the scientific part of the movie. The basis wasn't just on terror and blood. I think there's a real personal side to it for the lead character. She had watched her father suffer for years, and that drive and desire to prevent the same thing from happening to so many others gave the movie the obsession that it had. I found it refreshing that this movie had a woman obsessed with helping others instead of some risqué character obsessed with sex or violence. However, the other characters were not introduced to well. You never really found out anything about them. There were some suggestive hints about Carter having a background, but it was as if the movie left you hanging, or you got to make up whatever happened yourself.<br><br>There were some bad points as well. Firstly, the relationships between the characters weren't consistent. One minute, it would seem that certain characters were just acquaintances or co-workers, and the next, they seemed to be such close friends. Though, I suppose a tragedy like that would have that effect on people. The other fact that gets me every time I watch the movie is how many times Carter falls down! Yes, sometimes it's unavoidable, but then, others, you can tell he randomly jumps and slides away. Every time they try to do anything, Carter is falling down. Also, what gets to me each time I see the movie is when the stretcher hits the window. All the cast members stand there watching. I know that if I were the room and that first chunk of glass had flown from the window, I wouldn't wait and see what happens next--I would have been running for the door long before they did.","user":"mlm_211","rank":[24,28]}]
