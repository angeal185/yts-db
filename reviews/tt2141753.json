[{"title":"Not bad, but a little depressing.","rating":7,"date":"8 July 2015","review":"This doc was alright. I think focus on SC2 profits, and more than just one team would have been more enlightening though. Details were also left out that would have made the story a lot more interesting, especially considering they focused strictly on one team (EG). No monetary values were listed, which made it even more difficult to grasp the reality of the situation, and maintain interest. Overall, I am an avid gamer, but I still feel a little sorry for most of the guys in the pro-gaming community. It seems you go SUPER HARD and drop off super fast when you age. Which is crazy to me, but I guess it is what they want to do. Not much of a fallback though.","user":"blaicefreeze","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Good Game is good if you like games","rating":7,"date":"6 March 2019","review":"A friend of mine recommended this to me - he's an avid gamer and has a podcast and YouTube series devoted to all things gaming - and I can totally appreciate the appeal to those enveloped in that world. While it's personally not my thing, it was kind of fascinating to see this whole other \"society\" devoted to the craft of Pro Gaming, particularly Starcraft. In my opinion, the subject kind of borders on the ridiculous, but that's mostly because I've never really been that into gaming (we were forced to play outside as kids, and as such, I never really developed the knack for video game systems). But \"Good Game\" is nonetheless an interesting look at the Evil Geniuses team and their efforts to make it in their chosen field of cutthroat competitiveness.","user":"JayRief","rank":[1,1]}]
