[{"title":"how ?","rating":1,"date":"5 July 2018","review":"Watching this movie can severely damage your brain and confidence in humanity.\nIntroduction is terrible. Then 1st sketch is useless. 2nd is worse.\nThen during several minutes a hamster has fun in a doll house. It's so boring it feels like hours. But hamsters actually act better than humans in this movie.\nThen ridiculous sketches follow ridiculous hamsters.\nPurgatory is probably funnier.\nAvoid.","user":"jeremiebousquet","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"The best Hamsters movie ever","rating":10,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"Mixing hamsters and horror?? WTF? \nThis movie are built up of shorter segments or stories if you like, seperated by a short clip with cute fluffy hamsters in various settings.\nBut hell yeah, it works out nicely. Its not a problem to see its a B movie, or even a C movie, but as the directors lost their director virginity with this movie, you should yhink \"WOW! This is their first movie? AMAZING\"\nSome of the actors are in more than one segment, and they do a good job.\nThe directors is doing acting, lighting catering, makeup, audiorecording and \"80 other jobs\" as it says in the credit.\nEven Ray Besharah are director for one story. Some of the stories are a bit difficoult to understand the first time you watch them, but there are no reason not to watch this movie again :)<br><br>AND the Hamsters?? They are amazing too :)<br><br>PS; This is NOT a movie for children to watch alone, its some killing and gore in it. Ohhh, even a couple of boobs, but better with boobs than killing if you ask me....","user":"SpecialWeirdo101","rank":[3,7]},{"title":"Funny","rating":5,"date":"6 July 2018","review":"This is not for anybody, but if you are in the mood for a movie mixing amateurish horror/comedy short films and cute fluffy rodents, you can't miss it. First I must say that the general idea is pure genius : I love horror anthologies but the uninterrupted succession of concentrated violence can make people switch off. The answer here is to bring the spectator elsewhere with a radically different tempo, and it works pretty well. Now about the short films, you know from the first images that what you're about to see doesn't fit in Hollywood standards (especially the acting). Anyway, a few stories are rather good with some unexpected twists and you can feel overall that everybody had fun on the set and made their best to bring Horror and Hamsters to your screen. My 5/10 rating is probably a bit overvalued but I really had some fun, and I would have given 10 stars if a friend of mine was involved in the making. And I hope they'll do a sequel with kittens.","user":"acromegalix","rank":[3,7]}]
