[{"title":"Intense, Deep, Raw","rating":9,"date":"14 August 2018","review":"Constructed the way a brain might actually process conflict, trauma, and transition, this film seethes with the dark side of emotion, allowing the viewer to become embroiled in each character's turmoil. The experience is effectively uncomfortable, an ultimately triumphant effort providing insight to perspective outside of one's own while bridging that gap with the familiarity of both feeling stuck and being jarred. Family rifts, mental illness, and the search to understand and accept oneself are intertwined through visual and aural art style unique to the filmmakers, breaking new ground. It is like nothing I've ever seen, and I hope to see much more from this team.","user":"yabobubble-39578","rank":[182,189]},{"title":"enjoy the ride","rating":9,"date":"26 July 2018","review":"Really different. i think you have to go into it with an open mind and allow it take you on a journey and if you do that you're in for a very moving and visceral experience.","user":"booradley-26414","rank":[30,35]},{"title":"Not a waste of time","rating":8,"date":"26 July 2018","review":"I like weird stuff. Give me some Lynch, Noe or Jodorowsky and I'm a happy camper. This isn't quite as surreal (or as good) as those masters. It's a descent into drugs and meaningless sex. It's well made. Performances are terrific - Judd Nelson can proudly throw his fist in the air for this one! Better than Beastmaster.","user":"youknowmeihateeveryone","rank":[31,38]}]
