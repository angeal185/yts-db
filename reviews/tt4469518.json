Unfortunately, it also seemed like no one involved in the writing process had even a rudimentary grasp of ethics. At no point could any character be bothered to even attempt to distinguish between murder and self-defense or act like the distinction might change the appropriate ethical response. Other than that it was generally just a mess of mediocrity.","user":"darthseth","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Dull","rating":3,"date":"25 April 2018","review":"What a waste. The story looked promising and the trailer looked like a good sci-fi saga comprising 3 movies. But alas, this first installment was boring to watch, not even raising any excitement. The humans were rushing around, distrusting the civvies and going as far as trying to eliminate them.<br><br>No wonder the AI Robot had enough of this nonsense and set up the scene for the next installment. If it is actually going to be made, I won't be watching it.","user":"pietclausen","rank":[27,36]}]
