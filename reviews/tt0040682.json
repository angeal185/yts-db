[{"title":"Mother,you had me and I always had you but...","rating":28,"date":"28 September 2002","review":"The parents have rarely been more selfish and nastier than in this Cocteau play.Only Tennessee Williams's Mrs Venable in \"suddenly last summer\" can compete with Yvonne.Over-possessive to the power of 100,under her bourgeois mask,she is absolutely terrifying.And what about the father?He has an affair with Madeleine,who -coincidence- is in love with his son Michel.And when there's somebody who must sacrifice himself..it won't be him.<br><br>The play was ideal for cinema because the atmosphere is stifling,a constant huis clos where the characters are often filmed in close-ups:the parents 'faces exudes meanness,fear of getting old and ugly.Their apartment is deservedly called \"la roulotte\"(the trailer)as it seems as tiny as their occupants' heart.The only generous person is aunt Leo (Gabrielle Dorziat,dazzling as ever) who tries to save the young couple,because she knows what an unfulfilled life means;when she was young,she used to love her brother-in-law,Yvonne's now husband and she sacrified herself for her ungrateful sister.<br><br>Michel (Jean Marais ,a bit too old for the part but his gusto and his dynamism easily makes up for it) and Madeleine (Josette Day,who had already teamed up with Marais in classic \"la belle et la bête\") are unfortunate victims of the boy's old folks .<br><br>It 's untrue to say,as a precedent user mentions,that the nouvelle vague was rebelling against Jean Cocteau.He was never a target for them as was for instance,Jean Delannoy(who teamed up with Cocteau several times :\"l'éternel retour\"(1943) and \"la princesse de Clèves\" (1961).)<br><br>Cocteau is a monstre sacré.His works will outlive most of Godard's farces.I do hope they will.","user":"dbdumonteil","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Non Les Enfants Terribles.","rating":7,"date":"7 April 2018","review":"Recently buying Les Enfants Terribles,I started reading up online about the project from auteur icons Jean-Pierre Melville and Jean Cocteau. Making plans for films to view for an ICM poll on the best movies of 1948,I was surprised to learn from a DVD seller that the name of Melville's work was a reference to a '48 Cocteau,which led to me meeting the terrible parents.<br><br>View on the film:<br><br>Starkly standing out from his first three films, writer/director Jean Cocteau and cinematographer Michel Kelber trim the distinctive Surreal/ Fantasy stylisation for cramped, stage-bound locations. Following each person along as if they were cross to a different part of the stage, Cocteau allows his casts to fully explore their relationships in extended takes,with the addition of icy close-ups closing in on the vile from the parents.<br><br>Doing a second adaptation of his own plays in 1948, Cocteau superbly uses the isolated apartment to pull open the hateful views of Georges and Yvonne,who spit pure nihilism at the wide-eyed innocence of their son Michel. Reuniting from their magical Beauty and the Beast, Jean Marais and Josette Day proved they have not lost a drop of chemistry as Michel and Madeleine,via Marais threading Michel's passionate love for Madeleine between the fury of his family (played by the outstanding Yvonne de Bray/ Marcel André and Gabrielle Dorziat) and Day having Madeleine jump with giddy unease over meeting Les parents terribles.","user":"morrison-dylan-fan","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"The caravan continues on its way.","rating":9,"date":"17 January 2020","review":"Jean Cocteau wrote his play in 1938. After many trials and tribulations which were too numerous to be listed here he finally staged a hugely successful production with his ideal cast in 1946. He committed that production to celluloid in 1948 with the same cast.\nThe superlative framing, revealing close ups and unusual camera angles, including overhead, from Michel Kelber, sparingly used score by Georges Auric and ensemble playing of the highest quality must make this a leading contender for the title 'best filmed play'.\nYvonne de Bray, the original dedicatee , Gabrielle Dorziat, Marcel Andre, Jean Marais and Josette Day all perform their roles with the same energy as they would within the proscenium arch but still succeed in remaining filmic. None of these actors are exactly strangers to the camera of course.\nA magnificent piece of theatre thankfully immortalised on film. Here Cocteau has also included the centuries old ritual of 'les trois coups' prior to the curtain rising; a truly wonderful theatrical tradition.\nJean Marais came full circle in the late 1970's when he directed this play and took the part of the father.","user":"brogmiller","rank":[2,2]}]
