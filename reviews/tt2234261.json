[{"title":"Good old times","rating":7,"date":"24 May 2015","review":"Maybe the movie only \"deserves\" a 6 out of 10, but our main actors and their interplay alone is worth that extra point I gave it. It really feels like those two know each other their whole life, but we knew how good both are acting wise. The movie is also not really hiding the fact that it knows that we know where it is heading. We shall have fun on the ride there though.<br><br>And we can have fun, if we let ourselves. It's easy like that, just enjoy the two and some odd jokes along the way (let's call a repeated joke video chat \"bombing\", taken from photo bombing someone of course). Characters are very aware of what they are doing and in what movie they are in (villains are villains you see). Just enjoy if for what it is :o)","user":"kosmasp","rank":[18,19]},{"title":"Enjoyable Fluff","rating":7,"date":"15 August 2014","review":"I do enjoy a good British romantic comedy. My guilty pleasure I guess. They just make you laugh and feel good, just a little escapism and shouldn't be taken seriously. Being serious, well, that's for other films. Having said that, this movie has so many things wrong with it, it should be a huge failure, but oddly enough I loved it. I thought the two leads Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thompson were exceptionally well cast as they were so believable and likable. The other \"good guy\" Anglo-Saxon characters were good and as in so many other British films, the bad guys were French. I'm not sure how to judge their performances. The French accents were really dodgy at best and totally unbelievable, but this just added to all the fun. You know what? I must just watch this again, now.","user":"alfredsmith","rank":[26,30]},{"title":"Lighthearted fun","rating":6,"date":"28 April 2014","review":"A divorced couple lose everything and so they plan a robbery in order to recover what is rightfully theirs.<br><br>This is a light-hearted comedy through and through, the type we are getting more and more used to in seeing the former Mr Bond. One could go on about the insufficient storyline as well as the sheer impossibility of the break-in executed by utter amateurs.<br><br>Whilst I stand by the above but to judge it on that basis would be a miss and by treating it as a fun/cheerie comedy about a former couple who have to put up with another in order to salvage their pension and embark on an adventure it will suffice for a somewhat delightful time on the big screen.","user":"cinematic_aficionado","rank":[28,35]}]
