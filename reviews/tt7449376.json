[{"title":"There's some good in it","rating":3,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"Very intriguing base idea, some smart dialogues, decent acting (Ryan O'Quinn did a great job), nice atmosphere but... disproportionate premises, some unuseful stereotypes, messy structure of the script (or just a wrong editing). I would like to watch a better-made remake of this movie, a new production with more funds and, of course, with a new script.","user":"JofiElias","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Solid low-budget","rating":8,"date":"12 August 2019","review":"I think we need to give these indie horror films a little more credit. It's an obvious ultra-low budget film. Story wasn't bad. I didn't love some of the music choices. The acting was fine. I think you have to consider the material actors are given to work with. Vanessa Leigh and Ryan O'Quinn were great, as were many others. It's not a top-shelf horror film you're going to find in theaters. If you can't handle low-budget indies, don't watch it. Otherwise, give it a chance.","user":"Dommed","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"It's amazing what your mind can justify","rating":6,"date":"15 August 2019","review":"A group of young filmmakers head on up to the remote \"pass\" to interview Mr. Mahoney (Christopher Atkins) who was a park ranger. He discovered a bunch of mutilated bodies and hasn't been the same since. They wait to catch him in a lucid moment.<br><br>For the first hour, this is a boring film, except for the lesbian scene. About an hour into the film it turns into a WTF Twilight Zone with no closure, but a bevy of hints-some repeated at the end in case you missed them and similar films.<br><br>Guide: F-word.
