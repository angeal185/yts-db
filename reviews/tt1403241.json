[{"title":"Not to, to bad... a pretty decent watch.","rating":6,"date":"18 October 2014","review":"Had kind of a Teen Wolf meets The Lost Boys kind of thing going on.<br><br>I liked the fact that there was no CGI used it was all special effects and makeup, which was a nice break from todays excessive use of CGI. It's kind of what had me sold on it to be honest, the effort put into the costumes. You can see by the pictures they put a lot into the work on the wolves.<br><br>I think Angelica and Cayden looked pretty sweet as wolves, They looked about as real as a human/wolf could look, certainly looked better than Jack Nicholson's Wolf.<br><br>Yeah the acting wasn't spectacular, but really, when it comes to these kind of lower budget films.. It definitely isn't Underworld in that aspect but still it was a good little weekend special.","user":"DeviantHitman","rank":[45,50]},{"title":"Highly Entertaining Adventure","rating":7,"date":"11 July 2015","review":"The teenager Cayden Richards (Lucas Till) lives in a small town with his parents Dean Richards (Stephen Sparks) and Janice Richards (Jennifer Hale) and is having violent nightmares. He is the quarterback of the local football team and his girlfriend Lisa Stewart (Kaitlyn Leeb) is a cheerleader. After a game, Lisa decides to have sex with Cayden for the first time in the car. However he transforms into a monster and she flees from him. He goes home and finds his parents murdered. He leaves town hitchhiking while he is wanted by the police and he learns that his parents were actually stepparents.<br><br>Cayden decides to find his origins and helps a prostitute at a truck stop that is assaulted by two men. Then he steals the motorcycle of one of the men and later he stops at a bar where he meets the weird Wild Joe (John Pyper-Ferguson). The stranger identifies that Cayden is a wolf and gives the direction to Lupine Ridge. Cayden arrives in a bar owned by the teenagers Angelina \"Angel\" Timmins (Merritt Patterson) and Gail Timmins (Melanie Scrofano) and he asks for a job, telling that his name is Danny. However he is not welcomed by the locals and he leaves the bar. But a man called John Tollerman (Stephen McHattie) hires him to work in his farm where he lives with his wife Clara Tollerman (Janet- Laine Green). Soon Cayden learns that John is his uncle and his mother was raped by the local leader Connor (Jason Momoa). He also finds that he is a pure town wolf together with John, Angeline, Gail and two other inhabitants. Connor is also pure, but has formed a pack of impure wolves and has a pact with the inhabitants to leave them in peace. But he is getting old and wants to have a baby with Angelina as part of the deal. But the problem is, Cayden and Angelina has fallen in love for each other and Cayden intends to stop Connor.<br><br>\"Wolves\" is an entertaining adventure underrated in IMDb maybe because it is indicating the horror genre, frustrating the fans of this genre. The plot is predictable but the characters are charismatic; Lucas Till and Merritt Patterson have a great chemistry; and the special effects and fight choreography are excellent. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Lobos\" (\"Wolves\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Worthwhile horror","rating":8,"date":"18 March 2015","review":"I honestly don't know why some people have responded so negatively towards this film. Perhaps they did not watch more than the first twenty or so minutes. <br><br>It takes Wolves time to get off the ground and the segue into the story is not managed all that well, giving the initial impression of a clumsy B movie. If however, you persist you will be rewarded. Wolves improves as a the story progresses. The story itself is predicable horror fare but its competently done and very enjoyable. <br><br>The acting is solid too, and includes some capable Canadian actors you may be familiar with, such as Stephen McHattie, of Pontypool fame. <br><br>My advice ignore the negative nellies and give Wolves a go. You wont be disappointed. Eight out of ten from me.","user":"s3276169","rank":[17,19]}]
