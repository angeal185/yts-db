[{"title":"Rarely Funny Silliness","rating":2,"date":"29 August 2017","review":"This film, I imagine, is meant to be a raunchy black comedy. Well, it certainly is raunchy as well as lewd, crude, and, in my opinion, terribly unfunny.<br><br>Ken Jeong stars here as Chris, whose life is in shambles and sees his only way out is to kill David Hasselhoff and win his Celebrity Death Pool, which has grown to over 500 thousand dollars.<br><br>There are some decent performances here such as Will Sasso as a loan shark, Colton Dunn as a gay hit-man, and Hasselhoff does well parodying himself.<br><br>However, it just all added up to me as painful to watch silliness. Mercifully, it's only 1 hr. and 20 min.in length.","user":"larrys3","rank":[35,43]},{"title":"Killer Cast, Hassel of a Movie","rating":6,"date":"4 March 2019","review":"This film really only works if you are massively into David Hasselhoff, or if references, nostalgia and cameos are your absolute favourite parts of a movie. This has all that in spades!<br><br>Apart from that there really isn't that much ucg esle to offer here. It's not really all that funny and the story is all over the place.<br><br>Overall it's a pretty brainless comedy that relies on references to get it through, if you just want to turn your brain off then it's fine, but that's about it.","user":"scythertitus","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Such a funny and intense movie","rating":10,"date":"4 March 2019","review":"I absolutely love the Hoff (everyone loves him). I´m after a surgery and laying in bed for long time and this movie gaves me such a good laugh. Enjoyed every minute. :) The surprise guests were good choices, the music and the jokes are on point. 10/10 I haven´t enjoyed a comedy so much since the Other Guys. :)))","user":"nkishudak","rank":[4,4]}]
