[{"title":"Superb writing that is matched by superb acting and incredibly atmospheric and charged direction","rating":21,"date":"21 December 2004","review":"Blanche Dubois arrives in the French Quarter of New Orleans suffering from a mental tiredness brought on by a series of financial problems that have ended in the family losing their plantation. She has come to stay with her sister, Stella and her husband Stanley Kowalski in their serviceable little apartment. The aggressive and animalistic Stanley immediately marks himself as the opposite of the feminine and refined Blanche and Stella finds herself pulled between the two of them. Stanley suspects all is not as it seems and begins to pry into Blanche's colourful past, even as Blanche spots a way out in the arms of the Mitch, a man captivated by her. However it doesn't take long before the cracks begin to show in the relationships and in Blanche herself.<br><br>It almost goes without saying that the writing here is of top-notch quality. The story is a relatively simple character piece that can be summed up in a couple of sentences, however this would do a great injustice to the depth of development and the convincing manner in which the characters are all written and the story told. It is not so much the depth that some of the characters go to, but the complexity that is effortlessly written into them  we can see it writ large on them, but not to the point where it seems obvious or uninteresting. Blanche is of course the focus and she is a mess of neurosis barely hidden behind a front of respectability that clearly doesn't convince her anymore than it does Stanley. Mitch is also really well written  at first it is comic that he tries to be such a gentleman while having the brute just under the surface, but later his frustration is heavy on his face along with his anger. The overall story is surprisingly, well, \"seedy\" is the best word that comes to mind. It is in the gutter and no matter what Blanche wants to believe, that is where it stays and the film is right there the whole time.<br><br>How Kazan managed it in the early fifties is beyond me, because even now the film is pretty graphic in its violence to women, subject matter and rippling sexuality across pictures and characters. It is a compelling story due to the characters and the manner in which they are delivered  Kazan's atmospheric direction really helps; the films feels humid and close, and he has done it all with a basic set and a camera. The lighting throughout is wonderful both in the general atmosphere but also specific touches such as the way Blanche manages to visibly age due to lighting changes when the film has slight chances of tone.<br><br>Of course the main reason I keep coming back to this wonderful film is the actors, who take the opportunity and, in many cases, make it so that it is hard to see anyone else playing their roles. Leigh is perfect for the role and gets everything absolutely spot on; she is vulnerable yet self-seeking, confident yet needy, proper yet unstable. Even visually Leigh is convincing in terms of body language but also the fact that she looks the right mix of ages, looking beautiful one moment but worn and defeated the next  totally, totally deserved her Oscar. Brando made his name here and even now his performance is electrifying and memorable. He has his big scenes where he gets to play to the back row but he also has moments where he does nothing other than be a presence on screen; no matter what is going on we are watching him because we are as in awe and yet as afraid of his power as Blanche is herself. Together Leigh and Brando dominate the screen and whenever either of them are on screen it is hard to look away. As a result, Kim Hunter sort of gets lost in the background although her performance is still good. Karl Madden is great but again only holds a supporting role and deserved his Oscar for a convincing performance of a well-written character. Of course it is easier to give good performances with great material than with bad material but there have been enough versions of this play around for us to see how lesser actors can fail where this cast soared.<br><br>Overall this is a great film that sees so many critical aspects all coming together as one final product. A superb play has undergone a great adaptation that has been seized upon a great cast who deliver a collection of performances that deserve all the praise heaped on them, all directed with a real sense of atmosphere that really delivers a seedy and erotic film both for its time and today. I cannot think of an excuse for people not having seen this film.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[141,177]},{"title":"One of the Greatest","rating":10,"date":"24 October 2000","review":"I had put off watching this video for sometime.  I was afraid that I might be disappointed in this classic.  Instead I was drawn into this marvelous film with its great Tennesse Williams' script.<br><br>Williams doesn't let any of his characters off.  Brando's Stanley is a boorish, bullying, loudmouth.  But he also possesses an extraordinary physical sexuality and also seems to be more than a little bit of a victim himself.  Life has not been smooth for Stanley.  No silver spoon here. Both his wife and sister-in-law put him down as a crude \"Polack\" and other variations on that theme.  Not that there isn't some obvious truth to their put downs.  However, truly nice people (as opposed to \"nice\" people) do not engage in such speech.  There's also the table scene where Stanley is eating chicken and receives a harsh verbal reprimand from Stella.  Whereupon he sees the tactics of class shame being used and he proceeds to blow up in a very physical and blue collar fashion.  Stanley sexually assaults Blanche at he end of the film.  Blanche was already hearing voices by this time in the film, and this act of aggression pushes her over the edge.  Brando's performance was really superb.<br><br>Hunter's Stella is by far the most likeable character of the major 3 players.  She's honest, kind, sexy, and very much in love with Stanley--despite his obvious faults.  The depiction of the physical love and lust between Stanley and Stella is classic.  She also loves her sister and wants what's best for her.  She and Blanche collude to some extent against Stanley which provides much of the film's strongest tensions.  Stella is financially and sexually/emotionally dependent on Stanley, but she's also a strong character in her own right.  We don't really know for sure if she'll go back to Stanley at the end of the film after the baby and the sexual aggression against Blanche.  We do know that Stanley for all his macho swagger is extremely emotionally dependent on her.<br><br>Vivien Leigh's character was a revelation. I thought the most brilliant moments in the film were towards the end when her character was speaking. I didn't really think Leigh's accent was all that great, but hey, when you can act like that who cares?  Blanche is a victim, but Blanche is anything but innocent.  She was having sex with one of her high school English lit students back in Mississippi.  Naturally, the small town locals did not take a shine to such behavior.  Also, she was more than just a bit on the promiscuous side for a high school teacher in mid-century small town America.  It's not surprising that she got chased out of her small town teaching job.  There's also the touching scene where she asks for and gets a kiss from the boy who is collecting for the newspaper.  It's all tied in to her love for the boy who killed himself over her when she was 16. She said some very cruel words to him about being weak which led to the boy's suicide.  She's not an innocent--by any means.  The sexual attraction between Stanley and her is noticeable in a number of scenes.  And yet for all her pretentiousness, lies, and putting on airs, the audience is drawn to her.  Her fading beauty, vulnerability, and weakness can hardly help but elicit a sympathetic response.  Blanche is the human condition writ large. In some respects there is some of Blanche in all of us:  hidden ugliness from the past, both emotional and sexual neediness, and just plain old human weakness.  I think Leigh's performance was really brilliant.  And thank God for Tennnessee Williams and his ability to portray people more as we are than as we would like to be.<br><br>I do agree with at least one of the previous viewers that the term \"nymphomaniac\" seems somewhat out-of-date in describing Blanche.  Blanche uses sex in a promiscuous fashion to escape from her loneliness.  I think this is the same pathology that both men and women engage in when having \"casual--such a strange contradiction in terms--sex\".  I certainly don't think that Williams saw her as either a \"nympho\" or a \"slut\".  Rather, just a lonely, tortured individual.","user":"dusted1","rank":[105,131]},{"title":"Antebellum Delusions","rating":16,"date":"16 October 2005","review":"Blanche DuBois reminds me of Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd. (1950). Both characters succumb to their alter egos, and descend into their own worlds of fantasy and half-truths.<br><br>In \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", Blanche travels from her antebellum roots in Mississippi to New Orleans, to see her sister Stella. But, upon arriving in the Big Easy, Blanche must confront Stella's husband Stanley, a greasy, poker-playing neanderthal lout who knows a thing or two about reality. It's the clash between Blanche's stately delusions and Stanley's gritty realism that soups up the drama in this Tennessee Williams play, converted to film classic by director Elia Kazan.<br><br>The drama is absorbing. But the performances of Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh, as Stanley and Blanche, are what make the film the cinematic powerhouse that it is. Excellent B&amp;W lighting and jazzy background music amplify the seedy, sleazy atmosphere, which adds depth and texture to the story and the acting. And, of course, the claustrophobic, steamy French Quarter makes a perfect setting.<br><br>As one would expect for a film derived from a play, \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" is very talky. Generally, I don't care for films burdened with a ten thousand page script. But this talk-fest is an exception. Overwhelming what I would otherwise consider a weakness, the acting of Brando and Leigh alone are enough to justify a two hour investment, and render an enjoyable and memorable cinematic experience.","user":"Lechuguilla","rank":[57,70]}]
