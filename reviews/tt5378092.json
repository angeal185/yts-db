[{"title":"Brilliant animation, not the story","rating":7,"date":"1 July 2018","review":"The plot is quite cliche for fairy tale movies and it reminds me of Disney's Brave and Rapunzel. However, I'm pretty much impressed by its breathtaking animation (having said that this is the very first Ukrainian animated movie that I've ever watched).","user":"gyura89","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"A simple story with good animation.","rating":8,"date":"26 July 2018","review":"Am I the only one who feels this film really has a part of Aladdin and sleeping beauty and also the princess looks like Anna from Frozen? <br><br>The story is quite simple. When I started to watch this, I didn't have that much expectations. I thought it looks a fine animation. So, I watched it. When the film ended, I feel like it wasn't that good and wasn't that bad. <br><br>The reason why I gave 8 stars is because of animation. The animation is great. Although it isn't produced by Disney, it looks like it's production. All in all, yeah, it's enjoyable.","user":"silvermistvio","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Finally ukrainians have learned how to draw an animation!","rating":5,"date":"11 March 2018","review":"5 points only for good graphics and effects. Scripts and scenario are have to be revised. Plot is not brand new, but something different from similar others. There are a lot of unnecessary scenes that can be sciped. But overall, by comparison with other ukrainian animations it is worth seeing. Ultimatelly it is created for children, and my child was satisfied, and even truly laughed several times.","user":"julyman","rank":[16,22]}]
