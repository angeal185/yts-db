[{"title":"Understanding the movie Death Smiles on a Murderer..secrets revealed","rating":9,"date":"14 May 2008","review":"You have to see this movie more than once to understand and figure out what's going on.In short,after being reanimated from the dead,Greta Von Holstein(Ewa Aulin)seeks revenge on a lover who jilted her by faking a carriage accident and causing the death of its driver on the estate of the son of the man who impregnated her.She is in cahoots with the butler of the estate,who helps with a lot of her dirty work(then meets his end after she uses him).A doctor(Klaus Kinski)finds out her secret after ministering to her after the buggy accident and copies an Incan formula off of her gold pendant for his own use and fame.The pendant was made for her by her brother(with whom she had an incestuous relationship with)who brought her back from the grave after a miscarriage and inscribed her name,the year of her rebirth,and a mathematical formula for reanimation on the pendant.Greta causes the death of almost everyone in the cast,but you won't really understand anything until about halfway through the movie.And she makes sure no one is left to tell her tale!Surrealistic sound track by Berto Pisano keeps the movie on it's feet in the tradition of Phantasm.Definitely a must see!","user":"snarf14738","rank":[28,29]},{"title":"A Movie with Many Horrors","rating":10,"date":"6 April 2004","review":"In the mid '70s as a 10 year old I was watching the late show, and during commercials I changed the station to channel 5 in Atlanta, GA.  They were showing this little gem, and I caught a few minutes of it.  It took me 5 years before I could see it on TV again, and I had to rig a UHF antenna in my bedroom to get the broadcast. I was very struck by this weird tale of the dearly departed being resurrected:  the style of the film fascinated me.  It took me 15 more years before I finally saw the film uncut. The breakdown is this:  a rich young couple, Walter and Eva, take in a young girl named Greta who has been in an accident and has amnesia.  Something is not quite right about her, but that doesn't stop these kinky people from both having an affair with her.  This affair starts a very sinister chain of events.  Ewa Aulin and Klaus Kinski star in the film debut by director Joe D'Amato.  The film has many flaws I suppose, but I'm NOT a critic and I love it anyway.","user":"spoono01","rank":[16,19]},{"title":"D'Amato's maze of death and desire","rating":7,"date":"26 April 2009","review":"This early D'Amato film bears some affinity to the work of Mario Bava, being a 19th Century Gothic horror long on style and atmosphere if short on coherence. The basic plot involves a brother who raises his sister from the dead (using an old Incan ritual) in order that she gets revenge on those who were responsible for her death; a number of gory murders ensues.<br><br>D'Amato attacks the story is a very strange way, deliberately I would presume to emphasise the tale's strangeness and put the audience in a similar position of mystification as the characters find themselves under. This approach is not entirely successful, although the dizzying maze of Dutch angles, stalking and spying POV shots, extreme close-ups (especially of eyes) makes the film constantly compelling. Klaus Kinski gets star billing for what is essentially a bit part as a scientist in a sub-plot (which links with the Incan ritual) and his early demise is problematic, as his appearance and then disappearance have the stench of a red herring.<br><br>The film seems to be an extended riff on the idea that human relationships are an unhealthy brew of thwarted desire, jealousy and rage. The most effective moments have the characters stalked by the dead sister, who turns from ravishing beauty to mouldering corpse from shot to shot. The party with masks and the idea that beauty can suddenly turn rotten lead me to suspect that the film is an unacknowledged inspiration for some scenes in Kubrick's The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut.<br><br>The finale, with the dead sister being revealed as the old woman cohabiting with the detective, is half-hokum and half inspired derangement of time; like Nicholson's final Shining moment, frozen in a picture from the 1920s, this reveal suggests that the detective has been doomed timelessly to follow a case which is in some ways a re-enactment of is own marital relationship, a reflection of the deadly tortures which seemingly ordinary married people wish to enact on each other. The story bears some similarities to the work of Poe, and like D'Amato's Emanuelle's Revenge, it uses the images of immolation behind a wall from that storyteller's A Cask of Amontillado.","user":"jaibo","rank":[10,11]}]
