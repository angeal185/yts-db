Bad acting. (I laughed at the boy's horrendous woody acting at the beginning)\n2. Semi-bad directing.\n3. Not too bad alien makeup and CGI (CGI near the end). Though they need improving.\n4. Pretty decent story line.<br><br>The dinner scene reminded me of that dinner scene in the movie, \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\". I was thinking they should have hyped that scene up. Come to think about it, it could have been \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" with an alien twist.<br><br>With right directing, good acting and perhaps an improved story line, it would have made this a solid horror/sci-fi film.<br><br>Like someone said, it's probably a good popcorn movie, especially with friends to laugh at it.<br><br>5/10.","user":"DeafAlien2012","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Enjoyable B Movie Popcorn Flick","rating":8,"date":"25 July 2018","review":"\"No Good Heroes\" is never going to be an Oscar winning film but it never tries to be. For a quirky low budget Sci-fi thriller, its goal is to entertain and captivate. Is there a good story with engaging characters? Yes. Is it watchable? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. Will it hold your attention? Yes? Is it suspenseful? Yes. Does it have a sense of humor? Yes it does. So relax with \"Heroes.\" Kick back. Make some popcorn. Enjoy the show.","user":"qikfingers-71367","rank":[14,26]}]
