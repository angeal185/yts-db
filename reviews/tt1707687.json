[{"title":"poor acting, directing, script...","rating":5,"date":"12 April 2011","review":"Don't put your hopes too high, regarding the title, you might be missled in thinking: \"this could be something worth watching\"... well nothing further away from truth. Almost naive in how predictable can be, every 10 minutes a clich√©. From time to time You can feel and see the effort of those involved in making the movie of trying to make it look like a serious action movie by inserting plot twists, but no one buy it, and by the second half even they are getting bored.<br><br>Just in case you have a boring Sunday afternoon and you wanna see it I won't spoil it, all i can say it's that at the end i had the impression that a 14 year old fan of action movies was in the director's chair. I give it a 5 just because of Ray Liotta, even that it's not his best performance.","user":"sergiu-mocan","rank":[28,34]},{"title":"Too Predictable","rating":4,"date":"14 April 2011","review":"This movie is like a poor mans Training Day. But, without even a single twist. <br><br>The script leaves an awful lot to be desired.<br><br>It has absolutely zero resemblance to the gritty Street Kings crime drama that came before it. <br><br>The only reason I watched it was because Ray Liotta was in it. <br><br>I would say save your money, but I'm not sure it even made it into theaters. <br><br>If you don't have anything better to do, it's certainly not the worst movie. But don't expect anything like Street Kings of 2008.","user":"tlvx","rank":[16,19]},{"title":"Don't waste your time","rating":1,"date":"12 April 2011","review":"Very B category movie, don't waste your time with it, don't expect too much, this movie belongs to trash bin. Lots of people will watch it because they think it has anything to with the Keanu's Street King. Nothing to compare. Storyline has been told a thousand times before. Bad cop, good cop, revenge, nothing new is really added to it. Characters are one dimensional and you don't really care about them. Acting? You wont see that in this movie. Ray's only good movie was the Good Fellas, since then he showed us nothing but bad. The best thing about this movie is the ending, because its over. Too bad, you cant get refund for it.","user":"Chris_Seabird","rank":[29,51]}]
