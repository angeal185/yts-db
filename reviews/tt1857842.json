[{"title":"Redd, Inc.","rating":7,"date":"23 July 2012","review":"Just saw this movie at a film festival in Seoul and was quite impressed. As is generally the case with film festivals, I didn't quite know what to expect going in other than how it is similar to Saw. While the similarity is there, Redd, Inc. is certainly its own film and one that is worth watching. It involves a recently escaped mental patient/prisoner who believes himself to be innocent and kidnaps the unsuspecting people who were involved one way or another with the conviction.<br><br>The movie lacks the sort of pathetic dialog the worst parts of the Saw franchise often include as other films do, whether it's Saw, other horror movies, or other other movies that involve multiple people in a tumultuous situation. The dialog is often funny, usually necessary, and never drab.<br><br>The director was kind of enough to show up and say a few things about his film along with taking questions, during which time he brought up his love of the comedy/horror genre. Often times horror movies are funny when they don't want to be and corny when they are trying to be funny, but Redd Inc. does a good job achieving what it is trying to achieve at any given moment. In the end, everyone has a moment or many of feeling chained to their desks.","user":"recycled_invention","rank":[21,27]},{"title":"The originality makes it worth watching","rating":7,"date":"1 February 2013","review":"I just finished watching the movie. It wasn't one of those serious slasher films. Even though I've seen innumerable horror movies, the movie still made me cringe. It is sure to make some of the audience want to cover their eyes during some killing scenes, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The movie was explicit about showing minor yet disturbing enough torture scenes, but seemed to deliberately censor the major ones, which is understandable given the fact that it wasn't meant to be a torture movie. The gore is not over the top and it is only there to contribute to the story progression. It is more of a detective movie, mixed with some joker-type madness, which slightly takes away from the seriousness of the violent scenes, and somehow makes you keep watching even if it makes you uncomfortable. You're going to watch a bunch of people trapped in a single location trying to work their way out. This means much of your time will be spent watching the characters have lengthy conversations with one another in order to solve a murder case. The movie is a mix of detective, torture, and comedy genres. I'm not into comedy movies, but it kind of made this movie more appealing. If it didn't have that funny feeling to it, I might have got bored due to it resembling many other movies of this type. I must say the story is very original and that alone makes this movie worth watching, although I'm pretty sure for most of you out there it's going to be a one-time watch only.","user":"politehere","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"Haha, awesome","rating":10,"date":"19 February 2013","review":"It feels saw-Esq at the start, but that changes. I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the acting was good. The camera work was fine. The plot moved along nicely, I never got bored. If you don't mind blood and gore, you will hopefully love this movie as much as I did. I would recommend this movie to anyone age 18 and over. It is certainly no worse than a Jason or Freddy movie. I really loved the very end. I really liked the main girl, the actress did a great job. I hope she does more movies in the future. Thanks for reading! If you liked this, please uprate. I gave it 10/10, just because movies like this tend to disappear, and I really liked this one.","user":"mmo-sakuji","rank":[22,29]}]
