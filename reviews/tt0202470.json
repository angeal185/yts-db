[{"title":"Stand up and Shoooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuutttttttt!!!!!!!!","rating":8,"date":"20 September 2001","review":"I must admit I wasn't expecting much on this movie. I was surprised  I truly enjoyed it as much as I did.  The script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either.  The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg.  Jennifer Aniston  had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever.  What made this movie for me was the music.  If you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie.  Its all about being a rockstar.  Some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to Stand up and Shout!!! 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music.<br><br>Jason","user":"Feistfan","rank":[25,27]},{"title":"Music really saves it","rating":6,"date":"7 September 2001","review":"As a huge fan of 80s Hard Rock, I was really looking forward to seeing Rock Star. As the movie started I was more than satisfied. A lot of the early scenes were funny and entertaining. The concert scenes made me feel like I was actually there. One major compliment I give this movie is that they made the songs from the fictional band STEEL DRAGON sound realistic for the time period the movie is in. If I didn't know better, I could've been fooled into thinking Steel Dragon was a real band, and all their songs actually were made in the mid 80s. The underdog portion of the story may not be original, but it still works none the less. And by the time Wahlberg's character was in his first concert with the band, I really thought Rock Star could be one of the coolest movies of the year.<br><br>But at about the halfway point, I was lost. The second half of this movie could've really used a lot of work on the script. I say that the second half of the script needed work, but what I should say is the second half of the movie actually could've used a script, period. The second half is held together by some predictable sequences, all telling the story of a guy indulging in the rock star life, which we've all heard and seen a thousand times. There were very few moments that actually were used to progress the story.<br><br>But I don't want to give the impression that Rock Star was no good. Although some of the movie didn't work, I still had a blast watching it. The music is what really holds it together. Both the original songs written for the film (Steel Dragon), and the background songs used. It's not often that you can hear bands like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Kiss, and Motley Crue used in a movie. And like I said before, the concert scenes are awesome.So for people who love great 80s Rock, this movie will be a lot of fun. <br><br>\nRock Star is an average movie, with an above average soundtrack. Not a perfect film, but it provides enough entertainment for your money.","user":"unbend_5440","rank":[46,54]},{"title":"Comic book cynicism","rating":7,"date":"15 August 2002","review":"Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clich√©s in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball \"Almost Famous\". It has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****","user":"moonspinner55","rank":[34,41]}]
