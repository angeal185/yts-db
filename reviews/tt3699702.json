[{"title":"Not that great.. just okay","rating":4,"date":"15 April 2019","review":"Well i was able to predict what was going to happen. And that spoils the fun out of any movie.\nAlso i didn't like the cast. Did not feel any sort of connection.\nIf someone asked me if he or she should watch this movie... i would say no.","user":"juzerjk","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"So predictible it hurts","rating":5,"date":"26 March 2019","review":"If you've watched The Break-Up with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn you will know the overall quality of this movie. It's a dramedy that is so predictable it hurts. The movie can be described with 3 letters - meh. Acting-meh, story-meh, pacing-meh, sets-meh. But my main problem is that the movie makes you feel void. It's not inspiring or atleast heartwarming like a good dramedy should be, it just kinda sucks the joy out of the viewer.","user":"Greevas","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"if this has been a short film i would have rated more","rating":1,"date":"23 April 2019","review":"But unfortunately its not. and this 80 minutes of nonsense is nothing new and lacks lot of things like proper acting, a good paced story, not even proper music for that matter.<br><br>if anything a romantic comedy or drama needs some reasonable pace to make audience watch the whole thing even when it is predictable. i don't know what else to say except that it is a waste of time.","user":"mnagaditya","rank":[3,4]}]
