[{"title":"Good enough to be worth your while, probably not to own.","rating":6,"date":"25 January 2008","review":"The movie had a few things going in its favor. For one, it used reasonable technology and background, so the story wasn't far-fetched. Secondly, and most importantly in my eyes, it did NOT go for shock value. It didn't try to use gore to elicit a reaction from the crowd. Not to say that some scenes weren't rough on the eyes, but it was far from a Saw or Hostel. Thirdly, it honestly kept me on the edge of my seat for a good portion of the movie. And lastly, the ending does not drag itself out. It ends at the logical point.<br><br>That having been said, this movie will not change your life. It's a little bit of a commentary on society, but moreso, it's just an entertaining movie to watch.","user":"RetepAdam","rank":[148,209]},{"title":"Untraceable (2008) ***","rating":7,"date":"10 February 2008","review":"Entertaining thriller about a crazed young computer geek who becomes the deranged moderator of his own \"Kill With Me\" live internet feed where he displays new victims being slowly tortured to death. The more hits he gets at his site, the faster the people featured on his webcam die. This is disturbing in making us realize what depths we've sunk to in our society, and what morbid curiosities can do. I especially liked that the 40-something Diane Lane is the star as the police woman who tries to apprehend the killer, instead of relying on the usual Jessica Alba or Sarah Michelle Gellar \"honeys\" of late. <br><br>*** out of ****","user":"JoeKarlosi","rank":[81,114]},{"title":"Underrated","rating":8,"date":"5 June 2008","review":"That is the one word I will tell you perfectly sums up and describes my opinions towards this awesome film and it's bogus reception. Untraceable was a suspenseful thriller with great action, fun death strategies, and wonderful acting, that has a ridiculous amount of unappreciative reviews and hate aimed at it in all the areas that a lot of people have no problems with in other movies.<br><br>Diane Lane was a great actress in this film. As I have said, the performances are excellent, and she of course gives the best and she made the movie totally believable and enjoyable. While there were of course flaws, I found the story line and the movie itself to be great entertainment. I found myself yelling at the screen and telling the people in the film what to do, and I am not that interested in a film unless it manages to get my adrenaline up, which I find as a positive factor in few cases whilst viewing a movie.<br><br>There were things I found predictable, and of course the film gets a little out of hand at times, which as I said, it's not flawless, but it wasn't meant to be, and most of the time I was so interested in the movie that I wasn't making any presumptions or criticizing the faults. This was a wonderful film, that is under appreciated and if you haven't seen it, I recommend you do if you are capable of being lenient on these sorts of films.","user":"Dragoneyed363","rank":[60,83]}]
