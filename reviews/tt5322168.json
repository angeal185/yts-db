[{"title":"Tender and Touching Timeless Love","rating":10,"date":"18 August 2018","review":"Though it starts a little slow,Snapshots builds to an emotional ending that has kept me thinking about it for days. Piper Laurie is outstanding. We should all have a grandma like Rose the liberal one among the three. A reminder that things were closeted in1960 Midwest and in sixty years we still fight to be accepted and love who we want to love. One thing to mention is the look of the film. Big budget look and it's an indie film. Don't miss this one. The sleeper surprise this year.","user":"gretahindel","rank":[23,24]},{"title":"Piper Laurie Still Has It","rating":10,"date":"18 August 2018","review":"I watched the film with my wife because I've always admired Piper Laurie. At 85 she is still a great actress. Her portrayal of the love lost matriarch Rose who has to deal with her terribly unhappy daughter and confused grandchild is right on the mark. The music really got me. Those 60's tunes plus the background music that was composed add a lot to the film. Not every man will like this film. I just so happened to like is very much. Watch it.","user":"raymalone-71997","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"SIGNED UP JUST TO TELL YOU IT IS A FIVE STAR WINNER","rating":10,"date":"31 March 2019","review":"Someone told me that I could share my love of Snapshots on IMDB. I do love this movie. I'm over 50 and I can relate to the fear and pain I had being in love with someone society frowned on. The two actresses were real and I felt their joy, passion, love and loss deeply. Piper Laurie was amazing. Is amazing too. This is a film for everyone. One of the best I've ever seen.","user":"melaniestanton","rank":[15,16]}]
