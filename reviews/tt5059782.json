Someone should tell Benjamin that there is a big difference between being deep and being obtuse. It's bad enough that the acting is so stilted, but honestly, the story line is non-existent. My theory is that a group of first-year film students got lost in the badlands with nothing but a bag of drugs and a camera stuck in slow motion mode. I saw this movie with a large group of people,and afterwards everyone had lots of compliments for the scenery, the props, the costumes, even the stunt performers... but not one of them could tell me what the story was about, whether the movie had any kind of point to make, or why anyone would bother to produce this kind of self-indulgent garbage. Do not waste your time watching this movie.","user":"strapsetter","rank":[86,88]},{"title":"unbelievably bad","rating":3,"date":"25 May 2017","review":"How this movie received an 8+ rating is beyond comprehension. I am a Canadian so have an idea and appreciation of the differences found in Canadian storytelling. However this is just plain bad. Apart from an awesome location and interesting costumes and makeup (although here also inconsistent using stainless steel rings in a stone age society) No discernible story line, incomprehensible dialogue, clumsy directing, editing, and acting (although in their defense they had so little to work with) Don't waste your time or money.","user":"ballyedenmaintenanceinc","rank":[85,88]}]
