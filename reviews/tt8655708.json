[{"title":"But there was hardly a Ouija board involved here...","rating":3,"date":"6 July 2018","review":"The recent tirade of Ouija movies haven't exactly been spectacular, and that should have been an obvious indication of what to expect here. But after all, it is a horror movie and it could happen to be the movie that breaks the slump of less than mediocre movies, you know?<br><br>But it wasn't...<br><br>The storyline was nothing extraordinary and actually had surprisingly little to do with a ouija board at all, so the title of movie is sort of misleading. And that hardly worked in favor of the movie.<br><br>The acting in the movie was every bit as rigid and unimpressive as the storyline and plot. So don't get your hopes up for something spectacular here. And it didn't really help that the characters were mundane, generic cardboard cutouts that just milled about like lemmings, doing things that often made little sense in a situation like the one they were in.<br><br>As for the special effects in \"Ouija Seance: The Final Game\" were adequate, although you shouldn't set yourself up for something out of this world.<br><br>All in all, \"Ouija Seance: The Final Game\" is not an impressive horror movie, and as an avid horror fan, I have a lifetime of movies with me in my backpack. Some of us suffered through this ordeal of a movie so the rest of you don't have to.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"I sort of liked the trailer but the film didn't deliver","rating":3,"date":"22 July 2018","review":"I thought the acting was okay as was most of the dialogue. Those are key to a horror film. We know people are going to do stupid things but we don't want them to sound stupid. Unfortunately, after the plot was set up and they played with the Ouija board...nothing really happened. I was bored and thought the last 20 minutes might make for an exciting climax, but it, too, was pretty dull. So, I'd have to say skip this. I wasn't expecting much but it didn't deliver on my low expectations.","user":"derekjager","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"How far is a kilometer?","rating":2,"date":"22 July 2018","review":"The DVD cover has a spooky double jointed ghost that we don't get to see in the film. Sara Williams is in Italy to study painting restoration and sell her grandmother's rural home without cell phone reception. She ends up at the house with three friends, creepy caretaker, and a hidden room with a Ouija Board (could have guessed that from the title). They play with the board, family secrets unfold, folks die. Special effects and characters not that great. Barb (Holly Louise Mumford) was the ditzy friend with the stereotypical shallow boyfriend. Rico (Gianfranco Quero) wants to hook up, but is polite about it. <br><br>There are worse films with \"Ouija\" in the title. I don't recommend them either. I miss the old \"Witchboard\" series. <br><br>Guide: F-word, brief sex, brief nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[6,7]}]
