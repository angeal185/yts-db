[{"title":"LIGHT-HEARTED & FUN","rating":8,"date":"15 November 2019","review":"I was excited for Noelle despite the reviews, and after watching, I still don't understand all the ridiculously critical reviews. This is a Disney Christmas movie targeted for kids for goodness sake. The plot to me is a mix between Elf, and The Santa Clause, and it honestly is better than MOST of the Christmas movies on the Hallmark channel. It is a light-hearted fun movie and I love what the movie conveys even though most of the negative reviews are based around the fact that its \"too feminist\". The movie is showing young girls that their capabilities are endless, and that being a girl shouldn't hold them back from being whatever they want. The fact that so many people take issue with that is sad and ridiculous.","user":"tfrasier-68666","rank":[106,135]},{"title":"Anna Kendrick rocked this cute Christmas movie","rating":9,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"I'm not one to write reviews often. Disney has captured a cute and enjoyable amount of Christmas spirit with this movie that was helped along way by Anna Kendrick. A Christmas movie should do one simple thing ... give you the feels ... The feels are delivered here.","user":"rjtpb","rank":[67,93]},{"title":"You'll laugh, you'll cry","rating":9,"date":"18 November 2019","review":"This was a light hearted and fun holiday movie.
