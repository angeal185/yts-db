[{"title":"Don't waste your time","rating":3,"date":"30 June 2019","review":"This could have been a good movie but it was boring and stupid. It has a supernatural element that makes you keep watching until the end because you want it to be explained. Well guess what, nothing gets explained! Seriously, I mean nothing! And it raises more questions that also never get answered. So trust me on this &amp; don't waste your time.","user":"dreamcandi76","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Poorly Written","rating":2,"date":"12 August 2018","review":"The movie wasn't bad enough to the point that I couldn't finish it, but it was bad enough that I just had to leave a review. It had an interesting concept and potential, but because of poor writing the plot and story fell flat. First of all it was totally unexplained why they were all compelled to get the tattoos, why they were cursed, and how the curse exactly worked. Then the characters were written to be so terribly dumb, like it was obvious after the first guy died and the one girl suffered a couple of lost points that apparently their fates were linked to the tattoo numbers and that leaving the house or harming someone would affect points. But they continued to act oblivious to this and even verbally attacked the one person in the group who had managed to simply guess this incredibly obvious trend. \nThen, after watching these characters be dumb for the entire movie the writers decided to have the final victim killed off by this creepy old guy, who, gauging by the incredibly large number tattooed on his neck, has been killing off groups of vacationers for some time now, and gaining their life points as a result. But once again, it is unexplained who this guy is, how he ties into their situation, and why he's there. The movie would have been decent if it just ever explained why anything in the film was happening!","user":"socialsunshine-12645","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Fatal reunion","rating":5,"date":"15 June 2018","review":"Was drawn into seeing 'Where the Skin Lies' with a cool poster/cover, a very intriguing and creative premise and as someone with a general appreciation for horror. That it was low-budget, which from frequent personal experience is rarely a good sign due to that there are so many poor ones out there, made me though apprehensive. <br><br>'Where the Skin Lies' is a film it doesn't do enough with its potential (although there are far bigger wastes of potential in film) and could have been much better, can't say that it is a great film because it isn't. It is not a terrible film though, as far as recent low-budget film viewings go it's one of the better and more watchable ones easily. It certainly could have been far worse, considering the large number of films seen recently being mediocre at best and irredeemably terrible at worst.<br><br>Lets start with the positives. The scenery is atmospheric and spooky and 'Where the Skin Lies' is surprisingly well shot and easy on the eye, was expecting a cheap looking film and to me that wasn't the case here. The music is suitably ominous.<br><br>Found that the acting was not bad, doing their best with disappointingly nowhere near enough material to work with, found it better than average if not much more.<br><br>Also that there were a few nice moments that intrigued and weren't telegraphed too early.<br><br>Unfortunately, the story does feel paper thin, disjointed and over-stretched and some of it feels vague, under-explained in the last third where the film especially became duller, more predictable, more senseless and less scary. Too many characters are too sketchy and with nowhere near enough to make one want to endear to them and some of the decision making and behaviour induces face-palming. The effects are ropy at best.<br><br>Dialogue can be stilted and rambling, with lots of clich√©s and no depth whatsoever (definitely one of the worst assets), while the pace goes to a standstill very quickly and drags with very little going on worth caring about. Found too many the supposedly shocking moments not surprising or scary and the supposedly creepy atmosphere dreary, due to the excessive obviousness, a lot of dumb and vague moments and explanations and the lack of tension and suspense. Tonally, it feels unfocused and muddled from trying to do too much.<br><br>There are a good deal of underdeveloped plot elements and often nonsensical character motivations, while too many of the things to make you jump or shocked are far from creative or scary and are pretty tame. There is not enough threat here and what there is of it tends to be used poorly, it is completely unimaginative and more odd than creepy, with little sense of horror or urgency. Some badly sagging momentum too. The direction has its assured moments but inexperience also shows. There is a general lack of creativity and shocks.<br><br>Faring the weakest, other than the script, are the sound and editing. The sound is too echoey and often without warning or reason and makes some of the voices sound strange. The editing is haphazard and affects the coherence of some of the goings on and story structure.<br><br>Overall, not great but worth a one time watch. 5/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[12,15]}]
