[{"title":"Soooooo very, very bad!","rating":1,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"I gave this one star because the only redeeming quality was getting to look at Booboo Stewart without his shirt! This movie was so stupid. It was poorly written. Poorly acted. The special effects were lame. It was just awful. Do not waste your time. I wish I could get the hour and a half back myself.","user":"mzmojorizn-40689","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"From the title itself...BAD !","rating":3,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"All i can say is Giselle Bonilla (Cass in the character) is sexy...","user":"benzmendozajr","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"This concerns me","rating":3,"date":"13 January 2019","review":"A group of trouble making teens from South Chicago who look like bad actors are taken semi-boot camp style out to the country near a nuclear power plant. Like all teens, they are annoying and my only regret is that they don't all die. They act like two-year-old kids, female teens, and male testosterone. Meanwhile some masked terrorist plan an attack at a nuclear station. Only these kids can save the aquifer from deadly poisonous neon green liquid plutonium.<br><br>The plot was silly. First off nuclear power plants don't have that kind of waste. Processing facilities generate that kind of waste and they don't place it in incorrectly marked drums. Plants do not have an alarm whereby one knows they are under attack. They have site and general emergency alarms, but no \"terrorists are attacking us\" alarm. No cell phone reception near a nuclear plant?<br><br>I got really tired of moody teen Booboo Stewart.<br><br>Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[1,1]}]
