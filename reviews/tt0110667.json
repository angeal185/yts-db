[{"title":"Well made film with good pacing and cast","rating":6,"date":"4 July 2002","review":"This film reminded me of Fright Night (1985), or maybe Idle Hands (1999) in the way it was a horror with a fair of amount of humour too.<br><br>Don't take it too seriously, and I think you'll enjoy seeing the good special effects and some remarkably atmospheric scenes. True, there's not much of a story but the characters are realistically played and with some great interplay between the cast. Especially good are Zoe Trilling as Shirley, Bobby Jacoby as Perry, and Christi Harris as Bibi.<br><br>And for gore fans, there are some particularly gruesome deaths towards the end. Funniest parts were the use of supersoakers by the ninja-like Sister Gloria and the gang, and Kurt having his crotch felt by (he thought) Terri.<br><br>If you're a fan of the genre, enjoy!","user":"Lamerzi","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Angela returns to host another Halloween party at Hull House!","rating":8,"date":"8 September 2005","review":"Night of the Demons 2 (1994) was a highly entertaining sequel that's on par with the first film. Angela (Amelia Kinkade) is back to host another wicked party at the infamous Hull House. Ever since she disappeared a few years back, Angela has become as legendary as the house itself. She's in town looking for some more \"kids\" that want to party down! Students from a local parochial school meet Angela and accept her invitation, with some nasty side effects. How will the surviving kids deal with Angela and her new minions from hell? Will Mother Superior puck up her yard stick and join the fight against evil? If you enjoy horror films with heavy comedic overtones then you'll want to watch NIGHT OF THE DEMONS 2!<br><br>So much weirdness in this film that it defies logic, but in a fun way. The film never takes itself too serious and neither should you, just a fun sequel directed by the Aussie king of exploitation Brian Trenchard-Smith.<br><br>Highly recommended.","user":"Captain_Couth","rank":[15,21]},{"title":"Great horror flick","rating":9,"date":"9 June 1999","review":"This horror movie is not only good, it's actually better than the original.  It's an exceptional blend of horror and comedy.  Be sure to watch for Kurt when he's in the van with Marsha Brady and when he's playing basketball back at Hull House.  The demon effects were well done and the scenery was very eerie.  As opposed to part one, the good guys in this one have supersoakers and holy waterballoons to fight Angela's unholy thugs. There is also an interesting story to follow involving Melissa, the sister of demon Angela.  This is a great late-night horror movie to watch with friends.  Rent this one, but by all means, stay away from part 3.","user":"Atchka","rank":[12,18]}]
