[{"title":"Entertaining!","rating":7,"date":"11 October 2006","review":"If you enjoy off the wall humor, and have a fondness for 60's nostalgia, you will like this movie (in my opinion). I found the film to be good-natured, a bit silly in spots, and touched with a slightly warped sense of humor that held my attention for the relatively short run-time. I just wish that Cher had a larger role in this one, but, I guess (at the time), Sonny was considered the real \"talent.\" Granted, Sonny can't sing very well (especially so when compared to Cher), however, he seems to be having a \"good time\" making the movies within the movie. The Western spoof is especially entertaining.<br><br>This is a guilty pleasure movie. It amused me, made me smile a few times, and that is enough for me to recommend it!","user":"bscell","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Great soundtrack, weak flick...","rating":4,"date":"9 December 2005","review":"Pop-singing duo (and mod-dressed lovebirds) Sonny &amp; Cher are tapped to star in their own movie, but the couple are distressed over the corny script. Sonny Bono's soundtrack to \"Good Times\", which he produced and arranged (impeccably so), sounds like the very best of Phil Spector; the songs may give non-fans a glimpse at true musical genius. Unfortunately, all this aural greatness comes at the expense of a wayward, throw-away feature. Sonny &amp; Cher spend most of their time on-screen bickering in a too-real example of marital discord. Debuting director William Friedkin stuffs the proceedings with eye-candy, but he can't get any momentum going in the fantasy scenes and they just peter out. It's a strenuous comedy, the biggest mistake of which was to plunk the leads down in the middle of so much unhappiness. They don't want to make the movie, they're being forced to make the movie, they fight about compromising their ideals about making the damn movie. Only the opening and closing montages are sunny, the rest is much too heavy--even with all that groovy music in the background. ** from ****","user":"moonspinner55","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"GOOD TIMES, okay movie","rating":28,"date":"28 July 1999","review":"This is the starring debut for Sonny and Cher (their screen debut being WILD ON THE BEACH).  It is a hodge-podge of Sonny's fantasies of a movie-star career and Cher's not wanting to have any part of it (a carry-over from real life... ironic, huh?)  It has one of their best songs DON'T TALK TO STRANGERS, and Sonny's comedy timing is surprisingly good.  They could have done a lot better with a real script, I feel, but it WAS 1967...","user":"DenBoy-3","rank":[6,7]}]
