What a huge mistake...","user":"lucioomalves","rank":[20,27]},{"title":"Interesting movie...","rating":8,"date":"6 September 2019","review":"Not really much of a horror, a slow burn suspense maybe? Either way, the acting is solid and the characters believable. The costumes and settings have an authentic feel. I found the soundtrack fitting. Not much happens until the end, they take their time letting you get to know the characters. With little things happening here or there... Just enough for you to know that things are just not quite right. Overall I personally found it an enjoyable movie but maybe not the movie for hardcore horror or action fans. If you can appreciate slower paced movies with a historic setting then give it a chance. Props given for the mixture of genre ... A zombie, viking movie... who knew! Lol.... Not much in the way of zombies through most of it, mainly the last 20 mins or so. So once again I am saying that if you do not do well sitting through slow paced movies then this one probably is not for you. For those that are ok with that then definitely give it a shot.","user":"Wikkid_Gamez","rank":[40,61]},{"title":"Stay away, Not worth your time!!!","rating":1,"date":"14 October 2019","review":"Funny when the Swedish people try to play Vikings after Norways Norsemen vikings serie. This was so B-movie as it gets. Boring as hell. Drama movie.","user":"daropaz","rank":[13,17]}]
