[{"title":"Quite accurate","rating":7,"date":"9 May 2019","review":"The movie is told from the detective's perspective so plays mostly as a police procedural. It is an accurate rendition of the events, but often plays like a made-for-tv movie and shies away from the grizzly details. I recommend it to people familiar with the Green River case or people looking to learn more about it as it follows the real timeline quite closely.","user":"freddycomingforyou","rank":[27,36]},{"title":"Creepy performances","rating":6,"date":"7 May 2019","review":"The movie plays mostly like an old TV cop show following the main detective and FBI guy as they hunt down the Green River Killer and talk about serial killing. Most of the facts of the real case are followed closely but if you are aware of the true story it makes the film fairly predictable with few surprises. The best part of the movie is the performances by the actors playing Bundy and Ridgway. Both are very creepy and their scenes are by far the best parts of this movie.","user":"chrisowen-70253","rank":[28,38]},{"title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!","rating":1,"date":"10 May 2019","review":"Great concept. Horrible low budget production with the worse actors on the planet that sound like they're reading straight from cue cards.\nThis reminds me of Gravitas Adventures junk movies that they attempt to make.\nDo not waste your time.","user":"firballblaze-69689","rank":[26,35]}]
