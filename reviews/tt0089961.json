[{"title":"Something to be proud of","rating":5,"date":"5 January 2006","review":"I played one of the elves in the movie. When Santa &amp; Anya are shown the Elf Village for the first time &amp; watch all the toy-making, Patch (the late Dudley More) &amp; a small group of \"elf musicians\" are seen \"playing\" the music. Watch out for me at the top of an \"elvish double-bass\". The movie was available on DVD in the UK &amp; I purchased a copy, having not seen it since it's release. I think it's a lovely Christmas film that deserved greater critical acclaim than it received. I'm glad to see that it is now becoming something of a cult movie, which should ensure it's existence for many years to come. Having viewed the movie this year (2016), I feel proud to have made a small contribution to a film that tells a timeless story with considerable integrity. David Huddleston who passed away recently was the perfect casting for Santa Claus.","user":"nigelpaterson","rank":[27,27]},{"title":"Pure enjoyment","rating":9,"date":"13 December 2004","review":"Me thinks folks protest too much! Sit back, relax and enjoy this cute little movie. The plot is good. The actors do a very nice job of \"being\" their characters. Villains are vile and heroes are worthy. There is a continual ebb and flow with who is winning, good or evil. Good wins over evil. The scenery is is beautiful and fanciful. The effects are nifty and somewhat corny. What more could one ask for a short period of fantasy flight from the cares of the world? Don't worry about fitting it into today's \"problems with society section.\" Avoid seeing discussions of drug problems, violence in the world, sex in the city. Don't consider deep, hidden meanings. Just have some popcorn, turn down the lights, get into your comfy chair and enjoy yourself. This is a movie made for the cold winter nights.","user":"drdan4c","rank":[54,59]},{"title":"A magical movie","rating":4,"date":"4 December 2004","review":"I don't care who you are, this movie is a fun and magical experience for all ages. The actors are superb in their roles and their songs and characters will win your heart.<br><br>This movie may have been filmed almost 20 years ago but it still carries the message today that it did then. That Christmas should be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of creed, colour or persuasion. I defy anyone, who actually HAS a heart, not to like this movie. I first saw it when I was 3 years old and to this day, I have watched it every year thereafter on Christmas eve.<br><br>To me, this film holds the very feeling of Christmas. All you need do is watch it. And no matter where you are, no matter what time of year it is, from start to finish...<br><br>it's Christmas.","user":"Jody_Buchan","rank":[55,62]}]
