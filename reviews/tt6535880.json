And the other typical idiot move \"Hey I just killed a bad guy, go me, (looks at weapon) not gonna need this anymore\", next room, \"oh no another bad guy, if only I had a weapon to use against them!\"","user":"danwilberforce","rank":[77,99]},{"title":"Scream, blood, gore","rating":7,"date":"28 November 2019","review":"Well, it's not the perfect first-date movie, as it may happen that your beloved would hold you in her arms when you are sucking your thumb crying. :-)\nWell, I gave 7* because I think, the actual rating of 6.3 is too low, but I also fell 7* is a bit of exaggeration.\nWhat I was missing: more understanding of the story, less dumbdumb villains, less plotholes.\nBut who knows, you'll see a sequel or a prequel and you will have the chance to learn more about the Devil, the Witch, the Clown, the Ghost and the Zombie. :-)\nFor a horror movie, this is quite decent, refreshing, well-done!","user":"iknowhwoyouare","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"Nothing New Here But the Faces!","rating":5,"date":"15 March 2020","review":"A typical Halloween scare movie about a group of friends who gets into a haunted house and end up being haunted.<br><br>The movie is a very slow burner yet it does not treat the viewers at the end with anything fresh or satisfying, the idea of being haunted on Halloween itself is redundant and over used, Moreover, what can roughly be called a twist in the killers choice doesn't exceed what meets the eyes. Sadly yet as expected you can know who will survive from the beginning of the movie! The acting, directing, atmosphere fails to add any memorable moments and conclude with only a killing time experience that will be quickly forgotten.","user":"Impartial-Critic","rank":[32,40]}]
