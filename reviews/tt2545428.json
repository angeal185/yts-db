[{"title":"A Rousing Answer to the Question: Why do They Climb?","rating":10,"date":"6 October 2015","review":"The inherent drama of men and mountains has spurred in recent years a glut of TV and film that has blossomed with the technological advancements of our time and the \"look at me\" attitude pervading society so that everyone with a Go-Pro can film their adventures for the world to see. From Youtube channels of independent climbers filming their routes to big money TV shows that bring the adventurers' lives to our living rooms, the world of mountain climbing and adventure sports in general seems caught in contradictions. Always underlying the contradictions is the simple question of why? Do these individuals risk life and limb for their fame, for sponsors, for a TV deal or out of a unique personal desire and will that drives them into the wild.<br><br>The British climber George Mallory who died while attempting Everest back in the 1920s famously responded to the question of Why? with \"because it is there\". For the next 100 years, many climbers have tried to give better answers, and in Meru, we have a compelling combination of narrative and visual imagery that may result in the best answer of all. <br><br>The narrative stands apart from other films and documentaries in that it is not completely linear and veers off course to give the viewers appropriate back stories to inject meaning and under currents to the climbers' motivations. You get to know the climbers as people, and with that understanding, I think it becomes easier for anyone, including people who have never set foot on a snowy ledge, to understand why these people climb mountains. <br><br>The technical climbing is filmed by Jimmy Chin (both climber and film director) in a way that I have simply never seen before. As a climbing enthusiast, the shots of these guys on the walls of ice and rock are astounding, gut-wrenching and for me, completely inspiring. The organic relationship of the climbing team, their histories and ultimately their trials on the snow and rock of Meru expand on many common mountaineering themes - mentors, sponsors, risk analysis and contemplating death both yours and your friends. <br><br>Jon Krakauer is not my favorite voice in this world, but he is a voice that is adept at translating the mountaineering world to laymen, and his role in this film is served well. In the end, I strongly recommend this film for everyone. For those that can understand the motivation to be the first to stand atop a peak, you will not be disappointed. For those that can not understand the motivation, you might walk away finally getting it.","user":"ericjams","rank":[50,54]},{"title":"As breathtaking as the real altitude climb.","rating":9,"date":"8 November 2015","review":"Appreciate Meru, for it is rare that a documentary, or movie in general, able to bring audience in such inspiringly immersive journey. This is more than just a trip to the titular location, it's a private real life struggle of the climbers which we as viewers may not fully understand, yet it's presented with incredible honesty and amazing visual spectacle.<br><br>The documentary spans across many years of the climbers' lives, including all the trials and tribulations they must endure. There's myriad of behind-the-scene video making involved as well as testimony of friends and families. Everything is done with polished approach and this honest nature welcomes audience even if they're not into mountaineering.<br><br>What's great about this is how they talk about the darkest days in very professional manner. Having to describe one's own intimate fear and life altering experience can't be easy, however the filmmakers still present them with composure. It is rarely that they are emotional when delivering the narrative, even if it's involving a very personal subject, yet the appreciation for the extreme sport and the determination are highly riveting. It also displays the hazard strikingly well one can't help being absorbed in their excursion.<br><br>The rest of it doesn't even need words as the documentary captures beautifully taxing landscape. It offers so much clarity before and during the climb itself, from the preparation, trip in the cities before to the physically exhausting climb. There is no five minutes spent without scenery worthy of being wallpapers or posters.<br><br>Meru is a visually stunning journey accompanied by brave and inspiring fellows. It is more than most movies wish they could convey.","user":"quincytheodore","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"Boy, did I choose the right movie tonight!","rating":9,"date":"5 September 2015","review":"I went with my family to the ol' picture shows, since it was Friday and all, and they all went to see the new Transporter: Refueled. I told them that I was definitely not going to see something as poorly made, regardless of how much I loved the first three (as an effing kid). So, I was limited to a certain amount of movies since theirs started at 10:30 PM, I had to see one as well around 10:00. I looked up the show times; last viewing of Bloodsucking Bastards was at 9:00 so I thought I was screwed. Then suddenly, I came across a new film I haven't even heard of called MERU.<br><br>This film literally put me through a whole mountain-climbing experience. I LOVED it so much in fact! I could not decide at first if I was going to rate this with 3.5 stars or 4. Even at one point I got to thinking it might stoop down to a 2.5 (shh), but it had its comebacks and moments that will remain stuck in my mind for probably all eternity.<br><br>Meru is about a team of climbers who want to be the first to top off the great Mount Meru in India (I believe..). Guiding this mission is a man named Conrad Anker, who I think presents himself as a great leader. Though, he definitely has that crazy, adrenaline-junky-look in his eyes, he is also smarter than you think. To aid him are two of his longtime friends whom he has accompanied throughout his travels/expeditions. Their names are Jimmy Ching, who is the sort of younger, optimist of the group, and Renan Ozturk, who basically is the weakling in the group; // doesn't stop him though.<br><br>I actually noticed how this documentary was organized in three acts, and it's funny because whatever I thought the movie was going to be about was ALL in the first act. Silly me! This film has twists and turns and though you may not get the best of footage, the (true) story is what counts. // There is also breathtaking camera shots; I love seeing a wide open mountain range; makes me feel like I can finally breath.<br><br>One of my favorite aspects of this film was the character development. And I know, how can you say that about a documentary? Well, this one has it! Especially, Renan who started out as the most annoying/bitchy character and turns into... well I don't want to ruin it.<br><br>This adventure was UNPREDICTABLE and EDGY. Especially around the third act, you will be bitting your nails. This is the kind of story that makes you understand more of the human psychology - facing your fears - With FRIENDSHIP and FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS. // Also, they speak highly of \"praising to the teachers\"; Learning from others and passing on the experience/skills. That is how things get done in this world. It also presents how many people come to finally accomplishing their dreams. // GOALS, PEOPLE! You gotta push yourself.<br><br>I liked how I had a point of view on things after walking out of the theater. I said to myself, \"Huh, maybe FEAR is a good thing after-all.\"<br><br>-- Michael Mendez","user":"mmendez-22089","rank":[36,41]}]
