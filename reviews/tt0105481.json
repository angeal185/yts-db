[{"title":"More going for it than you might think","rating":11,"date":"11 July 2002","review":"Dolly starts out working at a dance hall but gets fired by her boss (played by John Sayles) and is sick of her abusive boyfriend (Michael Madsen) so she leaves for Chicago with his bowling ball.  <br><br>Through a highly improbable set of circumstances, she becomes a radio 'therapist'; it comes easy to her since she's thoughtful, has common sense and some down-home charm.  Soon she has a national following as 'Dr. Shirley.'<br><br>Soon she has James Woods' reporter following her around.  He smells a story and thinks she might be a fake but cannot prove it.  He also falls for her. <br><br>\nComedy is supplied by Griffin Dunne's maniac/radio station exec, a very funny scene with Dr. Shirley on a talk show, and the chemistry between James Woods &amp; Dolly Parton, two actors you might not think of in the same galaxy but who work together very well.  <br><br>Small movie has a lot going for it.  7/10.","user":"Boyo-2","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"Delightful piece of fluff","rating":8,"date":"17 July 2003","review":"Some might dismiss this as a \"feel good\" movie and indeed it is. But it's a lot of fun and a bright vehicle for the always delightful and vivacious (bodaceous?) Dolly Parton. Sure, the plot is predictable from the first scene. But there are a lot of laughs and good moments on the way to the trite happy ending. But the measure of a movie is whether you enjoy it and this is a wonderfully honest and enjoyable picture.","user":"rps-2","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"Dolly Is Great","rating":10,"date":"25 August 2003","review":"I totally loved this movie. Dolly has been a favorite of mine ever seen I seen her in \"9 To 5.\" She's just amazing. After watching this movie for the first time about two months ago I went out and bought a copy. I consider is a classic and will always love it. The movie alone is a role model.","user":"dbell8400","rank":[17,22]}]
