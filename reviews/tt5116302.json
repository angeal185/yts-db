I watched this film with my 11 year old daughter and we were both struggling to keep the tears ðŸ˜­ from falling. At the end my daughter was crying cause it was so touching. A REAL movie to watch!","user":"Cylac","rank":[164,180]},{"title":"Fantastic! Absolutely fantastic!!","rating":9,"date":"21 December 2019","review":"This is the first time that I think Walt Disney Picture did a great job on this amazing movie. A movie that deserves to be called \"Mission Impossible!\" Willem Dafoe and Julianne Nicholson both are great. The screenplay writer Tom Flynn gave us a straightforward plot, simple but amazing scenario that has made this movie so suspenseful, thrilling, at the same time, profound. Director Ericson Core also won my praise wholeheartedly. The special effects team did a wonder too, many scenes I just couldn't believe possible to make, but they just looked so real and so powerful. The crossing lake scenes are just ridiculously fascinating. The leading dog's performance is just beyond any word could describe, and the poppy that played Togo's younger age would allow you to understand what \"cute\" really means. Willem Dafoe, what a great actor! Julianne Nicholson, her natural talent completely shinning through the whole movie. Every part of this movie is a fulfilled perfection, it also owes to the great casting job, through the lens of the camera, offering you great cinematography, followed by a perfect editing job....The almost impossible mission, the dogs, the great couple and the great town people...all together, have made this movie THE VERY BEST MOVIE at the year end of 2019.<br><br>Highly recommended!","user":"Bad-Good-Great","rank":[139,157]},{"title":"Great","rating":10,"date":"2 January 2020","review":"Willem Dafoe and a bunch of adorable sled dogs star in this heartwarming, action packed new movie based on a true story...
