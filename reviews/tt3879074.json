[{"title":"Tom Green As A Dean","rating":5,"date":"25 November 2016","review":"A fraternity has some celebration fireworks accidentally set fire to their house resulting in the dean kicking them out. A year later one of the pledges tries to get them reinstated, but then has only five days to find 15 candidates. Constant sabotages from a rival fraternity doesn't help as they both compete for the same house. Of course all this happens in between lots of sex and parties.<br><br>This was a funny one, probably a step up from a National Lampoon offering. Tom Green was funny as the dean in which he plays his usual whacked out self.<br><br>There is no life changing moments in this one but just a simple shut your mind off and have a laugh, kind of film.","user":"shawnblackman","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"Total frat movie","rating":10,"date":"23 September 2016","review":"Just read the reviews Are you kidding?? Everybody's a movie critic and they should just back off and have some fun. <br><br>If you want to go out for a fun night on the town and relax and laugh this is the movie to watch. The cast was great, the girls were beautiful, and it reminded me of the fun we used to have in college. The Dean of the University is hysterical Couldn't stop laughing at his antics. The cast even looked like they were having a good time filming it.<br><br>Guys, get your buddies together and go for a fun night out . <br><br>A chill out for those poor reviews. I pity your boring lives.","user":"mescdds","rank":[15,37]},{"title":"A Good Comedy","rating":7,"date":"3 December 2018","review":"At first I was a bit sceptical about this film but its a good film with some really funny scenes. Its refreshing to have a film about college that has some funny new concepts unlike any other films about student life.","user":"theoriginalalen","rank":[1,1]}]
