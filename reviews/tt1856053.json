[{"title":"Typical sequel","rating":19,"date":"19 November 2012","review":"I quite liked the first Niko movie. It had decent animation, great characters, original idea and a storyline that managed to keep me invested and then some. I've seen it once or twice since and solidified my opinion: it's more than decent Christmas movie, not a classic, but still enjoyable and kid-friendly. I'd happily recommend it to all families.<br><br>And then there's the sequel, which follows the traditional way of offering more of the same, sans the novelty. In this case Niko is once again being forced to play the rule of a headstrong child with short temper and no patience whatsoever. It's a common cliché that the main character in a sequel seems to have learned nothing from his previous adventure, and this is true here as well, which is immensely aggravating. And when the storyline pretty much mirrors the previous film, this film can pretty much kiss goodbye to being as good as the original.<br><br>Luckily the film makers got a few things right. I complain about Niko having learnt nothing, but there's the mitigating factor that he's still a kid, so he still has lots of learning to do. He should have learnt at least something, though. The rest of the cast though remains pretty much the same. They're not amazing, but they're solid. The same with animation. Nothing groundbreaking, but it looks good, though a bit uneven, as numerous studios were involved in the process, so the quality wavers a bit from time to time.<br><br>The biggest problem is the story. It's just not as good as the first one, mostly because they tried to recycle the same plot, but with different enemies, which rarely works. There's a subplot concerning Niko's new stepbrother, but it's also very tired and clichéd. Not horrible, per se, but not very good either. You can pretty much guess how it'll go from the first minute of it.<br><br>So that's this film. It's nothing spectacular, if anything it's a bit below average, but it's harmless fun and it's not going to hurt or upset your kids. It's over an hour's worth of semi-decent family entertainment. If you can, watch the first one, as it is much better, but this will do in a pinch.","user":"Vartiainen","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"generally speaking, sequels aren't as good as the originals. but this sequel might be an exception","rating":8,"date":"29 August 2013","review":"now, i really did enjoy \"Niko and the Way to the Stars\", i thought it was really cute, funny and endearing, and Finland really knows how to make lovable animated movies. okay, the story was a little bit predictable cause we've seen it basically over 100 times before. but overall, it was still a really cute movie.<br><br>\"Niko 2: Little Brother, Big Trouble\" is the sequel to the movie and it follows the story of Niko, who knows how to fly now. but he finds out his mom Oona's gonna get married with another reindeer (not Prancer, Niko's real dad). so now, he's gonna have to look after Jonni, his little stepbrother. but problem is, they hate each other like a lot. then, Jonni gets kidnapped by eagles who work for White Wolf, Black Wolf's sister. She wants revenge on Niko for her older brother's death. now, it's up to Niko, Julius, Wilma and Tobias to save Jonni, defeat White Wolf and go back home.<br><br>yeah, we all know that sequels usually aren't as good as the originals. usually sequels can really screw up and leave everybody booo-ing. but luckily \"Niko 2\" isn't one of em! even if the story's familiar, \"Niko 2\" was even cuter and more endearing than the original. i'm surprised that i liked this one a little more than the original. it had good animation and great comedy. i laughed in this movie more, it had good comedic timing. there wasn't any part in \"Niko 2\" where i was laughing so hard that i was like crying. that never happened, but still a really funny sequel. and a couple of times in the movie, i was like \"i'm tearing up\". like i said earlier, it was endearing and it did the job pretty good.<br><br>so, u might find the story a little familiar and predictable, but in the end \"Niko 2\" was a fun sequel with good animation, good comedic timing, lovable characters, and it was cute and endearing. if u have little kids and if you're bored, take your kids to this movie. i promise, you'll have a good time.<br><br>9/10","user":"nikozguri","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"An enjoyable and visually great animated film.","rating":8,"date":"8 December 2015","review":"This has recently been on SKY movies in the UK under the name 'The Magic Reindeer'. <br><br>It follows a young reindeer who is searching for his brother who has been kidnapped. It's a fairly standard tale but is illuminated by some good characters and some gorgeous animation. Unlike many animated tales we are thankfully spared any really annoying characters. <br><br>There are some genuinely funny moments to go with the usual animated adventure. Rather surprisingly for an animation it does cover the issue of parent separation which I found a bit strange in a children's film, however I don't necessarily think this is a bad idea. <br><br>I really enjoyed this film and more importantly so did my children who are after all the target audience. An animated film that deserves a wider audience.","user":"MattyGibbs","rank":[3,4]}]
