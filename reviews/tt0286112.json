[{"title":"Kickful of comedy","rating":10,"date":"21 June 2002","review":"KUNG FU + SOCCER = lots of laughs!!<br><br>Funny funny funny.  And that's coming from a non-soccer fan.<br><br>Great performances here in this blend of comedy and high flying soccer action.  Stephen Chow as Sing packs one hell of a kick!!  His chemistry with Ng Man Tat (Golden Leg) is natural as it is in most of their films together. Plus, Sing's Shaolin brothers provide for a lot of comic relief!!  From their soccer training to the championship game, there are really cool kung fu soccer shots, a mix of Matrix/Crouch Tiger special effects and it delivers.  Oh, and Vicki Zhao literally steals this in the end (you have to see it).<br><br>The Bruce Lee goalie scene is priceless.  This movie can definitely be watched several times with even more satisfaction!","user":"InzyWimzy","rank":[84,95]},{"title":"Best sports comedy ever?","rating":10,"date":"4 November 2004","review":"Wow, I was really surprised by this movie. It is totally unique, I've never seen anything else like it. There is a very charming love story, and the effects are really cool. The idea of combining kung fu with soccer is very original.... even though it's so bizarre, you'll find yourself asking why nobody has done anything like this before. I laughed constantly throughout this movie and went out and bought it a few days after I first saw it. <br><br>I would recommend it to everyone I know. This is the best Asian comedy since the heyday of Jackie Chan and \"Fighting Benny\"! Go see it, buy it, whatever, just make sure you do see this film.<br><br>I would be surprised if there is not a sequel. This film should have been released theatrically in the US; I've heard Miramax handled it. Sorry guys you lost millions of dollars, this film would have been a smash hit. They probably just didn't think that soccer would sell in America, but word of mouth would have sold this movie very well.","user":"funkyfry","rank":[125,148]},{"title":"Amazing!!","rating":9,"date":"17 June 2004","review":"Or: the funniest movie I've seen this decade! I was expecting a moderate little asian comedy worthy about an IMDB 7 TOPS, but at the end, I was forced to give this 9 points! See, no other comedy has actually brought me to tears laughing in recent history! Either mr. Chow is a genius or he's one lucky sonova. See, \"Shaolin soccer\" just happens to press all the right buttons, and in right places! In the little \"relief\" spots it's as dramatic as it's supposed to be, and the rest, it's big, big, BIG laughs all the way. HIGHLY recommended! P.S. If you don't like this movie, your heart must be made of stone and you have absolutely NO sense of humour. My condolences.","user":"SPaS","rank":[125,151]}]
