[{"title":"It's all about the dialogue","rating":9,"date":"5 February 2005","review":"Kevin Smith has delved into action (\"Mallrats\"), drama (\"Chasing Amy\") and philosophy (\"Dogma\") in his Askewniverse, but Clerks, the first film of the series, is still the best.<br><br>Shot on a ridiculously low budget, using mostly friends and relatives as the cast and crew (see the line in the credits where \"Boom\" is credited as \"whoever happened to be holding the pole\"), \"Clerks\" is such a great film just because it doesn't try to be more than it is. You get the sense that this movie is in black and white not to be pretentious, but just because it's a prosaic look at prosaic lives.<br><br>Kevin Smith's real gift is writing funny, witty dialogue, and that's what carries this film. From Star Wars debates (did the destruction of the second Death Star in \"Jedi\" cost innocent contractors their lives?) to perfectly serious debates about sex (\"Thirty-seven???\"), this is the ultimate movie for anyone who's ever been going nowhere and doing nothing. It's a day in the life of the guy working at the corner store, no more, no less. But it's absolutely brilliant.<br><br>People either love or hate Kevin Smith movies. Chances are, if you can appreciate the humour of low-brow jokes about pornography as high art, then you'll enjoy \"Clerks\". His brand of humour isn't for everyone. This is his first film and it's flawed, to be sure. But in my humble opinion, it's still Smith's best.","user":"segacs","rank":[227,254]},{"title":"A witty, hilariously profane cult picture","rating":10,"date":"15 October 2006","review":"Clerks is one of those movies everyone knows everything about even before they've seen it. The most fascinating aspect is probably the back-story: Kevin Smith sold his comic-book collection to finance it, shot it in the convenience store where he was working at the time, and cast his school friends in the various roles (two of them wound up playing three or four characters each). The film became a huge hit at Sundance, and is now widely (and justly) considered one of the best independent movies of all time.<br><br>The plot is quite easy to sum up: nothing happens. It's just a \"regular\" day in the lives of a few people working in or outside a Quick Stop convenience store. The fun starts immediately, as Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is asked to replace a sick colleague. This upsets him a lot, since it's supposed to be his day off (\"You know what the worst part is? I'm not even supposed to BE here today!\"). So now he has to serve a bunch of rather annoying or excessively weird people, with occasional help from his friend Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson), who \"works\" in the video store next to Quick Stop. Together, they discuss things like hermaphroditic porn or, Tarantino-style, which Star Wars sequel is better (Jedi or Empire?), and also try to find ways of not working, or at least make the day less boring (as Randal puts it:\"This job would be great if it wasn't for the f**king customers\"). Between these discussions, they also interact with Dante's present girlfriend Veronica (whose sex life causes heated debates) and ex Caitlin, who's apparently engaged to some Asian design major. And let's not forget Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith himself), two drug dealers consistently located outside the store.<br><br>Smith uses these characters to reference his favorite movies (the previously mentioned Star Wars, as well as Jaws and Indiana Jones) and talk about any subject in the filthiest way imaginable. Some incredibly outrageous stuff is mentioned (\"jizz moppers\", necrophilia, \"snowballing\"), but unlike John Waters, he never shows the events discussed by Dante, Randal et al. Everything occurs, or has occurred, off-screen, so all we get to do is have a good laugh, because no matter how crude it gets (the film is rated R for \"Extensive Use Of Extremely Explicit Sex-Related Dialogue\"), Smith's writing remains genuinely funny. Randal, in particular, steals every scene with his existential musings (\"I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class. Especially since I rule.\") or very politically incorrect antics (the top? Reading a list of pornographic flicks in front of a mother and her baby).<br><br>If you haven't seen it yet, do it, and fast: Clerks fully deserves its cult status. It has priceless dialogue, wisecracking characters and loads of swearing. What else can you ask for?","user":"MaxBorg89","rank":[63,75]},{"title":"My favorite comedy","rating":22,"date":"22 June 1999","review":"This has to be my all time favorite comedy and one of my all time favorites overall. About three years ago a friend of mine came to school one day raving about the funniest movie he had seen on late night. He talked about this black and white low budget movie about two blue collar losers who talked endlessly about sex. From that description I wasn't anticipating a masterpiece but I decided to rent it anyway. It was probably the best surprise I have ever had. I was laughing the entire time, so much so that I nearly woke up everyone in my house. For months afterwards my friend and I would endlessly talk about and quote this incredible film. Everyone I have recommended it to has loved it and I can easily see why. I know that some people attack the movie as being vulgar and excessive. The way I see it it is being true to life (I'm sure that when you have 10 hours to kill you'll talk about the average pay of a gizz mopper). In short I absolutely love this film and it gets better and better with every viewing. Rent this film as soon as possible if you haven't already.","user":"Nedward","rank":[113,145]}]
