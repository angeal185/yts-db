[{"title":"The worst movie I saw in years","rating":1,"date":"10 December 2019","review":"It feels like it was written by a 13 year old boy. Very naive assumptions of how criminals and even how people in general behave. It's really hard to believe or relate to anything in this movie.","user":"genovevas","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"You are not fit to be a gangster.","rating":8,"date":"17 July 2018","review":"Izabela (Olga Boladz) is a police woman who thinks outside of the box. This causes her to be terminated by one police department and hired in Poland. Her assignment is to get close to someone in the mafia (attracts him as a pole dancer) as they are exporting cocaine (actually was meth) to Sweden. The mafia family has its own issues and like a Russian novel, it builds a lot of characters. Things quickly evolve to where a nanny (Agnieszka Dygant) takes control. The film has its twists which develop slowly and are not sudden. <br><br>It is 2 1/2 hours long. A good crime drama if you don't mind the subtitles. <br><br>Guide: F-word, sex, nudity, rape.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Pretty rough","rating":8,"date":"17 November 2018","review":"A movie like this can only be made in Poland. It is bloody and funny and ugly and the story is always surprising.","user":"christophjanetzko","rank":[4,9]}]
