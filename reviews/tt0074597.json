[{"title":"The film that best captures the pure joy of open-road driving.","rating":18,"date":"18 June 2000","review":"So, you've just spent thousands of dollars on a new home entertainment center and you want to take it for a spin around the block... what movie do you watch?  'Gumball Rally' would be a lovely choice.  It's pure simple fun filled with raw visceral sights and sounds.  Leave the serious films till later, this one will make you feel you've gotten your money's worth. Capturing the heart and soul of the real life \"Cannonball Baker Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash\" of the '70s, it's the tale of an unofficial, illegal, recurring race from New York to Los Angeles... anything goes.  And what goes?  Lapchick, the Mad Hungarian, trying to spend 36 hours non-stop on a motorcycle; a van filled with hundreds of gallons of fuel so they don't have to delay for fuel stops; Raul Julia as the Italian race driver Franco and his famous first rule of Italian driving.  And in that over-filmed concrete gully known as the LA River there is the BEST sequence ever shot there when a Ferrari Daytona duels with a 427 Cobra... they didn't rely simply on trick shots and undercranked cameras, often the cars were really driven to their limits.  Forget the later, far inferior 'Cannonball' movies; the 'Gumball' people actually knew their cars, and they'll have you craving a powerful engine, a full tank of gas, and the open road.","user":"roarshock","rank":[37,37]},{"title":"The True Purpose of the Movie","rating":8,"date":"6 February 2006","review":"I remember articles about the movie when it was still being shot. It was supposed to be a light hearted romp across the country with the cars being the stars. With that in mind, it succeeds greatly. My son and I have watched the \"Garage Scene\" over and over again. This movie is to car nuts what a porno is to sex nuts. It's hard to believe you can indulge yourself this much in front of the family without feeling guilty. :^) <br><br>Also, I've read a few of the comments and would like to make corrections here. The transmission in the Cobra (yes it was a real 427 Cobra) was a four speed \"Toploader\" transmission, not a 5 speed Tremec. There were no replica Cobras in those days. Also, the Ferrari was a 365 GTS/4. I also remember reading that the first Ferrari rented for the movie was totaled and they had to get another to take its place. However, that was over 30 years ago.","user":"i002492","rank":[23,26]},{"title":"Best of the genre","rating":7,"date":"19 March 2008","review":"Upon first view.. one will chuckle at the 70's production value in the opening sequence.<br><br>Get past that.<br><br>Gumball is the best of the cross-country race genre. Much better than any film in the Cannonball series. Why? For one...It's just as funny. Filled with some great lines and chock full of fantastic car sequences. Turning the speakers up may make it sound like you are at a Busch race. Raul Julia steals the show as far as the characters. Every moment that he's on the screen you'll have a smile from ear to ear.<br><br>\"55 is unsafe....it's slow enough to make you think you're safe....but it's fast enough to kill you\" Many scenes were shot at breathtaking speeds WITH THE ACTUAL ACTORS....this really adds to the realism... and overall, every car sequence is eye-popping. Where the 70's production value detracts from the film in the opening sequence....it actually helps in others...like when it adds a lightheartedness to the absolutely awesome downstretch in the waterways with the music....and of course the cars making music to automobile fans...Ferrari Daytona zipping....427 cobra roaring... steam from the water flying off the engine block.<br><br>The actors had fun making this one...and I had fun watching...all 20 some odd times.<br><br>shhhhhhhh..... ..........GUMBALL! 71/100","user":"witster18","rank":[18,20]}]
