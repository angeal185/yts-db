[{"title":"A nice \"halloweeny\" movie for 8 - 12yo's","rating":8,"date":"15 October 2017","review":"A fun movie with that halloween vibe for 8 - 12yo's, especially girls - my daughter liked it a lot. <br><br>Nice lo-budget film, decent effects and it's fun to watch. <br><br>With a bigger budget, who knows - a future Disney channel TV-series? Would work I think. A fun idea someone had.","user":"mijansso","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Tokusatsu for the kids","rating":7,"date":"29 August 2017","review":"A \"Tokusatsu\" film is a Japanese genre, such as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. It is filled with over the top imagery, puppet creatures, characters growing in size, etc. And yes. it is aimed at kids! This is a great Tokusatsu-inspired movie that will appeal to the 10 - 15 age group. The characters are sassy, the one liners are cute and funny, the story is exciting and the puppet-monsters are quite creepy.<br><br>If you understand that this film is NOT aimed at adults, you'll actually have a lot of fun watching it. It's a great way to introduce your kids to movies involving monsters and magic and villains...and I promise that you'll get as much of a kick out of this film as they do!","user":"tattoopig","rank":[7,15]},{"title":"Awful.","rating":1,"date":"27 August 2017","review":"This is the crap you end up with when an amateur video movie TRIES to be funny. Cartoon sound effects when someone notices something??? People looking at each other, as the \"joke\". Its just TERRIBLE. A child could direct better than this. Was it a child who directed it? Was this it aimed at children? It didn't say, but that's how it seemed. Starts with a trailer trash guy, waiting for a witch, to summon a spirit of some girl. The plot is not really explained that well, but the \"witch\" turns up with a semi dwarf... who has to be handed everything, to excuse him being in the scene. Its (all) just AWFUL. If it was some sort of tax write off, one would understand it. Compare it to another movie? OK, its WORSE than the brain numbing \"Police Academy\" movies, and that says it all.","user":"icelandknight","rank":[7,15]}]
