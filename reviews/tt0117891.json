[{"title":"Comedy with a surprisingly evil and sinister twist.","rating":8,"date":"29 June 1999","review":"A Thin Line Between Love And Hate is a very solid movie production job from Martin Lawrence. The film provides a nice mix of drama and comedy. The story line revolves around Darnell (Martin Lawrence) Brandi (Lynn Whitfield) and Mia (Regina King). Darnell is a ladies man who thinks he says all the right things to the ladies. He runs across Brandi and makes a bet with his buddy Tee (Bobby Brown) that he would have sex with her once he gets to know her. Eventually he gets his chance and hits paydirt with Brandi sexually. Brandi was hurt before by her cheating husband and holds brutal grudges for \"womanizing\" men (She killed her ex husband after finding him in bed with another women) As her relationship with Darnell develops she warns him that she is not the type of woman to be hurt and taken advantage of. The Producer does a good job of bringing along Darnel's rekindling relationship with ex flame Mia. Somehow you feel that Darnel and Mia's future relationship holds promise despite Darnel's flirtatious ways. Some of the things that happen to Darnel because of his womanizing ways you feel are justified but Brandi is out for serious revenge. Brandi inflicts injury to herself and convinces police that Darnel is the perpetrator, she leaves his Truck on bricks outside of a police station, she stops at nothing. Darnel calls off his relationship with Mia due to threats by Brandi that she would hurt Mia. Determined to settle the score once and for all he goes to Brandi beautiful estate overlooking the Pacific....<br><br>&gt; Thin Line Between Love And Hate was much better than I thought it would be. The movie definitely is funny but also provides plenty of drama. Lynn Whitfield is ever convincing in her role as Brandi, her piercing eyes slamming a knife down wickedly into her birthday cake is a scene worth remembering. What adds greatly to the movie is the fact that everything is centered around a nightclub which adds a certain feel and environment. This is a movie that is better than you would think. A definite thumbs up 8/10 on the scale.","user":"macnjnc","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Hilarious, witty, sexy, suspenseful, and totally beautiful!","rating":9,"date":"17 November 2005","review":"In my opinion, A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE is a hilarious, witty, sexy, suspenseful, and totally beautiful movie. It is also one of the best Martin Lawrence films I have ever seen. I thought that Martin (Lawrence) and Lynn (Whitfield) lit up the screen like magic! One of my favorite quotes of this movie is, \"You put your hands on the wrong woman.\" That really made me feel good and smile. The part that really made me feel good and smile, though, was when Brandi (Lynn Whitfield) got even with Darnell (Martin Lawrence) at her home towards the end of the movie. Also, I thought that Erica (Malinda Williams) looked very beautiful in her prom dress, especially with the way she had her hair done. That sure brings back memories for me. In conclusion, to anyone who's a fan of Martin Lawrence, I recommend this movie. You're in for lots of laughs and thrills, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.","user":"Catherine_Grace_Zeh","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"The effects of being in love and dealing with heartbreak","rating":10,"date":"8 August 2013","review":"This is a great movie and it depicts reality quite accurately. A Thin Line Between Love &amp; Hate deserves at least an 8 but seeing how it's an all African American cast, I guess it was rated accordingly. I do not believe a sequel would be in order for this movie. The sequel would be easily predetermined and not very mind bottling so the producers should leave it as is. I compare this movie to Obsessed starring Beyonce Knowles which was a mediocre movie. A Thin Line Between Love &amp; Hate demonstrates how the effects of love can cause one to do crazy and outlandish things to mend a broken heart. The cast were extraordinary and very realistic despite the fact that the movie is seriously underrated and not many people know about it. I suggest viewers give this movie a chance with a clear head and without a predisposition view about any of the characters","user":"CynicalMentality","rank":[4,5]}]
