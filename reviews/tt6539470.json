[{"title":"Horribly bad","rating":1,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"I accidentally watched this thinking it was The Barn from 2016. Amazon Prime has them mixed up on their Prime Video website. This movie was extremely bad, so please dont make the same mistake I did thinking its the other movie. This one is horrible.","user":"pensacolacomputer","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Better than expexted","rating":8,"date":"29 November 2019","review":"I thought this movie was actually really good. The single setting of the rural farm created an atmosphere of familiarity , mixed with isolation and dread..\nSome of its secrets are given up early, but this is intentional, as it creates questions , in the viewers mind, about who is, or who isn't, aware of what's going on.\nI thought Ken Samuels, as Gil, was fantastic as a troubled man dealing with his devotion to his community, while wrestling inner demons from his past.\nHis relationships, with the people around him, were fairly compelling, and existed upon a fragile foundation of pain and a deep sense of loss.\nI recommend this movie. It isn't your typical horror movie, but I thought it was much better than some, more well known movies I have recently seen.","user":"gvp7","rank":[1,2]},{"title":"It was ok","rating":6,"date":"15 November 2019","review":"Very strange film.
