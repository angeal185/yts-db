[{"title":"Denial","rating":12,"date":"12 February 2017","review":"This is sugar coated, slickly shot, voiced with mellifluence.<br><br>It blames everyone and everything... It is racism, it's being in a western society, and it's due to isolation. It goes on and on, family oppression - state oppression, poor education and work opportunities.<br><br>Abu Muntasir's emotional moments seem forced and in my opinion lack genuine remorse, the range of people interviewed in very small indeed, the documentary simply does not discuss this subject with any depth what so ever. And this is a topic that needs some serious debate.<br><br>Not once is the 'Book' discussed, not ONCE is the Hadith discussed - in which - every Muslim has to follow as the word of god, which commands without any room for interpretation Jihad, the establishment of the Caliphate and Sharia Law through violence if necessary.","user":"golgulok","rank":[27,37]},{"title":"Shedding tears","rating":1,"date":"9 June 2018","review":"The Imam who sheds tears seems to be a good actor. The others in this film, who were radicalized, still seem to be holding onto it in one form or another. One man, honestly stated, \"It's all about sex.\" Voila! and no surprise. Others stated various forms of radicalism still within their Islamic thought processes. Another review here commented how they \"blame\" so many other aspects of their upbringing, their British cultural surroundings, Britain, the USA, of which they want to see the downfall. They're not sorry, or reformed. I do commend the female filmmaker who ventured into this subject, though she excuses their radicalism due to the excuses the \"former\" radicals give.","user":"WVfilmfem","rank":[12,22]},{"title":"Essential perspective","rating":10,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"Surprising and deeply humane film about former jihadis that has made me revise my view of how these people are created.","user":"matthewjohnbrown-31120","rank":[8,17]}]
