[{"title":"Compelling","rating":3,"date":"3 October 2004","review":"The Opposite Of Sex  1998<br><br>The Opposite Of Sex stars two of my favourite actress'  Lisa Kudrow and Christina Ricci. Needless to say, they were my main motivations for seeing this film. Expecting a fairly average film you might say I was a little shocked when this turned out to be a well scripted, well acted, suitably gritty and compelling drama. The Opposite of Sex is narrated by the appropriately cynical lead character, Dede Truitt (Christina Ricci). The narration is highly amusing and witty and provides the audience with a release during tense and heavily themed situations. Dede Truitt basically walks into her half brothers life (Martin Donovan) and causes a stir among his sister in-law (Lisa Kudrow) by stealing his boyfriend who was originally thought to be gay and now decides he is bisexual. The whole film is constantly asking questions about Sex and what it has done to humanity. It works on two levels, one being that it has heavy themes and can be coarse at times. However Lisa Kudrow offers comic relief playing a straight square teacher who disapproves of everything and everyone in life especially sex. That is until she finds Sex on her doorstep. The Opposite of Sex is a brilliant film, when Christina Ricci was in her prime. It deserved much more praise than it got which is such as shame. 9/10","user":"sjr59","rank":[40,52]},{"title":"One of the best films in years","rating":10,"date":"20 October 2000","review":"I absolutely love this film.  Christina Ricci is perfectly cast and gives a great performance as a 16 year old who tries to manipulate and bully all of the other characters into bowing to her sick and twisted view of the world. While Ricci's character is not immediately likable she is somehow compelling and is effecting in driving the film.  Ricci's character does and says hateful things throughout the movie but the film is successful in maintaining it's own view on these topics without squelching her characters voice. Hopefully what we see through her character is that despite the hateful things people do, there are real human beings behind these actions. I ended up liking the character for her survive at any cost mentality and her resolve.<br><br>The movie is hilariously funny and at times touching.  Lisa Kudro turns in another great performance as a lonely single girl who is pining for the affections of Ricci's gay half brother.  The humor is not of the joke a minute or slapstick variety but grows out of the situations and relationships between compelling characters.<br><br>The writing and directing are also superb.  I especially liked scenes where the director showed how easily we can be manipulated by mood and music as well as the points that we show in a character's life.  Ricci's narration is biting, wicked, clever, bitchy and witty.  I can see however, how one could be offended and turned off by it.  But the narration is not for shock effect but rather to frame the main character.<br><br>I wouldn't change a frame or a line in this film.  It's funny, intelligent and warm in a strange sort of way.  A definite must see.","user":"Bill-147","rank":[52,71]},{"title":"Ground Breaking? Well... yeah.","rating":9,"date":"31 December 2002","review":"The Opposite of Sex does what Don Roos set it out to do. It brings the subject of homosexuality in all its forms to light in a hard hitting, funny in your face joy ride - but yet it's not a 'gay movie'. Ricci is wonderful as Dedee, our young 'tour guide' to this strange journey. Through her eyes we see her world of lies, deception and confusion. At times you might not like her, but thats what is great about the movie, it pulls you in. If your into witty one liners, a fast story line and terrific acting (two thumbs up to Lisa Kudrow!)than this movie is for you. After a movie that makes you think about other peoples lifestyles and situations? give it a try. As an eighteen year old, I recommend this movie for older teens and up and give it a 8/10.","user":"Bradley-drake","rank":[17,22]}]
