They were chuckling the whole time and most importantly asked me how they could help rescue animals when it was over. Go see it and take the kids! My favorite part of the movie had to be Hambone. The hamster is a scene steeler for sure. I thought the plot was very lighthearted and took me back to some of the great kids movies and sitcoms from the 90's. It even paid homage to some great 90's cartoons that I will not mention because of spoiling the fun. If you have time check this movie out, you will not be disappointed and the message and heart of the film is the best part. I read they saved 160+ animals opening weekend with live adoption events. Amazing work by all! 4 Paws Up!","user":"tbrooks-12-982204","rank":[1,4]}]
