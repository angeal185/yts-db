[{"title":"From an amazing little book","rating":9,"date":"26 July 2009","review":"This movie was made from a tiny, now classic 1938 book by Kressmann Taylor (her full name was Kathrine Kressmann Taylor) that was written in the form of letters only between the two lead characters.<br><br>As such it is not only a brilliantly conceived horror story of how an evil idea poisons a society but how it continues on to destroy life.<br><br>The small book was re-issued in 2001 by Washington Square Press and at this writing currently available. No matter how you reacted to the movie this is a must read. It can be read in a single, short sitting but it packs an incredible wallop. The little story is compared to the best writing of O. Henry for its sly plot twists and lauded by Kurt Vonnegut who compares it to WWII as what Uncle Tom's Cabin was to the Civil War.<br><br>You can then return to the movie and enjoy it at a far deeper and more profound level. Beyond all of thatÂ…if Paul Lukas is in a film, any film, you can trust that it is worth watching if only for his performance.","user":"merrywood","rank":[52,55]},{"title":"Well crafted but unfortunately forgotten WWII film","rating":8,"date":"5 February 2010","review":"This little film received Academy Award nominations for art direction and score, and I have to wonder how it escaped a nomination for cinematography as well, because this story does not have a great deal of action in it. Instead, much is said through the vivid score and the masterful cinematography that renders the shadows that the Nazis cast often more menacing that the Nazis themselves.<br><br>Not commercially available as far as I know, this is a film that deserves rediscovery. The story opens on a celebration between two friends and partners in San Francisco. Martin Schulz (Paul Lukas) is returning to his home country of Germany along with his wife and four of his five sons. His partner, Max Eisenstein (Morris Carnovsky), will meanwhile keep their art gallery going in San Francisco along with Martin's son, Heinrich. Max's daughter, Griselle, is also going to Germany to seek out a career as an actress. Heinrich and Griselle are in love, but have decided to delay marriage so that Griselle can pursue her career.<br><br>Once in Germany, Martin gets swept up into the building Nazi movement when he is befriended and flattered by the silver-tongued Baron von Friesche, who eventually convinces him that he should cut off all communication with his old friend Max because he is Jewish. When the Nazis come after Max's daughter Griselle when they learn she is Jewish, Martin stands by and does nothing to help her, allowing his old friend's daughter to perish at their hands and on his doorstep. However, a society such as the Nazi's that is built on purity of opinion and constant suspicion can sometimes be cleverly manipulated to be an instrument of revenge. Thus, by means of a very simple plan executed by someone in the U.S., Martin soon finds himself isolated and under suspicion of espionage - a prisoner in his own home as well of his own imagination of what will come next.<br><br>I highly recommend this film as it is still relevant today, especially from a psychological standpoint of how totalitarian movements start out by preying on the desperation of the many and the self-importance of a few.","user":"AlsExGal","rank":[42,48]},{"title":"One for the address book","rating":7,"date":"1 May 2014","review":"This is a fascinating movie on a number of levels.<br><br>For anyone who loves the look of films such as \"Citizen Kane' or film noir, there is plenty to offer here. The director, William Cameron Menzies, was also a brilliant art director and he went to town on this picture. Just look at the camera work; he and his crew must have shot half the film from a pit in the floor judging from the dramatic angles.<br><br>The film is set a few years before WW2. Martin Schulz (Paul Lucas) and Max Eisenstein (Morris Carnovsky) run a successful art gallery in San Francisco, Both are German immigrants and are close friends. Martin's son, Heinrich, (Peter Van Eyck) who also works in the gallery, plans to marry Giselle Eisenstein, Max's daughter (K.T. Stevens). Max is due to return to Germany with his wife, Elsa (Mady Christians), to expedite the buying for the gallery. At the last minute, Giselle breaks off her engagement to Heinrich, and also decides to go to Germany to further her acting career.<br><br>In Germany, Martin communicates with Max and Heinrich back at the gallery by mail; through his letters they sense that Martin is falling under the spell of the Nazis. Eventually this hurts Martin's relationship with Max, who is a Jew.<br><br>Martin's seduction by the Nazis, and the advantages they offer has similarities to John Halder, Viggo Mortensen's character in the more recent \"Good\". Both are weak men who are easily led, and both turn their backs on a Jewish friend.<br><br>Much of the plot of \"Address Unknown\" hangs on the letters that go backward and forward between San Francisco and Germany. As the film goes on, we learn how powerful these communications are, especially with the Nazi censors involved.<br><br>Giselle's Jewish background puts her in jeopardy when she appears in a play. Interestingly, the lines she speaks, which offend the Nazi censors, are actually the words of Jesus from the \"Book of Matthew\".<br><br>\"Address Unknown\" has a couple of scenes that really hit home, with one that would have done Val Lewton proud, and has an ending with a twist worthy of an episode of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\".<br><br>Although heavily stylised, the film highlights the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany, but \"Address Unknown\" was made in 1944, and the war didn't end until 1945. Films made during WW2, give an insight into what was influencing audiences at the time. Although the full extent of what had been going on in Germany didn't come to light until after the war, \"Address Unknown\" shows that the plight of the Jews before and during the war was far from a complete mystery.<br><br>The film is more restrained than some of the more strident films made during WW2, and it's somewhat abstract quality has prevented it dating all that much.","user":"tomsview","rank":[19,21]}]
