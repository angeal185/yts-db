[{"title":"Poorly executed","rating":1,"date":"2 February 2020","review":"The story had decent foundations and some good twists, but it was so poorly executed you could see every plot twist coming from a mile away. In the end most of the characters didn't matter at all, there's no resolution of any kind, the whole thing relied heavily on jump scares that didn't even work well, and you're left with more questions than answers. Overall a crappy movie in an oversaturated genre. This movie had no redeeming qualities whatsoever.","user":"zachsextra","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"a movie with a split personality","rating":3,"date":"11 January 2020","review":"Part of this movie deals with schizophrenia, and the movie itself seems to suffer from the same disease. While watching it , I couldn't help but wonder if 2 different people wrote it and directed it. I expected this, based on the trailer to be a \"so bad it's funny\" movie, but it actually starts off well , with realistic dialogue and Robert Kazinsky is very good in the lead. After awhile though I was waiting for it to start to get good or scary or anything, after all it's suppose to be a horror movie, but other then atmosphere it was starting to bore me. As other characters were introduced, some played by really awful actors, the movie jumped the rails and became preposterous, with dialogue so bad I was laughing. How could a movie that started out so good, go so bad ? By the time Tatum O'Neal arrived, and I was asking myself, \"what is she doing in this ?\", I began to wonder if this dud could in any way redeem itself. Well no , it doesn't. I watched it till the end only because it was this or load the dishwasher.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[21,29]},{"title":"the best part....","rating":1,"date":"10 January 2020","review":"....the end, it really is.
