[{"title":"Fun, dark and twisted","rating":7,"date":"22 March 2018","review":"Let's start by saying that this is a dark comedy. Reading some of the worse reviews I get a sense that maybe they have missed this.\nThe movie is thoroughly enjoyable, not one single weak actor in the cast and all performing well. Hat's off to Charlize Theoron, she is already one of my favourite actresses and has further cemented my opinion of her here.<br><br>Watch Harold, a victim of circumstance, muddle his was through his seemingly disaster filled life, all whilst trying to do the right thing, while others want to take advantage. Highly recommend this movie","user":"ramonster_uk","rank":[88,106]},{"title":"Surprised!!!!","rating":7,"date":"12 June 2018","review":"This movie was pretty good. I did not have much expectation do to the ratings and some of the reviews. It was a fun movie, with comedy and action all in one. David Oyelowo was great as Harold. All in all good movie to relax and eat popcorn.","user":"lukyboy1","rank":[58,69]},{"title":"how is this rated 6.0 on imdb?","rating":8,"date":"23 May 2018","review":"This movie is definitely better than the 6.0 rating here.","user":"dudleyduclos","rank":[104,135]}]
