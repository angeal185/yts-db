[{"title":"A good movie","rating":7,"date":"19 August 2017","review":"Although there are quite numbers of negative reviews on this movie (mostly about the novel plagiarism which I don't think it should stop people from watching this movie who already bought the copyright legally from the author), I choose to walk into the cinema as I only trust my own eyes and listen to my own hearts. Overall, this movie is worth watching with very beautiful scenes, costumes, BGM, CGI, good looking actors and actresses. The acting skills of Yang Yang and Crystal Liu are also impressive especially on those sad scenes. However, some of the scenes jump a bit sudden without good transition. Audiences who have never read the novels or series might not be able to enjoy the movie much. Hence, some points are cut because of the film editing.","user":"venuslim-42481","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"In my honest opinion","rating":8,"date":"10 August 2017","review":"For the first time, I've been filled with indignation.You may not believe all that low scores, hateful comments toward two leading actors and hateful comments toward the movie itself, just for a movie. Yes,I have saw the movie and it's time to speak up for it. This reminds me of Running for Governor by Mark Twain. In short, the story is about a very good man with very good reputation that is running for the governor. It seems obvious that he will win. But,to his surprise,all kinds of accusations came suddenly. All medias have report his nonexistent crime .It's ridiculous and unbelievable,but people believe in such fallacious rumors and that this true good men was thought as a criminal,so he have to drop out of the campaign with all kinds of slander. The great Mark Twain had uncovered the strategy of how to destroy a good person, or in this case, a movie. To be honest,I used to think that the novel is just a novel.But now I think that the great writer have told us a ridiculous but true fact. What the movie Once Upon a Time have gone through these days was an sound evidence. Some people can be so villainous to slander and defaming the film just in order to prevent audiences from going to see it. Don't you ever wonder why there are so many authors that gave bad comments are Chinese? I can think of no others but conspiracy. They are employed by some other film companies to spread rumors to undermine the film. These people disguise as judicial people to condemn the film .But,in fact,do you think an illegal production can be showed in foreign countries?The rumor is ridiculous and totally unreliable. What's more ,the original book has been adapted to both film and TV show. Ironically,they enjoy the TV show and flatter it everywhere but slander the film as a product of plagiarism. Simply because they suspect that the original author of Three Lifetime ;Ten Miles of peach Blossoms is a chief .But I really want to ask them this: why don't you condemn the TV show and the supposedly guilty original author but only speak ill of the film if they are such justiciars. <br><br>Now back to the movie: in my honest opinion, if you are interested in the ancient Chinese culture,It's a good movie for you.There are so many beautiful and magnificent hand-made costumes with beautiful embroidery. What' more, the story is really heart-warming and tell us that Love is, and can be eternal. In a word ,the film Once Upon a Time is a fantastic movie,if you are interested in this kind of movie ,you can enjoy it in the theater.But don't believe in those who spread rumors.After all,they can take profit by doing so and bear no legal liability. It's easy to write something bad without seeing the movie right? <br><br>I wish people can watch the film before giving their opinions. And don't ever get fooled by some pretentious \"fighting for the rights\" comments. <br><br>Lastly, for those who said this movie is based on a plagiarized book, please give solid proof that this book was truly plagiarized, i wish to see the LEGAL proof. As anyone can simply accuse another of stealing. For those who said the production teams knew, please give proofs. If not, there are no evidence to back up your statements. And in the end, they are all specious statements, and you're just making a fool out of yourselves. <br><br>Evidence to prove this book is not plagiarized: http://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404138764917191884 Comparison of two books http://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309404138763457539876 Legal statement https://m.weibo.cn/1496939465/4138782569045259 Result of examination<br><br>Conclusion: no plagiarism, court will dismiss the case.","user":"ameliaj-50631","rank":[34,42]},{"title":"Don't miss the moving love story of Eastern myth.","rating":9,"date":"10 August 2017","review":"This film is extremely moving and imaginative. It based on the ancient times, telling a love story about Bai Qian and Ye Hua. They experienced three-times- life and were deeply in love with each other. Yes, their love moved my friends and me. It is full of eastern mythologies. In this film, you can see the human race, devil race and SkyClan of eastern. I think it's a good movie and you can't miss it.","user":"chensh-97160","rank":[22,26]}]
