IMDb is flooded with fanboys of lousy actors who cannot respect opinions.<br><br>I never put spoilers, or abusive or irrelevant stuff.\nThis proves that IMDb of lately been hijacked by fake reviews.<br><br>I can still copy paste my review which is saved but this time I jus want to write something different.\nAs a fan of Ajay Devgan, I am really shocked that he agreed to star in this pathetic film.<br><br>\nThe overacting by the lead actor became an enduring torture to sit thru.\nThe script, direction, acting, editing n cinematography, r all worse than Ed Wood films.<br><br>Massive narrative sinkholes, outstanding disbelief in the muddled writing and shockingly pathetic over acting. This film is a torture to sit thru n without a doubt the most inept and atrociously awful film ever made.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[40,49]},{"title":"Paisa vasool movie","rating":10,"date":"29 December 2018","review":"I was so disappointed watching zero last week.
