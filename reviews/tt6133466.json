[{"title":"Awful movie","rating":1,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"Loved the original Purge movie, but this one was just so horrible. Seriously... the big neighborhood drug dealer is the good guy hero (\"Make way for the King!\") and all the white people are bad &amp; evil. I kept hoping I was wrong, but it just kept getting more and more obvious. What's the message here? Just a movie to feed the racial divide with stereotypes all over the place. Incredibly disappointing.","user":"wendalena","rank":[540,721]},{"title":"Nothing going for it; dreadful","rating":1,"date":"9 July 2018","review":"Honestly the film was absolute rubbish. Stereotypical characters. No humour. Terrible action. Atrocious acting. Regressive political messages shoved in your face throughout, eg: EVERY 'bad' or 'evil' character being white - often shown with nazi-esque uniform, KKK uniform, black-face w/ red lips versus the 'good' black gangsters in \"the hood.\"<br><br>Don't waste your money or your time. Regularly go to the cinema and this is the first time I've felt inclined to sign up on IMDB specifically to review/comment.","user":"danalex-66545","rank":[543,745]},{"title":"Blaxploitation 2.0","rating":1,"date":"8 July 2018","review":"OMG! The Purge series has outdone itself. A plummet from grace, far worse than the Saw series nosedive in half the amount of time. Apparently, we are doing so bad in the Black community that we have to turn to the Crips and the Bloods as our savior against the man. I was literally sitting in the theater ashamed. Pure filth. A hot, SILLY, ghetto mess.","user":"manresa314","rank":[538,740]}]
