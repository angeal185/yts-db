[{"title":"What I Learned","rating":5,"date":"12 March 2018","review":"SPOILER: This is a fairly predictable thriller worth a look. The ending was somewhat what I figured it would be, but the villain was not quite the character I predicted. Things one learns after watching...1. Do NOT play online violent video games. 2. Do NOT use online dating services. 3. Do NOT allow strange women to stay at your place while you go to work. 4. Do NOT assume a smokin' hot chick is obsessed with you, even if you are a dweeb. 5. Do NOT ignore phone calls from your lawyer.","user":"clintstevens","rank":[37,45]},{"title":"Social media hell","rating":6,"date":"8 July 2018","review":"An American thriller; A dark, tawdry tale of a supremely confident and contemptible young advertising agency archetype who dates women for sexual gratification using a gamified dating app.\nThe film is probably most similar to Clint Eastwood's \"Play Misty For Me\" in the way the story unfolds: one night stand followed by avoidance, obsessional tendency before a second night; female becomes antagonist and won't stop. In the end, the theme is not one of portraying the excesses of masculinity in the digital meat market, nor that there will always be one crazy person out there, but that we are good judges of our own mistakes but a poor judge on the mistakes of others.\nThe film is at least a believable take on the dark side of modern dating, showing the dangers of online engagement and it stays clear of a typical storyline where villians are set up to be knocked down. It's surprisingly effective as a thriller despite its narrow scope. My verdict is not 'sideswipe'.","user":"shakercoola","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"Swim Fan?","rating":4,"date":"23 March 2018","review":"Tired of the tired old remakes with an updated (tinder) twist. This was literally Swim Fan. The female even looks like the psycho from Swim Fan.","user":"kelliknowlton-682-220064","rank":[19,26]}]
