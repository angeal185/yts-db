[{"title":"howcome they make rubbish like this","rating":1,"date":"23 March 2020","review":"I tend to ask myself, have the british filmakers totally forgotten how to make film of horrors? the ''doll house'' is yet an example of amateur filmaking, slow burning non horrific acting, terrible plot and a so worn out way of storytelling. there is a devil in the house, but in which house.....<br><br>its a lot of muteness in this feature, but it is so overdramaticized that it wont gag to engagement, with lots of flashbacking, and sound effects used in the 70's the exorcist,its so lame and low on quality, i cant believe it.<br><br>the grumpy old man doesnt recommend.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"Deserves A ZERO! This Is Total Rubbish!!!","rating":1,"date":"23 March 2020","review":"10 minutes in with the fan blowing paper around and the psychic walking like Frankenstein talking like Linda Blair was definitely a NO for me! This is the worst British cast movie ever!!!","user":"zac-68274","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"Close to 1, but I'll give it a 2.","rating":2,"date":"24 March 2020","review":"Wow oh Wow was this an experience or what?!? I mean how is it possible that such a script was approved and developed is beyond me, and anyone who has seen a horror production before will completely agree.<br><br>Sure, a small budget has a huge impact on a movie, it takes a lot of cutbacks, lack of quality and so on, but come on, first of all, the real problem is the plot. Already used far too many times, we get to see the same old formula with some pretty weird scenes. Lots and plenty of such actions on screen that make little sense, others as cringy as they get and some simply and sadly, laughable. Of course I appreciate indie horror, every actor/director has to start somewhere, building up, but at least start from ground 0 and not so underground. I don't think that a movie like Doll House can count as experience, because it is a complete fail, so if the people involved in the making of it managed to learn from this mistake, then just maybe something good did come out of it.<br><br>As the other reviews said, a bad little movie sadly, and definitely not something to recommend.<br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[10,12]}]
