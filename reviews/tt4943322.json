[{"title":"Movies Are Not Politics, Nor Are They Documentaries.","rating":10,"date":"16 March 2017","review":"While some reviewers cannot see beyond the work of the actors and \n director in a project, others pay to escape life and be immersed in a \n world we cannot otherwise visit.\n \n The Ottoman Lieutenant is a grand, sweeping movie that has war as its \n backdrop. This movie is not a documentary. The artists who worked to \n bring us this bit of fiction immersed themselves beautifully within the \n project, and their hard work stands out, much like the Merchant Ivory \n films. The movie itself does not ask for a review of its accuracy, it \n simply asks that we put aside the trappings of our present environment \n to imagine a different vista.\n \n If you are interested in enjoying beauty for its own sake, then you \n will enjoy this film. If you are still intent on reliving the \n atrocities of the past, then l suggest you stick to documentaries, and \n only those with which you wholeheartedly agree.\n \n - Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.","user":"ChipperX","rank":[311,476]},{"title":"deeply flawed film, as both romantic epic","rating":10,"date":"16 March 2017","review":"Unabashedly old-fashioned and romantic, this World War I-era movie fearlessly plucks at the heartstrings while offering glorious, big- screen cinematography ... and a bit of revisionist history. The Ottoman Lieutenant may may lack big-name movie stars. And, because it was funded largely by Turkish financiers, it shines a positive light on the country, largely ignoring the Armenian Genocide of 1915. But if you judge it based on goal of telling a romantic story against an intense wartime backdrop, like a mini-Dr. Zhivago or The English Patient, it succeeds handsomely.<br><br>The three characters involved in the love triangle are very appealing, and their human qualities make their relationship all the more complex. Plus, Ben Kingsley is wonderfully hammy as the founder of the Turkish hospital. Veteran director Joseph Ruben, who usually makes low-level thrillers (like the excellent The Stepfather) forgoes any tricks and simply uses a gorgeous widescreen backdrop with spectacular landscapes and plays of light to underline his story. The telling of it is smart but not confusing, tragic but not weepy, and swoon-inducing without being dopey.","user":"armyforever-28741","rank":[204,322]},{"title":"This is proper art","rating":10,"date":"7 May 2017","review":"Very emotional movie, great acting, great cast, great plot. Simply incredible. I'm not really an emotional person, and the only movie that I've ever got teary eyed in was Hachiko. But then this movie made me just as much emotional if not more. Would definitely suggest it to everyone. Don't know about the historical value of the movie. But if you watch it without any prejudice, I guarantee that you will enjoy it. It's more than just a movie, it is.","user":"magbroalican","rank":[137,235]}]
