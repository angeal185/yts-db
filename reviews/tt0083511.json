[{"title":"An action classic, best and the only original buddy cop flick from the 80's!","rating":10,"date":"1 April 2016","review":"48 Hrs. (1982) is an action classic the only original best buddy cop flick from the 80's. Is an action cop flick that I love to death and it was honestly the first action film I saw as a kid. I grew up watching this film and in my opinion is still my favorite action buddy flick. This is first time we see Eddie Murphy in action before he went in making Beverly Hills Cop (1984), beside Beverly Hills Cop this is one if his best movies of the 80's. It is actually my favorite Walter Hill film. Like I said I grew up watching this film, I loved 48 Hrs. so much that I hardly convinced my mom to watch this movie with me and the sequel of this film. I read on Charles Bronson's Murphy's Law (1986) flick that the storyline of that film the pairing a cop with a convict was popular in Hollywood during the 1980s after the success of this film 48 Hrs. (1982). Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy are sensational in this film, the action is great and the plot about this film is well paced it goes fast and it is entertaining. I really enjoy watching this movie and honestly I love it more, than I would love the sequel, the sequel can't even hold a candle to this film.<br><br>\"Yeah. Well, I'm real impressed with you too, man. It takes a real-skilled cop to kick in the bedroom door of a couple of dykes!\"<br><br>Plot: A hard-nosed cop reluctantly teams up with a wise-cracking criminal temporarily paroled to him, in order to track down a killer.<br><br>The film is actually about a $500,000 stashed cash and two cop killers who are running around and killing cop,s while they want to get the hands of this cash. A tough cop who is a survivor in a shoot out in the hotel from those two killers, pairs with a convict from prison to help him to get and catch those two killers. They only have 48 Hrs. before the cop has to bring the convict back. They don't make films like this anymore, I really love action films from the 80's and this one was the first one I have saw as a kid. My favorite part in the film is the stake out scene: Jack (Nick Nolte) and Reggie (Eddie Murphy) head out to the parking garage, and they park across the street from the parking garage, waiting till the parking garage opens which it does around 7.00 am in the mornings and they spend the night there. Next morning Jack (Nick Nolte) brings a caf√© drink to Reggie (Eddie Murphy) and wakes him up. The similar thing happened to me when I was 12 years old. My mom drove me and my dad with the car in the city 4.00 am in the mornings it was night than and my dad went with his bike delivering news paper, me with my mom waited on him in the car till his shift ends. During the waiting I fall a sleep, when I woke it was past 7.00 am and my mom brought me food from the store in the car. That moment I remember this scene in this film. It is a beautiful child memories of mine on my mom and 48 Hrs. (1982) is my childhood movie and it is memories on my childhood. 48 Hrs. and Beverly Hills Cop 1 &amp; 2 are my favorite Eddie Murphy films from my childhood that I love to death.<br><br>This is Nick Nolte's best action flick that I love to death and only one that is worth to watch. I love Music theme by James Horner that I love so much including the opening scene that was awesome. Honestly James Horner made the same music theme for Commando (1985) Arnold Schwarzenegger's movie. I love the shout outs, the action scenes, the dialogues and I also love the main lead roles from Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond are my favorite characters. This is the only original action film, but I think it was unnecessary making a sequel (Another 48 Hrs.) that I honestly think Nick Nolte made a lousy awful job reprising his role and Eddie Murphy was even worst by shouting and punching Nick Nolte. Before I finish my review you have a few cast that are memorable here: You have: James Remar from Dexter playing the main villain, David Patrick Kelly from Commando and The Warriors, Sonny Landham from Predator, Annette O'Toole from Smallville, Jonathan Banks from Beverly Hills Cop and Olivia Brown from Miami Vice. I have this film on Blu-ray I used to own the DVD but I switch it for Blu-ray.<br><br>48 Hrs. is a 1982 American action comedy film directed by Walter Hill, starring Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy (in his film debut and Golden Globe Award-nominated role) as a cop and convict, respectively, who team up to catch a cop-killer. The title refers to the amount of time they have to solve the crime.<br><br>Overall: Is my favorite action flick from my childhood and I love it to death. This flick get's a solid 10 by me and it deserves it.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[45,50]},{"title":"The real thing. Accept no imitations.","rating":9,"date":"15 January 2003","review":"This is the one of the movies that kicked off the buddy cop formula. Technically, Nick Nolte's the only cop, but other films have tried to imitate the style by having a tough, cranky, by-the-book cop (Nolte's character) paired off with a loose, easygoing, unorthodox cop (like Murphy's character).  Some of these \"imitators\" have failed miserably and even those that succeeded don't match up to \"48 Hours.\"  <br><br>I haven't seen the unedited version of this movie in over ten years (it plays on TV like 4 times every month), and even when I did catch it on TV, I caught it in bits and pieces.  Now that I've seen it straight-through, in its uncut form, I can regard this as an overlooked classic.  Watching Nolte as the gruff, chain-smoking Jack, I thought to myself, \"He owns that part.\" Many actors have tried to take on that same role, but nobody plays it better than Nolte.  And the same goes for Eddie Murphy.  His talent has been taken for granted over the recent years, since his career has hit a major slump. And rightfully so.  He should choose his roles much more wisely.  How do you from doing such fun, memorable films as \"48 Hours,\" \"Coming to America\" and \"Trading Places\" to doing \"Showtime\" and \"I-Spy.\"  This movie proves that Murphy can go leaps and bounds with his comic talent, if the script is well-written.  The scene in the all-white, country-western bar, where Murphy shows off his skills as an interrogator, is a classic. <br><br>\nThe film is directed by Walter Hill, who's great at directing action sequences.  So the movie packs a punch in both the action and comedy department.  Nolte and Murphy's chemistry is priceless, and the banter between them is sharp and hilarious.  One of my favorite examples is when Murphy asks Nolte, \"Can you tell me a bedtime story?\"  Nolte responds, \"F**k you.\"  \"That's my favorite one.\"  Of course, Murphy gets most of the credit for being the comic relief, and he is terrific in one of his best comic performances, but Nolte belts out just as many funny lines as him, though he's the official straight man.  He never seems to say anything intentionally funny, but that's what's funny.  He says things that are hilarious, but sounds dead serious about them.  And of course, it's also hilarious to watch him react furiously to Murphy's taunts. <br><br>\nThose who haven't seen \"48 Hours\" should really check it out, because it's an action classic!  Sure, the \"Rush Hour\" films are good, but Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan don't have close to the same magic as Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy!  THIS is how an action/comedy is made!!<br><br>My score:  9 (out of 10)","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[69,81]},{"title":"The boys are back in town","rating":8,"date":"18 September 2016","review":"I regard 48 Hrs as an action adventure with a comedic debut performance by the then 21 years old, Eddie Murphy.<br><br>Hard nosed, hard drinking cop Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) pulls a convicted bank robber Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from prison on a forged 48 hours pass to help him capture Hammond's old partner, Albert Ganz (James Remar) who killed Cates fellow cop.<br><br>Ganz himself escaped from prison with the help of native, Billy Bear and both go on a killing rampage as they look for the half a million dollars that went missing after one of their robberies.<br><br>Reggie knows where the money is but wants to stay one step ahead of Cates.
