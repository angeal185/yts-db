[{"title":"Great Film","rating":12,"date":"12 August 1999","review":"Probably my favorite Rutherford Marple, this movie is funny, suspensful, and wildly entertaining. Whatever Agatha Christie thought of this movie, she greatly admired Margaret Rutherford, dedicating  one of her best books The Mirror Crack'd to her. Once again, great support acting from Stringer Davis (Rutherford's real life husband) and from Robert Morley. Don't you think that Inspector Craddock would have learned to listen to Miss Marple by this movie?","user":"MFH","rank":[26,27]},{"title":"A Delightful Agatha Christie/Margaret Rutherford British who-dunnit","rating":9,"date":"23 October 2004","review":"Murder At The Gallop was one in a series of Miss Marple/Margaret Rutherford British mysteries...Rutherford certainly appears and acts quite differently from the character of Miss Marple which Agatha Christie created. If you want to see the Christie books presented accurately on screen, view the versions with Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. They work perfectly with the characters, settings and time period of the orginals.<br><br>However, authenticity is not one of the reasons for seeing this series of films. Margaret Rutherford is a screen gem...working with her real life husband, Stringer Davis, as co-sleuth (his character never appeared in any of the Christie novels) they form a wonderful partnership. I only wish they had continued this series. 'Gallop' features some excellent supporting actors -- Flora Robson, Finlay Curie and especially Robert Morley. It's filmed in beautiful black and white which captures the early 1960's quite well.<br><br>For an entertaining evening of pure delight this is a mystery to cherish!","user":"catman47","rank":[14,14]},{"title":"Brisk Agatha Christie mystery moves at a gallop...","rating":7,"date":"26 June 2006","review":"This is possibly MARGARET RUTHERFORD's most satisfactory excursion into Agtha Christie-land and she's helped by a delightful Ron Goodwin score that emphasizes her character with an infectious main theme and the gorgeous B&amp;W photography, full of sinister shadows and proper atmospheric effects.<br><br>Furthermore, Miss Rutherford is surrounded by some formidable British talent, such as Stringer Davis (his Mr. Stringer is always a delight), Robert Morley (blustery but fun), and most notably, FLORA ROBSON, remarkable as the timid companion of an elderly woman.<br><br>I've seen most of these Miss Marple mysteries from the 1960s, and this has got to be one of the best. It moves at a swift gallop (unlike some of the more tedious, slow-paced BBC versions), and the accent is on the humorous characterization that Rutherford is capable of. Purists may not think it serves Agatha Christie well, but taken on its own as a piece of comedy/mystery entertainment, it stands up well in that genre.<br><br>Highly recommended.","user":"Doylenf","rank":[36,40]}]
