The idea of the Christmas Story seen through the eyes of the animals was totally a new angle on the story and a wonderful inspiration for children and adults.<br><br>Although there is obvious evidence of artistic right in the story, (has to be with talking animals) it does follow along with the heart and written encounters of Baby Jesus family journey to His birth in Bethlehem.<br><br>I will be going this week for second viewing and checking with friends and family about borrowing some children to take with me. I want every child I know to see this.<br><br>As soon as it becomes available on DVD my order will be placed. I have 4 groups of children I will be encouraging to have their parents take them to see this. Movie night at my house will have several showings of this movie.","user":"nancyrea-79151","rank":[71,117]},{"title":"Go See \"The Star\"! It is a great entertaining movie.","rating":10,"date":"18 November 2017","review":"I'll start this review off by mentioning something specific and unique about this film that proves that I have seen this film while I suspect one reviewer didn't. The film handles the traditional nativity story while modifying the King Herod's attempt to find the Christ child and the Holy Family and murder them. (And, frankly, IMO, that part of the story that leads to the slaughter of the children of Bethlehem is not a suitable subject for family animated movie for children and is wisely left out of this film.) How they changed the King Herod part was to tell the story from the animal's point of view. The donkey Bo, Dave the bird, and Ruth the lamb all notice a new star in the sky and conclude that something great is doing to happen. Now Bo, who is a donkey of a miller, escapes his cruel master, and is adopted by Mary and Joesph. Only after Mary and Joesph leave on their journey to Bethlehem, does Bo learn that Herod has sent a soldier henchman with a long nasty looking sword and two mean chained together dogs to search for Mary and the baby and kill them. Bo enlists the aid of his friend Dave the dove and a lamb named Ruth, to chase after Mary and Joesph in order to warn them of the Soldier hunting them and to protect the holy family. Bo doesn't know why Mary is being hunted. The camels of the Magi, who Bo, Dave, and Ruth don't meet until the end of the film, witness Herod's original plotting. As I said, the film wisely leaves out the massacre of the children of Bethlehem and stops before that point in the biblical narrative means this film does not have a very violent, bloody, and adult scary scene in it for children to watch.<br><br>While telling the nativity story from the animals' point of view is not a new idea, using them to modify, and soften Herod's part is.<br><br>The animation is stunning in this film. <br><br>The story is easy to fallow and treats the traditional nativity story respectfully while infusing the obviously fictional part of the animals talking. It also has jokes in it to keep the tone of the picture light and easy .<br><br>The soundtrack's use of the carols and new music is lively, and enjoyable without getting too heavy handed with the religious theme. But the soundtrack doesn't get too light ether. It hits the right balence of seriousness and entertaining.<br><br>I would highly recommend taking children to see this film.","user":"dgranger","rank":[38,62]}]
