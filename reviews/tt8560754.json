[{"title":"Terrible!","rating":1,"date":"10 April 2020","review":"I turned this movie off after only a matter of minutes. It is unwatchable. It is moronic, irritating and bland.<br><br>It is as though some high school animation students made it and wrote the script. Except had this actually had been the case, the characters may have been given some semblance of a personality.<br><br>And don't even get me started on the lip syncing. Atrocious!!<br><br>Do not waste your valuable time.","user":"taryn_miller","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Probably the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","rating":1,"date":"20 March 2020","review":"This movie is beyond vile. It's beyond lazy, boring, un-fun and a complete waste of time. The animation is completely incompetent and the most basic animation possible while still being classified as such. The lip-syncing is the worst I've ever seen and there are three total angles. One on character(s) A, one on character(s) B, and one that circles around both of them. The animators clearly didn't try, to no one's surprise. Speaking of characters, these morons are the most basic, stale pieces of flaming goo sack I've ever had the displeasure of listening to and watching. There's a hero who just wants to be who he really is, of course accompanied by his stupid sidekick. There's an evil guy who wants to rule the land. There's a princess who just wants her father. a king, to let her have a little freedom. They're the most basic characters possible and leads to me wishing they actually fail. The story is basic and leads to no conflict and no intensity. You feel nothing while watching this movie. It is an absolute atrocity against mankind and humanity and was clearly made to make a quick buck piggybacking off some more popular, FAR, FAR better movie. I can't stress this enough, do NOT see this garbage fire.","user":"orangeplasma-","rank":[1,1]}]
