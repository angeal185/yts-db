[{"title":"What is Electronic Music from Germany today? Still unanswered....","rating":3,"date":"15 May 2017","review":"This documentary failed to even answer its tag-line. It also failed to even introduce the main characters. The filmmakers assume the viewer is the ultimate fanboy so unless you're on their level of fandom you'll be left wondering who the hell everyone is and what their role in the industry actually is. It's self-indulgent, It's boring. I wish I had more to say but basically, the whole documentary only has 10 minutes of content the rest is just long single camera shot of gurning dance floors. ** Full disclaimer I work in the electronic music industry, I went with a group of friends who also do and half of which walked out during the screening. My one friend who has nothing to do with the industry fell asleep. **","user":"ThaliaDavies","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"This documentary is brilliant","rating":8,"date":"19 May 2017","review":"This documentary is brilliant. Similarly to the above reviewer I work in the electronic music industry, however unlike the above thought it was one of the best music docs I have seen in years. It captures moments on the dancefloor so perfectly and the mood and feelings that go into the music and scene we all love. Yes - if you don't have a background in electronic music you may find it boring and self gratifying, but if that is the case you are very unlikely to be watching it in the first place. The subjects the film maker interviews are incredibly influential in shaping the world of techno and electronic music in general and as such there thoughts are very insightful when you consider the complexities of the music genre. Its not simply ... \"people gurning on the dancefloor\"..its an art house documentary...what did you expect? If you are into the scene and the music you will enjoy it immensely","user":"rohansakhardande","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"Wished it were 3D","rating":5,"date":"31 May 2017","review":"At a certain stage in the film Sonja Moonear reflects about djing, saying something like it were about putting people in the state of mind you want them to have. The tricky thing is that you can't just force the mood unto them like turning a switch, you need to transform them slowly, in a way they are not even realizing it. When she says that her hand even moves like a snake crawling through the thicket. The Snake manipulating people, it sounds so f****** evil, especially if you associate it with politics. But if you see a beautiful, inspired woman like Moonear talking about music and dance, any political dimension just seems to fade away. What manipulation? It's magical and sexual, if it works, it's orgasmic. It sets energies free, a very spiritual experience. Yeah, sure, probably it was very sexual and spiritual for Goebbels and Riefenstahl, too, seeing all this massive people formations marching around at the Berlin Olympics 1936. So much unifying energies  The only critical words about the electronic musical scene I realized in 110 minutes is one of the djs stating that there you would of course also be confronted with your own weaknesses when you spend your years mainly in a music studio also reflecting yourself. The critic remains vaguely, just a little drop of negativity in an otherwise surgical clean, but nonetheless praising composition. Is this something like positivist fan boy propaganda praising house music into the Heavens of alternative culture? No, of course not, all these extremely long, extremely geometric, extremely static shots can't be characterized as fascist aesthetics, neither. They are neutral containers holding images in which you can discover all sorts of details and plenty of space-time to project your own thoughts and imaginations into Well, well, I don't know, I don't even know if it stinks, the whole thing I know I wished it were shot in 3D, would have added the depths it strangely and terribly lacks.","user":"schrifthsteller","rank":[0,7]}]
