[{"title":"This Netflix Movie is below Lifetime standard","rating":5,"date":"27 September 2018","review":"Netflix has some Lmn type psycho movies too. This one has a wacko boyfriend of an oblivious separated mom. Her daughter begins to suspect things aren't right. The cast is quite watchable. The story is as expected. <br><br>Ok for one watch.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"So Bad. It's Awful Bad, Mild Spoilers, But Who Cares, You've Seen This 1000 Times!","rating":3,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"Moms don't move uncle daddy in with your teen daughters and then let them make decisions against you're own better judgment, even though you're halfway through a bottle of wine every night. Then sleep like a log, while he creeps around your sleeping young daughters.<br><br>Both of the parents were brain dead. When the daughter nearly threatens mom to give her, her pills, um, mom maybe there's a problem.<br><br>And then letting him tuck the youngest in at night? Oh hell, no!<br><br>These are movies where everyone's so stupid, you hope the bad guys knock everyone off.<br><br>Anyway, the bad guy likes rich older women, so a mother with two kids??? He wants to be daddy now? Motives made zero sense.<br><br>Don't waste your time. This is right up there with Plan 9 from Outer Space. But at least that's a classic!","user":"Mehki_Girl","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Beyond Bad","rating":1,"date":"10 September 2018","review":"Do you want to watch a really bad movie, with bad acting, bad script and unstructured dialogues?<br><br>Well, you just came to the right place, this is the one.","user":"dequalizer","rank":[5,7]}]
