However this movie is the second movie we have all watched together and enjoyed (first being CoCo).<br><br>The plot of the movie is simple and strait forward, yet it is still enjoyable and keeps you entertained. I especially appreciated how they put two teen characters together for most of the movie and there was no hint of romance between them. Don't get me wrong, I love a little romance, but there is a time and place. I was sure they were going to mess this movie up by having the boy and girls relationship (romantically) be a subplot. I am relieved to say I was wrong.<br><br>The animation is stunning. The amount of detail in this film must have taken hours to make. The clouds near the end was some of the best animation I have ever seen, along with Everest's (Joseph Izzy) fur. I also was really happy to see how much detail they put into Yi's (Chloe Bennet) violin playing. They made sure to include vibrato that matched the soundtrack, her figures landing on the actual note being played, the shifts into 2nd and 3rd position at the correct time, and the bowing that was almost always on point (few exceptions).<br><br>The color pallet chosen was perfect and stunning.<br><br>The sound track was beautiful; above all the violin playing. I am excited to go find the pieces and play them myself.<br><br>There isn't any reason you shouldn't go see this picture.","user":"Rachel_Dunphey","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Touching and beautiful","rating":10,"date":"24 November 2019","review":"This is a heart felt movie. I loved it. Ignore the technical criticism. Ignore the reference to political overtones. All criticism seemed superficial...perhaps they were fake. It is obviously a kids movie, but as an adult I left with good feelings. Very few movies or television shows do that for me. Children in the theater cheered at the end.","user":"friesena","rank":[58,80]}]
