[{"title":"For me it was worth watching at least.","rating":6,"date":"25 May 2018","review":"'SUPERCON': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br><br>A comic book convention caper comedy, about a team of small-time celebrities who decide to rob the convention they worked at. It stars Ryan Kwanten, Maggie Grace, Russell Peters, Clancy Brown, Mike Epps and John Malkovich. It was directed by Zak Knutson, and written by Knutson, Andrew Sipes and Dana Snyder. The movie has gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and fans, but I found it to be mildly amusing. <br><br>Adam King (Brown) is a former TV icon who still makes a lot of money touring comic book conventions, with the help of a corrupt promoter named Gil Bartell (Epps). A group of comic book artists, and other smaller TV stars, get into a fight with King one day, and they're all fired because of it. Matt Wheeler (Kwanten) comes up with a plan to rob Bartell and King, by stealing the money they make from the convention. The team of misfits recruit another former TV icon, Sid Newberry (Malkovich), to help them. <br><br>The film has some colorful visuals, and a nice cast. I really liked seeing Kwanten and Grace together, after just seeing the duo in 'THE HURRICANE HEIST' earlier this year, and they're both good in both films. Of course the veterans are the scene stealers (Brown, Malkovich and Epps), and the movie definitely has a few good laughs. For me it was worth watching at least, and I think it's a heck of a lot better than it's IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings! It's of course nothing great or special though.","user":"Hellmant","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Don't mess with the King.","rating":6,"date":"8 July 2018","review":"The story centers on former child actor Keith Mahar (Russell Peters) who played Haji, the \"bald cancer kid\" in a camp 80's production. He is financially strapped and extremely down on his luck. He meets fellow \"stars\" at a \"Supercon\" convention in the south. They all dislike Adam King (Clancy Brown) an egotistical super hero with certain Shatner qualities. John Malkovich comes into the feature at midpoint as a \"Stan Lee\" type of character. After an altercation our group of characters decide to go Danny Ocean on the Supercon. <br><br>The film makes fun of both Comic-cons and Ocean type films with all fictional characters. It would have been nice to of had actors play themselves...so much for budget constraints. Film was funniest when it made fun of the conventions. Adam King goes on a SNL William Shatner rant. <br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Names you know, that you probably wish you'd forget.","rating":1,"date":"27 April 2018","review":"Every actor here has achieved a modicum of respect. But I'm sure, as we all know that some people are just lucky. The trailer alone is enough to show that. While this may save you the time of watching the movie. The time you spend watching the trailer will never come back, as somehow it is bad enough to leave that regret and disgust, not in them, but in myself for watching it all the way through. Also how Russel Peters managed to take one comedy show and recycle it into multiple shows by diluting the original with bad jokes, and then get a tv series... You have to admire his ability to convince the money every time that this is going to be better.","user":"josephsivakumaran","rank":[9,22]}]
