[{"title":"Slap Your Brain Into Neutral For This One","rating":4,"date":"6 December 2014","review":"Keep in mind this film has nothing whatsoever to do with Oliver Stone. Instead we have a twenty something man with little or no ambition who happens to enjoy smoking the cheeba.<br><br>He has to do the odd job for his father's car detailing business in which he successfully screws up constantly. He seems to even have issues with handing out fliers! The crux of the story has him picking up a 55 Mercury from a customer to go detail it but somehow gets it stolen while partaking in some ice cream and some puffs. He then spends the duration of the film looking for the car while getting high and falling in love.<br><br>This is a \"PG\"ish comedy with no nudity but does contain the odd f bomb and rampant use of marijuana(the whole city seems to get high).<br><br>Teenagers will enjoy the humour but probably no one else will. It is a light no brainer comedy which actually does emit a few morals. After watching the film you will probably want to get high if you already aren't.","user":"shawnblackman","rank":[27,31]},{"title":"Better than I expected","rating":6,"date":"4 August 2015","review":"With a name like Oliver, Stoned. i didn't expect this movie to be very deep, but last night it popped up on amazon so i decided to give it a shot. It started out like you'd expect a typical buddy/stoner comedy to be. A loser and his drug dealer on the couch talking about nonsense getting high. I wanted to shut it off around the 15 minute mark, but stuck with it so i could at least get my money worth. But then the movie started to surprise me. The main character gets forced to help out Brea Grant's character and a fun adventure begins. It definitely feels like a low budget movie but there are some fun parts through out. I really laughed hard during the dubstep ice cream scene and the part when oliver and megan smoke in the garage together. it ends with a bit of a cheesy message but i at least liked the characters and laughed while watching them. Worth watching if you're looking for something that doesn't take too much thought.","user":"skirtsweeperz","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Lacks soul","rating":2,"date":"4 May 2015","review":"just watched this on Amazon prime, because I'm running out of things to watch. I would say this is a Seth Rogan film if it wasn't for the fact he ain't in it. This is no compliment, if your a Seth rogan fan then you'll probably think it's OK. The characters are so one dimensional they could be served with paper cut outs The acting has been criticised, I honestly don't think the actors or their acting was too bad, it's a weak film and as the saying goes you can't polish a t**d. The storyline has the typical \"sethroganesq\" stoner screw up guy, who keeps failing at all things in pursuit of weed, a disappointed dad who not only appears to be only ten years his senior for the nearly thirty something stoner living life as though he's 17 (hence the repeating Seth rogan references (did I say that I don't think Seth rogan should be allowed in front of a still camera never mind a movie camera) I got about an hour into the film when I found myself making use of the skip 10 seconds facility that Amazon provides, then I asked myself why I was wasting my valuable 4am time of insomnia on this when there's a bathroom floor I could be scrubbing or ironing that could be done...anything that would mean I don't have to waste my life on this film. That said I pity the actors and crew that probably wasted a lot more than one hour making this drainage. So, to end, I recommend the writer or final script editors that put this together as a script go back to Taco Bell and start wiping down the tables where they belong. Please send a cheque to compensate me for my time. It is in the interest of humanity I have bothered to take further time to write this review...may the Lord have mercy on your souls. Avoid this film, and avoid any film the writers make...note to self make a mental note of their names, wait don't risk forgetting...get a tattoo Jazz Kalkot and Tom Moris...you...you are to blame...don't go trying to pin it on the actors.","user":"lurpak","rank":[3,6]}]
