[{"title":"Film noir from the French, before they invented the phrase","rating":23,"date":"23 April 2002","review":"\"Pepe Le Moko\" is an early film noir, coming several decades before the French themselves invented the term to explain atmospheric American crime films.  And it is one of the best, a film ranking right up there with the work of Melville, Becker, and other top post war directors.<br><br>This is being billed in the US now as a sort of lost film. Actually, it wasn't lost.  Hollywood simply bought the rights and kept it off American movie screens so it could release its own remake of it in 1938, retitled \"Algiers.\"  That wasn't a half bad film, made enjoyable for the most part because it was a very off-beat story, had great atmosphere and featured the breathtakingly beautiful Hedy Lamarr in the role of Gaby.<br><br>At first, when looking at this French original, you wonder why it seems so familiar.  Then you realize that the Hollywood version is almost a shot for shot remake, copying almost everything.  Everything, that is, but the performance of Jean Gabin.<br><br>Hollywood's version, which stared Charles Boyer, always seemed a little contrived, primarily because Boyer was just not very convincing as the tough Paris gangster who pulls a bank heist and flees to Algiers, where he takes up permanent residence in the Arab quarter, the Casbah. Boyer just didn't seem like the gangster type.<br><br>Gabin, who had played rough characters before and would go on to play many others, is perfect as the smart, charismatic, but sometimes brutal Pepe.<br><br>It is ironic that the French, so in love with gangster films that they copied American cops and robbers films of the 30s, actually made one of their own in that era that wound up being copied by the Americans.<br><br>This one is well worth seeing.","user":"tprofumo","rank":[49,54]},{"title":"\"Everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and Paris\".","rating":10,"date":"28 March 2007","review":"\"Pepe Le Moko\" (1937) directed by Julien Duvivier - is a wonderful movie with the great performance from very young Jean Gabin. It just happened that I've seen several movies with him in the older age where he is serious, not very talkative man with the head full of grey hair and I like him in the later movies, too but it was so much fun to see him as Pepe - young, charming, dangerous, smart, brutal, irresistible, and so much in love with Paris that he'd lost forever. As much as I enjoyed the film as an early noir and crime, I think it is about the longing for home, about the nostalgia and as such it is even more interesting, deeper, poignant that just a noir. The celebrated film director Max Ophüls, who knew a lot about nostalgia and immigration said about Paris, <br><br>\"It offered the shining wet boulevards under the street lights, breakfast in Monmartre with cognac in your glass, coffee and lukewarm brioche, gigolos and prostitutes at night. Everyone in the world has two fatherlands: his own and Paris.\" <br><br>I could not help thinking of his words when I watched the film. There is one scene that almost reduced me to tears - a middle-aged former chanteuse plays one of her records on a gramophone and sings along with her voice that has not changed at all even if she looks nothing like the picture on the wall from the days of her youth. The time may play very nasty jokes with a woman - she may get fat or skinny, lose her teeth and hair but her voice will stay as strong or tender, ringing or melodious as it was in the long gone days that stay forever in her memory. She sings about Paris and there are tears on her eyes and the scene simply can't leave any viewer indifferent. There is another scene - between Pepe and Gaby the girl from Paris with whom Pepe falls in love (Mireille Balin). They talk about Paris remembering different places which are dear to both of them, and in the end, they both named La Place Blanche where they both belong and not in Algiers's Casbah where Pepe is safe and he rules the world of criminals but can't forget the sound of Metro in Paris. When Pepe wants to tell Gaby that he loves her, he tells her that she reminds him of Metro in Paris... <br><br>I have not even mentioned how masterfully the film was shot by Julien Duvivier and how well it was acted, how fast it movies, and there are so many wonderful scenes that I have not mentioned...Great, great movie.","user":"Galina_movie_fan","rank":[26,28]},{"title":"Before there was Bogart...","rating":9,"date":"12 June 2003","review":"In the greatest gangster film of all time, Duvivier brings to the silver screen a gripping tale of love, passion, friendship and loyalty, as Pépé le Moko (Jean Gabin) reclusively hides in the seedy, underground of the Casbah quarters of Algiers.  Elusive and dangerous, Pépé is considered one of France's most wanted at-large criminals.  However, upon meeting a beautiful \"parisienne\", Gaby Gould (Mireille Balin), Pépé discovers that his heart is in Paris.  Willing to risk his life and freedom to pursue his new love, Pépé takes to the streets of Algiers to find Gaby.<br><br>An enlightening look at French Algeria in the early 20th-century, Pépé le Moko is a cultural and historical masterpiece as much as it is a classic film.  Examining the diversity of the inhabitants of the Casbah and exploring its architectural layout, this film provides for an extremely interesting postcolonial, anthropological, even Freudian (architectural) reading.<br><br>The friendship that develops between Inspector Slimane (Lucas Gridoux), a native Algerian investigator sent to capture the fugitive, and Pépé adds an element of perplexity, as the inspector is caught in a crux of friendship and loyalty and his duty to the state.<br><br>What ensues is a heartwrenching scene between the disconsolate gangster pursuing his beloved Gaby while being pursued by his inspector friend and the French Algerian police.  One of the greatest endings in the history of film, Duvivier exposes the sovereignty of the heart, even the heart of a brazen criminal.<br><br>Duvivier's best effort and the greatest gangster film ever, this film ranks in my top ten of all-time.  To truly understand Humphrey Bogart, Edward Robinson, Robert Mitchum and Al Pacino, one must first discover Jean Gabin, the archetype gangster for the crime genre.  Duvivier's masterpiece is a film that all lovers of cinema simply must see.","user":"BobHudson74","rank":[27,31]}]
