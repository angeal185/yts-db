[{"title":"Labor of Love","rating":7,"date":"21 May 2019","review":"I don't understand the over-the-top negative reviews of this movie. It's as though the viewers were expecting a blockbuster, over-produced cinematic home run. Expectations are different for independent movies - not lower - but different. I expected and enjoyed the interwoven stories and characters that inhabited The Griddle House. It almost felt like I was watching a production at the local playhouse, where all the characters and actors were approachable and believable. The only thing that keeps me from rating this movie higher is the volume of the ambient music; it overshadowed much of the dialogue.","user":"susandinardoh","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"13 robots walk into a diner...","rating":4,"date":"3 December 2018","review":"I have a genuine theory that every character in this film is a robot replicating a human being but not quite well enough. Something about these characters, the way they acted, spoke and the things they chose to do all just sat wrong with me and didn't feel human.","user":"ryansalamence","rank":[5,11]},{"title":"The truth will make your voice shake","rating":4,"date":"3 December 2018","review":"Jack (Luke Perry /Alex Shaffer) stops to help a stranger with car trouble and witnesses to him about his search for his birth mother. He knows she hangs out at the Griddle House. Here we discover some unique characters that are grossly sweet. Jack has three women who could be his mother as he asks questions about their life. Mae Bee (Charisma Carpenter) has a gift where she knows everybody's favorite meal which are all odd. The film has a \"come to Jesus\" goodness and feel to it without Bruce Marchiano harassing people.<br><br>The acting and dialogue fell short of entertaining. The sound in the Jack/ Francis (Clare Kramer) parking lot was uneven with car background noise getting louder or softer depending on who was speaking. Amber Benson plays a prostitute, I think, as they could never say her occupation.<br><br>Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[3,6]}]
