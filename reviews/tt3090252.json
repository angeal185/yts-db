[{"title":"Dinosaur 13 - Incredible Documentary","rating":10,"date":"4 June 2014","review":"I have continually had the conversation that we live in a beautiful era for documentaries that push narratives and transcend what audiences previously believed a documentary could do. I am reinforced in this belief by a handful of films that I've seen, but another such film, Dinosaur 13, will now join those ranks. <br><br>Exposing us to a narrative that few people know, Dinosaur 13 is a roller coaster of a story in the best way possible. What starts as a humble yet passionate following of a group of paleontologists becomes a conflict that is bigger than they could ever expect. I don't want to give any part of the film away because there are so many twists and turns in this story. It is documentaries like this that make me question why even bother with writing stories when there are great ones like this that are more compelling than fiction. I will highlight a few things that I resonated with. First, this is a film about small town USA, in this case Hill City, SD (in close proximity to the Badlands), and the power of community in places like this, both in good times and bad times. Secondly, this is a film about passionate people. The subjects of the film, notably Peter Larson, the paleontologist who is the primary focus, but also the many other folks involved, all share a beautiful love of what they do. Despite all adversity, carrying passion and optimism is a beautiful thing to watch.<br><br>From a craft standpoint, the film is greatly benefited due to a high quantity of archival footage. Had these events transpired 20 years before, home videos would not have been commonplace and it would have to rely more on reenactments and interviews, but instead a good amount of the film actually uses footage, along with some reenactments and some fantastic interviews.<br><br>I am blown away by this story and look forward to watching it again in theaters. Paleontology is essentially the study of history and uncovering the truth in the past: Dinosaur 13 has done the same for this powerful story that should be heard by all. 10/10","user":"Hint523","rank":[42,46]},{"title":"Wonderfully Scripted Documentary","rating":10,"date":"5 September 2014","review":"This is by far one of the most touching documentaries that I have ever seen. A story about the Larson family, who put their heart, sweat and blood into finding and unearthing one of the most dominant dinosaur's in the world. It goes to show that the Government can never be trusted, and for Mr. Larson to not be invited to the opening of Sue in the Chicago Museum is an absolute insult to Palaeontology. McDonald's the obesity king and Walt Disney teamed up and acquired Sue for a Whopping 7.6 Million Dollars. To know that you put everything you have into something and have it taken from you just crushes me. I hope Mr. Larson that one day you discover a 90% intact T-Rex and have it displayed in South Dakota. I wish you and your team all the best. <br><br>Cheers.","user":"ddparkson","rank":[37,41]},{"title":"A must watch for dinosaur lovers and the truth","rating":10,"date":"8 January 2015","review":"This is a must watch for anyone interested in dinosaurs and perfect for college courses.<br><br>This documentary is definitely a roller coaster not like other documentaries as you learn from the hero's, the villains and you learn about corrupt law.<br><br>I went and seen sue in Chicago and this definitely wasn't the story they have on Sue, so I recommend to anyone who has seen this amazing T.Rex to watch this documentary and find out how Sue nearly didn't come to the public eye, and how much of a struggle the true owners went through trying to keep her were she belonged.<br><br>I wish all the best to the Larson Family.","user":"adamleeplaysbball","rank":[17,19]}]
