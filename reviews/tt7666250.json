Raised by a controlling but loving father he is forced to start a ballet school even though he hates the idea. A coming of age story with a strong connection to the time and place, makes for unique viewing.<br><br>Carlos Acosta has co-written the multilayered script with the Scottish writer Paul Laverty. It is mostly focused on Acosta's childhood and his journey to accepting his true calling. The film is also a bittersweet testament to his father, a man with a turbulent personality who never stopped believing in his son's talent.<br><br>Authentic and larger than life, and full of colourful scenery, the film always has another wonder in store. Slightly too long for an independent production it still has a coherent story to tell, about the purest of diamond found in the toughest of places.<br><br>I do not care much about ballet although my education had ensured I know a lot about it. YULI has plenty of ballet on display but it is organic to the storytelling. Yes, there are dance sequences for those who enjoy them, but for those who don't they are short and inventive enough to be fun.<br><br>Here is an extraordinary life story told without bitterness or regrets. There's gratitude instead. And this is how it should be.","user":"mjfhhh","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Fascinating insight into a world class dancer's life","rating":10,"date":"7 May 2019","review":"You don't have to love ballet or dance to appreciate this fine film. It weaves dance , stunningly performed by Acosta and his co-dancers in short, riveting bursts, in with the story of his childhood growing up in Cuba and into his adjustment to being in other countries as a young adult, leading eventually to world recognition.\nAcosta was pushed into dancing by his father, who was extremely tough on him and determined he should stick with a strict practice regime, but now he is grateful for that, as it led to his great passion for dance and the opportunities he later had to perform with the Cuban National Ballet as Principal Dancer and for a long period with Royal Ballet London as Principal Guest Dancer. He now has his own contemporary dance company, Acosta Danza which tours and performs internationally.\nIciar Bollain has taken risks with this unique biopic, with its blend of narrative and dance, but for me and most of the critics whose reviews I've read, it works. It just means you need to shift with the film as it moves between the different stages of his life and the actors or dancers who are portraying him at that point.\nThis bold directing combined with Paul Laverty's honest and heartfelt writing (he also wrote I Daniel Blake) makes for great teamwork and results in a truly compelling watch.\nJust a great shame that UK distribution confined the film to a couple of special screenings (followed by excellent Q&amp;As with Acosta, Laverty and Bollain) and a ridiculously restricted screening run at selected cinemas. Why? This film deserved much wider screening (compare it with Germany, where it was in some 95 locations!). What is happening with foreign title distribution in this country? Don't get me started....Anyway, I feel that Yuli is a film well worth seeking out - and it's not too late to lobby your local cinema!","user":"MariposaLibre","rank":[8,24]}]
