Overall, if you haven't watched it yet, you NEED to watch it!","user":"jtizzlejt","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Uncle Drew laughs and dunks but is very predictable","rating":5,"date":"2 July 2018","review":"What started out as a Pepsi Max commercial then evolved to a YouTube chapter has now taken its next step in evolution... an Uncle Drew movie. For those who haven't seen the original commercial, think Grandmama from the early '90s. Instead of Larry Johnson, insert Kyrie Irving who 'philosophises' youngbloods on the game of basketball and how it should be played.<br><br>Set on the premise of an annual outdoor hoops tournament, Dax finds himself in need of a team to coach just 72 hours before the start of the tournament. Broke, homeless and recently dumped; he heard legends of the mythical \"Uncle Drew\" from his hayday in the 1960's but didn't believe the hype. Until he stumbled into a chance meeting with the blacktop legend.<br><br>As predictable as expected, Uncle Drew agrees to play for Dax under several conditions. First, Uncle Drew choose his teammates. And second, Uncle Drew is the weatherman and can only control the heat in his van. Turns out that's a running joke throughout the film. A funny joke none-the-less.<br><br>The funny scenes are stolen throughout the movie Chris Webber's character is introduced! When you have acting legends such as Shaq, he must be funny. Actually, the two of them are the comic relief in the film. Especially during the baptism and the night club dance off. Apparently, that's a real thing.<br><br>The funny scenes are hilarious, laugh out loud funny. Not just LOL, but actually laugh out loud. The remaining scenes, not so much. And as predictable as the sun rising every morning, the movie ends as expected. With a running time of 103 minutes, scenes still could have been cut. At the end of the day, its a fun summer movie that didn't take itself serious (minus a sentimental moment before the start of the tournament) so the audience shouldn't either and just enjoy the film.","user":"charlie-krausse","rank":[21,25]}]
