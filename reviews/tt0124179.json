[{"title":"Interesting, if not wonderful.","rating":8,"date":"26 July 2003","review":"To say that this movie is shallow, or unrealistic, is to miss the point. While it certainly has a lot to say about sex, and especially sexual fidelity, the point of the film is not that at all, but that concerns of sex are not truly the most important factors in a relationship.  While loyalty and honesty certainly are, forgiveness is still a virtue, and lying about sex is not the same as lying about feelings.  Though I, of course, do not agree with what the female characters in this movie did, at least the movie makes the oft-overlooked point that sex isn't everything, a point seldom made in movies, and often made in life.  Though it is certainly not an exceptional movie, it is worth seeing, and an interesting look into the privileged status sex has attained in our modern society.","user":"aeh16","rank":[22,27]},{"title":"Good Ensemble Acting","rating":7,"date":"31 October 1999","review":"Two Girls and a Guy consists of an extended conversation between three people; a guy played by Robert Downy, Jr and two girls played by Natasha Wagner and Heather Graham.  Both young ladies have been Downey's lover over the past year, and through that time each believed they were his one and only.  Unfortunately they both show up unannounced at his loft apartment to 'surprise' him and discover the charade.  The discovery occurs in the first scene and what follows is a verbal confrontation between the three in which they discuss love, sex, commitment, truth, yadda-yadda.<br><br>I'm not knocking it; the movie is really very good.  The three actors work very well together in what is sometimes fine improvisation.  Definitely worth the rental when you are in the mood for something different.","user":"gbheron","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Wonderful","rating":22,"date":"22 August 2000","review":"I watched it last night and thought it was brilliant.  Robert Downey is just stunning, and the final scene of the movie floored me.  I''m not sure how to use the word pathos properly but that final scene exudes it.  But before that the whole movie is an excellent examination of an actor who can't stop acting and the two girlfriends and mother he loves. Very witty and exciting to watch.  I loved it.","user":"dreadfuldan","rank":[10,12]}]
