Not that I will be watching that remake, but I cringe already at the thought of Hollywood hack and remake specialist giving this an American swirl. All the cliches of bad remaking and safe corporate changes will be applied.

I love the imagination and palette but also appreciate that it aims to remind us of social issues that we should be paying attention to.<br><br>The only reason I don't give our heroes and their story a 10/10 is that I still feel a couple of Miyazaki movies (like Kiki, Chihiro and the racoon dogs) were just that much better and showed a little more imagination.<br><br>Whatever the case I live in fear of the Hollywood announced remake by Hollywood hack JJ Abrams who has never shown any talent or vision. As with others I will ignore and boycott that coming insult and always cherish kimi no na wa.","user":"bup-53144","rank":[426,454]},{"title":"The Japanese Sure Know How To Unleash","rating":18,"date":"18 July 2018","review":"Beauty, Mystery and Creativity, don't they?<br><br>I am scared for the day Jar Jar Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy get hold of this and make the hero a Disney princess and bore all our pants off.<br><br>before Disney gives Kimi No Na Wa the Ghost In The Shell treatment get hold of this original and beautiful film.
