[{"title":"An Enjoyable new generation of teen comedy","rating":8,"date":"24 February 2015","review":"I never herd the term Duff before and I don't know if it exist in real culture, but it made for a humorous movie. <br><br>Bianca Piper is The Duff (Designated Ugly Fat Friend). Though it sounds very cruel when spelled out, abbreviated it just means your not as cool or as hot as the friends you hang around, and if your a teenage girl who was made aware of this by your idiot jock next store neighbor without previous knowledge that you were different from your herd, that could put you on a downward spiral.<br><br>This movie is just more proof that teenagers don't change (technology does and social media plays a very large part in this movie), which is why the movie seems formulated. I would not spoil anything if I told you how it ends so long as you have seen a teen comedy before.<br><br>I find the topic of the Duff fascinating. The character itself has been seen in every teen movie ever. It's always the main protagonist, the semi-cooler kid that wants the protagonist to party and the third wheel, that now has a name. For the first time in teen comedy history(I think) that third wheel got it's own flick and it turns out the Duff is funnier than the one liners we had it say over the course of time.<br><br>Mae Whitman played the character with amusing results.<br><br>I totally recommended seeing this film. highly enjoyable","user":"bbickley13-921-58664","rank":[70,103]},{"title":"Hilarious, yet deep. And, worthy of a second viewing","rating":8,"date":"20 February 2015","review":"The comedic movie, The Duff, is hilarious, relatable and worth watching. The film is about high-school senior Bianca, played by Mae Whitman, who finds out that she is the DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend) of her attractive group of friends. Determined to change her DUFF image and impress her crush Toby, she turns to her popular neighbor Wesley Rush, played by Robbie Amell, to give her a complete makeover. Through her journey of transformation, she gains self confidence and shows the school that everybody is a DUFF. <br><br>Not only do I enjoy that the movie starts off fast, but I really like that it starts with a cool, graphic newspaper clip that explains high school and the different types of people in high school. Being a high school student myself, I was really surprised at how relatable the movie is, especially to today's generation of teenagers. It doesn't just portray the generic, stereotypical high school student that is so outdated. The movie has a lot of familiar celebrity stars that I enjoyed seeing. The performances by Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell, Allison Janney and Ken Jeong are especially hilarious and very entertaining.<br><br>The movie is hilarious, yet deep. Most comedy movies are really funny, yet pointless or lack an overall message. I laughed so often and even shed a tear in a heartfelt scene. The facial expressions are priceless and memorable. I respect this film for being extremely funny while also having a deep, motivational moral lesson and theme. I enjoyed the plot and moral of the story as much the comedy. The movie has a lot of references that are very comical. One example is an episode of the Simpsons that the movie shows. The movie also has really entertaining graphics that make the movie even more unique, some of this include labels and an interactive screen effect.<br><br>This film is one I will watch multiple times and tell my friends to watch, yet I do not recommend it as a family movie. The film may be inappropriate for children under the age of 13 due to inappropriate language and actions. I definitely recommend the movie for teenagers in high school, especially girls. I recommend the movie to ages between 13 and 18. I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.","user":"rannynm","rank":[64,104]},{"title":"I just couldn't believe it.","rating":2,"date":"28 June 2015","review":"The Duff is just another filed attempt by film makers to make a movie from what was actually a great book. There were so many things wrong with this film that I don't even know where to start. The book was about how stereotyping is a pile of crap, yet the film strove to make stereotypes out of the characters. They made Wesley stupid and all about his body, they made Bianca 'awkward' and socially inept, they made Casey and Jessica look shallow and self-obsessed, and worst of all, they made Toby into an indie, guitar playing dreamboy with long hair. All the characters were meant to be AVERAGE (except maybe Wesley, who was meant to be particularly attractive), because the message of the book was that stereotypes don't exist and everyone is actually leading really similar lives and you shouldn't judge. I basically hate this movie and all that it stands for. If I could, I would give it a zero, because I was so disappointed that the makers of it had A* material to work with, real characters and real talk about the world, and they made it just another teen movie.","user":"sarah-lou_12","rank":[25,37]}]
