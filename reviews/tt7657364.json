[{"title":"Utter borefest.","rating":2,"date":"15 October 2019","review":"Wow, was this movie annoying or what. It genuinely felt that every single step the script takes is in order to annoy the viewer even more. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge horror fan, and whenever I review one I take in consideration the year, the budget, the subject and so on, thus do believe me when I tell you Gothic Harvest is nothing more than a skip, skip, skip!<br><br>Nothing intriguing about it, nothing new, absolutely all the clich√©es one would expect from such a production, you will find here. It truly was hard to watch it, all the way through, but with a lot of patience and some alcohol, I did manage to do just that. Did I find it somewhat entertaining? Definitely not, not enough alcohol and not enough boredom for that to happen.<br><br>Sadly to say, this is an absolute pass of a horror movie. It is weak from start to finish. You have been warned!<br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"If I could give it negative stars, I would.","rating":1,"date":"16 November 2019","review":"It's such a pity to see Lin Shayes talents, wasted on a boring, awful, and confusing movie. Let me just say I made an account on IMDb just to give this movie a review. To make sure no one wastes their time. You'll be confused about what's going on for about 35 minutes of the movie. And you'll be groaning and cringing at the acting skills in this, the whole length of the movie. To call it a horror film, is a disgrace to horror films. I had a better time watching Killer Sofa. There is one part in this movie I didn't mind though. The last 5 seconds of the credits. Good luck if you watch it.","user":"mayonnaiseisnotaninstrumentt","rank":[2,4]},{"title":"So bad it's good.","rating":4,"date":"17 March 2020","review":"And I mean it's showgirls good.
