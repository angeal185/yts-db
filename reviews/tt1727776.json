[{"title":"Scouting for an audience","rating":8,"date":"12 November 2015","review":"Horror films in recent years tend to be in the found footage vein, and Zombie films have been in decline since filmmakers could knock them out on low budgets with large amounts of CGI hordes of the undead for the straight to disc market.<br><br>Scouts Guide is a modestly budgeted comedy horror with lashings of gore with plenty of raucous laugh aloud.<br><br>The film does open up with a truly cringe worthy two minutes of inept nonsense with a janitor doing his job, but quickly changes its pace with the introduction of D.O.D. Christopher Landon (son of Highway to Heaven actor/director Michael London) has the guts to run with the laughs and some decent splatter for the next 90s minutes. <br><br>The cast of unknowns are capable and do have the charm and skill to carry the film over its 90 minutes running time. The film does not lag or waste any time introducing parental relationships and defining the social structure of high school culture it exists within its own universe of undead, scouts, strippers, boobs and pussies of all sorts. It's well edited, the script is tight,the photography is bright and clean and is definitely worth a viewing.<br><br>I just hope the producers don't plan a long series of low budget pointless sequels and just let the film find its own appreciative audience over the coming years.","user":"Braindead09","rank":[55,78]},{"title":"How could this have such bad ratings?","rating":10,"date":"4 June 2019","review":"Does no one understand satire? When the movie started, I thought it was going to be a cheap B-rated movie, but TBH, I think they did a really good job of balancing gross, with humor, with double humor, with nudity, and of course... with zombies.<br><br>There are a lot of double entendres in the film, so you have to be listening or watching very closely for them, because you are already laughing at some of it when an even funnier joke is told.<br><br>I loved it. It reminded me of Leslie Nielson movie.","user":"darian-caplinger","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"L m a o !","rating":10,"date":"31 December 2015","review":"I laughed my ass off while watching this movie. I had no expectations to what I was about to experience and I'm so glad because I did enjoy it. The last crazy zombie movie I watched was 'Cooties' which is truly an off-the-wall delight and 'Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse' is right up there with it. Good show!<br><br>The synopsis states three scouts attempt to save their town from a zombie outbreak. But that's really not the plot. Their motive is to save their fellow classmates and one of the scouts sister at a rave party to which the three scouts were not invited. The scouts were given an erroneous address and they must find the real address before the zombie get to the rave first. What they go through to get the address is a laugh riot of grotesque zombie horror that is funny and goofy and perfectly timed.<br><br>Casting, acting, dialog are spot on with the spirit of the movie! Light hearted crazy zombie fun done to perfection!","user":"cekadah","rank":[49,73]}]
