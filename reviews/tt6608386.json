[{"title":"The ultimate fan-football team movie","rating":8,"date":"28 August 2017","review":"An excellent documentary. Chronicling the rise of the Wales football team around 2016. The most amazing thing about this movie that it successfully conveys the impact a national football team can have on it's fans and nation. It really conveys the emotions of the team and fans alike. The whole movie is a bit of an emotional roller coaster. Amazing interviews with Gareth Bale and the team of Wales. This could very well be the ultimate football-fan movie, meaning the ultimate movie that explains the love that fans have for their national team, and the love that players have for their national fans. I wanted to give it a 10, but because it's a documentary and because the subject is a bit shallow (in the end it's just a game, even though I think that is not true), I could not. No documentary can stand up against a Sergio Leone movie, but if there is any, it would be this one, as it conveys a bit of that same emotion; a movie about boys dreams and the reality of life.","user":"Madhu-Van-Paare","rank":[3,3]}]
