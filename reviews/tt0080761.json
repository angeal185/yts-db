[{"title":"Welcome to Camp Blood the classic original slasher that started it all my personal favorite","rating":10,"date":"24 September 2017","review":"Friday the 13th is my all time favorite horror slasher film it is in my top 5 favorite Friday the 13th films. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. It is my second favorite \"Friday the 13th\" movie and my all time favorite film in the horror genre. I love this movie to death and it is instant classic for me. I have the t-shirt about this movie the original film and I always wear it so much I love this film and this franchise. <br><br>I watched this movie 7 years ago when I was a fan of Superntural and I have heard that actor Jared Padalecki was staring in the reboot Friday the 13th (2009) so I decide to checked 4 Friday the 13th movies: Friday the 13th the original, Friday the 13th Part 2, Jason X and of course the 2009 reboot because of Jared Padelcki and I have fun watching them. What can I say? I love this film to death I love it. I got all 11 films on Blu-ray (Freddy Vs. Jason I already had before) this Thursday and I have re watch them all. I watched this film in Friday yes Friday 22th it is a great horror suspense film. I am more a fan of the sequels just this film isn't my number one favorite film but it is in my top fives Friday the 13th films and it is in my second rank in the franchise. <br><br>About the film this is a classic but the death scenes are too slow very slow it is very slow paced. We never see the assailant or who does those murders but when it comes one hour around the movie it self's becomes interesting, intense, fast paced and goes bloody around. Watch the last 30 min's with Betsy Palmer and Adrienne King there showdown, Betsy steals the show in my opinion. The last 30.mins of the movie is worth of watch.<br><br>In 1958 A tragic accident at Camp Crystal Lake a young boy drowns in the lake, while the camp counselors are too busy making out, then a little later on two teenagers are brutally murdered and the Camp is closed down. Then fast forward to 1980 and a bunch of teenagers are hired to open up the camp, despite the warnings and then one by one they are killed off.<br><br>We have a beautiful cast in the film that I like such a: Betsy Palmer, Adrienne King, Robbi Morgan, Kevin Bacon, Walt Gorney, Peter Brouwer, Laurie Bartram, Jeannine Taylor and of course Ari Lehman as young Jason. All those actors were beautiful and excellent to watch.<br><br>I love the gory, death scenes which were nice kills, the special effects were real practical and real done. I love practical effects and not the CGI's that are done today. Why are not horror movies like are this one today? Hollywood doesn't make movies like are this one today. The kills in my opinion were gory real practical. There was a snake that was killed in this movie and no she was not a puppet she was a real snake in this movie that was killed off, so the death scene was for real. The effects are really good and shows even this early, Tom Savini knows his stuff, like the throat slit, axe in the head and the epic head chopped off.<br><br>Directed and produced by Sean S. Cunningham who 5 years later directed and produced my favorite horror film The New Kids I liked that film and watched since I was a teen.<br><br>Adrienne King was fantastic and excellent as the final girl and heroine who survived and defeated Mrs. Voorhees on the end.<br><br>Tom Savini (From Dusk Till Dawn, Dawn of the Dead (1978) does special makeup effects for the film that I enjoy.<br><br>Friday the 13th the original film is my favorite horror film it is a great movie to watch it does kind a get slow the first hour but when Betsy Plamer appears it get's faster around.<br><br>The DVD and Blu-ray has uncut version of the film which I am glad with it, I love this film to death, I enjoy it I love everything they done with the film. It is my number 4 favorite \"Friday the 13th\" slasher horror movie. In my opinion it is Sean S. Cunningham best film he every did. I want see any new films like are this one today.<br><br>In 26. May 2017 Friday the 13th: The Game (2017) was released which I might going to buy it next year for my PC if we get the game in our stores. I also bought Friday the 13th t-shirt with Jason's hockey mask on it.<br><br>R.I.P. Betsy Palmer, Walt Gorney, Laurie Bartram, Rex Everhart and Sally Anne Golden you are missed and I have respect to all of you. <br><br>The first and the original movie get's my Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 by me this is the one that started all the slasher boom, it was \"Friday The 13th\" that started the 80's boom of Slashers, and became a franchise.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[97,120]},{"title":"A Classic, genre defining","rating":24,"date":"24 January 2001","review":"Without a doubt, the work of Cunningham and Carpenter during 1978 &amp; 1980 rocked the world of the horror genre. Friday the 13th is one of the films that to this day still has repercussions. It demonstrated the importance of setting the tone in horror movies, making the audience themselves feel as if they too were being stalked. Cunningham also was one of the few directors to introduce the idea of a possible female serial killer.<br><br>Without this film, Scream's Randy would have never uttered those famous words, 'There are certain rules to surviving a horror movie..' This film combined with Carpenter's Halloween, firmly etched the rules in stone. The creepy music, the infamous \"ch-ch-ch-ha-ha-ha\", the crude photography and the graphic depiction of the murders of the counsellors all blend together to give a classic piece of film history. It scared the hell out of multitudes of teenagers who, in many instances could see themselves in the victims of the stalker. These weren't bad people getting killed, these were just your typical average American kids, having a good time, getting picked off.<br><br>That is what makes this film so defining, that is why, for all its crude and harsh imagery, this is a classic. This is why alot of recent attempts at horror don't measure up. It's not the effects or the blood necessarily, it's the atmosphere and the familiarity that bring it home.It is more frightening to think, \"That could be me\"","user":"Jane FlamE","rank":[97,129]},{"title":"\"Then He's Still Out There\"","rating":7,"date":"29 October 2009","review":"I'll concede right off that it's very hard to be objective in reviewing this movie. The truth is I've never seen it until today, but it's spawned so many sequels and become such a part of popular culture (for better or worse) that it's stamped into your mind whether you've seen it or not. Trying to be objective I'd say - it's not bad. It's not as good as what I would consider to be the classic of the slasher movies (1978's Halloween) but it has some moments of pretty good suspense and somewhat surprisingly to me I found that it wasn't a \"gore-fest.\" There's violence and blood but the murders, while they're portrayed, tend to be shown quickly and the movie moves on fairly quickly. The setting is used pretty well to create atmosphere - the movie is set in a remote camp about to be re-opened after being closed for over 20 years following the murders of two counsellors in 1958. Those murders kick off the movie. There's some decent camera-work, as the camera serves as the eyes of the killer, and at times that effect is used when the camera isn't being used as the eyes of the killer, so there's a bit of uncertainty for the viewer. It is a bit of a chuckle that this movie uses as its setting the classically bad opening of terrible novels (\"it was a dark and stormy night.\")<br><br>The performances were OK, if a little bit forced and artificial at times. Adrienne King did a good job near the end of the movie as the terrified Alice. Kevin Bacon had a role in this as Jack, but it wasn't the lead role, and aside from him no one from the movie rose to any significant stature in Hollywood and there was certainly no Jamie Lee Curtis (see Halloween) among the female leads, although there were many shots of young and cute women in various stages of undress!<br><br>Strange to say, but in some ways knowing the basic outline of how the series progresses adds to the suspense at the end of the movie as to the identity of the killer, and does get you wondering how the heck this is going to lead to sequels - or at least to the sequels it led to, although Alice's last line (\"then he's still out there\") clearly establishes that those responsible for the movie were already looking ahead to the sequels. Not having been really interested in the series before this, I will confess that, having seen the first instalment, I now have a certain curiosity to see how the second instalment is constructed. 7/10","user":"sddavis63","rank":[14,16]}]
