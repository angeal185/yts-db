[{"title":"Shallow, immature, and badly written","rating":1,"date":"24 January 2015","review":"I'm a conservative evangelical Christian (a Calvinist in fact), and I am not exactly proud of this movie.<br><br>At times, it was actually kind of entertaining - mostly because of the laughably bad writing, but near the end there actually were some dramatic moments that affected me. Plus, sometimes I couldn't help but get caught up in the cheesy fun of watching a movie so clearly directed at members of my own community.<br><br>But overall...? Yeah. This movie had a LOT of problems, and frankly it was offensive in a lot of ways. And to be honest, it doesn't reflect very well on believers.<br><br>I think that the entire thing is supposed to teach Christians how to use apologetics to evangelize, but if that's what it's trying to do, don't expect a huge influx of converts anytime soon. The entire movie seems VERY caught up in how stupid, evil and bad non- Christians and atheists are, without stopping for one minute to recognize that HUMILITY is one of the key virtues of our faith. In truth, Christians are literally NO better than other people, and whatever difference exists in our life is not because we're smarter or more moral - it's because of Christ and Christ alone.<br><br>This movie is nothing more than an amalgamation of clich√©s and stereotypes that us Christians unfortunately have. It doesn't put a modicum of effort into thinking about or developing its story or characters because the story and characters already exist in the minds of the Christians watching.<br><br>As a result, the characters are all flat and badly written. Their motivations oftentimes don't make sense. They feel like total non- entities, mere objects upon which the writers rather un-subtly impose their views of the world. This is BOTH bad writing AND vastly weakens the message.<br><br>This movie, because it contains nothing that feels like \"real people\", has limited relevance to the real world. This is basically the movie equivalent of a kids' educational video - it may have vague outlines of characters and plot line, but they have no depth to them. The entire thing just exists to teach something in an entertaining way.<br><br>And that's actually perfectly okay. It's not exactly what I'm looking for in a movie or a Christian movie, but it's not inherently bad. I just wish they had done it in a way that didn't further prejudice and shallow understanding of other human beings.<br><br>EDIT: For the record, I am no longer Calvinist; as of 2019, I converted to Orthodox Christianity.","user":"Talia_the_StoryMaker","rank":[159,200]},{"title":"The most offensive movie I've ever seen","rating":1,"date":"22 March 2014","review":"I have never written a movie review in my life but I was so offended by this movie I felt compelled to say something. I actually went into the movie excited to see a genuine debate about God vs Science. I knew there would of course be some Christian bias as there would be an atheist bias if the movie was made by atheists. However, what this movie turned out to be was a hypocritical piece of propaganda. I will give the movie some credit for bringing up a few intelligent points for the case for god but not enough to redeem it even a little.<br><br>If you are a Christian and are OK with this movie then I suggest you re-watch it after reading this review. I will try not to be overly negative but it will be hard for me. <br><br>1st) Every character in this movie that was not Christian was either portrayed as an idiot (the reporter), a terrible person (the boyfriend), an abusive father (the Muslim), or a God hater (the atheist professor). <br><br>2nd) The atheists professor was apparently only atheist because he was hurt over his mothers death and blamed God. While I will admit this is probably the case for some atheists it is not the majority. Further, being atheist does not mean you hate Christianity or would ever require students to sign an agreement that \"God is dead.\" Not to mention this character is hit by a car at which point the Pastor in the movie runs to him telling him this is his last chance to accept Jesus as his lord and Savior. <br><br>3rd) the LONE Muslim man in the movie is a control freak dad who ends up slapping around his daughter when he finds out she is listening to the bible on tape. I know plenty of Muslims that are very accepting people and this portrayal only enforces stereotypes that are often wildly inaccurate. <br><br>4th) The movie makes a point that without God nothing matters and you can't have morals and everything is permissible. It further implies that without God there is no way to have hope in life. This notion is extremely ignorant and one that any logical Christian would reject. <br><br>5th) The movie ends with a list of court cases proclaiming them as examples of this type of situation, but fails to give any detailed information. I expect that upon further investigation of these cases I will find them to be very very different. I will write in later once i research them.<br><br>Overall, the movie is offensive to anyone thats not Christian and should be offensive to those Christians who have valid arguments for their faith. I do not wish to belittle anyones faith and do believe logical and intelligent discussions can be had without degrading one another. I am not an angry person and very rarely get worked up but by the end of this movie I was almost in tears at how offended and upset I was. Again, this is very uncharacteristic of me. I am not some but hurt atheist in fact I am not really sure what I believe at this point in time but I can guarantee you this movie only made me angry at the Christians who made it and participated in its production. Growing up in a church I have met many intelligent and insightful Christians who I love dearly. This movie was so disgusting in its execution that I almost asked the theater for a refund.","user":"cameronduncan21","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"It's Bad and I'm Sorry","rating":2,"date":"31 March 2014","review":"I am a Christian pastor and genuinely appreciate the efforts of those who try to engage the culture in creative ways. However, someone needs to say this. This movie isn't particularly good. Although it may offer Christians some apologetic material, it will fail to engage the larger culture in any meaningful way. The reason for this is simple. Most Christians seem wholly unable to grasp the difference between propaganda and art. Art is a powerful but subtle tool that draws people in and causes them to question their assumptions without even realizing it . Propaganda is a blunt force instrument for communicating dogma in story form. Without any shadow of a doubt this film is more propaganda than art, and thoughtful atheists will see it for what it is even if Christians can't. Perhaps we need fewer Christians doing art and more artists serving Christ. There haven't been any decent Christian films since \"The Passion of the Christ\" and the \"Chronicles of Narnia.\"","user":"joefred-962-369729","rank":[760,1]}]
