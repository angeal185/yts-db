[{"title":"Absolutely best in this series!","rating":10,"date":"2 April 2005","review":"and i'm not just speaking about technical surroundings like cinematography or editing. It is a more ambitious movie that tries to be as silly and enjoyable as his predecessors. <br><br>It's especially a credit to Tsui Hark for his fast pace because there'll happen so many things in so little time that it makes you sweat, here's a way more rich story and better portrayal of its characters, simply the best even though Hark reportedly lost any creative freedom over this film, but still managed to make it much more hilarious and balanced movie than any other in this fun series.<br><br>It's especially a credit to Tsui Hark for his fast pace because there'll happen so many things in so little time that it makes you sweat, here's a way more rich story and better portrayal of its characters, simply the best even though Hark reportedly lost any creative freedom over this film, but still managed to make it much more hilarious and balanced movie than any other in the fun series.","user":"devilside","rank":[19,25]},{"title":"A very slick Aces go Places film.","rating":7,"date":"24 December 2014","review":"The second sequel to Hong Kong's Aces Go Places, it is a story about King Kong (Samuel Hui), while vacationing in Paris, being kidnapped by a British agent called James (Jean Mersant), who wants to recover one of the stolen crown jewels, the Star of Fortune, supposedly at the request of the Queen of England. King Kong attempts to steal the jewel at the Hong Kong Police Headquarters without his partner-in-crime, Detective Albert \"Baldy\" Au (Karl Maka), knowing.<br><br>Like the previous movie, the plot is fast-paced and full of adventure. the story has slightly less corny jokes and silly action than the previous movie, and incorporates some slick and daring cross-culture references, like the appearance of James Bond villain actor Richard Kiel and Mission Impossible actor Richard Graves. There are also characters named James Bond and Oddjob in the movie - obvious references to 007 films. King Kong trying to pull off a heist while not betraying his partners is a pretty captivating plot.<br><br>There is wild action in abundance, but still doesn't quite capture the fun of the original film. Still, it's worth a watch.<br><br>Grade B-","user":"OllieSuave-007","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"An acquirable taste","rating":8,"date":"19 October 2008","review":"I watched the Mad Missions in order 1, 2, 3 (4 will be next). The first confused me so much that I stopped the viewing and restarted the next day. The second stunned me so much that I re-watched it the same evening. And now this one..<br><br>It is different, with another director, and a much higher budget, it appears. It is still silly, but seems to have grown up and dropped most of the boys' toys the first two featured.<br><br>But I also noticed how with experience one sees a film differently. Had I watched it without context, I might have thought, \"that hairy-beardy police chief is very unconvincing\". But what I thought was, \"Hey, there's Tsui Hark again, the FBI loonie from #2\". And soon to find out he's also the director of this piece. With experience, one starts to feel as part of the family of Sam Hul, Carl Maka, Sylvia Chang (why, I even was at their wedding) ...<br><br>Again there were cute details that made me laugh out loud. Consider a high security access system that plays Tic-Tac-Toe (and can be cheated with extra hardware). There's a glimpse of that old boy's humor again.<br><br>The German CinePlus DVD has the English soundtrack for which I'm very grateful (the German dub added excess silliness). And, if you care to spend another half-hour, a very rich set of cut scenes (some adding new content to the plot, some just out-takes). Silent (just with the title music), but ample proof how much hard work goes into making such a film - innumerable retries of the fight at the Seine, or just the scene in Bond Street which starts at street level and then pans up to a window.<br><br>I must say I have now acquired the Zuijia Paidang taste, and look forward for #4 now :)","user":"suchenwi","rank":[3,4]}]
