[{"title":"Wonderful adaptation of the play","rating":11,"date":"11 December 2004","review":"I liked this movie. I thought it kept it's edge and that was largely because of Madonna. I didn't want to like Madonna in the part...she seemed too flighty, too self-involved. I didn't hold out too much hope for her acting.<br><br>She really surprised me. Not only did she do a wonderful job with the script as given, she also went so far as to watch footage of Eva Peron and got the hand gestures and facial expressions down.<br><br>I also heard that she is credited in obtaining permission from the Argentine government to film at the Casa Rosada. Eva Peron is STILL considered a saint, and they were worried the movie would show her in a bad light. Madonna proved to them (and then followed through on film) that she was going to give the role dignity...to show Eva Peron in a balanced way as a person with flaws, not an evil woman bent on destroying Argentina.<br><br>She actually made the movie for me to the point where I couldn't envision anyone else in the role.<br><br>Antonio Banderas was also a bit of a surprise for me. I didn't know anything about him and kinda considered him eye candy instead of a serious actor. I was pleasantly surprised when I found out he can sing as well as act. <br><br>Jonathan Price was good at portraying a Juan Peron. He could be gentle and kind to his friends, but also showed no remorse for \"removing\" anyone who opposes him. I read in another review of this movie that Price wasn't barbaric enough for the part. Juan Peron WAS very charismatic...he had to be, or else he would NEVER had been elected president.<br><br>One of the things I liked most about this movie was that all the people in it seemed real. The extras were neither overly good looking or freakishly ugly. They looked like anyone you would see walking down any given street.<br><br>The cinematography is splendid, and it's hard to beat the soundtrack.<br><br>It's an 8/10 for me.","user":"wnterstar","rank":[69,93]},{"title":"I loved the movie!","rating":10,"date":"21 February 2004","review":"As a Lloyd Webber fan, I was thrilled to hear 'Evita' being made into a major motion picture. But I had my doubts that Madonna could play Eva Peron. Then I saw the movie and realized Webber's genius in casting her to play the lead. Madonna shines as Evita and proves her vocal talent on 'Don't Cry For Me' and 'Buenos Aires.' Another pleasant surprise was Antonio Banderas playing Che. I had no idea he could sing! And sing he does! He was the showstopper in an excellent role. And Jonathan Pryce...what can I say about the Engineer from 'Miss Saigon'? As Juan Peron, he holds his own against the powerhouse playing his wife. And he has some of the best facial expressions I've ever seen on an actor. 'You Must Love Me,' written specifically for the movie, was the Oscar-winning song for the talented composer; a tribute long overdue, if you ask me. Excellent casting! Excellent effects! Excellent movie!<br><br>To quote TIME magazine, \"You must see 'Evita.'\" Yes, you must. Some of you will love it, some will hate it. But I hope that you all agree that Lloyd Webber is a genius. He is the true star of the film. 10/10","user":"blackberrybabe","rank":[63,88]},{"title":"This movie was phenomenal!!!","rating":10,"date":"14 July 2003","review":"I cannot imagine ANYONE seeing this movie and not being completely blown away by it.  It is one of the most beautifully done pieces of work I've ever seen.  I have never seen anyone act and sing and dance their heart out the way Madonna does in this movie, and she deserved an Oscar as much as anyone EVER has.  She portrayed Eva amazingly, and they made her look so much like Evita you buy it's her.  Madonna stretches her vocal cords incredibly to sing this part, her voice is as gorgeous and strong as ever in this movie, and she sings it fabulously.  She dances...well, like Madonna, with talent and grace and style.  She acts it perfectly, every facial expression, every tear, every line.  After this movie was made, I didn't hear ANYONE ever say Madonna couldn't act ever again.<br><br>Taking the movie from the stage to the screen was hard to do, but the directors and producers succeeded in having it still blow your mind, even on screen.  The scenes are dashing, the way all the pieces are put together is genius.  You love and hate Evita, you sympathize and despise her.  You're fascinated by her though, whatever emotional feelings you may have towards her.<br><br>But don't think Evita's the only thing incredible about this film.  Who knew Antonio Banderas could sing???  I didn't!  He sang great for how hard Che's parts were, and for it being his first time singing.  He also acted the part of Che fantastically.  His chemistry with Madonna is there and he uses it to the fullest to bring out the magic between Che and Evita.  He had an even bigger role to fulfill than Madonna in the transition from stage to film. Madonna is in real life much like Evita so this part was like home for her, but Antonio's stretch to become Che was right on key, and you just love him.<br><br>And Jonathan Price!  Dear God, he was beautiful too, and did again, genius work.  He is a stage actor, so of course he played Juan's intensity just right.  All three of these actors deserved AT LEAST Golden Globes, and Madonna deserved an Oscar, along with the director who blew your mind with the movie, making you laugh and cry.  This movie is in one word...phenomenal.","user":"Para8Dice","rank":[60,85]}]
