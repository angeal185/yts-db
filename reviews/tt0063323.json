[{"title":"'Gilda' Goes Giallo!","rating":23,"date":"23 February 2004","review":"So few Euro directors have done more to exile themselves from the arthouse pantheon than Massimo Dallamano. His work is slick, trashy and stylish in the manner of a fashion supplement in one of the cheaper Sunday newspapers. Yet at least three of his films are compelling studies in morbid sexuality and erotic obsession. A Black Veil for Lisa is nowhere near as famous as Venus in Furs or Dorian Gray, but it's still an intriguing brew. Imagine a giallo version of Proust's La Prisonniere with sex, drugs and serial killings thrown into the mix.<br><br>Like the other two films, it has a protagonist whose physical beauty and sexual magnetism leave her immune to the qualms of everyday good behaviour. Lisa is played by Luciana Paluzzi - a voluptuous, flame-haired tigress who's best remembered as the bad girl in Thunderball. Like almost every Bond girl since Ursula Andress, she somehow failed to become a great star. Bitterly unjust, as Paluzzi in this film is a femme fatale to rival Rita Hayworth in Gilda. We can well understand the anxieties of her drab and dreary husband (John Mills) who obsessively polices her every move.<br><br>The mystery, of course, is why Lisa married this old dolt in the first place. Suspecting his wife of sleeping around, Mills commits a grave breach of professional ethics (he's a police inspector, no less) and blackmails a hunky hitman (Robert Hoffmann) to kill her. Naturally, Lisa and said hitman fall in love...and there are plenty more twists where that came from. A Black Veil for Lisa could never be mistaken for Art. Still, it's a potent reminder that Trash is often more fun!","user":"dwingrove","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"\"She let me in....so to speak\"","rating":6,"date":"23 June 2017","review":"Massimo Dallamano made the great Bandidos and the also great What Have You Done To You Daughters, but here takes things a bit too laid back and therefore we end up with an okay giallo that could have used a nice kick in the arse plot wise.<br><br>It's still interesting enough, mind you. You have a detective (the almost immortal John Mills) who is investigating a series of knife murders in Hamburg (this is where the black gloved killer comes in and this isn't the last giallo set in Hamburg either). The problem is, the detective has this young, hot, young, hot, sexy, young, mysterious, hot, young, tepid, young, hot, young wife who had possible links to a criminal past but the detective's totally over that and he's only phoning her a hundred times a day to see if she needs milk, right? <br><br>So we move from the giallo that has the 'who is the gloved killer?' plot to that other kind of giallo - the kind where you have no idea what everyone is up to until the last ten minutes. Most of the time those turn out to be the more entertaining giallo but we have just a bit too much in the old dialogue stakes here and less on the actual action.<br><br>Still, Dallamano's skills as a cinematographer shine through nice and bright, but for some reason the sleaze that sticks to his other films is missing here. It's still worth tracking down but isn't any lost classic or anything.","user":"Bezenby","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"An intricately-plotted giallo","rating":8,"date":"24 November 2015","review":"The director famous for his controversial giallo classic WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE?, Massimo Dallamano, also directed this earlier contribution to the giallo genre which focuses more on police procedure and investigation over the usual murder-mystery antics that the genre offers, although sex and violence are still main ingredients. This Italian thriller, however, is gripping stuff, especially due to an unforeseen and genuinely impressive twist which comes about halfway through.<br><br>A BLACK VEIL FOR LISA benefits hugely from the setting of '60s Hamburg, the decade reflected by a hummable and stylish soundtrack. The script is intelligent and the characters are particularly well-developed, especially John Mills' increasingly desperate Inspector Bulov whose life becomes more and more complicated throughout. Dallamano directs with the typical Italian flourish of having stylish camera angles and good, colourful photography which makes the film visually appealing. The plot twists and turns as layers of the story are constantly peeled off only to deepen the mystery and make the film more complex to watch (it's never confusing, either, often a flaw of these clever-clever mystery thrillers).<br><br>John Mills is a familiar actor with considerably more fame than most gialli stars, and his appearance is definitely a departure from his more typically Hollywood roles. However, he copes admirably with the complex part and succeeds in creating a likable, believable character whom one can identify with despite all his flaws and mistakes. Robert Hoffmann is also very good as charismatic killer Max, and it's a mark of an actor's talent that he fits the role like a glove. The only out of place character is Lisa, played by Luciana Paluzzi, who doesn't really seem like a woman men would go out of their way to be with, although this is probably a flaw of the character rather than the actress. The supporting cast are uniformly good in their parts. A BLACK VEIL FOR LISA lacks the graphic violence of '70s Italian productions which may be off-putting for some gore fans. However, the combination of strong acting and an excellent plot make this movie really worthwhile after all.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[6,6]}]
