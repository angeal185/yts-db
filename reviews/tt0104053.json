[{"title":"Impossible to recommend, but I liked it","rating":6,"date":"24 March 2005","review":"I'm beginning to laugh at the distinctions people draw between \"good\" and \"bad\" Dario Argento films. They all seem to have some common technical elements: clever camera-work, grotesque but deliberately unrealistic violence, weird music, incomprehensible plots, \"impressionistic\" titles, and poor acting. None of them work perfectly, even for fans of this style. The variations between the movies, then, come from the genre accidentals  \"Profondo Rosso\" is a detective thriller, \"Suspiria\" an occult conspiracy tale, etc.; Argento seems to come along and apply his own unique vision of the giallo onto whatever horror style is fashionable at the time. It's his uniqueness, rather than his ability to produce great films, that has assured his place in the canon.<br><br>So, then, \"Trauma\" turns out to be exactly what we would expect from an early nineties Dario Argento film. Camera-work? Check  even in this late period, Argento's eye and technique are strange and impressive. Violence? Double check  although what the actual purpose of that Decapitron device is supposed to be, I can't imagine. Weird music? Check  orchestral rather than Goblin this time, but still louder and a little more engaged than we would expect. Odd plot, check, arbitrary title, check, bad acting, check  Asia Argento actually manages to make Aura a likable character, but you can't deny that she garbles her lines and seems mostly amateurish throughout. (And she's hardly alone in those respects.)<br><br>The slasher subgenre had died out a bit by this point, but no better reason for Argento to try to freshen it up a bit with his unique stamp. The story's quite watchable and fun, and occasionally funny too - more in the vein of \"Phenomena\" than the early stuff. It's frequently ridiculous, of course, but show me a movie of his that isn't. And while there's a sex element to the film, it has a surprisingly innocent quality, perhaps because Argento was directing his own daughter in the lead. (I'm sure Freud would have a field day with it, though.)<br><br>In the end, it's hard to strongly recommend it to anyone  diehards are as likely to hate it as love it, and casual viewers are going to find his style absurd. So I'll give it a 6.5, with the simple comment that I would watch it again.","user":"kintopf432","rank":[39,48]},{"title":"Underrated Argento chiller!","rating":9,"date":"27 October 2006","review":"Italian horror master Dario Argento's only venture into American film-making was this tight, unique thriller.<br><br>Young man tries to help a troubled anorexic girl catch the 'head-hunter' killer that murdered her parents.<br><br>Trauma is a film that has been given the shaft by many critics, including some of Argento's own fans. Trauma is a step outside of Argento's typical colorful style as it goes for a more subtle look. Still Argento does flair with some creativeness in this film. The camera work and atmosphere are splendid, helping to make the mysterious story all the more intriguing. Pino Donaggio also lends some good music to the film as well. The theme song 'Ruby Rain' sang by Laura Evans is a nicely haunting little piece by itself. Also different from the other works of Argento, this film is rather light on gore, but still manages to have some shocking murder sequences thanks to some wild set-ups. <br><br>The cast is quite good. Chris Rydell shines as our likable young hero. Asia Argento, Dario's daughter, does a decent role as the young victim wrapped up in the mystery. Veteran actress Piper Laurie is great as always as Asia's psychic mother. The supporting cast hold their own too.<br><br>Despite its differences from Argento's earlier classics, Trauma is a fine piece of film-making itself. It's a must-see for Argento fans and just right for those seeking an off-beat thriller!<br><br>*** 1/2 out of ****","user":"Nightman85","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"Underrated, but no masterpiece","rating":7,"date":"25 May 2001","review":"There are some good stuff here to be sure. Argento-fans tend to rate this way down on the scale and criticize it for being to \"americanized\". I don't agree. Sure, there is a certain sense of \"half-baked Argento\" here and there, but I don't find that to be a minus point. If anything, being made in the states, it has more convincing performances and the production values can not be faulted. It's look may seem aneamic if viewed beside \"Suspiria\" or something more of Argento's more gaudy creations, but I think that this is intentional. Cinematography it absolutely top-notch, conveying a suitably spooky atmosphere to many scenes. The story is fairly straight-forward for an Argento movie, but not standard fare, and if this had been made by a newcomer it would have been hailed as very solid suspenser indeed. The plot twists and turns even if the outcome isn't too much of a surprise. However, one thing really bothers me about \"Trauma\". The sfx-work by Tom Savini is truly awful. Some scenes, like the one in the elevator-shaft, start creepy enough but are ruined by the effects overall cheesiness (the falling head is only laughable instead of frightening). Shame on you, Savini! Bring on Sergio Stivalletti! Another thing that's not very good is Pino Donaggios score, which he seems to have composed in his sleep. It's not bad, it's just that it seems so routine. Compared to \"Deep red\" and a few others, this is not Argento at his best. But even Argento at half-speed is better and more interesting than most directors produce within a lifetime.","user":"jangu","rank":[12,15]}]
