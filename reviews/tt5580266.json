[{"title":"Surprisingly nuanced; undeniably effective","rating":7,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"I note the very large number of one star reviews of a film that has only played festivals - hmm, that's curious. What could that be about?<br><br>For the record (and I'm not the film's target audience) this is a rather sophisticated YA film, a mix of teen romance, female self-empowerment, and the politics of Black Lives Matter. Chewy subject matter - police violence, the unconscious racism of bien-pensant privileged whites, divisions within the black community - is treated quite interestingly. There are contrivances, but for all that, it's very well done and I suspect it will be a hit.","user":"neilahunter","rank":[243,426]},{"title":"Just got back from the theater, and yes this film is worth your time...","rating":10,"date":"19 October 2018","review":"Beautiful, thought-provoking, well-crafted gem-thank you to everyone involved in making this wonderful film. Although this film is a \"message movie,\" it's not one told through narrow-minded tunnel vision; I think the author (Angie Thomas) of the book, that this film is based on, understands the frustrating fact that some of the worst issues that need fixing have no quick and easy solutions, and are complex and take time for the human mind to understand (especially to the minds of those who aren't being affected / victimized, who inevitably take longer to understand). Fortunately this movie provides a narrative that can help one consider the issue of racial bias.<br><br>In addition to being a wonderful social commentary, it's also a wonderful film and story in general. Honestly I loved the music, all the scenes, the complexity of the situation the main characters find them in, I loved the ending, and I loved the characters.<br><br>When I saw the 5.9 on imdb but higher critic score, I thought this movie simply got good reviews from the critics because the critics liked that it brought up a real-life issue that needed to be delved into and explored, but that it was boring to the audience who might not care about social issues as much, but now after watching it... I wonder if the people who rated it low even watched the film, or they simply thought it was some sort of ignorant propaganda biased on the trailers. I promise you it's not that; it's a complex, thought-provoking fictional world that mirrors issues of the real world in the best way possible.<br><br>I'm not black btw, and that's all the more reason why I should be a member in the audience; I've never experienced anything like this first hand. If a God said this film could only be shown to every black person in America or every non-black person, I would say with absolute certainty that every non-black would be the ones who need to see it. But it's a really good film for everyone, regardless of race. Even if you're not too interested in social issues, it's just a good story in general to get absorbed in for a couple hours.<br><br>So good... 9/10 from me, but the 5.9 makes me give it a bit of extra credit, so I gave it a 10.","user":"nicholasHasaDog","rank":[177,316]},{"title":"An outstanding, thought provoking, emotional movie.","rating":9,"date":"3 October 2019","review":"Wow. Where do I start?\nI watch movie's of any type and genre If I think I will enjoy it and although (surprisingly) I had never heard of this film, it looked like one I might like. It had been on my planner for a couple of weeks and when I finally saw it I was blown away.\nI am a white male from a poor but not impoverished back ground, I have not experienced any of the events in the film nor do I know anyone who has, but I felt as though I was living the life of the main protagonist.\nThe themes of unity and the situation of feeling like no one listens hit hard and the film worked wonderfully to illustrate how people at the bottom of the pile feel. Whether that be black, white or anything else. This film is not about one particular race over another it is purely about inequality in the structures around us..\nI advise you give this film a watch and make up your own mind on what side of the fence you sit.","user":"ashley_walton","rank":[13,19]}]
