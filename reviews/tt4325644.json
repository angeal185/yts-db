They tried to weave modern political correctness in , and it doesn't fit the times.","user":"madanthonywayne","rank":[1,7]},{"title":"Yeah, you might want to skip on this one...","rating":3,"date":"24 November 2019","review":"While the concept behind \"Union\" definitely sounded interesting when you read the synopsis, the truth of the matter as it unfolds on the screen is something else entirely. And not for the better, mind you.<br><br>The synopsis promises a story about a woman whom disguises herself as a man to survive the ranks of the Confederate troops, whilst struggling to get back to her true love.<br><br>Sure, sounds interesting enough. Although the movie was so unfathomably slow paced that it was an ordeal to sit through. And at a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes, you best prepare yourself with a bucket of coffee, some energy drinks and what have you not... This is not an interesting movie.<br><br>I managed to endure 56 minutes of the ordeal that is known as \"Union\" from writer and director Whitney Hamilton before I called it quits. The lack of an interesting storyline and the fact that all the characters were as colorful and appealing as wet cardboard ensured that I lost all interest in the movie. Actually that happened around the 30 minute marker, but I opted to give the movie a second chance, on the off chance that it would pick up and actually become interesting.<br><br>Needless to say, I am not going to return to watch the remaining 1 hour and 19 minutes of \"Union\".<br><br>My rating of \"Union\" is three out of ten stars, solely because it was set in the American civil war and because they had some really nice costumes and sets. But in terms of entertainment and enjoyment value then \"Union\" was lacking massively on both fronts.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[0,2]}]
