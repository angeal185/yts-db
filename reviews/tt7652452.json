Most kung fu fight scenes in other films I find confusing and boring with bodies and limbs flying about in a tangled mess, but here they come across more convincingly. Considering the film has no star power to carry it everyone acts well albeit tongue in cheek at times. Obviously this film borrows heavily on Die Hard, but hey who cares, well entertaining over a few beers with brain in neutral, go for the ride!","user":"t-coxwell","rank":[8,11]}]
