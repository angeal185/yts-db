[{"title":"At least 10 times better than it looks","rating":6,"date":"2 January 2005","review":"This may look very much like a redundant and unpleasant horror comedy about the umpteenth serial killer wasting a group of film students but, if you give it a chance, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The premise is quite creative, the film pays homage to legendary titles and directors and  believe it or not  there even is tension to detect in the script. Jill Schoelen (The Stepfather, Phantom of the Opera) is the ambitious student Maggie who wants to turn her always-returning nightmares into a screenplay. When she's preparing a horror marathon event with some fellow students, she stumbles upon footage that proves her nightmares are real and that she might even be a completely different person. During the movie shows at the remote theater, an actual murderer shows up and goes after Maggie. Granted, Popcorn is an 80's slasher in disguise but at least it tries to be ingenious on several levels. The invented titles that are shown during the \"horrorthon\" also have potential if you ask me! Who wouldn't pay money to see flicks called \"The Amazing Electrified Man\",\" Mosquito\" or \"The Stench\"? I sure would As said before, some sequences are quite suspenseful (like the eerie \"possessor\" film) and the murders aren't too gross. I had some prejudices as well before watching it but I'm glad to admit I was wrong. Too bad the last twenty minutes (and the climax in particular) are a bit of a letdown. Logic wasn't Popcorn biggest trump to begin with but, near the end, director Mark Harrier completely loses his grip on the messy screenplay. Also, the humor most of the time is painfully unfunny (for example on of the male leads constantly bumps his head or falls down) and irritating. Best aspects truly are the light-headed atmosphere, creative plot-twists and very good costumes and scenery. Surely this underrated gem beats the overload of 80's and 90's no-brain horror productions. Check it out!","user":"Coventry","rank":[27,32]},{"title":"A good time classic","rating":7,"date":"1 December 2004","review":"This has got to be one of my old favorite horror flicks, I remember renting this when it first came out, and I loved it since then!<br><br>The storyline of this movie is so classic and original, but thats what it made it so great! <br><br>I was a little shocked to read that Toby (Tom Villard) had passed away, I had no idea, he was one of my favorite movie psychos, and I was wondering if he'd be in any other movies...R.I.P Tom Villard. <br><br>If you haven't seen this movie, rent it now! Or since its been released on DVD, pick it up! remember, \"Buy a bag, go home in a box.\" !","user":"DrGigglesX","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"Very entertaining and original.","rating":22,"date":"22 September 2001","review":"This is a really well-done, early nineties horror flick that actually made it to the theaters.  At the time this was a very original movie.  It was back in the day before Scream (hate what that movie did to horror) and all the clones dominated the horror box office.  <br><br>It all starts when a group of film-students looking to raise money, fix up an old movie theater for a one-night-only horror festival.  They plan to show 50s horror flicks using old gimmicks (aroma-rama, 3-D glasses, and shock seats).  In a box of old junk they find an ancient film reel containing some really graphic and disgusting footage of an insane, demonic looking hippy chanting \"posessor\"  in a reallly sick voice.  One of the students is shocked to discover that the man in the film is the man who has been plaguing her dreams lately.  The festival rolls around and all is fine until someone starts offing the students one-by-one.  It then turns into a whodunnit and things never get boring<br><br>I enjoyed \"Popcorn\" because it was a highly original take on the slasher genre and it was before there was any other films like it too rip-off. There are a few cliches but the acting is top-notch from a great cast.  Ray Walston had an amusing cameo and Tom Villard was never better.  It's a shame that he's not around any more.  The guy had a lot of potential and was very underrated.  <br><br>I was lucky enough to find this film for sale in a video store that was going out of business.  It may be kind of hard to find (don't know if it's available through Amazon) but if you can find it, it's definitely worth seeing.","user":"billybrown41","rank":[7,7]}]
