[{"title":"A Milestone Of Science Fiction And A Cyberpunk Masterpiece","rating":11,"date":"11 February 2018","review":"A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the \"final cut\" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was intended by its director). <br><br>It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as \"cyberpunk\", and it was also the first \"film noir\" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere \"eye candy\", it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.<br><br>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br><br>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/","user":"gogoschka-1","rank":[158,194]},{"title":"A glorious, timeless nightmare","rating":10,"date":"25 July 2006","review":"Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982).<br><br>Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion.<br><br>Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling.<br><br>In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film.<br><br>Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. <br><br>10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)","user":"Flagrant-Baronessa","rank":[490,645]},{"title":"Still outshines the others 17 years later","rating":9,"date":"5 August 1999","review":"Blade Runner belongs on a list of 2 or 3 movies that had me walking out of the theater in a stupor as though hit by a sledgehammer, the first time I saw it. It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.<br><br>There is so much to take in visually, intellectually, and emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at the first viewing trying to sort it all out. Unlike the so-called \"entertainment\" we get today at the movies, this film didn't spoonfeed its meaning to you. It left the ending ambiguous so your imagination has to supply it.<br><br>The film demands discussion. There are so many topics to debate. Is Deckard a replicant? Do Deckard and Rachel live happily ever after? Why is there a unicorn in the director's cut? Is Deckard a hero? Or are the replicants really the good guys? Every time I watch it, my answers change.<br><br>I may be one of the few that really likes the original. Probably because I've seen that version a couple dozen times since 1982 before the director's cut came out. This may contradict what I said earlier about being spoonfed, but I liked the narration because it explained what was going on in Deckard's mind. And I didn't mind the \"happy ending\" because it still implied that their troubles may not be over. \"I don't know how long we had together. Who does?\" But with that version memorized, I now appreciate the directors cut. It probably has the better ending. (At least I think so until I view it again!)<br><br>It's also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, and Edward James Olmos. I think they all did a great job. And Vangelis did a beautiful, moving score.<br><br>After \"Blade Runner\", most of the big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down to good guys vs. bad guys with lots of loud explosions and in-your-face effects. Very simplistic messages, if any. That's why I still contend that an \"oldie\" like Blade Runner still outshines them all. It has incredible special effects, but never at the expense of the story. The cityscapes do more than dazzle you, they involve you.<br><br>The more I think of it, the more I realize that \"Blade Runner\" is not only my favorite science fiction movie, but one of my favorite films in any genre. I wish Ridley Scott would return to science fiction, but then again today's Hollywood would never release a movie like \"Blade Runner.\"","user":"Ivan-28","rank":[346,454]}]
