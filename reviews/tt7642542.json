Marie looks like a porn star. Overall, this story is good and the production is right on track. However, at times it seemed like I was watching an extended commercial for Hallmark Christmas Ornaments. A little product placement is OK, but let's not create an entire movie themed around pushing our product. That being said, I need to get some Hallmark Christmas ornaments.","user":"zyxnix","rank":[14,20]}]
