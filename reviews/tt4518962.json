[{"title":"Ugh. Don'e listen to the FAKE reviews","rating":1,"date":"14 March 2018","review":"Just another \"let's get people in a room and let them kill each other\" SAW-ripoff movie, without any memorable kills. Cheap effects (Cameras in their heads? Really? And I saw that fake machete chop you did there), large plot holes (Where did the scars go? 6 hrs wandering around palates without anything happening?), bad dialog. Painful to watch. Without the fake reviews, probably gets a 2 or 3, but gave it a one just to even this crap out.","user":"DrRicketts","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Dumbest. Movie.

Climbing the damn pallets?!?!?<br><br>Few good ideas.\nI enjoyed the musical score and some of the acting wasn't bad. <br><br>But, it was such an incredibly dumb movie in so many groan out loud ways (too many to list) that it shatters any sense of escapism or interest early on. <br><br>Still, I've watched much, much worse. \nEspecially recently! <br><br>If this kind of horror floats your boat then give it a go, me personally......
