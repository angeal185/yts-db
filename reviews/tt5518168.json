You won't miss much here.","user":"Rastifan","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Has the potential to be a good weekend or evening watch but is completely ruined by the lead.","rating":6,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"The film overall was pretty enjoyable with mixed acting but majorately those close to the lead were fairly good actors. The lead however, let the film down with her over the top facial expressions and inability to express any kind of emotion except pain constantly throughout the movie, it would have passed as an 8/10 had they brought in a better actress to play the lead. Also the girl who plays the bully was a shockingly bad actor , her role felt unnecessary in the film and the CGI was sub par in some area's.","user":"chogan-89367","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"Most actors were terrible","rating":1,"date":"30 July 2019","review":"The main character is so awful at acting there about 3 people who can act in this film","user":"nagmaidris","rank":[6,10]}]
