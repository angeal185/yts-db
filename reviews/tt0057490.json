[{"title":"Disturbing but fascinating psychological drama","rating":27,"date":"27 December 2001","review":"Back in the late 1960's or early 70's I discovered this creepy psychological drama on local late-night TV.  Once seen, it's never quite forgotten, and it's fascinating to see it once again beautifully restored and uncut in its new DVD release.  Aspects of it stick with you years later, most especially the dark, moody torch song with some bizarre lyrics which is played repeatedly throughout the story on Mr. Tony's record player, seeming more sinister with each successive playing.  By the time of its final hearing near the end of the movie, its effect is so oppressive that it's a relief when the record player is violently shoved off the table.  One telling detail is in the scene where Mr. Tony is left alone after Barrett and Vera are expelled from the house, and his fiancee Susan also disappointedly leaves him.  He dejectedly goes to an upstairs bedroom, and on the wall above the bed we see pictures of male body-builders.<br><br>The cast is uniformly excellent.  This was apparently James Fox's film debut, as his credit indicates `Introducing James Fox.'  He was obviously an experienced actor, though.  In contrast, four years later he was affecting an American accent, singing and dancing, and amazingly, looking even younger in `Thoroughly Modern Millie.'<br><br>This is the sort of role that I always associate Dirk Bogarde with.  The way Barrett's malevolent character is gradually revealed, not just through the script, but through Bogarde's facial expressions and body language, is a credit to this great actor's skill.  This is one dangerous guy.<br><br>`The Servant' is a real gem of early 60's British film.","user":"Bobs-9","rank":[45,48]},{"title":"Superb, sinister movie","rating":9,"date":"25 November 2002","review":"This is a superb, sinister movie of the very highest class.  Unlike the character Tony (James Fox) who is upper class without being high class, if you get my drift.  You cannot really sympathise with Tony, who toys with some high falutin' development projects but basically is a wastrel just waiting to be ponced off.  Tony is a later-day Bertie Wooster.  The sinister element comes from the servant (Dirk Bogarde), who is no Jeeves.  Barrett, like Jeeves , is a gentleman's gentleman or valet (not a butler as suggested in some other comments on this film).  Tony needs a valet because he is incapable of doing anything much without help.  Barrett and his accomplice Vera (Sarah Miles) take Tony to the cleaners, sweeping aside the fiancee Susan (Wendy Craig) in their wake.<br><br>Harold Pinter has written the screenplay in similar vein to the superb movie The Accident, also a Losey piece, which I also commend. The cinematography in both movies is simply excellent.  The subject matter of The Servant suits Pinter, although much of the screenplay is not really in Pinter's voice. However, there is one scene, set in a restaurant, which includes a tiny cameo by Pinter himself and which contains a short Pinteresque exchange between two women.  There is also one tense exchange between Susan and Barrett \"do you wear deodorant\" etc. which is very reminiscent of a scene in The Caretaker \"you stink from arsehole to Thursday\" etc.  Indeed the story of The Servant resembles The Caretaker in many respects, except that in The Servant the interloper, Barrett, is on top and stays there, whereas in The Caretaker the interloper, Davies, lacks the skill and circumstances to dislodge the incumbent.<br><br>There is a homoerotic undercurrent to the film and this works so well because it is an undercurrent (in 1963 there could have been no more than an undercurrent even if they had wanted more).  The overt debauchery with Vera and the orgy party towards the end of the film is the only bit of the film that has aged without grace.  But I quibble.<br><br>This is a truly great film and it deserves to be more widely known.","user":"ian_harris","rank":[62,70]},{"title":"Dark psychological drama","rating":8,"date":"30 August 2009","review":"Dirk Bogarde is \"The Servant\" in this 1963 film written by Harold Pinter and also starring James Fox, Sarah Miles, and Wendy Craig, and directed by Joseph Losey.<br><br>Fox plays Tony, a wealthy young man who doesn't do much in the way of work. There is vague talk of a project or two, but basically he fools around with his girlfriend Susan (Craig) and that's about it. He hires Hugo Barrett (Bogarde) as a manservant. Barrett is quiet and efficient, but he makes Susan uncomfortable, and she encourages Tony to get rid of him. Barrett brings in his sister Vera (Miles) as a maid for the household, and it doesn't take her long to seduce Tony. He later finds Barrett and Vera in his bed and learns that they're not related - except in purpose.<br><br>This is a fascinating, murky psychological drama about seduction, the classes, and the strong versus the weak, with homoerotic undertones. The servant slowly becomes the master by preying on the vulnerabilities of a purposeless upper class playboy.<br><br>The John Dankworth score, with vocals by Cleo Laine, has been mentioned. Frankly, I found it intrusive sleazy '60s music that contributes to dating \"The Servant.\" It's a shame, because the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is exceptional, showing the house as it changes throughout Barrett's tenure and its gradual darkening, and his use of shadows and odd angles is exemplary.<br><br>The acting is tremendous, with James Fox pathetic as the weak-willed Tony, and Sarah Miles sexy and vulnerable as Vera, and Wendy Craig is appropriately cold as Tony's fiancé.<br><br>But the star is Dirk Bogarde. As a predator of the weak and corruptible, Dirk Bogarde is fabulous - restrained, sinister, dignified, he gives no doubt who holds the power in the household. And when he drops the manservant act, shirttails hanging out, hair uncombed, and cigarette dangling from his mouth, he's downright scary. Bogarde began a new, non-matinée idol career for himself beginning with 1961's controversial film Victim, and his roles would grow more and more interesting as the years progressed. Bogarde is well-known in the U.S., perhaps becoming increasingly more well-known with his films being shown on TCM, but it's hard for us to measure his tremendous fame overseas. It's probably on a par with Gregory Peck's - they were both post-war stars who worked into the late '90s. My sister lived in England in the '70s, and I asked her if he was big over there, and she said, \"Uh - YEAH.\" Definitely worth seeing for the direction, acting, camera-work, and those Pinter touches.","user":"blanche-2","rank":[25,28]}]
