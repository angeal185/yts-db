[{"title":"Very very funny","rating":10,"date":"8 September 2019","review":"I wasn't sure about this film to begin with but it was really good. The story is very good but it's the laughs that really make it great. The cameos are perfect, Johnny Vegas perfect. We all laughed out loud at points. Don't read the bad reviews just watch it yourself :)","user":"jamiejunglehead","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Eaten by Lions","rating":6,"date":"1 April 2019","review":"Comedy drama.<br><br>Starts very strong with a heart-warming plot and frequent LOL humour.<br><br>Two half-brothers Omar and Pete are on a journey to find Omar's estranged father after their granny (who looked after them) passes away.<br><br>Pete is played by Jack Carroll, who UK viewers might recognise, but might not know why? He was a very young comedian and runner up in a recent Britain's got Talent contest. I think he was well cast and showed he can be a first rate actor as well.<br><br>Also stars Johnny Vegas, another well-known UK comedian, who wasn't used enough, he stole every scene. This is a great British film, which unfortunately really loses its way during the Rolls Royce sketch.","user":"brankovranjkovic","rank":[9,15]},{"title":"Lots of laughs paper over the cracks","rating":7,"date":"1 April 2019","review":"The film isn't perfect and has a slight feel of cheap TV movie but the gags are written well most I've laughed at a film in quite some time and is mostly well written. The storyline gets by and great cameos by Johnny Vegas and others hold it together. Overall an enjoyable film even if it didn't feel slightly tacky and jumpy storyline wise at times.","user":"muamba_eats_toast","rank":[7,15]}]
