[{"title":"Predictable and shallow","rating":3,"date":"3 May 2014","review":"When I watched The Wedding Pact I knew from the start that it wouldn't be a blockbuster but I didn't think it would be so bad.<br><br>Truth be told, the lead actors actually seem quite talented and both Haylie and Chris gave a great overall performance considering the awful plot. They demonstrate good chemistry, seem experienced and show a lot of potential. Scott Michael on the other hand looks a bit unconvincing at times but, hey, this was not Shakespeare.<br><br>What I really disliked was the poor, predictable, boring and somewhat unintelligent scenario.<br><br>I do not know much about directing a movie but quite a few of the takes reminded me of amateur movie scenes. There are others. quite a few of them actually, which are unrelated to the plot and just exist as time fillers, which is fine, even the best movies have them, but they were so random and obvious I thought the director thinks that the viewer is unintelligent. This is what urged me to write this review.<br><br>There is no imagination in the storyline whatsoever; it just feels like it's a product of a 9 year old girl's summary of a single Archie's comic book of 15 pages.<br><br>Overall I would say that if you have an hour and a half to spend, better watch something else unless you're 10 and play with Barbie dolls.","user":"djgenesis","rank":[31,32]},{"title":"The dullest movie I watched in a long time.","rating":1,"date":"17 May 2014","review":"My wife is into romantic comedies and I end up watching lots of them. Some I tolerate, some I even enjoy. Well, not this one. This is without a doubt one of the most insipid movies I have watched in a long time.<br><br>Rarely one has the chance to see a movie without a single redeeming quality. Well this is the one: the acting is bad, the script is worse, the dialogue is so dull it's like watching a pair of goldfish staring at each other in an aquarium, the characters and their motivations are so two-dimensional and clich√© you feel like you are watching cardboard cut-outs acting.<br><br>It's not the worst movie ever made, it's just bad and dull and I cannot honestly recommend it to anybody.","user":"camaway","rank":[22,24]},{"title":"Horrible waste of time - go to acting school!!!","rating":1,"date":"26 July 2014","review":"This film had absolutely no storyline, no budget, no actors worth watching. The parts that were supposed to be funny just weren't - not only because of the bad jokes but also due to bad performances of all the actors. Acting wise, I felt like watching a porn movie just without the naked people. The dog was the best actor in the whole film. This review has to be at least 10 lines long to be submitted, and to be honest there is absolutely NOTHING left to say about this movie to fill up that space. But to give some examples: the way the characters met was completely random, the fake wig of the main character in his college outfit was just too obvious. The poor attempt to make the movie more 'artsy' by moving back and forth in time doesn't work, just seems like the editor was asleep himself while trying to edit this film. Maybe that's due to the extremely slow pace of this film in general and especially the first 15 minutes. Watch this movie only when you're into masochistic activities... can't wait for the sequel...","user":"Manchu2","rank":[6,6]}]
