I was surprised at the fact that this was his most underwhelming role to date! <br><br>Danny Dyer has played acceptable roles as the underling to hard men in some of his previous movies, but it seems that in a few of his recent movies, he's been elevated to 'boss-man' status, and his acting inabilities are now shining through.<br><br>When I read the plot, I thought the movie had a little potential, but terminal disappointment set in after 15 minutes, and all I could do was wait impatiently for the monotonously predictable ending. <br><br>I have nothing against Danny Dyer per se, but giving him a lead role in any movie is a recipe for serious face palming.<br><br>I'm feeling generous, so I'll give it 3/10","user":"CharlieHound","rank":[36,44]},{"title":"Splode my head now please.","rating":3,"date":"3 October 2011","review":"I'm about 50 minutes into the movie and I can't get passed their voicing. I mean seriously, it's like they're all reading from the same script as they're going. It's pretty bad. And don't get me started on the girlfriend; she can't even speak proper English. The main character, Sean Faris, I've seen him in multiple other movies and he's done a good job, not so much great, but good job at the roles he's played. Never Back Down, awesome movie IMO, Forever Strong, same deal. But this, OMG, this is movie is completely unbearable. <br><br>It takes about 40 minutes for the movie to even take off and at that point, its halfway over with. <br><br>The only thing that's keeping me even remotely interested is the fact that I'm a slight fan of Sean Faris and I love Parkour. <br><br>Overall, movie is horrible. Horrible Effects, Horrible Voicing. Horrible Actors. Horrible Plot. Horrible Looking 'Hot Chick' etc.","user":"ADtheThird","rank":[48,61]}]
