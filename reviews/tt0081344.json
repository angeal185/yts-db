[{"title":"The best TV production ever.","rating":9,"date":"3 April 1999","review":"Firstly I have to say that this is not your usual stereotype Jewish holocaust movie: It goes much, much beyond any ideological rhetoric, to deal with Human condition.However, you have the Concentration Camp as a background for one of the best contemporary playwrights (arguably The best!) to create and develop his masterpiece .It is worthwhile to know that Arthur Miller persisted in his demand to put Venessa  Redgrave in the the leading role, in spite of all the threats and protests of JDL.Here, she presents one of her most magnificent performances as an Artist trapped in the most dehumanizing conditions one could imagine.The dialogue is absolutely superb, and the actings are quite decent.A must see.","user":"hooshi","rank":[34,39]},{"title":"An astonishing masterpiece","rating":11,"date":"11 November 2004","review":"It is amazing to me that this film is pretty much unavailable in any format.<br><br>What a cast. Vanessa Redgrave. Jane Alexander. Marisa Berenson. Verna Bloom. Melanie Mayron. And a subtle and evocative script by none other than Arthur Miller.<br><br>A summary of it sounds unpleasant and harrowing and to a certain extent it is. But there is extraordinary beauty in this daring and unusual picture. A group of women, all musicians, are allowed by the Nazis to remain alive on the condition that they amuse their captors with music.<br><br>It simply must be seen, and will never be forgotten. See this picture any way you can. I am sure that in time it will be rediscovered and seen for the sublime utterance that it is.","user":"surreal_subtext","rank":[33,38]},{"title":"superb performance by Vanessa Redgrave","rating":10,"date":"2 February 2000","review":"Playing for Time deserved theatrical release, but as TV fare, perhaps among the finest, ranking up there with The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. Being a Jew, I received a lot of flak for applauding Vanessa Redgrave's magnificent performance, but one needs to separate the art from the politics.  While physically Ms. Redgrave does not at all resemble the real Fanelon, one can't help feeling that she captured the role.  My only criticism is the newswreel type footage used to depict the moving trains. First rate movie","user":"sroimoi","rank":[23,26]}]
