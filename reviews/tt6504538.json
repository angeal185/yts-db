[{"title":"LEAD ACTORS MAKE THE MOVIE","rating":7,"date":"19 September 2018","review":"Story isn't particularly original but the performances are what sell this action comedy/thriller, most notably Tom Everett Scott's and James Jurdi's. Their connection and dynamic from the first scene to the last is what kept me invested in this otherwise entertaining but formulaic piece. Some good action scenes sprinkled throughout, but Scott and Jurdi's chemistry and rapport is what elevated this above the norm.","user":"armineaction","rank":[71,78]},{"title":"A COMEBACK ROLE FOR TOM EVERETT SCOTT!","rating":10,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"I've loved Scott ever since \"That Thing You Do!\" but haven't seen him in material that did him justice in years. \"Danger One\" finally gives him a meaty role that he was born to play, and he delivers arguably his most charismatic turn since playing Guy the drummer in the above mentioned Tom Hanks classic. It doesn't hurt that he's paired with able talent like O'Hare and Jurdi, who plays off him nicely and develops an unlikely buddy rapport. Still, this is Scott's movie, and he has long been in the background, but here he shines front and center.","user":"mreviewer82","rank":[82,91]},{"title":"Good buddy action comedy","rating":9,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"Reminds me of films from another, with shades of \"Lethal Weapon\" and \"After Hours.\" The buddy comedy element between Tom Everett Scott and James Jurdi is the best thing in the movie -- their rapport and chemistry makes the viewer root for them and hope they survive the night. Fun movie overall.","user":"moviemaven-98866","rank":[75,83]}]
