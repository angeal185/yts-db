[{"title":"Charles Bronson vehicle confronting pimps and punks in this extremely violent fare","rating":4,"date":"22 February 2011","review":"This thrilling picture titled Kinjite (which means \"to forbid\" in English) contains suspense , noisy action-packed , intrigue , thrills and lots of violence . The meaning and relevance of this movie's title is that it refers to subjects such as sex, child molesting, prostitution which are forbidden topics in Japanese culture . It deals with the cop Lt. Crowe (Charles Bronson , he was about sixty-seven years of age) who takes on a pimp (Juan Fernandez) and a slimy hoodlum (Sy Richardson) whose speciality is recruiting adolescents including the daughter of a Japanese business man (James Pax). The lieutenant married to Kathleen (Peggy Limpton) has a teenager girl (Amy Hathaway) and is helped by another policeman (Perry Lopez). He then stalks the baddies and takes the law into his own hands , acting as judge , jury and executioner ; searching vengeance on crooks , pimps making the neighborhood safer and bumping off delinquents and street scum.<br><br>This standard Bronson movie is full of action , thrills, and disturbing scenes . Bronson in his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapons such as ¨Harry the Dirty¨ and killing mercilessly nasties . This is the last movie Charles Bronson made for Cannon Films and it represents the tenth and final of ten teamings between producer Pancho Kohner and star actor Bronson . It's certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Lt. Crowe Bronson's side . Disagreeable scenes and loathing theme as abuse of children with terrible end . Screen debut from Baywatch's Nicole Eggert as a teen prostitute and Danny Trejo as an inmate in a final brief appearance -almost extra- . Unappropiated and anti-climatic musical score composed by means of synthesizer . <br><br>The fare was badly directed by J. Lee Thomson , in his last one , he previously had a nice track record in the English cinema from 1950 until 1961 , directing good Western (McKenna's gold , White Buffalo) and all king genres as Sci-Fi (Conquest and Battle of planet of apes), terror (reincarnation of Peter Proud, Eye of the devil), adventures (Flame over India ,Kings of the sun, Taras Bulba , Tiger Bay) and Warlike (Guns of Navarone, Von Braun , Chairman , The passage) . His two biggest successes turned out to be ¨Guns of Navarone¨and ¨Cape Fear¨. Thereafter , the filmmaker's career subsided in a morass of slickly realized but middling films . He moved into the field of international spectaculars , at which point his filmmaking seemed to lose its individuality . J. Lee Thompson working from the 50s in England, finished his career making Chuck Norris (Firewalker) and Charles Bronson vehicles (Caboblanco, Evil that men do , Messenger of death, Death Wish 4 : Crackdown, Caboblanco, St Ives). Rating : Below average . Lousy results for this disagreeable thriller that has many depressing failures.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"A Diet Of Rolex","rating":4,"date":"24 August 2008","review":"When great director/actor combinations are talked about the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned. Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre. Unfortunately Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter. <br><br>That's sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better. But for the life of me I don't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl, a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out. That might have been good for another film altogether, but it served no purpose here.<br><br>A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals. That part could also have used a little explaining as well. But he's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl.<br><br>Bronson's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history. In fact in the film's best scene, Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire.<br><br>At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack, he sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez. But that's another terribly big hole in the plot.<br><br>Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez. I wish the whole film had been better though. This was the last film of the Bronson-Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last as a director. He should have gone out with something better.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[17,24]},{"title":"Still Kickin' at 68","rating":7,"date":"12 February 2005","review":"This is the last movie that Charles Bronson made before the death of his second wife, actress Jill Ireland. At 68 and with a string of mediocre action thrillers littering his 1980s output, this sleazy cop movie turned out to be one of his better efforts of the decade. Bronson plays vice detective Crowe, a racist veteran of the force who has grown weary of seeing the scum of Los Angeles dragging innocent children into prostitution and drugs. A parallel storyline follows visiting Japanese businessman Hiroshi Hada (James Pax) who struggles to adapt to American values and soon after arriving loses his young daughter to slimy pimp Duke (Juan Fernandez). Crowe has already had run-ins with Duke, so when he is assigned to find Hada's daughter, the stories merge with tragic results. Bronson is still trim and performs well as Crowe, with several good action sequences. Largely maligned as an actor because he underplayed his leading roles, Bronson always fit this type of role because you could believe that he actually does the things he is portraying. There is a nice little scene involving an ethnic event where Crowe vents his frustration on some startled Japanese that speaks volumes about character motivation. Juan Fernandez is exceptional as Duke and makes his character truly evil. Veteran British director J. Lee Thompson does a fair job of keeping the movie plugging along and has a great set piece at the end of the movie involving a crane and crashing automobiles. The subject matter isn't as exploited as it could have been, but it's still pretty rough and loaded with nudity and violence. Bronson fans won't be disappointed and even non-fans (like my wife) enjoyed it.","user":"bodine-1","rank":[18,26]}]
