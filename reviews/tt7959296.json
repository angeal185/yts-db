[{"title":"Animal carcasses and hard liquor","rating":8,"date":"7 April 2020","review":"For a low budget independent Aussie B-grade film, this was surprisingly and impressively entertaining!<br><br>This is novice director Heath Davis' third full length film, and he did not disappoint. And considering this is amateur writer Angus Watts' first ever dabble in filmmaking, his screenplay was better than some seasoned writers work I've seen lately. Cinematography was on point, with excellent landscapes. Casting and performances were great, and Jessica McNamee was certainly easy on the eyes. The editing needed some work, and the score, albeit fitting for the genre, was way too loud, I could barely make out the dialogue in some scenes. The pacing was a little slow, but bearable with the short and comfortable 85 min runtime.<br><br>This certainly isn't no big budget Hollywood blockbuster, but for a low budget indie film put together by newb filmmakers, it is undeserving of of anything under a 5 - new filmmakers have to start somewhere and should be rated based on their experience. Sure it's no 10 either, but it is very deserving of my 8/10.

Just because it isn't the worst movie doesn't mean I recommend watching it. Maybe if your stuck at home because of a global pandemic. But only then.<br><br>I watched this based on some of the reviews written here praising it. It amazes me how some people see something and call it art while others are not impressed.<br><br>This movie isn't the worst movie I have ever seen, and I watched the entire thing. I wanted it to be good. The camera work was good, the audio was good, the acting was okay. The story, however, was like a madlib, a bunch of things thrown together that supposedly create a story.<br><br>It's pretty out there by the time the \"great reveal\" rolls around near the end. The foreshadowing is gross and not necessary, that entire part of the movie could have been left out, including the great reveal. It was nonsensical and had nothing to do with anything else in the movie.<br><br>The \"love interest\" was a pretty female, but possibly the worst exotic dancer since Striptease, and her character's habit of slapping every patron she danced for or who looked at her seems a little dumb. In the very small town they lived in it seems odd for the owner of strip club to be making so much cash. The strip club as an art form is dumb as well. Movie makers need to get over their belief that men go to strip clubs because of the artistic bent of some girls who remain dressed. That never happened, not in Flashdance and not here either.","user":"jaimegonzales210","rank":[4,5]}]
