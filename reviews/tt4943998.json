[{"title":"Brilliant & touching","rating":10,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"This movie, a brilliant &amp; touching send off to one of the best series ever aired, is like a study on how to write a finale. Every character has a prime moment, the story flows beautifully and it's full of comedy, pathos &amp; action. It makes me wonder how HBO let some shows go on well past their due date and ended this prematurely. Congratulations to all involved for giving the fans the best send off anyone could expect and more.","user":"mhorg2018","rank":[297,348]},{"title":"Thanks HBO","rating":10,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"Just wanted to say thanks to HBO, I doubt this was overly profitable but you made a lot of fans happy instead. Great ending to a beloved series.","user":"Malice_Unarmed","rank":[155,190]},{"title":"One of the BEST ever series on TV","rating":10,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"Finally, we returned to Deadwood! My family has been waiting for this for SOO Long...we felt like we were attending a family reunion after being away for 10 years...this is the most perfect ending to a perfect series...every once in a while in the movie industry, all actors, actresses, plot, scenery, director &amp; writer come together to make an unforgettable, magical work of art....this is DEADWOOD. The characters have aged but the magnificent prose that each espoused years ago is still as familiar as old slippers....The end was very much like attending the funeral of a beloved relative....too bad there will never be another masterpiece like this show!","user":"Harbour184","rank":[165,207]}]
