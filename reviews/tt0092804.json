[{"title":"The timeless message of Cry Freedom","rating":10,"date":"23 April 2003","review":"I show this film to university students in speech and media law because its lessons are timeless: Why speaking out against injustice is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed. Why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential to democracy. This is a must-see story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world through the activism of Steven Biko and the journalism of Donald Woods. It also gives an important lesson of free speech: \"You can blow out a candle, but you can't blow out a fire. Once the flame begins to catch, the wind will blow it higher.\" (From Biko by Peter Gabriel, on Shaking the Tree).","user":"lmperry","rank":[34,39]},{"title":"Fine all round performances","rating":8,"date":"1 April 2002","review":"Billed as the story of Steve Biko -- played excellently by Denzel Washington, as you'd expect -- this was actually more the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline.<br><br>This was undoubtedly the making of Kline as a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good in the role.<br><br>Attenborough gave this the sort of direction you'd expect, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the sort that only he can get across.<br><br>The remainder of the cast was competent enough and did a good job, in what ends up as an ultimately sad tale of a South Africa that is still nowhere near the distant past.","user":"redkiwi","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Thought provoking, gut wrenching and a humbling experience at 14 years of age","rating":9,"date":"15 February 2010","review":"I think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so I would just like to write about the impact this film had on me.<br><br>I first saw this film the year of it's release around 1987. My school organised a trip to the cinema to see it, for an RE project I think. We all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema! Little did we know what we were about to experience. To this day I still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends. I think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way .It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti Apartheid Movement the same year.<br><br>I think it served it's purpose in my case.","user":"kellyo73","rank":[13,14]}]
