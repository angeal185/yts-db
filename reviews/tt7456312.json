[{"title":"Silver lining!","rating":1,"date":"25 February 2020","review":"I just created an account specifically for this review. That's how bad, pointless, and confusing this movie was. I felt something in my soul that said I had to let the world know.<br><br>Plot: Bad/Pointless\nContinuity: None\nDoesn't tie everything in at any point\nFeeling: Am I dumb, did I miss something, or is this movie actually this bad?<br><br>This film has prompted several questions\nWho OK'd this film to be released?\nWill I ever forgive myself for wasting 2 hours of my life?<br><br>While the answer to the first question is obviously \"an idiot\", the answer to the second question is actually \"yes!\".<br><br>There's a silver lining. In wasting my time watching this film, I managed to come across film reviews and ratings of this movie afterwards. I got so much joy and laughter (which I did not receive from watching the movie) out of reading how bad the movie was that I actually am happy I watched it. For every second of misery I endured watching the movie, there was a moment of happiness reading a review of an equally disgusted viewer. The ONLY reason to watch the movie is to laugh at the reviews after!","user":"rjpack-03288","rank":[181,199]},{"title":"Did a 5th grader write this screenpaly??","rating":3,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"Nope, the 5th grader's screenplay would be better!<br><br>\"The Last Thing Anyone Wanted\" should've been the title of this film. What was seasoned writer and director Dee Rees on when she wrote and directed this, and did no one else proofread this convoluted plot ridden excuse for a screenplay?<br><br>Ugggh, 2 hours of my life I'll never get back! Watch the trailer and you've seen the entire movie - and the trailer makes more sense than the movie if that tells you anything. What a waste of talented actors. A shame this will be a thorn on their resume, I hope they got paid well. NOTHING in this film made any sense. The only thing I got out of this film was to take up smoking; Hathaway was successful in advertising cigarette smoking.<br><br>The only reason I'm not giving this film a 1/10 is +1 for the actors and +1 for the producers not posting fake/paid reviews - yet. Thus it's a 3/10 from me","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[188,216]},{"title":"....was a bad review but he got one","rating":4,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"I really wanted to like this movie because the trailer was great and it set the bar high. About a third of the way in I said to my wife, \"what the hell is going on?\" She didn't know either. Another third into the movie and I repeated the question, which went unanswered because my wife was asleep. Bored by the meandering plot lines that never seem to unite. So, I wasted a few hours of my life watching this but the good news is my wife got an hour or more of decent shut eye.","user":"tim-301-451819","rank":[87,99]}]
