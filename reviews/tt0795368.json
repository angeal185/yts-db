[{"title":"Very funny is a gently twisted British way","rating":8,"date":"19 August 2007","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect out of this, even though I had enjoyed the trailer in the theater. There had been some comments about cruel humor, which I just didn't see. The story was well structured, with groundwork laid early on for very funny bits much later in the film that got us laughing hard without hitting us over the head with the joke. The moments of comic tension were good, without that excruciating sense that someone was going to be horribly embarrassed, or hurt, or whatever, that American films seem to have. The situation is very well known to everyone who's been to a family funeral, although in America we would have the service in a funeral home or church, and we've all had moments when we want to laugh at the wrong time, or notice something a little out of the ordinary in the service that seems to cry out for comment. My husband, 14 year old daughter and I enjoyed the film immensely, and we all gave it an 8 out of 10, with some good carryover lines to quote amongst ourselves. Go see it, enjoy, and leave the political correctness at home.","user":"ejev","rank":[149,180]},{"title":"Nearly Died Laughing","rating":9,"date":"27 June 2007","review":"I went to this screening expecting it to be a serious movie -- you don't expect to be laughing at a movie with both \"Death\" and \"Funeral\" in the title -- but this film was hilarious! It wasn't just me -- the theater was full of people screaming with laughter and clapping at various moments.<br><br>Alan Tudyk is hilarious every moment he is on screen. Finally this underrated actor has gotten a good-sized part where he can show off his comedy skills.<br><br>Most of the actors are British and I did not recognize them, but they were excellent.<br><br>One I recognized was Jane Asher (she was Paul McCartney's girlfriend in the 60s -- he shoulda married her -- she's still alive and she's not a gold-digger). She plays the very composed widow here. (Oddly she has fewer creases on her face than her middle-aged sons.) <br><br>This film reminded me a bit of \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\", but even more of those British madcap black comedies of the 60s with Alec Guinness or Peter Sellers.","user":"hellokristen","rank":[221,274]},{"title":"A brilliant British farce, one of the funniest comedies ever","rating":10,"date":"25 August 2013","review":"A funeral is really the perfect setting for a British comedy. There's just something about the British and funerals contrasted with all the silliness that's going on that makes me laugh hysterically. The start of the film really sets the tone so well. You think it's going to be something serious but then the screw up by the funeral home's staff immediately changes the tone to a comedy and everything starts to carefully build up to a grand farce of mishaps, secrets and misunderstandings which eventually come together at the film's climax. Farce is definitely a better description for the movie than black comedy because you don't feel guilty when you're laughing at all the horrible things that are happening in the movie.<br><br>Yes there's crassness in the movie but it is also smart, subtle and it has a ton of heart. You need to have patience with this film in the start though because it carefully builds up the setting and tension and puts the needed pieces in place in the beginning for the later hilarious scenes to work as intended. When the comedy really starts going, boy is it worth the wait! The way the family tries to deal with the problems in secret while also trying to keep the funeral going is absolute comedy gold. The disruptions of calmness and decency the British appreciate are expertly crafted in this film.<br><br>The cast does a wonderful job. Andy Nyman does an especially awesome job as a hypochondriac stressing about his skin condition (he just can't catch a break!). Alan Tudyk absolutely steals the show, his reactions and behavior during the funeral are so comical (loved that guy on Tucker and Dale vs. Evil by the way) and he can do a surprisingly good British accent. Matthew Macfadyen was a great choice to play the straight-faced son who is in charge of the funeral arrangements. Peter Vaughan as Uncle Alfie was also entertaining as the slightly anachronistic swearing old uncle. There's really too many good performances here to count them, everyone simply acts fantastically. What was also great was that the many characters aren't put there just to do one thing but they're cleverly woven into many hilarious subplots. <br><br>The music is used sparingly but when it's used it definitely enhances the comedic moments well. Oh and that toilet scene, wow, I've probably never laughed that hard. Gross-out humor is used where it's appropriate and the situation and the characters are properly primed for to get those priceless reactions. Man, I wish I could watch this movie over and over again without knowing that I've watched it before. It's just such a perfectly crafted farce. Few comedies have ever made me and my friends laugh out loud for as long as this one. Definitely give this film a go.","user":"lornloxor","rank":[17,19]}]
