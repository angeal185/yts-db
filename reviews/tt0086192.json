[{"title":"A classic","rating":8,"date":"28 April 2006","review":"Revenge Of The Ninja is a classic 80's ninja movie, I grew up watching this movie and other crap ninja movies and I would always come back to this one. You always knew when you rented an action movie which started with the Cannon logo on screen or was a ' Golan / Globus production ' you were going to be entertained. Yes, the acting is dreadful and the plot could have been written by a 14 year old, but its entertaining. The fight scenes at the time were amazing, baring in mind that action flicks back then did not rely on CGI effects. The action was also fairly brutal, as far as I am aware all UK VHS versions were heavily cut as the film was released around the same time the BBFC appeared and were censor happy on anything involving ninja stars and nunchakus etc. I can understand why someone watching it now who has never seen it before would find the film 100% crapola, but if you remember this film fondly from your childhood then make sure you watch it now, its just as good now as it was back then. Make sure you get your hands on the region 1 DVD version as it is uncut and has a good few extra minutes of violent action which was snipped from the uk video versions.","user":"vince9","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"My favorite \"American Made\" Martial Arts Movie.","rating":11,"date":"11 October 2003","review":"After seeing \"Enter The Ninja\" in the movie theater that I worked at in the early 80's, I cringed of the thought of having to watch another American made martial arts movie when my boss notified me that \"Revenge...\" would be our next attraction.  When the movie opened in 1983 and I watched the opening scene, I was drawn in and hooked! <br><br>Everything about this movie seemed perfect (except the acting).  The locations were great.  The colors and lighting in the film were great.  And the fight scenes were fantastic.<br><br>I just purchased the DVD to see how well this has held up through the years, and I must say it has held up quite well.  I didn't even remember this movie being so bloody and violent (I had to quickly usher the \"under 10\" crowd away from the TV).  Even by today's standards, this movie holds on tight to its \"R\" rating for violence. There is very little profanity and very little sex in this film.<br><br>It's funny that a movie with such good production values would have such bad acting.  I mean some of the lines in this movie are delivered so badly I had to laugh out loud.  And the \"thugs\" in the park look  like the Village People!<br><br>Honestly though, this is, in my opinion, a great action movie.  And the characters, in spite of bad acting, are quite likeable (or hateful, whichever appropriate for the character).<br><br>I also thought the music track was excellent, and doesn't really sound dated now like a lot of early 80's movies.<br><br>I recommend this movie with eight out of ten stars.","user":"NickSavage","rank":[23,26]},{"title":"Die laughing- the way of the 80's ninja flick","rating":18,"date":"18 September 2004","review":"Cho's (Sho Kosugi) family are butchered by evil ninja's and he is forced to flee to America. Cho hangs up his sword and open's an art gallery in some slum neighbourhood and is inevitably caught up in a struggle between awfully dressed mafia and a quick-change artist evil ninja. I knew this film was bad as I'd seen it in the 80's but fancied the nostalgia trip. In the end I almost had a seizure from laughing.<br><br>***Spoilers***<br><br>It opens with the massacre of Cho's family who must be taking part in a reality TV show where you pretend it's the nineteenth century. Evil ninja's for no reason that is revealed, slaughter everyone. Cho returns with his American pal (never revealed how they hooked up) Braden who has a fetish for opening art galleries and is trying to convince Cho to come to America. Ninja senses alerting him, Cho goes tearing into the evil Ninja's who politely queue up to get sliced and diced. Braden being the respectable art dealer he is, produces a colt 45. blows away a couple of ninja's who stand out in the open looking to be shot by a entrepreneur. Cho's infant son (Kane) and non- Japanese looking mother still live. Braden seizes the opportunity and badgers Cho about the gallery idea again.<br><br>Jump to America years later, we know this by first seeing the American flag and then a caption beneath that says \"united states\". We have an obligatory fight scene with Cho's (now piggy looking) son who defends his right to wear a bright pink pullover with some bullies who despite outnumbering him, being bigger than him, and getting some choice hits in, still get their ass kicked by this pint sized ninja wannabe. Cho seems to have prospered and has a dojo in his art gallery and even a blond bimbo with fake tits who fights in her stockings (she is Braden's girl, kind of). Braden is using the artwork to smuggle heroin in what must be minute quantities since it's inside small Japanese dolls. In a masterstroke Braden puts these dolls on display to the public. Braden is partners with the stereotypical mafia who have no fashion sense, (even for the 80's), give each other back-rubs (shudder), most of them look like they've been recruited from the local retirement home. Braden and the don squabble about business that ends with Braden threatening the Mafia for screwing him. You see Braden IS A EVIL NINJA (it's never explained how he learned to be Ninja).<br><br>Braden goes on a mafia-killing spree...dressed as a ninja in broad daylight.<br><br>He kills a guy in the toilet in less time than it took for him to duck in the stall and put on his ninja costume. Seeking information on the killings and high finance crime the Don asks a tramp in the middle of a busy street. The tramp is dispatched by a shuriken in the eye. Where Braden threw the star from (as passers-by tend to notice a guy dressed in black pyjamas and a silver skull mask) is unanswered. The Mafia Don, (now sporting a cowboy hat) has had enough and sends a white/red Indian and some goons to steal the drug dolls. The police are investigating the strange killings and one cop (who couldn't act his way out of a soggy bag) asks Cho for help. <br><br>Cho being the concerned citizen tells them to bugger off and runs out to buy another beige pullover. Meanwhile Chief robbing-Bull and the goons have cleared out the gallery, Cho catches them in the act and a fight-scene ensues. The bad guys in this film can soak up massive amounts of punishment, still come back and produce weapons out of nowhere (like two tomahawks). After dragging Cho through two states with a van, the bad guys escape. Braden sensing his blond bimbo may not be loyal, leave's her in the care of a leering sumo sized child molester who has always wanted a blond bimbo of his own. Braden arrives at the gallery in Ninja garb, but disturbs Granny. Granny then tackles the intruder by morphing into a stunt woman but ultimately gets gutted by Braden. Killing grannies is hot work, and Braden suddenly has a compulsion to take off his mask, but pig boy Kane is up on the roof for no apparent reason. Sensing someone has seen him Braden looks up and sees Kane, but can't catch him.<br><br>Braden returns home to find the rapist he left his Blond bimbo with is trying to rape her, so he kills him. Using his magic fluorescent eyes Braden hypnotises the bimbo into capturing Kane. Meanwhile Cho discovers Granny impaled to the wall. The cop who can't act invites him to check out some ex-cons who hang out at a children's playground. The extremely camp looking ex-cons don't take kindly to being asked questions by a bad acting cop and a tiresome fight scene ensues. Meanwhile the hypno-bimbo has Kane who after failing to subdue him by laying into him with a metal pipe, simply carries him away. <br><br>The blond bimbo gives Kane to Braden who has hired another leering deviant (who refuses to wear a shirt, but really should). Braden and the henchman inexplicably leave the room letting the bimbo have easy access to a phone. Bimbo calls Cho and spills her guts about Braden only to be discovered. Braden has seen too many Bond films and instead of cutting their throats, sentences Kane and Bimbo to death by sauna and Jacuzzi. Braden realising the Mafia has his drug dolls goes off to the mafia headquarters. Cho gets out his Ninja gear, extra eyeliner and heads off to fight Braden. Both Braden and Cho make the mafia their bitches and end up fighting one another on the roof. After exhausting 50 weapons each (including a flamethrower up Braden's sleeve), Cho triumphs while his ugly kid and the bimbo escape to be reunited.","user":"kaisercam","rank":[18,24]}]
