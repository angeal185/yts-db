[{"title":"Not perfect, but a solid film.","rating":7,"date":"11 July 2015","review":"In the same grain as \"The American\" and \"The International\", \"THE (notice a trend?) Gunman\" is a international thriller/action. Where the former 2 films focus more on the thrill, and are overall failures, Gunman is more action, and much more entertaining. If you are looking for a fairly low commitment to a 'smart' action movie, then you can do worse.<br><br>In 2006, Terrier (Penn) works for a global corporation (that might as well be called Umbrella Corporation) and is asked to kill a high ranking diplomat. The movie then skips ahead to the present where Terrier is not being chased down by unknown assailants. Nothing original there.<br><br>Terrier (Penn) is a likable character. Penn tends to be an actor your either hate or love, but he is does a good job as a grittier, more realistic Jason Borne. The movie ties to humanize him, but that side plot is mostly a thud. After Penn, the cast is stellar - however underutilized. It really is the peak of 'hey that guy' British actors. Unfortunately, Elba who gets second billing is in the movie for 2 scenes total and less than 3 minutes screen time, a role that has so little to it that I might as well have played the character. Winstone and Bardem exist, but their talent is mostly wasted.<br><br>The movie is a step sideways from a classic action movie. If you like the Borne series and its fast paced action you likely won't enjoy the more 'realistic' violence of \"The Gunman\". Unfortunately, if you are not interested in the Borne series, this likely won't be of any more interest. I give the movie a 7, because I enjoyed it. It is far from perfect, I feel the movie definitely 'left sometime on the table' in terms of directing and acting, it misses often in character development, and the movie kind of devolves into clich√©, but there is enough substance to watch.","user":"fxdx4","rank":[35,45]},{"title":"Whew... Great...","rating":8,"date":"2 July 2015","review":"I'm not a huge Sean Penn fan. To my way of thinking, his best performance up until this movie was as Bradford Whitewood, Jr. in \"At Close Range,\" but right now, after just having watched The Gunman, I've got to say, \"Wow...\" I never thought of Sean Penn as any sort of \"action\" star and I certainly never imagined him doing a film like this. But he can sure pick them. And picking this one was a stroke of genius. Some folks might see it as formulaic or routine, but I guarantee you that whoever wrote the screenplay either did more research than he should have or knows more about it than he should. It was almost perfect.","user":"dongillette1","rank":[59,86]},{"title":"A solid 7 leaning 8 for a \"realistic\" action film.","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2015","review":"This is my first review. I have finally gotten tired of fake reviewers and haters rating films poorly because they don't like the actor and likely never saw the film. Reviewers are offended because he was working outside without a shirt on or because his shirt sleeves were short? Give me a break. I've seen plenty of 1 and 2 star movies, but, this was not one of them.<br><br>What I want to know from a review is whether or not a movie is worth watching. I do like action films and I don't dislike Sean Penn. This review comes from that angle.<br><br>You're not going to find cars jumping between sky scrapers, people falling 100s of feet and walking away or phony cliffhangers in this film. What you will find is an attempt to show necessary action in a mostly realistic way.<br><br>Sean Penn's role is more like Rambo than Superman. The action was original, clever and well executed. The dialogue was realistic and the acting was believable.<br><br>The only reason I didn't give it an 8 or 9 is because I felt it tried to do too much in too little time. That having been said making the movie longer wouldn't have worked because it would have taken 5 hours to do it right. The first 20 minutes could have been its own 2 hour film.<br><br>That having been said it all made sense. I didn't leave the theater wondering why or how anything happened. I would have cut several of the longer scenes short in order to tell more of the back story.<br><br>If you are looking for something fun to do on a Saturday afternoon you won't go wrong by seeing this film.","user":"me-939-335601","rank":[206,326]}]
