[{"title":"A New and refreshing retelling of an old Classic!!!","rating":8,"date":"8 September 2008","review":"Cinderella has been retold far too many times to even count, what made this version stand out is the way it was delivered, how the events are arranged and the inclusion of an aftermath after prince charming found his one true love.<br><br>The movie was directed with great attention to character development. The story kept the balance between realism and fantasy. We all know Mary in the story is just studying due to school privileges and doesn't have the money to go to dance school so what does she do? She sneaks in and through the mirror emulates the dances of the more privileged kids, we always see in movies the line: \"Try your best\" but in this story, Cinderella finds a way to make her dreams come true, she is strong-willed and kind at the same time. When her sisters show her video as a kid dancing, she fought back with getting the tango tape and letting prince charming know she is the one. A very different approach to the meek and kind Cinderella we all know.<br><br>With regards to Joey, the prince of the movie, very well played by Andrew Seeley. Makes you wonder why he didn't land the role in High School Musical, his dance moves are not the best out there but very far from average. His acting is subtle but at the same time very convincing. His expression when he touched the mirror during the dance rehearsal was spot on and very indicative that he felt that the person of his dreams are on the other side of it. The chemistry of their characters is undeniable.<br><br>The evil stepmother has a lot of dialogue that pokes at pop icons, wash out artists and teenyboppers, if you can keep an open mind, it is hilarious. Jane Lynch really got into character, you want to hate her but you can't help but love her in the movie.<br><br>The choreography is great especially the mirror scene which I reckon will be happily remembered and Andrew Seeley's final stage performance was very professional, it looked like a real concert of a pop icon. Whoever thought of those deserves a pat in the back.<br><br>Overall, do not look for depth in this movie. It is meant to entertain us, not make us think nor try to be smarter than it really is. It is a fresh take on an old classic and does so beautifully.","user":"sonova","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Not As Bas As It Looks...","rating":7,"date":"5 September 2008","review":"I seriously expected this movie to be worse than it was... The acting was great and so was the dancing... Some people are criticizing this film because of the age gap between Selena Gomez and Drew Seeley but the two of them played their parts well... The main thing is that they managed to get into their roles and were amazing... Some may find it a little fake or something but i seriously enjoyed it... Of course, that's just me... Different people have different opinions... Ovreall, i'd give it a 7/10... Like i said before, Selena Gomez had acted well in this movie just like how she's been acting well in WOWP... Drew Seeley was amazing and there was chemistry between the two characters that made this movie enjoyable to watch...","user":"faiqah1610","rank":[61,76]},{"title":"Delightfully Silly and Enjoyable","rating":6,"date":"26 December 2008","review":"In Beverly Hills, the teenager Mary (Selena Gomez) is the stepdaughter, actually the maid, of the egocentric and decadent pop star Dominique Blatt (Jane Lynch) and is frequently humiliated by her two sisters Bree (Katharine Isabelle) and Britt (Emily Perkins). Mary's mother was a dancer of Dominique and when she died, Mary stayed with Dominique. When the pop-star Joey Parker (Andrew Seeley) returns to Los Angeles to select a pair for his next video-clip in a dance competition, he becomes the sensation and all the girls in town expect to win. However, Mary sneaks to a masquerade party with her best friend Tami (Jessica Parker Kennedy) and Joey dances a tango with Mary, who is wearing mask and he does not recognize her, and he has a crush on her. Near midnight, Mary leaves the party in a hurry, but she drops her mp3 player on the floor. Without any other clue of her partner in the dance, Joey Parker uses the device to seek out the girl. But Dominique, Bree and Mary will do anything to keep Mary apart from her prince charming.<br><br>\"Another Cinderella Story\" is silly, predictable and there is a great gap of age between Selena Gomez and Andrew Seeley. However the update of the Cinderella fairytale is also delightful, with enjoyable dances and choreographies and the chemistry between Selena Gomez and Andrew Seeley is amazing. Selena Gomez really impresses with her beauty and charm and it is a pleasure to see her dancing. The \"sisters\" Katharine Isabelle and Emily Perkins perform a totally different role from the cult \"Ginger Snaps\" franchise. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Outro Conto da Nova Cinderela\" (\"Another Tale of the New Cinderella\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[17,20]}]
