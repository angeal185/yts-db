[{"title":"Surprisingly hilarious","rating":9,"date":"25 November 2017","review":"On the surface, Crash Pad is the typical men are like this/women are like that/nothing matters just get laid comedy, but there's more to it than what meets the eye at first glance. <br><br>The acting is frankly brilliant. Domhnall Gleeson's comedic genius really shines through; I can't wait to see more of him in this genre. His chemistry with Haden Church is hilarious, and Christina Applegate's emotional performance makes you feel for her cardboard-character. <br><br>The script tries too hard at times, but the one-liners are very memorable, and the jokes that land land hard. I loved how over-the-top and self-aware it was; the best comedies are always comedies of comedies. <br><br>I'm not sure who the target audience was. Fans of romcoms might find it offensive; romcom haters might find it too silly and clich√©d; but if you don't have expectations and let this movie surprise you, you'll have a fun time.","user":"atbakerstreetb","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Domhnall Gleeson brings this film up to a \"5\" despite a very poor script","rating":5,"date":"26 September 2017","review":"This would have been a disaster were it not for Domhnall Gleeson who somehow manages to work in his take on the naive nerd looking for true love, who falls for an older married woman (Applegate) only using him for sex to pay back her husband (Hayden Church) for what she perceives is his infidelity. <br><br>Gleeson's very good performance allows the audience to bear through an almost unbearable and sophomoric script.<br><br>Kudos to Thomas Hayden Church whose impeccable timing adds needed snap to the dialogue. <br><br>Editng is notable as well.<br><br>Gleeson is an impressive actor, and as he (hopefully) stretches himself into more complex roles, will no doubt discover higher ground upon which he can unfold his talent.<br><br>I'm rating Crash Pad a 5 (avoiding a 1 only because of Gleeson, Church and overall snappy editing). <br><br>The rest of the cast is wasted on this dog of a a script and 5 is generous.<br><br>2017 is going down as one of the worst years for movie releases unless the holiday season comes up big to redeem it.","user":"Instant_Palmer","rank":[21,32]},{"title":"Different... in a good way","rating":10,"date":"10 November 2017","review":"The script made this movie. It's extremely clever and written in a talky, self-aware way that I didn't mind at all. Some of the jokes build, getting funnier as they get longer. I've honestly never seen anything like it before, and I mean that in the best way possible. It reminded me of the first time I saw Kevin Smith's Clerks way back in the day, Jeremy Catalino's voice is that fresh and different. If you're up for a fresh and funny voice, I highly recommend this film.","user":"pjscarf","rank":[13,19]}]
