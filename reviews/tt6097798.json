[{"title":"Prooves you don't need a big budget to make good entertainment","rating":7,"date":"19 November 2017","review":"A very good thriller with a scifi theme.<br><br>A mysterious effect, acquired after an accident, of killing anything within 50 ft of a man that's nullified by a woman is the central concept here. Both main characters have amnesia after that car crash.<br><br>It's been some time since I watched a film that generated as much tension as this and full credit to the director for such an achievement with what must have been a limited budget (too limited to actually crash the vehicle even). The acting is decent enough but the real credit, I feel, should go to the director for this very good movie. There's little happening at times and to maintain tension is a difficult task that very few directors achieve. There's little throughout the film to explain the phenomenon leaving the two main characters trying to understand their roles in it as the main thrust of the film.<br><br>The ending does not explain the phenomenon at all and some will find that frustrating but the film isn't about this. It's about whether the central character finds redemption and the film wraps this point up nicely. I won't explain further as you won't thank me for giving away the ending. If you watch this thinking it's scifi then you'll probably be unimpressed with the ending. If you're watching it as a thriller with a scifi theme then you'll probably like it.","user":"verminhater","rank":[88,105]},{"title":"Surprisingly good","rating":9,"date":"16 February 2018","review":"I seriously canÂ´t understand the bad ratings. This is an extremely well made and entertaining movie. Acting and cinematography are excellent and the plot keeps the audience engaged the whole time. Though foreseeable for some, twists are pretty logical and not disappointing at all. I totally recommend it.","user":"roberto-488-18764","rank":[87,108]},{"title":"Loved this movie - would def recommend","rating":9,"date":"4 December 2018","review":"Atmospheric. Great acting. Fantastic storyline. And superb ending. Was not expecting that twist. Didn't expect to enjoy it but I did. Don't listen to the haters. It's not high budget with graphics to hold it up. The story and directing holds all on its own.","user":"gailmoir","rank":[17,19]}]
