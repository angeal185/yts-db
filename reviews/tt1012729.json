[{"title":"Another Powerhouse Performance from Ashley Judd","rating":8,"date":"23 December 2010","review":"A painful movie about a woman struggling with severe clinical depression.<br><br>Ashley Judd has a knack for giving powerhouse performances in movies no one's ever heard of (did you ever see her in \"Bug?\"), and she disappears utterly into the character of \"Helen,\" who herself descends into hell when her illness makes an appearance after lying dormant for many years. Let me be clear -- this movie is one long sustained note of agony, and it is not pleasant to sit through. But it's fascinating in its own way, and the thought of it haunted me for days after I'd seen it.<br><br>The filmmaker clearly had a very personal and painful relationship with her subject (she lost her childhood friend to clinical depression), and one might think this would make her incapable of retaining the objectivity needed to prevent a film like this from turning into melodrama, but one would be wrong for thinking that.<br><br>Grade: A-","user":"evanston_dad","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Welcome to the mind of a depressed person","rating":30,"date":"30 September 2011","review":"At first I didn't like this movie a whole lot. As other reviewers have already pointed out, it's merciless in its stereotypical portrayal of people: every character in the movie is a royal jerk except for the 2 depressed people, and it gives the impression that all doctors are cold-hearted sadists, all spouses are selfish psychos, and people in general are totally apathetic.<br><br>But hold on...<br><br>Then it suddenly dawned on me, duh, that's exactly how one views the world when one is in the throes of depression. I believe it wasn't the filmmakers' intent to make an objective film. I think they were out to show us a somewhat skewed perspective through the eyes of a depressed person. At that, it's very successful.<br><br>So yes, this is a depressing movie. It's dark. It's irritating. It makes you feel like the world is a sucky place. But if, for some bizarre reason, you want to know what it's like to be depressed, then this is the movie for you.<br><br>I can't say that I \"enjoyed\" it (I'm no masochist!) but I can say that it's very well made, with excellent acting, effective cinematography (good use of focus &amp; blurring), and a fitting musical score. Just as \"Peewee's Big Adventure\" takes us into the mind of a manically happy person with its cartoon colours and bouncy pace, \"Helen\" shows us the opposite side of the coin with its darkness, bleached visuals and monotonous presentation. If you want to know what it's like to be bipolar, I suppose you could watch the 2 movies back to back.<br><br>Movies like this: \"House of Sand and Fog\" (or as I like to call it, \"House of Sand and Why Don't We Just Slit Our Wrists and Save Ourselves the DVD Rental Fee\") and \"Leaving Las Vegas\". All of these are excellent films. But wow, hide the sharp metal objects before viewing.","user":"rooprect","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Depressing movie about depression","rating":2,"date":"1 July 2011","review":"As a survivor of severe clinical depression --- yes, it can be a killer --- I had a special interest in this film. I could relate to much of it. Yet I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone in the middle of depression. It is very much a \"downer.\" Indeed my wife's comment was \"I don't want to look at it. I've been through it.\" Having said that it is an extremely well executed film in all regards. Someone without any history of depression might not understand it or might think it exaggerates. To someone like myself, it was all too realistic. To someone in the middle of depression, it could push them over the edge. Clinical depression is right behind heart disease and cancer as a killer except that its victims die of suicide. Certainly anything that focuses attention on it such as this movie is good. In addition to its horror, depression too often is a \"closet\" disease in which the victim feels hopelessly lonely as was evident here as Helen tries unsuccessfully to fake normalcy. (Been there...done that...) I believe this film can be useful to the family of anyone suffering depression because it illustrates the despair of the victim and the immense stress on family and professional life. But it could be dangerous for the actual victim. But thank you for tackling a subject that too often is taboo.","user":"rps-2","rank":[18,22]}]
