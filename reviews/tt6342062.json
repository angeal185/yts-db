[{"title":"She had a cooking accident.","rating":1,"date":"24 March 2018","review":"There are dolls in the film, but it has nothing to do with Annabelle, but it does have a bell in it in case you wish to make a connection. Anne (Gail Yost) who looks like a man in a dress, lives alone with dolls. She is not all there. We watch her watch TV and eat from a discontinued Pfaltzgraff bowl to a horrific sound track that sounded like a ukulele with a broken string. It was boring to watch and feel free to fast forward for about an hour into the film. <br><br>The production was low budget. It was written, produced, directed and starred Joseph Mazzaferro who was more concerned about Mazz appeal than mass appeal. So bad it is worth a punch on the hacker's card if you can make it all the way through. It does have twist (?) that was as idiotic as the film. <br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"WHAT !!","rating":1,"date":"21 April 2018","review":"Watched this film last night ,its 1 hour 20 minutes of my life i can never get back , my father was watching with me is still in shock ,think he might never watch another film that i suggest to him ...starts off slow then gets even slower if that is possible made an hour and half seem like a month of Sundays ...avoid at ALL COSTS !!","user":"tonybeatson-901-440249","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"Worst.
