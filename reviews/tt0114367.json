[{"title":"Underrated Sci-Fi Classic","rating":7,"date":"28 December 2005","review":"OK this film has virtually no budget for a sci-fi movie and no real stars to speak of other than Peter 'Robocop' Weller but that doesn't matter because what it does have is a good story well told. It's a shame that bigger budget sci-fi productions never seem to remember that sci-fi should be have an interesting premise and not just throw a few explosions at the screen every few minutes.<br><br>What is on offer in Screamers is a solidly entertaining 1hr 40mins of sci fi fun, reasonable acting and a great story based on a Phillip K Dick short. The main idea of screamers is a very scary one a war that had been taken over by machines that fight on our behalf a war that can't be stopped.<br><br>For sci-fi fans this is a must see, for everyone else it's still solidly entertaining 7/10","user":"no-skyline","rank":[124,139]},{"title":"Not bad at all","rating":22,"date":"22 February 2002","review":"This movie aptly showed that you don't need a huge budget to make a good picture, even when that picture is a sci fi.  It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but for crying out loud it was a heck of a lot smarter than Independence Day and that movie cost a mint.  I had read Phillip K Dick's 'Second Variety', the short story upon which this movie is based, before I ever saw Screamers, and I didn't realize Screamers was even based on the story until I watched it.  Being a big fan of the original story I was glad to see it brought to the screen, and more or less faithfully - I thought Peter Weller did a great job in this movie, the atmosphere was actually somewhat as I had imagined it reading the story (they updated it somewhat by placing it in a totally different location, since the original story's wasteland was a result of nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia; something which I'm sure seemed plausible at the time it was written but is a little dated now), and although I don't think they pulled off the sort of paranoia we saw in The Thing, there was some nice tension as the story unfolded, although it fell apart a bit at the end.<br><br>Bottom line - if you're a sci fi fan sniffing around for some sci fi you haven't seen but don't want to sit through a total dog, it's not a bad renter.","user":"mr2times","rank":[94,106]},{"title":"A very, very good movie","rating":10,"date":"14 April 2000","review":"Screamers impressed the heck out of me.  Reviews I'd read of it called it a \"slasher\" movie and said that it was highly derivative of other movies, such as Aliens and Blade Runner.<br><br>In fact, I found it to be highly imaginative and original, very much in the spirit of the Philip K. Dick story that inspired it, pondering the ultimate meanings of humanity, war and technology.  The scenery and story surrounding the film were both intriguing: despite the film's low budget, the director did an excellent job of constructing the devastated planet.  Peter Weller and Jennifer Rubin turned in excellent performances, and the supporting cast was also quite good.  Finally, every scene is shot with a real urgency to it; particularly well done are the nightmarish confrontation 2/3 of the way through the movie and the poignant and shattering ending.  In short, this is a very very good movie and well worth renting.  It will stay with you for quite a while.<br><br>Before signing off, I should say something about construing one science fiction movie as a ripoff of others.  Screamers had elements of its plot which can be found in other films (ie men and machines, monsters) but it blends them seamlessly into its own original story.  The mere presence of identifiable elements from other films has given people ground to criticize this movie as unoriginal.  By their standards, I don't think it would be possible at all to make new movies or novels or anything.  These surface similarities will always be there.  One can argue that the Matrix is merely an update of Socrates' cave allegory.  In conclusion: ignore the critics and see Screamers!!","user":"Calgon","rank":[105,124]}]
