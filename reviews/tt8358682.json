[{"title":"I will never see another Justin Lee film again smh","rating":2,"date":"7 November 2018","review":"This is the 3rd flop I've seen this year from Justin Lee. Who puts up the money for this garbage? Does he not know how to write a screenplay or direct his actors? I guess this is the result when all your experience in writing and directing is TV series. At least give one of those hats to a professional that can teach you something before you try to do it all yourself when taking on a full length feature film and make the same mistakes over and over every time. Maybe then one of your films may get a rating higher than a 5.<br><br>This once again was another long dragged out dumb story that goes nowhere with lousy pacing and boring extended scenes that make you yawn. The dialogue was just non-stop insignificant garble. The grenade effects were lame little ant-hill explosions. The actors voices were either too loud or barely legible. Even the actors looked bored. And enough with the slow motion scenes, it's so 1980's.<br><br>This film should have been edited down to a 30 min TV film. A generous 2/10 for the cinematography and war sets (albeit minimal).","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[31,37]},{"title":"Waste of time","rating":1,"date":"18 June 2019","review":"The movie had potential. Other than Benson the actors are unknowns, but they showed promise. The story was basic but doable. The two technical consultants should refund their salaries, it was that bad. If this had been done by a college level fine arts student it would be lauded as a good effort. But its not. Its a waste of time, money and talent. Its too obviously a low budget film.\nOther reviewers have pointed out errors in weather, and lack of dirt on equipment and people. I have been a casual student of war fof quite some time, and before this i have never seen German troops wearing bandanas to hide their faces. Maybe it makes sense for the sniper, but not for anyone else. Unless the producer only had one person qualified to play the German part, and they had to hide his face.","user":"texinva","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"New equipment","rating":2,"date":"22 May 2019","review":"How do you fight a war after landing in Normandy and not have a scratch on the tank, tents are clean and look new, helmets without a scratch.","user":"johnkelley-64837","rank":[4,4]}]
