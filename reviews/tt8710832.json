[{"title":"Pretty good...","rating":8,"date":"7 April 2020","review":"For a low budget movie $11,000 (estimated), this one is pretty good. The cast all give pretty solid performances and one is enthralled enough to see how it ends.<br><br>I really don't know why they have used the Elder Sign (from the Cthulhu Mythos of horror writer H.P. Lovecraft) as the team logo... very odd.<br><br>This is not a horror really, but a worthwhile indie sci-fi movie... give it a go.","user":"flickeringstate","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Great independent","rating":10,"date":"3 April 2020","review":"Fabulous job for an indie film!! If you can get through the first 30 minutes the second half of the film is absolutely stunning!! It really takes a beautiful turn and the lead (Lara Jean Sullivan) does an amazing job all in her own!","user":"sullivbr","rank":[2,17]},{"title":"Not Bad","rating":10,"date":"2 April 2020","review":"This is not the worst movie yet made. I watched the whole thing. The ending song was good, one can actually understand the words. I would give this a 3. But mid Star Wars movies are a 3 or 4 max. The limits of low budget kind of force limited sets and lots of talking.","user":"beyond-repair","rank":[2,27]}]
