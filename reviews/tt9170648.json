[{"title":"Not my favourite among his previous standups","rating":6,"date":"20 November 2018","review":"Just seen it on Netflix. I think it's fair to give it a 6/10.\nThere's nothing bad about the show but there is nothing brilliant or profound about it. I just finished the show and already I'm forgetting about what I've watched or heard. There's simply nothing memorable. Compared to all of his previous standups, this one is the worse for me. Normally you can expect something great or original especially towards the end of any standups, but Trevoh just thew in and recycle some stuffs and ends his show that way.<br><br>Not sure why Trevor choose to do this show. Should have waited for better materials before doing one. Overall felt very monotonous and underwhelming. I don't think I will ever re-watch this one. (I've re-watch his other standups countless times).","user":"sheepfood","rank":[19,23]},{"title":"Falls short of expectations - not one of his best","rating":3,"date":"22 November 2018","review":"Had high expectations from the new Trevor Noah stand up special. Unfortunately, most of it seemed predictable and formulaic.<br><br>Really liked his earlier stand up specials , and his book - born a crime - so a bit surprised at how mechanical and almost forced this one felt.","user":"numair_kagzi","rank":[22,31]},{"title":"Couldn't finish it...
