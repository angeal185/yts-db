[{"title":"LOL - Load of \"Load\" (If you get my drift)...","rating":1,"date":"29 May 2012","review":"I'm going to summarize here:<br><br>This \"film\" bears about as much connection with modern society as KFC represents the life of Chickens. Not only is it the most cheese filled pap ever, it's a walking clich√© and the people in it, even say the word \"LOL\" rather than actually laughing, in one scene; one person even rolls around the floor laughing when she is told a joke by her friend, and it wasn't even funny. <br><br>The entire dialogue in this film looks as if it has actually been written on a Nokia 3310 by a 10 year old boy, who has ADHD, no offence to people who actually HAVE ADHD, but seriously, it's like they've given a child three things:<br><br>1. MDMA.<br><br>2. 90 Blank Sheets of Paper and a typewriter.<br><br>3. 2 Days to complete it.<br><br>The acting is below par and even in one scene, it is blatantly obvious that the actress has forgotten her lines, so she seems to make her line up on the spot. How on earth did Demi Moore get roped into this? Demi Moore has made some god awful movies in her time, but this will be a black hole on her CV for many years to come and I imagine she is only kicking herself to the loony bin for partaking in this absolute rubbish.<br><br>Then I have to mention the obvious fake posts on here which are condoning and praising this teeny bopper movie, which is obviously made to capitalise on fans of the girl out of this, kids who are grounded and have to use their phones as a social outlet, LOL, and teen kids who have nothing better to do with their money than go and see how the media thinks they should live their lives.<br><br>Anyone paying to watch this god awful trash should take themselves and get counselling, go and see a doctor, because whilst there are thousands and thousands of good script writers trying to earn a living, thousands of actors trying to break through; and thousands of budding directors just aching for a chance to even get 1% of this budget for their work; production companies are still lying and pulling the wool over our eyes with pap like this.<br><br>If you are fan of the girl in this film, think about it, and think about it hard!!!<br><br>If you actually like this girl, then you will NOT go and put money into the pockets of the greed ridden pigs who are actually trying to exploit YOU as well as your idol. So I'm not going to give you grief for liking this girl; like most will, but seriously think about it before you part with your money. If this film does even remotely well, the fat corporate pigs will only release more pap with her in, to try and prize YOUR hard earned money from your hands, and in turn, the big wheel of fortune will grind away on YOU and ONLY YOU!<br><br>It says something when a production company pull out of post production marketing like they did on this kids, they want to BURY it without trace, because they know how terrible this film truly is! <br><br>Fair enough, watch it on cable (it will be on there soon enough), download it from some kind of torrent site, but whatever you do, do NOT go and spend a penny of your money on this, you will regret it for years to come.<br><br>Long live the free thinkers.","user":"The_Monocled_Mutineer","rank":[136,172]},{"title":"Painful.","rating":1,"date":"26 April 2012","review":"If there's one way to describe this movie, it would be utterly atrocious, execrable trash. In no way are there any redeeming qualities in this \"film\" as it is filled with a moronic plot, hideous dialog(if you can call it that)banal acting and overall crap. The whole thing is a ruse; it looks like a low-budget made-for-TV film that ironically enough SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MADE-FOR-TV FILM IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! I'm sorry, but after Hanna Montana and the atrocious film that followed it, Miley Cyrus's career as an actress is pretty much in the toilet. Only a wickedly hardcore Miley Cyrus fan would watch this because any self-respecting movie-lover would stay clear away from this hell-hole of a movie.<br><br>1 out of 5 stars. That's how bad this piece of sh*t is.","user":"johnnymacbest","rank":[196,253]},{"title":"An awful remake of an already awful movie","rating":1,"date":"20 April 2012","review":"Okay first things first, you should know that this movie is a remake of a crappy French movie of the same name. If that doesn't deter you from watching, then maybe knowing that Miley Cyrus is starring as the lead role does.<br><br>I never had high hopes for this movie especially since Lionsgate completely shunned the marketing team and had no effort in making sure that this movie gets some much needed publicity. But aside from that, this movie isn't really targeted for people like me. It seems to focus on its teen demographic, hell the title says it all...LOL.<br><br>Now I'm not hating on Miley Cyrus or anything but God that girl really brought down the movie. I thought that she could maybe prove that she can act and switch away from that Hannah Montana crap, but no, she cannot. And having Demi Moore didn't help either. It's like the cast had every intention to make a god-awful movie that only teenage girls would barely like.<br><br>Overall, the movie was your average run of the mill, teenage love affair crap. If you're a guy then stay the hell away from this movie, but if you're a girl then...no, you should also stay away from this movie.","user":"Lugewi","rank":[169,218]}]
