[{"title":"The Great Battle","rating":8,"date":"13 February 2020","review":"This was a great find on Netflix. It reminded me of the battles in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Helms Deep and Minas Tirith. It is subtitled but the story couldn't be easier to follow. Highly recommend it.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[37,39]},{"title":"Epic battle scenes!","rating":7,"date":"29 December 2018","review":"With stunning cinematography, awesome visuals and incredible photography during the epic battle scenes, what more could one ask for in a war movie? The battle scenes are quite spectacular.<br><br>South Korea once again showcases an excellent war film. In-sung Jo is very good as Commander Yang Man-chun, a caring and likable protagonist, who's main concern is the well-being of his people. The rest of the cast is very good, as well, and there's sweet moments between some of the characters, and also a nicely set-up romance. This is a top-notch production.","user":"paulclaassen","rank":[16,23]},{"title":"War of wills","rating":8,"date":"1 November 2018","review":"A very well made film about war and determination, very impressive cast and the scenes of battle were staged nicely, the camera angles at times were a little off during some fight scenes, but an overall satisfying historical film for lovers of battle strategies.","user":"wjosephjorob","rank":[20,30]}]
