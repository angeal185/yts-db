[{"title":"It's watchable but not good.","rating":5,"date":"9 February 2019","review":"This movie is a pale imitation of a Wes Anderson film. It has an interesting premise with good actors, but ultimately come out flat.","user":"alexpoleshuk","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"wrong as a comedy","rating":2,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"In 1977, scientists Ben Morin (Matthew Goode) and his wife Catherine (Toni Collette) want to prove the dominance of nurture over nature, influenced by their own childhood experiences. They are having a baby and propose to have him raised by artists parents. With two other babies, they chose them to be also raised to be their biological opposites.<br><br>After watching Three Identical Strangers, this would have a difficult time as a comedy. Instead of quirky, this may work as a dark drama. Its quirkiness is desperate to be funny which only makes the disturbing concepts even more off-putting. Also it's hard to remember the individual children's nature vs nurture changes. They don't become real 3-D characters. It seems highly unscientific to put them all together in the same place. There's nothing to prevent them from influencing each other. I can't laugh at this couple and I can't laugh with this movie. It's trying for something that is never going to work.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"A Nothing Film","rating":1,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"What a silly waste of 90 minutes. The movie makes no sense. The adults are shown to be supposed scholars, which is far from the case. The only smart characters are the three children. Watching the father encourage his young son to have sexual stimulation by forcing him to watch old vintage photos of naked women was, at the very least, disturbing. And the fact that the boy walks out shows which one is the smart one.<br><br>Billed as a comedy, I found nothing at all humorous in the story. I am sure there are pseudo-intellectuals who will find hidden meanings and symbolism here, but I found it to be a waste of time.","user":"clintstevens","rank":[22,40]}]
