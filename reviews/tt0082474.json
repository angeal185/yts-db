[{"title":"Great comic shenanigans","rating":10,"date":"16 June 2002","review":"This film is definitely a comic masterpiece.  A great improvement over the earlier MUPPET MOVIE, which seemed more like a faltering first step into feature film techniques; this has a strong plot, bright characters and keen timing.  It also has great support from the comic greatness of John Cleese, Joan Sanderson, Jack Warden, Robert Morley and Peter Falk.<br><br>Diana Rigg and Charles Grodin (in his best movie) manage to hold the central human characters together, up against the bright lunacy of the Muppets. Lady Holliday's expression on seeing Miss Piggy enter in her swimsuit is worth the price of admission alone!<br><br>PS:  My mum just loves the bit where Kermit does up his zipper!","user":"BadWebDiver","rank":[18,19]},{"title":"The Muppets Take Big Ben","rating":8,"date":"28 December 2007","review":"Anglophile that I am, I love \"The Great Muppet Caper,\" and think I might like it even more than the original \"Muppet Movie.\" <br><br>The gang find themselves foiling the plot of a group of crack diamond thieves led by Charles Grodin, and it's a hoot to watch the slick, professional thieves' preparations and actions juxtaposed to the loud, crude antics of the Muppets. There's a pretty funny musical number that finds Miss Piggy ripping off Esther Williams, and another lovely song performed while the entire group goes bike riding. Long before the days of jacked up special effects when anything can be done using a computer, I remember being astounded by the fact that this special effects team could make the Muppets ride bicycles. Ah, what a more innocent time....<br><br>Grade: A","user":"evanston_dad","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"\"The First Time It Happened...\"","rating":8,"date":"15 April 2002","review":"This is one of my all-time favorites! I am 23 and I still need to view this movie at least once a year. Jim Henson was at the height of his creative powers when this was made, and it shows brilliantly. As opposed to \"The Muppet Movie\", the songs aren't as dated, and the celebrity cameos have been cut back which lessens the distraction from the Muppets themselves. The cameos of John Cleese, Sir Peter Ustinov, Sir Robert Morley, and Jack Warden all are funny and fit the plot's movement. The highest performance praise though, must go to Dame Diana Rigg and Charles Grodin, who may have deserved an Academy Award for being the only human ever to attempt to make love to Miss Piggy! (\"Miss Piggy, don't put a wall between us...we could have had the world on a silver platter\") I also love the music, especially the number in the Dubonett Club, which harkens back to the old-time musicals, with just a hint of satire. Even after seeing \"The Score\" and \"Ocean's 11\", the Muppet heist scene is still the most entertaining I've ever seen! My advice is swallow your pride, grab the kids, and \"check right in, to the Happiness Hotel\"! (SAY CHEESE!)","user":"happiscotsman","rank":[15,17]}]
