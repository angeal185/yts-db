[{"title":"Splendid !","rating":9,"date":"25 March 2019","review":"Great little film that I picked up for just Â£5. Lots of nods to giallo films and will relate to people who stalked the video shops in the 80s such as myself looking for obscure films we thought we would never actually get to see. Give it a go you could do a lot worse with your 90 mins.","user":"vanburen-29644","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"unexpected dive in the depth of the mind.","rating":9,"date":"29 August 2018","review":"This was an unexpected good movie with both laughter and a creping sensation down the neck, that made me check the door lock an extra time time when i got home. With excellent feal and referens to the 80,s VHS boom for all the nostalgic movie fans. Also fun to see some (in Sweden) big actors in not the biggest roles. And all actors deliver without a doubt a good preformance.\nA well made movie that suprice you in more ways than one.","user":"BumbleBII","rank":[18,29]},{"title":"Collectors choice","rating":9,"date":"17 January 2019","review":"This may have a bigger impace on people who had video store to go to. And I mean the one that had VHS tapes to rent or sell you. And then there is the Giallo aspect to it. I'm not really a fan of the genre overall, but you do can feel the love the director has for the genre. There are so many references to it. And the other great thing (if you are into that): it mixes comedy (not slapstick mind you) and horror - and it does a fantastic job at that.<br><br>Then take the acting and it goes beyond all. It really is something and while it may not affect everyone who watches it, the sheer amount of dedication (the years it took to make and so forth) is amazing. Just for that I got mad love for this movie - and the director is one of the nicest people you can meet. And just to be clear, only met him once (festival) and loved the movie even before meeting (and telling him about it)","user":"kosmasp","rank":[7,14]}]
