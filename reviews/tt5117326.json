[{"title":"Rachael Harris and Rob Huebel Use Comedy to Explore Their Failed Lives in International Falls.","rating":9,"date":"26 March 2020","review":"What makes International Falls such an engaging film -- outside of the soothing Minnesoooota accents -- are the two central performances. As Tim, Huebel perfectly captures the life of a struggling comic, his sarcastic wit and self-deprecating humor masking the emotions he's too insecure to actually share. As Dee, Rachael Harris matches him note-for-note, slowly but surely finding the confidence she needs to alter her life, regardless of how daunting it may seem. Together, Huebel and Harris create the kind of on-screen chemistry that never feels forced or rehearsed; the type of chemistry that grows organically from a shared perspective.","user":"noelshankel","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"A Heartfelt Film","rating":10,"date":"25 March 2020","review":"Superbly acted, wonderfully filmed - this indie film is about connection, resilience and moving forward.
