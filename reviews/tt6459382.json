[{"title":"A beautiful and charming Film.","rating":10,"date":"4 May 2018","review":"The following is my sincere opinion on the film:<br><br>I was curious and cautiously optimistic about watching a film based on that Gorrila Vine series, but I am so glad I did.<br><br>This is a simple, quiet but joyful and heartfelt film about the Journey of a creative Gorilla trying to find his place in the World. \nThe story is told very thoughtfully, with extremely well crafted and well edited scenes. It's apparent in every shot that a lot of love and care was put into this film.<br><br>While Sylvio may not be very flashy, or thrilling, it is certainly endearing and meaningful. It showed me that a great film can be made from even a dude in a Gorrila suit as long as the ones creating it put their heart and soul into it. This is exactly the case for Sylvio. It's slightly outlandish and odd but loveable and undeniably creative.<br><br>Now, this film may not be for everyone, especially if you're not patient with more Indie films, but if you're open to it, this could be perfect for you.<br><br>It certainly was a perfect film to me. From start to finish.\nI don't know why this film exists, but my life is brighter and sweeter because of it.<br><br>Thank you to everyone who made it.\n10/10","user":"wannaB2008","rank":[9,18]}]
