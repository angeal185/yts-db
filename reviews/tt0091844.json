[{"title":"Excellent Story !!!","rating":10,"date":"5 May 2010","review":"I just saw this movie recently by way of a DVD that I rented. As the \"voice of experience\" from having previously served in the US Army in the same duty as John Lithgow's character ... I must say that he did one Hell of a good job! I was totally amazed! I usually associate this actor with roles that are \"dumb &amp; goofy\" ... but he amazed me by performing in a very serious role. The character traits were perfect. The costumes were on target for that period. It was even filmed on location at an army post in Georgia which is where the fictional story was to have taken place. I especially liked the ending when the combined efforts of the men in the (mostly white) Platoon became the force that turned the tide of southern racism and finally allowed a hero to be buried in a place where he originally had NOT been welcome for no other reason than the color of his skin. I grew up in Georgia and even during that same time period of the early 1970s, there were still small communities where the mindset of certain people was still like the 1950s before Civil Rights had taken effect. But overall, I felt that this film was excellent and really did NOT get the attention that it truly deserved when it was first released. Hallmark should replay this once again.<br><br>---LTC Ralph Mitchell, US Army (ret)","user":"Rmcfg","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"An enjoyable thought-provoking and entertaining TV drama","rating":6,"date":"25 February 2002","review":"\"Resting Place\" tells of an Army officer (Lithgow) who accompanies the body of a black Vietnam war hero home for burial only to find the cemetery is segregated and the body is shrouded in mystery. A well cast journeyman TV drama, \"Resting Place\" is a thoughtful and poignant exploration of one man's search for truth among a too divided civilian population and a too unified military unit. Good stuff with a message for everyone.","user":"=G=","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"above average performances for all involved, especially G.D.

Our world is not always a pleasant place, but as these events show, truth and right generally prevail. I like the fact that this experience was an education for all involved, especially John Lithgow's character.","user":"dwmorrison","rank":[10,14]}]
