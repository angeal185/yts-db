[{"title":"If you like Wes Anderson or Rushmore","rating":8,"date":"29 June 2018","review":"I literally am shocked at the reviews and rating. All I want to say is if you like movies with offbeat or irreverent, inttelligent humor like Rushmore or Wes Anderson's movies you will like if not love dtfl. Only thing that struck me as odd was the elevator music soundtrack.","user":"paulkobos1980","rank":[21,27]},{"title":"Excellent! The ending will tear your heart out","rating":10,"date":"15 November 2017","review":"This is a an excellent film! The complex relationship between Audrey (Claire Armstrong) and Lillian (Naomi Skwarna) is both poignant and hilarious. There are also some incredible scenes between Gary (Todd Graham) and Audrey and Lillian. The ending will tear your heart out. If you are able to see this - I can't recommend it enough. I really hope it comes to Netflix and iTunes!","user":"nadiagibbons","rank":[24,35]},{"title":"A true Canadian gem!","rating":10,"date":"16 November 2017","review":"Rally love this film. A true Canadian gem that is under-appreciated. The director has a bright future in front of him and writes true-to-life female characters, something that is truly lacking in cinema today. This deserves to be seen on screens across Canada and the US and ultimately on Netflix. Can't wait to see it again!","user":"asaundersm","rank":[18,28]}]
