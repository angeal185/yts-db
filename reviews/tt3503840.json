[{"title":"Steven Seagal Fan","rating":10,"date":"11 December 2017","review":"Personally I like all Steven Seagal movies and this is one of his better ones in recent years. There are only a couple a few of his movies I haven't seen since I have only Netflix &amp; Hulu at home and no expensive cable bill. I was in the military and met him once up in Alaska while we were to do some military training. I hope and wish he would come out with something big in the theaters like he did in the late eighties &amp; early nineties. This one had a great plot and story line since human trafficking is a real problem in the world today. I wish I was recruited to hunt down human traffickers but I wouldn't want to just catch them and bring them to trial.....once we have solid proof and catch them red handed I would shoot them on site without any hesitation whatsoever. I'm not a republican/conservative/right and never will be but especially major crimes if they're caught red handed there should be no trial because the trial and all that is just a waste of money so just punish them right then and there.","user":"lovettstough","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"A Routine Action Film...","rating":6,"date":"23 June 2015","review":"A sequel to A Good Man, 'Absolution' is a routine action film, that has some absorbing moments. The storytelling is very 1980's, although some of the action bits are sharp. <br><br>'Absolution' Synopsis: John Alexander (Steven Seagal) is a contract killer. After encountering a girl on the run from a mob boss (Vinnie Jones) with powerful political connections, he is torn between protecting the girl and remaining loyal to the government agency that hired him for a mission.<br><br>'Absolution' clearly lacks an innovative script, but all said and done, some of it works. Especially the second-hour, where there is good scope for some hardcore, bloody action. Keoni Waxman's Direction is decent. Cinematography is standard. Editing is okay. <br><br>Performance-Wise: Steven Seagal is as usual, but he looks completely out of shape. Byron Mann does some terrific action here &amp; is also the scene-stealer. Vinnie Jones is reduced into a loud villain. Adina Stetcu is average.<br><br>On the whole, 'Absolution' is, at best, a passable watch.","user":"namashi_1","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"A return to form for Seagal?","rating":8,"date":"26 April 2015","review":"Without any spoilers as a direct to DVD film this is one of Seagal better efforts. Please don't listen to the critic's Technically it's a well executed film. Seagal and Mann make a great team together and whilst Vinnie Jones is not in the film a great deal he's a very believable bad guy because quite frankly playing psychos is what Vinnie does best.<br><br>I rated It an 8 as an action film because the story and pace and action kept me entertained. <br><br>I do recommend this to fans of Seagal.<br><br>Please view for yourself and decide.","user":"sonofjorel316","rank":[47,71]}]
