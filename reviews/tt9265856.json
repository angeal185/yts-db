[{"title":"And the award for...","rating":3,"date":"20 December 2019","review":"..the most fake reviews goes to: Nineteen Summers. How is this film anything close to 9's and 10's? It's not. Acting from actors I've never heard of was decent, cinematography was ok, and the directing and writing was very amateurish. It's your typical story told many times before -and much better, nothing new here. Sound was also off and editing needed work. 2 hours is ridiculously long for this story. Don't get fooled by the fake reviews, this film is a generous 3/10 from me","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[9,16]},{"title":"Fake reviews","rating":2,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"This movie started off cool and it seems like they ran out of money towards the middle story didn't make sense at times actually 94% of the time it didn't make sense like what was the point of half the story half the time it felt like things happened because it seemed like it was a good excuse for something major to happen","user":"plutodadawg","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Sad as hell","rating":4,"date":"30 January 2020","review":"This a sad fuqkin movie, don't even know how come i've watched it the whole way through.
