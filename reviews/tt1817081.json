[{"title":"It's not stalking, it's research","rating":14,"date":"14 December 2014","review":"\"Love isn't all sunsets and roses. Sometimes it's good old-fashioned surveillance.\" ― Jarod Kintz<br><br>Written by and starring Justin Long, \"A Case of You\" revolves around Sam, a young writer who uses the Facebook profile of a young woman (Evan Rachel Wood) to assist in romance.<br><br>\"Case\" adheres to a generic \"boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl\" formula. Elsewhere its portrayals of a \"writer\" are entirely fantastical, and Evan Rachel Wood gets saddled with a \"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\" role, a phrase coined by critic Nathan Rabin. Despite its flaws, though, \"A Case of You\" has some valid things to say about personal acceptance. The film contains mildly amusing cameos by Sam Rockwell, Vince Vaughn and Brendan Fraser.<br><br>7.5/10 – Worth one viewing.","user":"tieman64","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"mildly amusing","rating":6,"date":"22 May 2014","review":"Sam (Justin Long) is a weary writer who novelizes movies. He turns already made movies into novels. He is smitten with the coffee shop girl Birdie Hazel (Evan Rachel Wood). So he uses her Facebook profile to bone up on all her favorites.<br><br>This is co-written by Justin Long. He's playing his try and true awkward uncomfortable character. There are a lot of great actors. Peter Dinklage, Sam Rockwell and Brendan Fraser are all going out of their way to play wild crazy characters. It would have been better if one of them played the bigger character of the best friend. Of course they were probably just doing Justin a favor. Evan Rachel Wood is lovely but she's not the rom-com type. There are mildly amusing performances. The central concept is a good idea to write a movie around. The ending is quite cheesy. The movie needs much better writing. It makes me appreciate how hard comedy is.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Justin Long and Evan Rachel Wood play it safe.","rating":6,"date":"14 November 2013","review":"In the age of social media, dating has become infinitely more complicated, and the ability to pore over your loved one's Facebook profile or Twitter feed to find those little idiosyncracies that make them unique is something we've probably all experienced. But what happens when you start taking it a bit too far?<br><br>Written by Justin Long (who also stars), A Case of You follows struggling writer Sam, whose daily trips to a local coffee shop have left him infatuated with the free-spirited Birdie (Evan Rachel Wood). Unfortunately, Birdie loses her job before Sam works up the nerve to ask her out, but never fear - with a little bit of Facebook stalking, Sam can not only find out where she'll be next, he can also begin molding himself into her ideal match.<br><br>Yes, it sounds more than a little creepy, but Long is charming and charismatic enough to keep us interested, and Sam's willingness to put himself into incredibly awkward situations in order to impress Birdie result in some humorous exchanges. There are also a few laugh-out-loud moments that come courtesy of Keir O'Donnell as Sam's roommate and Peter Dinklage as a flamboyantly sassy barista.<br><br>While amusing at times, A Case of You doesn't stray far from the typical romantic comedy template: boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy learns important life lesson and tries to win girl back. The chemistry between Long and Wood is believable, and watching them together is far from boring, but the film never aspires to be more than a paint-by-numbers affair. It's a decent first effort for screenwriter Long, but certainly nothing that reinvents the genre.<br><br>-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com","user":"BrentHankins","rank":[12,17]}]
