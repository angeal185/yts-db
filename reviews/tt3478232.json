[{"title":"And the adventure continues ... somehow.","rating":5,"date":"19 June 2015","review":"After a promising start with Mythica 1 I was disappointed with this sequel. Sure, as a fan of fantasy films, Independent movies and as Kickstarter Backer I still give here five stars, but it could have been done better. The makers seem to have forgotten that they have only a little budget. Instead of having bad CGI it would be better to halve the number of effects and improve them. In some scenes I really thought \"What the hell?\" Smoke, blood, riders and magic have to be done better. And therefore one must not always bring an \"expensive dragon, especially if the fight against it is so clumsy. Some other parts are also not convincing: The fight scenes this time are surprisingly bad, annoying fairies are needless, and the story bobs up and down. It starts right after the events of the first film, but somehow it is not believable and seems constructed. The scenery and the costumes remain good, and I also like the girls of the troupe. As a fantasy fan you can watch this B-movie, but unfortunately I can't recommend it.","user":"sven-49-694776","rank":[22,30]},{"title":"A waste of time","rating":1,"date":"12 April 2016","review":"Marek and her company must go on a journey and prevent Szorlok from obtaining all the shards of the Darkspore, or all will be lost. Really??? They already lost the stone!!<br><br>There's a lot of flaws here. Very poor visual effects, poor scenario and poor acting.<br><br>Marek got strong powers but she still a slave tho, and needs help to be freed!!! The timeline is so slow.<br><br>Marek and here friends had the portal opened but they didn't go into it until the evil wizard arrived to fight them.<br><br>They saw his army and they got enough time to escape through the portal, but the stood still like idiots and got caught!!! <br><br>I'm sure that the high ratings are very fake. I rated 1 for this movie because there's no less than 1 to give.","user":"Voda_AVA_1094","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Inferior to the first. Decent concept, poor execution","rating":12,"date":"12 November 2015","review":"It's not necessary to mention the terrible use of CG (most of which could have been done with cheaper, more realistic non computer effects), because that's not really where this movie can use improvement.<br><br>While the acting is mostly good, the script is very weak. Character interactions are awkward. Their relationship seem forced, like there doesn't really look like there's enough motivation for them to stay together. The fighting scenes are really badly coordinated. With that same group and just a bit of tactics, victory would come easy (at least to enemies shown) but instead everyone fights like if they were drunk or disabled somehow; so whenever the heroes are defeated, being in good condition, it is not believable. Also, all heroes are unremarkable: the warrior is not a great fighter, the wizard cast magic sparingly or waits the worst moments to do so, the \"thief\" is not really stealthy or that quick on the feet, and the priest has no real divine magic or combat power (despite \"being trained in combat\", see the first part).<br><br>Also the name/title of the enemy seemed like inspired from a video game, thus awkward and forced... the ending felt forced as well.<br><br>In the end, unless they improve script and character development and interaction, not even \"Hercules\" can save this movie series...","user":"cruel_intentions-71527","rank":[10,13]}]
