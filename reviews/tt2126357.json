[{"title":"How The Heck This Movie Could Get 10 Rating !!","rating":6,"date":"13 January 2019","review":"Rating 6.0/10\nIt is watchable, but the performance of Jennifer Lopez is poor. I don't understand why they rate it 10 ! Are they all paid critics ? What's the point in rating if it is fake ! So disappointing !","user":"ymyuseda","rank":[140,192]},{"title":"2 plots that don't go together","rating":6,"date":"8 January 2019","review":"This film is sold as one thing but tries to be two which about ruins both. The story the film was sold on is about women in a dead end job who is given a chance at a big league job by a faked resume. But it's also got a very melodramatic/ soap opera story about the woman and her long lost daughter.<br><br>The movie also is rather cheap and video-looking, neither Lopez or Remini look particularly good, though Lopez is still playing a character ten years younger than she is--which she pulls off, I only mention this as it has the feel of a 90's cable tv movie.<br><br>Interactions with Remini and Lopez are good, probably the best thing about the movie actually, then again the focus of the film shifts to the melodrama lost child thing, of which Remini is virtually abscent from.<br><br>The director was well cast to direct this kind of film but his earlier films are much better and have a sense of being a complete movie that this one lacks.<br><br>Supporting characters are most cartoons and, in the faked resume portion of the film are funny enough.<br><br>Of course Lopez is a big glamorous star, so for her to pull off this 'working class' act is not easy, but she manages to do it--it's mostly free of star moments--she doesn't sing, isn't shot to show off her famous bottom, she does have one dance scene with friends but it seems realistic enough.<br><br>Treat Williams does well in the roll of a basically unconvincing 'good guy' mega corporation owner.<br><br>The whole idea of cramming a old hat and unconvincing mother/lost daughter movie into this one is a bad one. This is a film sold as one thing because what they aren't selling doesn't work.<br><br>Sad to say it on many levels is a LIFETIME level movie.","user":"HEFILM","rank":[40,51]},{"title":"Nothing new that we haven't seen already","rating":5,"date":"3 March 2019","review":"Here we go again, JLo in a role of a woman who happens to have a midlife crisis and drastically changes her life. She gets a new job, new wardrobe. However, it is all a lie as we could see in a trailer.\nThe acting is good, Vanessa Hudgens is the one actor who in my opinion is keeping this film from flopping completely. Also Leah Remini was a good choice as well, giving us multiple good laughs during the film. JLo's acting is acceptable, good but not amazing.\nThe plot is nothing new and very predictable.\nIf you are looking for a film to relax on Sunday, this one's a good choice but do not expect anything. You will know what is going to happen in the next scene as well as the ending but there are a few funny scenes and some hearttouching ones too which was a good choice during writing the film.","user":"mikkiparker","rank":[25,33]}]
