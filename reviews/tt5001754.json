I know the narrative is a little straight forward but who cares. It was a fun ride, and Mamoa's in it!","user":"ronniewain","rank":[134,184]},{"title":"Watch when you have time","rating":6,"date":"29 April 2018","review":"While the movie lacks strong writing, the action is on point and there is a lot of suspense once the movie kicks into gear. The location this was shot in made the story more interesting. Overall, it was enjoyable in my opinion.","user":"sarahdamilleo","rank":[84,115]}]
