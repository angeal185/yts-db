[{"title":"Landmark in Nihilism","rating":8,"date":"6 August 2008","review":"No, they don't do movies like this anymore. A tough one about self-hatred, mayhem and self- destruction: Franco Nero as a down-&amp;-out reporter, Corinne Clery as his sexy, completely hollow spouse, plus David Hess doing his usual good- humored-and-mean-as-hell thing. \"Autostop Rosso Sangue\" is sleazy, sexist, ultra-violent, but not without some unforgettable moments: The naked Clery in front of a trailer holding a huge rifle in the middle of the night is like a hastily written, edgy but brilliant poem found in a tattered paperback left in a cheap motel. For a few short hours in his life, Pasquale Festa Campanile, creator of some of the worst Euro comedies ever, turned into a po√®te maudit of the most cynical kind. This is the kind of grindhouse cinema nobody can embrace with seventies nostalgia: mature, brutal, knowing, never \"cool\", always cold, gripping and utterly nihilistic.

The terrific David Hess makes for another great villain, also having played a crazed criminal in both Craven's Last House on the Left (1972) and another Italian exploitation film House on the Edge of the Park (1979).<br><br>For those who are seeking an unconventional thriller or just a fan of Hess, this film will be a well rewarding watch.<br><br>*** 1/2 out of ****","user":"Nightman85","rank":[20,24]},{"title":"with David Hess in the backseat, this is bound to be fun...","rating":7,"date":"7 July 2003","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who lament David Hess's minor film career--his three key roles (Last House, House on the Edge, and Hitch Hike) showed amazing sleaze potential (he could've been the wisecracking villain in summer action movies if his time had come 20 years later).  \"Hitch Hike\" can be called a precursor to the action films that litter multiplexes now, but it is also much more.  It's an uncommon little B movie with the gloss and name actors (Franco Nero, Corrine Clery) of an A picture, along with a surprising moral slant, gay stickup men, and twists galore.  Like most Italian exploitation films, \"Hitch Hike\" sometimes bogs down in a bit too much excess talk, but it helps flesh out the characters--they're not mere victims or heroes, but people, too.  And for fans of Hess, this is a no-brainer.  (A word of advice--seek out the Anchor Bay DVD, which is remastered and preserves the film's 1.85:1 aspect ratio.)<br><br>7/10","user":"Jonny_Numb","rank":[14,16]}]
