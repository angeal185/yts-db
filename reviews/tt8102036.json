[{"title":"One for the Fans","rating":8,"date":"29 May 2018","review":"I find it interesting that the \"Evening With Kevin Smith\" films have mostly stellar ratings and reviews here, yet the reviews for this special, so far, are abysmal. I found Kevin's storytelling and humor in \"Silent But Deadly\" to be no different than his previous specials, and I found him to be as charming and witty as usual. Kevin Smith isn't a standup comedian, so those going into this special without being familiar with his work and numerous podcasts, commentaries, reality TV show appearances, specials and live shows may not \"get\" or particularly appreciate his humor, personality or brand. I'm not sure this special would appeal to those looking for a traditional comedy special, but Kevin Smith fans will enjoy it. Several anecdotes had me laughing out loud, and if anything, I thought this show was a tad too short. Given the real-life circumstances that occurred after Smith wrapped up the special, I applaud him for making it through and leaving the audience none the wiser regarding his health issues. Using that as the marketing hook for this special is a little iffy to me, but I get it. My favorite moment of this special was the story about Kevin getting the 133-inch TV and wanting to see the life-size version of himself on it. For some reason the visual cracked me up. Again, this might not appeal to everyone, but I think most Kevin Smith finds will find it endearing and entertaining.","user":"columbiahunny22","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"An Honest Review","rating":7,"date":"19 July 2019","review":"I absolutely love Kevin Smith's sense of humor, and he comes across as a seriously nice guy so from the start you feel compelled to like him. He's funny and nice, who doesn't like that?<br><br>And it makes it even more compelling because he seems genuinely excited about things, even when it's annoying staged excitement like his youtube reviews, there's an earnestness with it that makes it enjoyably annoying.<br><br>And, honestly, his dig on Ben Affleck was hysterical, even more so because their friends and Affleck actually did a pretty decent job as Batman.<br><br>But... this was more of a stand-up routine and not so much of the Q&amp;A that we're used to with these. He relied a lot on the punchlines, and, even though the delivery was good he's best when he's answering question and the humor is seemingly coming from Kevin Smith and not something that looks as rehearsed.<br><br>The bottom line is that's it's Kevin Smith doing stand up, and you're going to laugh and you're going to like him enough to enjoy it, or just about whatever he does. And, even though he does reach out to the audience, he's really at his funniest when he's up there answering questions, and he's really at his best when he's connecting with people a little more personally.<br><br>So don't expect the brilliance of the other shows like this, but it's still something that you're going to enjoy through force of personality.","user":"generationofswine","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"these are so much fun!","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2019","review":"Mr. Smith has such an affinity to extrapolate the funny or the witty out of anything no matter how trite or boring it may seem , give it to Kevin if one is uncertain how to pump up a tale with wit and humour! Definitely a fine job here, just like the other stand up affairs, this one does not let down, it stays on point and delivers! I personally love how he was moving around and throwing his arms around! I just think Kev is the most! This was really cool.","user":"juanmuscle","rank":[1,1]}]
