[{"title":"This movie deserves a better chance","rating":8,"date":"15 December 2019","review":"This movie hasn't been treated well by \"the critics,\" but neither were movies like \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" \"The Wizard of Oz,\" and many others. Sometimes critics don't see what is in front of them. The pacing only seems slow if you're spending your other reviews telling people how wonderful super hero and \"Fast and Furious\" movies are. How can it be slow if the whole thing takes place over a period of about three weeks? It's paced the way it should be to allow a good look at Bernadette, who she is, how she got there and the demons she deals with. It's a wonderful look at the closeness between a daughter and her mother, when the daughter often finds herself being the more mature of the two. The best part of the movie, as it should be, is Bernadette, played to mercurial perfection by Cate Blanchett. Under the obvious disruption of a manic personality, Blanchett also allows the intelligence, humor and pain of the character to show through. It's a tremendous performance and, fortunately, some of the awards are paying attention to it despite the critics. It's a thoughtful, but also very funny movie. People should give it a chance.","user":"sage-42618","rank":[34,42]},{"title":"Different, thoughtful, much to say about modern life","rating":9,"date":"17 August 2019","review":"My wife and I went to see this movie because Kristen Wiig is in it and it looked like it would be funny. It is funny - but it is a lot more. It is quirky (we love quirky movies!), edgy, sometimes uncomfortable, but mostly enlightening (as in bringing light in). It could have been titled \"Where'd you go Human Spirit?\", or \"Where'd you go Imagination?, or \"This is what happens to society when fear drives honest, loving, intelligent people to start acting weird and give up on each other\". And it shows us the answer in a very positive way.\nSo, it was not Bridesmaids. Closer to \"Welcome to Me\" or \"Skeleton Twins\" maybe (I loved both), but not really like any other movie I can think of.\nNote: The critics seemed to not like it. That is almost a sure sign of a good movie to me. Bless their pointy little heads.","user":"alanm-30942","rank":[83,113]},{"title":"We've All Been There","rating":8,"date":"16 August 2019","review":"Started out at little slow and ended strong. The Director took to long to help us understand the complexity of Bernadette and her real struggles -which we can all identify with, so that we really liked and rooted for her. Once the movie got there it took off and ended strong. One criticism overall and not so much about this movie but an overall statement. If a movie is set in a specific city - film it in that city. There were obvious obligatory scenes of Seattle but It was clearly filmed mostly elsewhere.","user":"jimandkent","rank":[59,83]}]
