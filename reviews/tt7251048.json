I thought the performances were outstanding, particularly Pat Dwyer, Jonathan Hopkins, Taylor Myers and Elise Kibler. The directors' choices made these wonderful performances even more compelling.","user":"hlfrench-19608","rank":[5,11]},{"title":"Stunning","rating":10,"date":"25 April 2018","review":"What a beautiful and haunting adaptation. Taylor Myers, as mastermind director &amp; lead, is a force to be reckoned with. Chilling performances by the entirety of the cast as well. Bravo.","user":"breshort","rank":[4,10]}]
