[{"title":"All style, no substance","rating":2,"date":"2 May 2017","review":"Another \"Lifetime\"-esque version of prostitution with a PG13 level of nudity. In other words, a complete waste of time. But, wait, will the tattooed bad boy be her saviour? Lead actress is good, but the material is ultra-weak. There's plenty of sex scenes, but no skin. And almost all of them involving a stereotypical misogynistic old man. It's not engaging on any level whatsoever. I'd highly recommend \"Student Services\" or \"Young &amp; Beautiful\" or even the TV show \"The Girlfriend Experience\" as far better material in this genre.","user":"davexist","rank":[29,39]},{"title":"Wants to be a new generation's Pretty Woman.","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2017","review":"Strong beginning but a little formulated, which makes it cheesy.<br><br>Sex Doll begins as this look into the life a a hooker. We see her engaging with her clients on a night by night basis as if she was working a \"normal job\" or something. The filmmakers do a good job of expressing her subtle contempt for the old, fat and ugly businessmen she sleeps with for money. The film also goes through how she balances this profession without her friends, family, and other relationships discovering the truth.<br><br>But I guess that's not enough of a story for a movie, so they added a part about her relationship with a new potential boyfriend, who is more than he seems. It's not a bad add to the story, but for me it does cheapen what it seems they had been trying to do for most of the picture, or what I thought they were doing in humanizing a prostitute's life.<br><br>But overall Sex Doll is a good movie that tries not to romanticize or demoralize the decision this young woman made, only humanize the young woman.<br><br>http://cinemagardens.com","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"Not bad","rating":6,"date":"10 December 2017","review":"I recommend you watch this movie first, then read reviews. Those who are expecting sexually explicit scenes would be disappointed. As for me, I enjoyed this nicely made movie. The acting is superb as pretty much in all French and European movies. I have few unanswered questions about the young guy with so many tattoos, but may be it was meant to be this way, to leave his motives unknown. A scene when he left her money is also confusing. Her story is also remains unknown. All in all it is a snapshot of a segment of life of two people. There is no beginning and no end. A professionally made snapshot.","user":"smithellie1966","rank":[5,5]}]
