[{"title":"The inevitable is inevitable","rating":5,"date":"22 October 2017","review":"Dominick LaBanca is a professional fashion photographer who in his daily life is surrounded by beauty, he's appreciative but accustomed to it. In fact his job as a fashion photographer he's almost a creator of it in terms of publicizing. He's had a hard upbringing including losing a mother at an early age to cancer and that comes with a lot of suffering.<br><br>An auto accident leaves him blind and therefore finished in his profession. But when a new aide comes to help him in the person of Jeannie Garcia who is a Christian the inevitable does happen.<br><br>I say as I always say when reviewing Christian films they follow certain parameters so you know what to expect. Still this one is not badly acted and though shot on chump change is probably good for more than church audiences.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[1,1]}]
