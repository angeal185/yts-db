[{"title":"Painful to watch","rating":1,"date":"1 July 2019","review":"I was attracted by the movie poster but turns out that was the best thing about this movie. Gave it a chance but this has the worst acting I have seen in a very long time. Story might have been ok, but was too annoyed by the amateurisme to keep track. Really struggled to watch to the end","user":"nathalieblocry","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Worst movie I have seen in a long time","rating":1,"date":"15 July 2019","review":"Between a brutal plot and terrible acting, this may be the worst movie I have seen in years. I committed to finishing it just to warn others not to waste 90 minutes of their life. Please don't watch this movie","user":"jeffclark-83998","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Are your friends are named Benjamin","rating":4,"date":"11 June 2019","review":"Mollywood is the name of a dance club in Chicago run DJ Rush (Billy Dec). Chase (Micah Fitzgerald) is selling drugs nearby, pushing something called \"Oz.\" Chase is also a serial killer who tortures, mutilates, and then kills his customers. A poor business model to say the least. Zach (Vinicius Machado) an old friend of Rush is the detective on the case.<br><br>The killer is a white guy who has a voice similar to Tony Todd while spewing religious talk like Samuel L. Jackson in \"Pulp Fiction.\" I wish they had gone more into the killer as the Zach.Rush/dead brother drama didn't make it.<br><br>Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[3,4]}]
