Meyers isn't given as much to do as one would hope, and Ifans does what Ifans does, Geraldine Chaplin does well in her small role as an elderly neighbour.","user":"slightlymad22","rank":[28,40]},{"title":"British/Spanish Thriller in which a teenager is being stalked by a mysterious doppelganger who has her eyes set on assuming her identity","rating":6,"date":"17 February 2015","review":"This is an intrigue/suspense film with very good cast , being well starred by Sophie Turner along with Rhys Ifans as daddy , Claire Forlani as mom , Jonathan Rhys Meyers as teacher , Gregg Sulkin as boyfriend , all have supporting roles in director Isabel Coixet's thriller . It deals with a normal adolescent girl called Fay (Sophie Turner as the teenager who haunted herself and the movie took so long to be made that when Sophie was cast the first season of Game of thrones (2011) hadn't aired) finds her perfect life upended when she's pursued by a weird double . Neighbors (Geraldine Chaplin) spot this other girl in the stairwell — even though Fay only takes the elevator . While Fay is at school emerges her alter-ego and turns her life into a nightmare until the teen meets with her into a tunnel and moves toward a fateful encounter . Teachers (Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Leonor Watling) and fellow students (Ivana Baquero , Gregg Sulkin , Charlotte Vega) say they interacted with her on the day Fay stays home sick . Could the look-alike be Fay's mean-girl rival who is her understudy in the school play? Or someone more sinister? It's enough to make someone go a little crazy — prompting a moment where Fay chops off her long locks just so people can tell the two of them apart .<br><br>A gripping psychological/supernatural thriller co-produced between Spain and England ; dealing with a teenage girl whose once seemingly perfect life is upended when her father becomes ill and a mysterious double begins inserting itself in her life and she then starts to fear she's being followed by someone who shares her face . Appeals primarily to those fascinated by Hitchcock intrigue along with ¨Twilight Zone¨ series where mystery matters most . Nice acting by Sophie Turner , this was Turner's first movie after having performed in the television series ¨Game of Thrones¨ . Turner gives perhaps his best screen performance in this interesting chiller-thriller about a teen who finds that her life is being taken over by her ¨double¨ . This her first film, Another Me, based on the book of the same name by Catherine Macphail and also written by Coixet , the film was produced by Fip, Rainy Day Films and Tornasol Films . It premiered in competition at last November's Rome International Film Festival and will be released by Fox in the Us, Spain, Germany and other select international territories . It features the actress in multiple roles, as a teenage girl named Fay who feels like she's being stalked by someone who looks just like her, and who is slowly taking over her life . The talented supporting cast consists of Jonathan Rhys Meyers ('The Tudors'), Claire Forlani (Meet Joe Black) , Rhys Ifans ('The Amazing Spider-Man') and Gregg Sulkin (Avalon High) , Ivana Baquero (Pan's labyrinth) and Leonor Watling (The Oxford murders) . Geraldine Chaplin (Zhivago) steals the supporting honours from a gallery of enjoyable minor roles as a gossip neighbour old woman . And Isabel Coixet revealed in an interview that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was extremely difficult to work with , she argued that he had no discipline and that he run out Coixet's patience, making work really hard for everyone on set . Colorful though dark cinematography filmed by Jean Claude Larrieau , Coixet's usual . Being shot on location in Cardiff, South Glamorgan, Wales, UK and studios from Parc Audiovisual de Catalunya Studios, Terrassa, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain . Thrilling as well as suspenseful musical score by Michael Price , including a wonderful song titled ¨You haunt me¨by Richard Hawley . <br><br>The motion picture was professional though slowly directed by Isabel Coixet . Here director Coixet mixes dull stretches with some palm-sweeping suspense/thriller . Following this year's \"Enemy\" and \"The Double\" comes \"Elegy\" filmmaker Isabel Coixet's \"Another Me.\" Coixet is an acclaimed Spanish filmmaker who has previously found international success with Elegy and The Secret Life of Words and she's the camera operator of her movies . Her filmography includes other feature films such as 'Cosas Que Nunca Dije' (Things I Never Told You) (1995), Elegy (2008), 'Mapa De Sonidos De Tokio' (Map of the Sounds of Tokyo) (2009), and the two latest 'Ayer No Termina Nunca' (Yesterday Never Ends) (2014) and 'Learning to Drive' (2013) besides documentary films, shorts and commercials . And recent premiere in Berlin Festival of 'Nobody Wants the Night' (2015) starred by Juliette Binoche .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"Boring and Predictable","rating":5,"date":"10 September 2015","review":"The relationship of the teenager Fay Delussey (Sophie Turner) with her family is deeply affected when her beloved father Don (Rhys Ifans) has multiple sclerosis and her mother Ann (Claire Forlani) starts a love affair. Her teacher John (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) invites Fay to perform the important role of Lady Macbeth in a school play and her schoolmate Monica Meldrum (Charlotte Vega) is jealous of her with the choice. Soon strange events happen to Fay and she believes that Monica is the responsible for the acts. But her father discloses a family secret about his ghost daughter. <br><br>\"Another Me\" is a slow-paced, boring and predictable ghost story. This is not the usual genre of the great director Isabel Coixet from \"My Life Without Me\", \"The Secret Life of Words\" and \"Elegy\". Despite the great cast, director and cinematography, the flawed plot does not help the performances. Why Fay's doppelganger decides to haunt her after so many years? How her father could know that Fay should not look at her face? Why Fay insisted to meet her doppelganger after her father's advice? The conclusion is totally predictable. My vote is five.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Meu Outro Eu\" (\"My other Me\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[13,19]}]
