[{"title":"Disturbing subject matter, yet a great film!","rating":9,"date":"22 December 2002","review":"I'll never forget first seeing this film in the theater.  When I heard that this film was written by the same writer as \"Seven\", I expected a truly sick and twisted film.  Now don't get me wrong, this most certainly is a sick and twisted film, but it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected.  Maybe that is due to this film having a different director, but nonetheless the film wasn't as graphic as I'd expected.  With that said, and having watched this film a number of times, I still wouldn't recommend this film to everyone. If you like thrillers and can handle the subject of pornography and \"snuff\" films, then you should definitely give this film a chance.<br><br>I'm a little surprised that this film has such a low rating on IMDB.  I can see why someone wouldn't like it, but I can't see why it would have such a low rating.  I would assume that most viewers couldn't handle the subject and therefore gave the film a low rating.<br><br>All of the actors involved in this film did a very good job.  Nicholas Cage was great as always (sometimes a little over-acting, but most of the time he was great).  James Gandolfini, Joaquin Phoenix, Peter Storemare, Anthony Heald, Catherine Keener, and the rest of the supporting cast all pulled off solid performances.<br><br>Joel Schumacher really needs to stick with films like this.  He really does a great job with thriller/drama type films (and needs to steer clear of certain super-hero films).  Joel did a great job with this film and I look forward to his next work.<br><br>The only complaint I have about the film is the music.  There were some times were the music was perfect or tolerable, but there were others where it was just horrible and detracted from the film.  Some of the music in the film was too bizarre and didn't fit with the film.<br><br>Like I said, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I thought this was an excellent film.  I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,<br><br>-Chris","user":"LebowskiT1000","rank":[39,39]},{"title":"Disturbing, effective film","rating":8,"date":"25 October 2000","review":"8MM is a very dark, disturbing film that isn't for everyone. Nicolas Cage puts in an excellent performance as a private detective named Tom Welles who is hired to investigate whether a snuff film is real or acted.  His journey takes him farther and farther into the realm of pornography. Every minute of this film is suspenseful and riveting.  I also found Joaquin Phoenix's performance to be outstanding as well.  This movie does a wonderful job of creating a dark mood and exploring the motives and drives behind its characters.  One of Cage's best, and a severely under-rated film.","user":"mwpressley","rank":[49,50]},{"title":"A dark, graphic view into the underworld of pornography","rating":8,"date":"29 October 2004","review":"Firstly, this film is hugely under-rated. For those reviewers who call this film a \"waste of time\" or place it in the \"hall of shame\", maybe they should go back to watching more obvious and simple films. <br><br>8mm focuses on \"snuff\" movies and follows Nicholas Cage as he ventures into the dark underworld of the pornographic industry. I'm not a great fan of Nicholas Cage (I still wonder how he ever made it as a movie star), but in 8mm felt he redeemed himself from past performances. Other actors in the film put on great performances, notably Joaquin Pheonix, and James Gandolfini (of Sopranos).<br><br>What makes the film worth watching though is the emotion, dark imagery and tense moments throughout the film. The storyline too is very well thought out although does have a few holes and untouched areas that may have helped develop the film further. There is no Hollywood ending, forced propaganda, or marketing. What you do get is graphic scenes, moderate violence, and an insight into \"snuff\" movies (which really is quite disturbing).<br><br>Having said that this movie is not for the faint hearted, so if you're a \"puppy-dogs and ice-cream\" kind of person I'd suggest watching something else. If however, you feel you will be able to stomach such a film then prepare yourself for a moving film, which will leave you feeling that little bit darker at the end.<br><br>I highly recommend this film. 8/10","user":"bealer","rank":[205,229]}]
