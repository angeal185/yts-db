[{"title":"Comedy? Horror?","rating":7,"date":"4 June 2019","review":"Clara's Ghost has to be one of the most baffling films I've seen in recent memory. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. Though it doesn't fit neatly into any real genre, it's certainly never dull and the performances make it worthwhile. Everyone is on their A-game here with the entire Elliot family coming across rather well.<br><br>The only way to describe this movie is like a mashup of Let's Scare Jessica To Death and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, but with an entitled family of actors (save the matriarch who may or may not be having a mental breakdown.) Hayley Joel Osmet even shows up as a family friend who supplies weed to the family, which only causes things to get worse.<br><br>Clara's Ghost is endlessly fascinating and unlike anything I've ever seen.","user":"emilywallace-49758","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"cringeworthy. worth it.","rating":9,"date":"3 June 2019","review":"Perfectly enjoyable film. not for the hollywood blockbuster sycophants.<br><br>there are some cringeworthy (the good kind) moments, some laughs and some great emotional moments that break the cut and dry hollywood same'ol.<br><br>probably not a great movie for people who'd rather analyse director shots rather than actually enjoying the story and getting lost in the moment.","user":"aciddawn","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Weird and funny film","rating":10,"date":"18 December 2018","review":"I am so happy this film exists! It is really unique and there were many LOL Chris Elliot physical comedy moments. Some of my favorite and most memorable scenes were when the daughters were talking very candidly and saying things that I myself would never say around my parents. I hope there is a sequel!","user":"crispinrosenkranz","rank":[5,10]}]
