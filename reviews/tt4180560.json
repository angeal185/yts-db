[{"title":"From motherhood to otherhood","rating":6,"date":"5 August 2019","review":"A feel good movie about the midlife crisis and the empty nest syndrome. On Mother's Day, three single mothers decide to rendezvous in Manhattan with their three ungrateful sons. Ungrateful? Well, they forgot about Mother's Day ... again!<br><br>The atmosphere looks like an unpredictable mix of the endearing side of any <a href=\"/name/nm0000095/\">Woody Allen</a> movie from the 70s, the irreverent side of <a href=\"/title/tt0159206/\">Sex and the City (1998)</a> and the cheesy side of <a href=\"/title/tt0795421/\">Mamma Mia! (2008)</a>. It's definitely not a masterpiece but I liked it.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[35,42]},{"title":"I called to my mom after the movie","rating":8,"date":"2 August 2019","review":"I mean, yes is a predictable comedy BUT the message that this movies pass us is so strong and powerful.\nA solid screenplay, a nice directing style with a Netflix budget and with the outstanding and brilliant performances of the Oscar nominated actresses Angela Bassett and Felicty Huffman and Oscar Winner Patrícia Arquette.\nRecommended to the all the grown up sons that live far away from their mother.\nAnd in the end of the movie u're gonna miss her so much that u gonna call to your mom until she answer.","user":"CinemaAmazing","rank":[55,84]},{"title":"Loved it!","rating":9,"date":"3 August 2019","review":"Cliché or not, I loved it!
