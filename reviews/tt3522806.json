[{"title":"Very predictable","rating":6,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"Fun action as usual, the plot is paper thin but works. Writing didn't make sense at times.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[38,39]},{"title":"Seen it all before","rating":4,"date":"2 September 2016","review":"Apparently Hollywood is completely out of ideas. How else to explain this film? You have a \"retired\" assassin/sniper/martial arts master who is living a quiet life, and doesn't want to be called back into service. A government agent/former friend/former enemy blackmails/coerces him into returning to do some evil deeds, but he will be killing evil doers/assassins/nasty government types so he can stay a hero. Along comes a pretty girl that gets sucked into the plot, they fall in love/have sex/exchange witty barbs, and before long her life is in peril. The hero stabs/shoots/kicks/hangs/blows up and otherwise creates mayhem, and no one else in his path can shoot, throw a knife, or otherwise match his skills. Lots of stuff gets blown up and lots of people get killed, and it all takes place in exotic locations. The hero and the girl get together in the final scene.<br><br>What a waste!","user":"drjgardner","rank":[181,202]},{"title":"It is a boring and non logical film","rating":4,"date":"2 September 2016","review":"The content is too non logical, Jason has no reason to scarify his life for a 2 days met girl.<br><br>For short, this film is only for watching some action scenes. But even with the action scene, it is a little bit affected when Jason kills everyone without any considerable antagonistic. <br><br>The role of the woman in this film is also funny, she has no reason to come to his life :D <br><br>I am a fan of Jason, but frankly, I am disappointed of this film.<br><br>I only rate it with 4/10.<br><br>Regards,","user":"thangvietbk","rank":[127,156]}]
