[{"title":"What happened?","rating":2,"date":"17 August 2019","review":"I grew up watching wayans brothers movies and marlon was my favourite, but my god what happened to him?? This movie if filled with old, tired and unfunny cliche bits (not even from his old movies, from generic comedies)\nI have to assume the chemistry of the acting is due to the fact it's all the same person talking to each other but the script and dialogue is shockingly dull.\nThe storyline is half decent, and the idea for the movie is mildly interesting but it just doesn't hold up.\nIf they worked on the script a little more and tried some more progressive humour it might actually work as a half decent comedy, but if you compare this to the old stuff he used to do it's just awful.","user":"jdgrayson-08010","rank":[62,83]},{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"16 August 2019","review":"Without doubt this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I am slightly disappointed in myself for watching this all the way through.","user":"bigmin","rank":[146,215]},{"title":"Don't waste your time","rating":1,"date":"17 August 2019","review":"Not even worth watching.
