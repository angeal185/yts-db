[{"title":"Great movie for young children - a positive addition to the Tinker Bell universe","rating":8,"date":"5 March 2014","review":"I have been a fan of the Tinker Bell franchise, since I started watching them with my children a few years ago. There are relatively few high-quality animated movies that, like this one, are appropriate for very young children, so we look forward to each new installment. The Tinker Bell universe adds a little Pixar magic to the original Disney Peter Pan universe story and brings it up to date. Compare it to the original Disney Peter Pan movie, and it is striking how aged and inappropriate for young children that one feels.<br><br>I watched the movie in the cinema during the winter holiday with my daughter (4 1/2 years) and son (3 years). They were glued to the silver screen the hole time and loved it just as much as the other installments. My daughter now wants to be a fairy pirate like Zarina. I enjoyed it, too. I have watched the other four Tinker Bell movies, and it actually manages to renew the universe and bring in new three-dimensional characters like Zarina who tests the limits of Pixie Hollow even more than Tinker Bell.<br><br>One of the interesting things in the movie is how they have started to bring in a little more of the original Peter Pan universe in an unexpected way. I would not be surprised to see even more of this in the next installment. I also liked the score, where they added a few pirate songs to the always beautiful fairy songs (I should mention that I watched the Danish-language version of the movie). Summing up, a great movie for young children that adds positively to the charming Tinker Bell universe.","user":"Lebech","rank":[34,40]},{"title":"A little gem of a film that deserves more publicity than it seems to be getting.","rating":10,"date":"24 February 2014","review":"I'm sure anyone who is a dyed-in-the-wool follower of the Tinkerbell series of movies (like me) will be more than delighted with the latest instalment - Tinkerbell and the Pirate Fairy. A year ago, Tinkerbell and the Secret of the Wings totally blew me away. (So much so that I was extolling that film's praises for several months afterwards.) Well, I'm delighted to say that the same thing (extolling of praises) is pretty much certain to happen with me about this film too! Tinkerbell and the Pirate Fairy simply brims with delightful characters old and new. The plot is superb. Original, intelligent, witty and well constructed (ie there are no discrepancies in the narrative and all loose ends are satisfyingly tied up by the end of the movie). Zarina, the new fairy, is a wonderful addition to the cast. In many ways Zarina's particular 'talent' drives her to behave in ways we have become used to associating with Tinkerbell herself - ie she is inquisitive, takes risks and feels herself impelled to go beyond Pixie Hollow's previously established (and generally accepted) boundaries. I liked that there was plenty of good natured interaction this time among Tinkerbell's regular cohort of friends (Vidia, Iridessa, Silvermist and Rosetta) and many times something one or another of them said would cause me to chuckle with mirth. The action of the skirmishes between the fairies and the pirates is thrillingly animated. Finally, I thought the artwork throughout was top notch and the music, whether sung or instrumental, was both subtle and fitted well with the visuals. There is vastly more that I found enjoyable in this film (told you I'd be extolling the film's praises didn't I!) but I think you've probably heard enough from me by now. Whatever your age or gender (I'm a sixty something male), give yourself a treat ... go see Tinkerbell and the Pirate Fairy. My bet is you won't be disappointed. (Go with a little 'faith, trust and pixie dust' and you'll enjoy it even more!) 10/10.","user":"geoffgee","rank":[41,53]},{"title":"Loved it","rating":10,"date":"27 March 2014","review":"Not even sure why I ended up watching this movie but as I like animated movies I gave it a try. Yep, it's meant to be for kids but ... but I just loved it. It's one of those feel good movies. It's funny, witty and just cute ;) Characters are excellent (even those mean pirates), animation and music is top notch as well with kind of old-school feeling. And voice casting is just lovely :) I will probably even check out some other stories from the \"fairy\" universe. As I am from Czech Republic I do not know much about Peter Pan and Tinker Bell as those characters aren't so famous in my country. Anyway I am giving 10/10 and I recommend this movie to anyone who is 2+ or just in mood for little bit of childish fun ;)","user":"nomad-73","rank":[18,24]}]
