[{"title":"The DVD alternate ending makes a BIG difference","rating":7,"date":"10 January 2004","review":"I had not seen this movie when originally released because of bad reviews. I did however recently pick up the DVD in the $5.99 rack at Target mainly because I really like Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd. They did do their usual fine job of acting but I must admit that the plot was convoluted and illogical and the first time through watching it normally, I was disappointed in the lingering confusion.<br><br>I then watched the one deleted scene and the alternate ending and it changed my whole perspective. Sometimes alternate endings do not really change much but this was the most dramatically different alternate ending I have ever seen. It wrapped up everything for me and made the whole thing crystal clear and satisfying.<br><br>I can not imagine why they left out this long segment that does not so much result in an alternate ending per se, but rather fills in a lot of the holes that I had in my head. It is worth your time to rent the DVD and see this alternate ending. It may change your mind about the movie.","user":"Buff2001","rank":[78,98]},{"title":"Don't waste your money.","rating":1,"date":"7 December 2000","review":"Ashley Judd has turned in excellent performances in movies like \"Double Jeopardy\".  But this movie is pathetic.  The character played by Ewan McGregor seemed to be on drugs.  This movie was weird,dumb,and boring.","user":"bamatommy","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Boring and hard to follow.","rating":1,"date":"19 October 2000","review":"Another rental that I feel I have wasted $4 on and about two hours of my life.  The plot didn't make sense and was hard to follow.  The pace was also painstakingly slow.  This is a story that probably needs the format of a book to be able to understand.  I didn't like the main character.  He was a stalker and they made that out to be like it was okay.  I would recommend a pass on this movie.","user":"jcushin","rank":[14,17]}]
