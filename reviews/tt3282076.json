[{"title":"Why all the negativity!","rating":7,"date":"1 September 2019","review":"I'm a big De Palma fan, and i have loved almost every film he has made. Ok, its not one of his best films, but giving it 1 and 2 stars is just ridiculous. It has all the elements a De Palma film should have and i really enjoyed the way he builds up the suspense in the story. I loved the slow motion scene in the bullfight arena. I know it's a bit weird that all the Danish actors talk English, but i didn't mind. I myself are Danish and i know all the actors from Danish and they are all great actors. I would recommend everyone who like De Palma films to watch it and forget about all the hater's reviews.","user":"beofreak","rank":[31,42]},{"title":"What the hell is this?","rating":1,"date":"11 June 2019","review":"So you're told to watch a movie about a terrorist plot, starring Guy Pearce, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Carice van Houten and SÃ¸ren Malling. And you think \"Hey, I know these guys, they are good actors!\". You are told that Brian De Palma is directing, and you think \"Brian 'Scarface' De Palma? Let's watch this!\"<br><br>90 minutes later you are still trying to wrap your head around the impossibly bad movie that you have been subjected to.<br><br>How on Earth did this happen? Yeah, the Trivia section mentions production issues and all that, but then again, what the hell was this? Let's just forget this movie exists and move on.","user":"migueldominguezmr","rank":[63,102]},{"title":"Terrible film","rating":1,"date":"2 June 2019","review":"Bad acting all round. Awful dramatic music and unbelievable script.\nMade laugh that at a crime scene the CSI are all in masks and gloves with shoe covers. The main character of the film walks right through the crime scene in his own shoes.\nDon't waste 90 minutes of your life watching this tosh. It's the turkey of the year for me","user":"divealanya","rank":[66,111]}]
