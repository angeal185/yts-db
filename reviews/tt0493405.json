[{"title":"Entertaining comedy","rating":7,"date":"29 March 2017","review":"All too often people like to rag on movies like this. Not every movie to hit the cinema will be Oscar worthy, Not every movie will be written with a story that will move you to tears or challenge your thinking. Set your expectations for the movie you will see and you are less likely to be disappointed. <br><br>Chips is an entertaining cop buddy flick, rated R and has some adult humor. Both Pena and Shepard play their parts well and along the way the movie pokes fun at itself and the genre. There are plenty of laughs to be had here and overall the movie went at a steady pace. There is nothing ground breaking in it but I wanted a laugh, I got a laugh. Hopefully it does well enough at the box office to get a sequel.","user":"andybyrne79","rank":[113,165]},{"title":"People are being too harsh, very funny film!!","rating":9,"date":"2 April 2017","review":"As a preface, I have never seen an episode of the original show; I knew Estrada was in it and that's all. So, if you're a fan of the series, I cannot say whether you will enjoy this film (though based on other reviews I've read, it seems unlikely). <br><br>What I can tell you is that I had low expectations and just wanted a laugh. Dax Sheppard's films have always been hit-or-miss for me. When I bought the tickets, I wasn't even aware that it was rated R. <br><br>I was very pleasantly surprised! My friend and I both laughed non-stop at the off-the-wall humor. The success of the jokes was in the delivery - often very deadpan and unexpected. Some reviewers complained about the sex addiction/masturbation jokes, but I found them hilarious due to Sheppard's sincere concern and Pe√±a's awkward embarrassment.<br><br>As a motorcyclist, I very much enjoyed all the bike action and liked that they kept it relatively realistic (but don't look for realism as a general rule; that's not what comedy is about) regarding the necessary skills (Ponche thought he could match Baker and was sorely mistaken) and the comparative speed of a lightweight sport bike vs. the clunky cruisers. I also loved that, when they upgraded to sport bikes themselves, they wore proper full-body riding gear instead of promoting riding in street clothes as most films do. <br><br>In short: this is a riot, not an Oscar-winner. Go for laughs, not for a serious cop film.","user":"dragonhunter200","rank":[82,136]},{"title":"Peaks and Valleys","rating":6,"date":"24 March 2017","review":"Sometimes I have a hard time rating movies, and more specifically comedies. Because comedies generally try to do nothing other than make you laugh, it's easier to let plot and character development (etc) slide, as you might not with other genres of movies. This is the typical R rated comedy of this day and age - over the top, raunchy comedy that focuses mostly on human anatomy jokes. If you hate those movies, avoid it at all costs. If you like them, then you'll probably like this. <br><br>At the screening I saw this at just about everyone after the film was talking about how they liked it, and there was certainly a lot of laughter in the theater throughout the movie. <br><br>This movie had a few moments of truly laugh out loud hilarity, outside of those few moments the rest of the comedy was there, but it was pretty generic.<br><br>Look, you know what type of movie this is (raunchy comedy). If you go to the theater and drop your $ and don't like it, that's on you.","user":"allstarrunner","rank":[36,58]}]
