[{"title":"Great if you like terrible acting mixed with a fair amount of breasts","rating":3,"date":"28 January 2015","review":"The basic set-up is a sexually frustrated bride-to-be gives her fiancé a hall pass to get his freak on in Vegas. She tries to ensure this by telling the best man (who apparently is an employee in her company) he will get a promotion if he gets the groom laid.<br><br>Honestly their isn't any point in telling you anything further regarding the plot. The acting is SO bad. The topless women are really the only reason to watch this bomb. If this is your only option to watch, you might consider giving your goldfish a bath, maybe even counting hair follicles, learning to levitate, or even master the Time Warp!","user":"wildmanmw","rank":[21,28]},{"title":"C'mon, were you expecting Oscar-worthy acting?","rating":5,"date":"3 July 2017","review":"I dunno, maybe I'm crazy but as far as raunchy B-movies go, this one was actually fairly decent. I laughed, I cried, I admired lots of boobs—who had the best roles in the movie, actually. The Vegas cut-scenes thrown in like a truly high-end iMovie user took the cake, baby! Real cinematography genius there. As an added bonus, the music was actually pretty good.<br><br>Worth the hour or so of your time to watch, if only for the boobs and the music... but if you were looking for more than that (why would you every need more than that in a movie is beyond me), you're going to be disappointed.<br><br>Baaaaahhhh, who am I kidding? The music wasn't that great either.","user":"jd-creativeguy","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Quality topless women","rating":3,"date":"16 July 2019","review":"It does have topless women. Other than that the attempt at humor sucks. Cliche male dominance movie. Again it does have topless and hot women.","user":"johnnyrockets55","rank":[1,1]}]
