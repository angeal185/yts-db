[{"title":"Mature, sober look at human side of the Cold War","rating":10,"date":"10 October 2002","review":"I liked this one very much. Julie Andrews and Omar Sharif bring a very sober and realistic screenplay to life about real human beings involved/kept apart by the Cold War. I very much liked the Julie Andrews character who doesn't fear speaking about morality to a Communist likely to scoff, nor fear falling for that Communist with ehr eyes wide open, despite all the difficulties that would bring. Julie Andrews is just wonderful in this role - rather lonely, quite real, with warring feelings between head and heart about caring for someone who is dangerous to know - and in his work, dangerous to the Free World.<br><br>Omar Sharif is excellent - charming, quick-witted, falling for Andrews (and who wouldn't - she looks fantastic) despite himself, and finally making the life-changing decision to defect. <br><br>I can understand why some find the movie plodding - it certainly is by most spy movie standards. But it's trying to do something different - and admirably succeeding - one just feels the existence of the Iron Curtain here, and one feels the Andrews character making her point that at the heart of the Cold War are questions about the value to be given an individual human being by the state, the value of truth as capturing measurable facts, the value of allowing people to live by their own goals and values rather than those determined by the state. <br><br>And the over-arching question is an interesting one of emotional involvement despite world tensions. <br><br>You'll like its gradual unfolding - just don't look for James Bond.","user":"trpdean","rank":[36,37]},{"title":"UNDERRATED SPY FILM, QUITE GOOD","rating":17,"date":"17 May 2001","review":"Blake Edwards' \"The Tamarind Seed\" falls into the \"lost\" category, more specifically the era spanning 1968-1974, when Edwards released a series of films, ranging from good to great, that died a bloody box-office death. That doesn't mean that any of these films were bad. You can't account for audience taste.<br><br>Anyway, \"The Tamarind Seed\" is a different film for Edwards: an international spy thriller. I think the reason for the film not being well received by the public was that Edwards was stereotyped as a comedy director. Indeed, many of his best films (\"10\", \"S.O.B.\", \"Victor/Victoria\", and \"The Pink Panther Strikes Again\") are in this genre. But during this period, Edwards made many fine straight films such as \"Experiment in Terror\", \"Darling Lili\", \"Wild Rovers\", \"The Carey Treatment\" and \"Gunn\". These films are lost today, thanks to clueless studio executives who didn't know how to market them and the clueless moviegoers who stayed away in droves.<br><br>Lucky for us, cable TV still remains the forum to catch some of these lost treasures (except \"Gunn\" which seems lost forever) and AMC has been playing \"The Tamarind Seed\" frequently. Early video copies distributed by Magnetic Video and Embassy Home Entertainment still exist in used video stores around the country.<br><br>Now, about the film itself. Edwards has crafted a pretty skillful thriller here. Spy movies often die a quick death because most directors think they have to be either T&amp;A fests or relentlessly talky. What makes the Bond films so much fun is that there's a sly sense of humor and Edwards understands that. But Edwards maintains a smooth control over his material here and doesn't play this material for monster laughs (rightly).This is a real good story, which I will not reveal, because the film's success is dependent on Edwards' surprises. The acting is great (with Julie Andrews and Omar Sharif in the lead roles, how could it be bad?), the cinematography (by the great Freddie Young in Panavision)is dazzling as it would be from that great talent, and the script gets involved enough in the story that we can follow it without getting confused.<br><br>\"The Tamarind Seed\" is very much worth the effort to find. Once you see it, it will be hard to forget it.<br><br>**** out of 4 stars","user":"Katmiss","rank":[31,32]},{"title":"Good Old-Fashioned Fun","rating":20,"date":"20 April 1999","review":"\"The Tamarind Seed\" is a wonderful film to discover for the first time in the video store when you're searching for something good to watch.  Made at a time when negative depictions of the Soviet Union had fallen out of favor in the movies, \"The Tamarind Seed\" wonderfully bucks this trend as Russian embassy Colonel Omar Sharif ultimately comes to realize that the nature of the Soviet system makes some things worse than treason against it.  Julie Andrews is at her most beautiful as a British Home Office employee who first meets Sharif on vacation in Barbados, falls in love with him and helps him defect.","user":"Eric-62","rank":[18,18]}]
