[{"title":"I would've kicked him out my car within minutes","rating":2,"date":"19 October 2018","review":"You had two leads who had chemistry, but some of the acting was off (and I've seen them act better, so I'm gonna say it's the script and direction at fault) and you messed it up BIG time. I wanted to like the movie because of the actors but I don't think I want this writer or director to make another movie, sorry.<br><br>So many things annoyed me mainly the killer, he wasn't scary but unbelievably irritating, in real life you'd kill HIM before he could kill you!!!<br><br>And going into a covered pool as the only logical hiding place....absolutely absurd.<br><br>No comprehensible motive for why he did what he did, and how was he gonna pick up James next passenger without a car?!?!<br><br>I watched this for free, if I paid I would definitely get my money back.","user":"DreamWonder","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"After a long time starting it went nowhere","rating":1,"date":"14 October 2018","review":"A rather dull start before the event that changed the story. Like the drive itself the plot went on a meandering, eventless journey to nowhere in particular. It didn't even end. No thrills, no shocks, no plot twists. Acting was OK, even the dialogue was alright. It was dull, causing no offence nor any excitement. Everything was guessable.\nRead a good book instead of watching this.","user":"andrewlevison-40916","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"He gave him the gun","rating":1,"date":"9 October 2018","review":"The bad guy gives the good guy the gun that he was threatening them with and he doesnt shoot the bad guy but shoots listens and shots another good guy most ridiculous story fail ever and we stopped watching after.","user":"christopherneitz","rank":[25,31]}]
