[{"title":"beautiful, serene, surreal","rating":7,"date":"24 April 2019","review":"Another movie denied its proper place rating-wise by a sparsity of ratings! this was lovely to watch, with a beautifully haunting (original?) soundtrack and surreal, yet captivating cinematography. it's very much a thematic, atmospheric film. there isn't much of a \"plot\" and while the description / synopsis makes it sound like the movie focuses on the adventures of a girl across a magical land, that isn't the main focus, it's more of a glimpse into life, mythology, setting, guilt, death. less provocative are the characters, who don't stand out very much, and character development often feels a little forced.","user":"dirtydiph","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Beautiful","rating":10,"date":"5 April 2019","review":"The Burial of Kojo has so many beautiful elements from a wide variety of styles.
