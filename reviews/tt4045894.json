[{"title":"Get the Girl Review","rating":6,"date":"9 April 2017","review":"There are so many movie's today that rely heavily on a gimmick to impress - As an audience we want something new, and from time to time we'll gladly take something old as long as it inventive in some form. With Director Eric England's (Contracted) \"Get the Girl\", we may not get anything new - but we do get a fun paced thriller packed with twists you might see coming and characters that even Tarantino himself might take a nod.<br><br>\"Get the Girl\" starts with a simple premise - A wealthy young man (Justin Dobies) falls in love with a girl (Elizabeth Whitson). Love at first sight, allegedly. Only thing is - she doesn't know he exist, despite the fact that he comes each night during her shift - Just to see her! He's then manipulated by Patrick (Noah Segan) into a fake kidnapping in order to win her affection. Of course things go horribly wrong all around the board.<br><br>Eric England crafts a fun story with a few thrills and perhaps a few unseen twists and turns along the way to keep you busy. Our proposed hero - Clarence is rather dull and timid, with constant voice overs that remind you of Jessie Eisenberg's \"Zombieland\". The real hero of this story and perhaps fun character to stay with throughout the 1h 27 mark is Adi Shankar as KJ - Adi Shankar is hilariously brilliant in every scene he's in, you'll probably wish he had more to do though. Noah Segan (Looper) is also very good.<br><br>Overall this is a movie worth watching, despite a formula you've probably seen one to many times before.","user":"geraldohanna","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"Everybody's doing it!","rating":5,"date":"1 March 2017","review":"So the new thing for seasoned horror directors is to make their first non horror film, sometimes with elements of horror, but ultimately a different genre. Ti west with \"In a valley of violence, Christopher Smith with \"Detour\", now Eric England with \"Get the girl\", and there are many more examples I cant think of off the top of my head immedietely. Eric England's \"Get the girl\" is upbeat, hip, somewhat exciting, and pretty fast paced. This movie is done by a director who has only done horror films up to this point and although he is young Eric England is still seasoned in the genre. Madison County had corny and ugly characters but was overall a good horror movie. Contracted was also a good horror movie. It is a body horror film with some good creepy factors to it. It gives a nice nod to independent horror as it stars talented screenwriter Simon Barret as the mysterious man, Caroline Williams as the worried mother, Matt Mercer who England also used in his first film \"Madison County\" and went on to become a staple in independent horror. \"Roadside\", England's second to newest film, was pretty crappy and uneventful. It was a mix of a very boring thriller/mystery/horror. Now, England comes out with this narrative engaging thriller, \"Get the girl\". The only problem is tho, that there are a lot of problems with this film, as it seems as if the director wanted to upgrade his filming quality and style but he kinda just did it with out really doing his homework on it. It seems like an amateur director tried to make a big budget feeling film, but failed kinda miserably. The lead character is boring and extremely generic. He is not attractive, he is childish, his intro background story was seriously lacking any real background info about him which keeps the audience from ever really feeling for this guy or relating with him and immedietely makes us think he is shady by not telling us more of his background. Its like he was hiding something from us and we knew this within the first 5 or 10 minutes of the movie. The girl is also very boring and not very attractive at all. The movie is overall confusing and the only redeeming quality, in my opinion, is the presence of Noah Segan. He brings a certain menace to any movie he stars in. This movie seemed childish and immature. It is like a step backwards for Eric England, as there is no real emotional or mental pull to this film. It is barely comendable and very forgettable. The biggest problem in this film is the editing. The film editing sucks. There are several shots where a character is standing there making a certain face, or even pointing a gun at someone, and then in the immediate next shot, the character is suddenly turned around looking out the window. There was no transfer in actions. It was weird to see the focus of the shot operating and moving smoothly and accurately, while the background character was pointing a gun and shifted to walking up the stairs in the blink of an eye. Terrible editing for an overused and tiring plot. You would think Eric England had more \"oomph\" in him. I am not impressed at all. I follow horror directors and their work and I was excited to hear about this film but once I saw it, I felt embarrassed for the director. Maybe he will redeem himself with his upcoming four films lol. I guess the lesson here is don't bite off more than you can chew and always do your homework. Gave it a 5 cuz its a good teeny bopper movie for toolish and foolish kids, and cuz i feel a little bad for England who made a movie to throw up to for all the wrong reasons.","user":"TuesdayThe17th","rank":[7,13]},{"title":"has its moments, but not enough","rating":5,"date":"14 November 2017","review":"What saves this film from total boredom is the use of humour. The characters are all somewhat offbeat an don't always take the right decisions in the strange situations there in. And then you have the head character saying quotes every time he finds himself stuck in a weird situation. Not that all of this makes a great film: story is to generic, the final twist doesn't really work, mix of humour and violence should have been darker...But hey if you simply want a fast paced action film with some humour, this film will do the job. Nothing more, nothing less.","user":"bel001","rank":[1,1]}]
