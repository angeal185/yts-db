[{"title":"An obscure gem from Steve McQueen","rating":12,"date":"12 March 2004","review":"I personally rank this film, based on William Faulkner's last novel, among my favorites. Not that I would rank it as a \"great\" film, but it's a lot of fun. It's true that McQueen may have been in fact older than his character was supposed to be, but his attitude and style seems to bring it off. Mitch Vogel, as the young boy Lucius, who is lured into stealing his grandfather's (Will Geer) new Winton Flyer automobile for a wild weekend in Memphis by Boone Hoggenbeck (McQueen) is completely believable as a kid who wants the adventure, but has to be drawn into it because he respects his grandfather so much. Rupert Crosse as McQueen's other reiver (thief) in this caper adds an extra comic relief as the one who gets them into a real fix in Memphis. Ordinarily I hate movies with running narration, but the narration in this by Burgess Meredith as the grown old Lucius, remembering his exciting weekend in Memphis, adds a real touch of poignancy to this tale of youth lost. Additionally, Sharon Farrell as McQueen's prostitute girlfriend, Clifton James as a vicious southern sheriff, and Juano Hernandez as a kindly old black farmer add real dimension to the film. Throw in a beautiful score by John Williams (his first film score) and you've got the makings of a warm, charming story, accurately drawn, from the turn of the century. The scene at the film's end, where the grandfather has a heart-to-heart talk with the boy, is wonderful, and very \"authentic.\"  The director, Mark Rydell, did a terrific job. I've seen this movie many times, and it never fails to entertain me.","user":"lyle-12","rank":[32,37]},{"title":"A movie with special charm","rating":10,"date":"16 June 2002","review":"For a movie that starred one of the greatest box office stars of his time, based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by one America's greatest writers, \"The Reivers\" has continued to be something of an answer to a trivia question (\"In what movie did Steve McQueen portray a semi-comic character involving a stolen automobile and a horse race?\")  I'm not sure of the reasons myself, but this movie has remained at the top of my \"Favorite Movies\" list since I first saw it in 1969.  Maybe it was the out-of-character role of McQueen.  Maybe it was the excellence of his supporting cast that includes Mitch Vogel, Rupert Crosse and Will Geer. Maybe it was the direction by Mark Rydell.  Or maybe it was the outstanding score by John Williams (which has remained my favorite movie score of all time). Most likely, it is a combination of all the above. All I can say is that this movie has never lost its appeal for me.  Watching the movie is like visiting an old friend with whom the passage of time will only strengthen the bonds of affection.  This movie may not be for everybody, but I recommend it on the chance that you may be smitten by its special charm.","user":"Shooturiout","rank":[34,40]},{"title":"\"...the virgin's love of his rough and innocent heart.\"","rating":7,"date":"10 April 2014","review":"This movie holds a special significance to me as it was one of my late father's favorites. It's a William Faulkner coming-of-age story about a boy named Lucius (Mitch Vogel) in early 1900s Mississippi. Lucius looks up to Boon (Steve McQueen), the immature handyman on his grandfather's plantation. Boon convinces Lucius to help him \"borrow\" the grandfather's brand new car and drive to Memphis to see Boon's prostitute girlfriend (Sharon Farrell). Tagging along for the ride is Lucius' older cousin Ned (Rupert Crosse), who's almost as irresponsible as Boon. Once in Memphis, a lot of things happen and they wind up needing to win a horse race to get the grandfather's car back.<br><br>McQueen is good in a role a little outside of his wheelhouse. Vogel, Farrell, and Crosse are all good as well. Will Geer plays the grandpa. Light-hearted but with some serious moments. In many ways it plays like a Disney film of the period, except with whores and people using the N-word. William Faulkner is probably my favorite Southern author but his work hasn't been considered easy to translate to screen. This is one of the better efforts.","user":"utgard14","rank":[12,13]}]
