[{"title":"Interesting, real life and visually appealing","rating":8,"date":"16 December 2019","review":"This is a very good movie depicting post traumatic stress of returned soldiers. The main Actor does a great job. Not a big American production, but certainly a decent effort for an Australian feature film. Worth a view","user":"melissahmcgrath","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"The Real Rambo","rating":7,"date":"16 December 2019","review":"I love Australia &amp; World Films and TV they are a lot more realistic than the US BS that claims to be the truth.\nOne Soldier's story about being sent on a mission to Myanmar and dealing with the trauma and guilt back in the real world.\nA reporter delves into the truth about what happened to her brother on the mission.\nA very realistic depiction of how the horrors of war can impact on the family life.\nVery well acted by Josh Mcconville and well supported by Bonnie Sveen and Jessi Robertson.","user":"pkdyer6519","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Is like a rambo returns","rating":7,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"I really like this movie.\nIt is a gritty, grimy, brutal perspective of a war in the burmese jungles.\nA passable performance by Josh McConville as the troubled soldier.\nIt has everything in it and as such never really achieves anything. Can't help but feel it's more a Storm Ashwood showcase than film....<br><br>but it's a good showcase, definitely worth a go.","user":"SlightlyMe","rank":[4,7]}]
