[{"title":"offers more than other thrillers","rating":24,"date":"24 September 1999","review":"I'm really surprised that there are next-to-no comments on this excellent thriller. It has been on ITV many times now, but I have only just caught it now after reading a second-hand copy of the novel. This thriller deals with the inequality between men and women in the corporate workplace brilliantly, displaying the clichéd attitudes of so-called friends and colleagues. this film has a real moral to it that rises it up from the blockbuster it is intended to be. The plight of the man against the megalomaniac female corporate boss seems quite desperate against the political correctness of the 90's, but is also sadly realistic showing what an unphilanthropic, complicated world this sometimes is. Especially in the ever-dominant world of corporations, simple human empathy is lost against a backlash of other most often selfish concerns. Michael Douglas as Tom was superb, although the acting of Meredith was sometimes a bit too clichéd, although this of course is what it was meant to be. All-in-all a very enjoyable, gripping thriller with all the plot that only usually a novel adaptation can give, exploring a real contemporary issue which other thrillers typically leave blank.","user":"TheNGBCh","rank":[51,60]},{"title":"An intriguing story of sex and power...","rating":6,"date":"6 July 2001","review":"Sexual harrassment soars to new concepts in this compelling film based on the novel of the same title by Michael Chricton.<br><br>Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) is psyched up about his promotion at DigiCom. But, as he arrives at work that morning, he finds out that the promotion never happened, but the position of Vice President was given to a woman.  Of course, its not just any woman, its Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore), a woman from his past.  Sanders discloses that he once was in a whirlwind romance with Meredith, but they parted ways and he came to Seattle, married, and started a family.  Now, she wants nothing more to rekindle their romance, which Sanders doesn't want.  An after-hours encounter leads to Meredith crying sexual harrassment, Sanders claiming he was the one who was really harrassed. Now, Sanders must be able to push past her power and status to show people what Meredith is really all about.<br><br>This was a great movie, based on an amazing novel.  Douglas as Tom Sanders is what I expected, middle aged with a family, successful.  However, the novel describes Meredith Johnson as blonde, while Demi Moore was not what I really pictured.  However, her performance as \"Super-Bitch\" Meredith is convincing.  She makes you hate her, no matter how much you like the characters she played in other films.<br><br>The part where Sanders struggled with Johnson in her office was extremely graphic.  My mom predicted that I would cover my eyes, but I was very fascinated with it.  In the book, this particular scene was EXTREMELY long, about 15 pages.<br><br>In conclusion, I thought \"Disclosure\" was a very well-done film with a great cast.  Performances by Moore and Douglas were great, with a good supporting cast to back them up.  It gives a good understanding of the American Legal System and sexual harrassment, and proves that sexual harrassment works on two levels.  Sex is truly power, and if you have it, you have it, and if you don't...well, you'll have to work hard to prove yourself.  I highly recommend seeing this film, but read the novel in addition to the movie. You won't regret it.","user":"AllisonLVenezio","rank":[38,45]},{"title":"Taut psychological suspense, good performances. Didn't like the sci-fi stuff!","rating":7,"date":"27 June 2004","review":"Tense thriller mixes legal suspense, gender-role debate and technology-based action, with mixed results. In fact, its all good except for the computer stuff. The firm which the film revolves around is Digicom (a bit too made-up sounding for my liking), a computer technology firm. We're told at the beginning that the firm is developing a new technology, which will be used as collateral in the upcoming merger. They develop a sort of virtual reality file-scanning system, which doesn't make file-searching any easier whatsoever, but is more like an unnecessary toy for show - but it plays a part late in the film that, for me, was my only complaint about the film. All of a sudden, we go into the machine, and it just sticks out like a sore thumb as being totally wrong for this movie - we're in a sci-fi movie all of a sudden. Plus, it was totally unnecessary. In the scene straight after, the character reports what they discovered in the machine, so it was more for show than relevance - but it ends up hurting the consistency of the film for those five minutes.<br><br>This film suffers a little from the same thing the Sandra Bullock vehicle The Net suffers from - in hindsight, now that we've all just accepted the internet and computers as a helpful part of our daily existence, all these old fears we had seem slightly silly. Its a bit like looking back at those Y2K scares and thinking how ridiculous we were to be so afraid. Unlike The Net, though, technology-phobia is only in the subplot of this film. Its more about what happens between Michael Douglas and Demi Moore late one night at the office, and what happens afterwards.<br><br>Its very wordy - so be prepared for that. A couple of early dialogue scenes should have been rewritten with the dialogue absent, and told with a couple of thoughtful extended shots. But maybe i only think that because i've just gotten into Antonioni. He really makes this movie look reliant on words.<br><br>\nThe sex scene is so well choreographed as to feed an entire movie's worth of plot. Its sexy - true, Demi Moore radiates sex appeal like you wouldn't believe - its an incredible scene to watch. But its stict mechanics are also very necessary for the rest of the plot. Its one of the most necessary and justified sex scenes i've ever seen.<br><br>Overall, it works. Its a tense thriller with two really incredible performances from the leads. I don't think its an essential movie, and its not particularly pleasant, if that's what you're after, but if you want a good tense thriller (which many of us do), this is worth a rental. Plus, we feel for Michael Douglas and want things to turn out good for him. So in that way, i think it deserves a workmanlike 7/10.","user":"Ben_Cheshire","rank":[51,63]}]
