[{"title":"Back to the good old days ...","rating":9,"date":"10 June 2011","review":"I can honestly say this is better than Jackass 3D. The main commentary I keep hearing about Jackass 3D is that it felt forced. The stunts were too far-fetched and although it was still a cool movie, it just wasn't as funny as the old stuff. I liked the movie and laughed at most bits but I personally got the feeling that it was over, the novelty had worn off and it was the end of Jackass. But Jackass 3.5 is different. The pranks are back, the feeling of comradery is back and they went back to the style of stunts that made them popular many many years ago. The stunts are simpler and dumber than in Jackass 3D, they're the kind of stunts we got to know them with, and it's that style of stunts we love. The group is back together, and I'm sure all Jackass fans will love it. This movie brings back a lot of memories. There isn't much else to say, see it for yourself and laugh your *ss off !","user":"nielsboex","rank":[20,24]},{"title":"Much Better Than Expected","rating":8,"date":"10 June 2011","review":"The Jackass series is gross out humour that is funny because it's stupid and people get hurt. These guys have been doing this thing for ten years now. 3 films later, the stuff they do is still funny. Jackass 3.5 is pretty exactly what Jackass 2.5 tried to be. The crew shot so much footage, that it could essentially be another movie. So instead of adding the scenes for special features, they made 2.5 and now 3.5.<br><br>If you are a bit apprehensive about this one because of the lackluster 2.5, don't be. Jackass 3.5 is hilarious and maybe even funnier than Jackass 3D. They have a better flow and format down for this addition and it shows. Everything runs smoother, it's not horribly intercut every time with interviews that we don't care about. Every so often it will cut to someone explaining something, but 2.5 was interview overkill. Here they have significantly cut it back and let the stunts do the talking. <br><br>3.5 showcases a lot more male nudity then the other entries, I think you see Pontius and his penis 4 times...in super slow motion no less. Using the state of the art Phantom camera, that big productions like Sherlock Holmes used, we get to see male parts move around in slow motion. Hilarious and disturbing at the same time. <br><br>This is a recommendation for any fan of the series. The DVD has some nice features as well, you get a look at the initial creation of the show, how half-assed the stunts were and how young everyone is. It's nostalgic. <br><br>In short, Jackass 3.5 is funny and a big step up from the disappointing 2.5, which definitely should have been left for deleted scenes. Jackass 3.5 is worth the viewing.","user":"Matt_Layden","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Welcome back to the world of danger and lowercase letters","rating":7,"date":"12 June 2011","review":"I've been known to really enjoy Jackass because not only is it amusing to watch, but it's like a series of failures or bloopers compiled into a film. After being hit or injured, their only response is laughter. Like that was what they wanted to achieve. Jackass 3D was released in 2010, and like with the previous installment, a Direct-to-DVD \"film\" was released that included all the unused stunts that were originally cut for the film.<br><br>Jackass 3.5 was clearly released without the care and attention put to the previous film. There is no consistency. Usually in Jackass films some of the best stunts are in the middle with the big opening and the grand finale to end it off. This one is at a very slim and slender eighty-four minutes and just packs some of the mildest Jackass has ever offered. A lot of it is funny, but not a lot is very elaborate or clever.<br><br>We get Wee-Man painted into a wall, the secretary nearly peeing herself after a train horn being installed in her office goes off, and way too many kicks in the nuts. We get little random five second clips, but the most interesting is when the jackasses are face to face with the camera discussing stunts and how it is to be a jackass. Bam says it's fifty-fifty most of the time. Saying fifty percent of the time it's \"fun as hell\" with the remaining fifty being \"anxiety and paranoia\" about what will happen next. They're interesting, but not long enough to deem my satisfaction.<br><br>My two favorite stunts were \"Bombs Away!\" and \"The Fire Gauntlet.\" \"Bombs Away!\" is when the gang fills two liter bottles of diet coke with peppermint candies and then throws them, full force, at the ground to cause a loud and messy explosion. I'm surprised my buddies and I haven't killed ourselves doing that. \"The Fire Guantlet\" I refuse to talk about. I want you to have the same jaw dropping reaction I did.<br><br>Heavily hyped, but ultimately lacking in cutting edge stunts and gags, Jackass 3.5 shows not much more than the movie. What was cut was made for the best because nothing here should've been in the movie, besides \"The Fire Gauntlet.\" I did like how we saw the castmates hit and beat up on each other frequently. Maybe a spin off series will be called Jerkoff where the aged Jackasses beat up on their friends. That would be an interesting second chapter.<br><br>Starring: Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Steve-O, Chris Pontius, Ryan Dunn, Ehren McGhehey, Dave England, Preston Lacy, and Jason \"Wee-Man\" Acu√±a.
