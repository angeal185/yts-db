[{"title":"The End of an Era... for Christopher Reeve","rating":6,"date":"20 September 2006","review":"In this 4th and final Chritopher Reeve Superman film, Superman tries to rid the world of nuclear weapons, only to find that Lex Luthor is back and ready to supply the world with these dangerous weapons. Oh, and he has a new sidekick: Nuclear Man! <br><br>Many people have given this a lower rating (understandably), but a 3 or 4 out of 10? It really is not that bad. The film is fun, fast-paced and very watchable. Some consider it the worst, but I did not find it any better or worse than part 3. Granted, parts 1 and 2 are superior (thanks Richard Donner) but I've seen many worse films than Superman 4.<br><br>Random thoughts: The double date scene was clever, but really annoying and completely pointless. If Superman would just reveal himself to Lois Lane he wouldn't have to find other girls on the side... although see below.<br><br>The idea of getting rid of nuclear weapons was very nice and a great social and political commentary. I agree getting rid of nuclear weapons would be a good move. But the film made this very unrealistic. The world cheers him on, when in reality the countries would protest. He invades a variety of countries and steals their to secret hidden weapons (not sure on the legality or logistics of that). And what is to stop someone from building these weapons all over again? <br><br>What happened to Lana Lang? At the end of part 3, it looked like Superman finally realized that Lois Lane is a loser and hooked up with Lana. But she is never seen or mentioned in part 4, despite working for the Daily Planet (at least as of the last film). What gives? <br><br>Does anyone else think Lex Luthor is getting a little tired? Did we really need 3 films with Luthor and one with a Luthor knockoff? What about Brainiac or Bizarro or the Eradicator or just about anyone else? Heck, General Zod is so much cooler than Luthor (with all due respect to Gene Hackman).<br><br>There's a scene where he rebuilds the great wall of China just by looking at it. What power did he use? Tractor beams from his nipples?<br><br>But anyway, this film is not as bad as many would have you believe, and if you've spent six hours on the first three, you might as well invest 90 more minutes in this series finale.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[40,45]},{"title":"Not A Very Memorable Ending To The Reeve-Superman Series","rating":6,"date":"2 February 2007","review":"Superman Turns \"Peacenik\" could be another title to this film. Christopher Reeve remarked several times that this was his most \"important\" Superman movie. Being somewhat of a Liberal \"peacenik,\" he was the kind you'd see out with a big \"peace sign\" at rallies against nuclear weapons.This movie had the kind of message that was dear to his heart.<br><br>Superman goes about trying to rid the world of nuclear weapons here, especially, of course when they get into the hands of villain \"Dr. Luthor\" (Gene Hackman). It was a nice message and, overall, a nice film. Unlike the other Superman films of the era, they didn't overdo the sappy romance with \"Lois Lane\" (Margot Kidder). They concentrated more on the story. Unfortunately, that story - even with good intentions - just wasn't all that memorable. <br><br>Ask anyone: people remember the first two Reeve Superman films a lot more than the last two. This one, and the third one with Richard Pryor, pretty much \"bombed\" at the box office, at least compared to the others.<br><br>It did not help that the producers of this movie were Golan-Globus films, guys that were known for their cheap and usually-sleazy exploitation films. \"Superman\" deserved better.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[41,50]},{"title":"Well intentioned film...","rating":6,"date":"8 March 2001","review":"Superman 4 has good ideas and good performances, but was ruined when the director cut 40 minutes from the film before release. Among other things, the denouement in which Nuclear Man defies Luthor and turns himself into a nuclear missile in order to spark World War III. In order to see what the film should have been, I suggest one seek out the DC Comic Adaptation. This film, as Christopher Reeve's final performance as Superman deserves to be restored for DVD. The reason for Superman using powers he has never had, was the result of unfinished effects. The great wall of China scene should have been finished by adding Superman fixing the wall at super speed, and finished with Superman sealing it with heat vision.","user":"signs933","rank":[16,19]}]
