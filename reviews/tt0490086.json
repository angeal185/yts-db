[{"title":"A pretty decent comedy","rating":7,"date":"23 June 2008","review":"I find the general lack of interest towards this comedy rather disturbing. This message coming all the way from Europe, Bulgaria. The movie is playing in theaters as of this week, and to be honest it is just as hilarious and similarly spirited to other Schneider flicks. I went to see this expecting a few good laughs and that's what you get. The funny moments generally arise from comical situations and actions which lead to a rather expected outcome each time. It is not a sophisticated film, it has no real depth, it is just a feel good, unrealistic comedy, which makes you all warm inside. I apologize for the chaotic and short review, it's just that I find it hard to organize my thoughts in order give this film an adequate presentation. 7 out of 10, doesn't stray too far from all the other Schneider movies, if you've loved his previous work, you'll also enjoy seeing this.","user":"interstellarhaze","rank":[107,130]},{"title":"Rob Schneider is...Unrapeable!","rating":8,"date":"26 August 2008","review":"So, after becoming a gigolo, a teenage girl, an animal and making a lot of copies, Schneider becomes unrapeable. And it works for me.<br><br>One thing will dictate whether you'll like this movie: 1 - Rob Schneider. I like him, but he's made some real turkeys (Animal comes to mind), so I was unsure of what to expect. If you don't like him, you probably won't like this. Probably, but not surely, because this is one of his best movies.<br><br>Here he enlists the help of a good ensemble cast AND David Carradine, who steals every scene he's in, by playing a parody of himself straight-faced. This is essentially a prison comedy movie, and the best one I've seen since \"Mean Machine\" and \"Life\".<br><br>This time, instead of becoming a Stapler as his previous movies would indicate, he becomes a martial arts expert in order to cope with life in prison. You know, because he doesn't want to get raped. That's pretty much his only agenda, of course until he gets to know the inmates better and the usual clich√©s unwhirl.<br><br>The irony in seeing the diminutive actor kicking more ass than Chuck Norris is what makes this movie so entertaining, and in a way, even inspiring (if completely unbelievable). There are several laugh out loud scenes here, including one in which he \"bans\" rape from prison. <br><br>The only real problem with this film, aside from being deliciously silly and a tad too long, is that is pretty much divided in two extremely different parts, the buildup and the actual prison scenes. But in the end all is well, because laughter is what Schneider wanted, and that's precisely what he got out of me with \"Big Stan\".<br><br>So, good job, Rob, and try to keep it up.","user":"pmdawn","rank":[54,67]},{"title":"Pretty amusing actually!","rating":7,"date":"7 August 2008","review":"I'm amazed this movie doesn't have more comments. It's not the best comedy flick out there, but I've definitely seen worse. All in all I found this movie pretty damn amusing, with some definite laugh out loud moments (like someone unexpectedly talking with their bellybutton) to be had. I would say if you want a feel good comedy with no great expectations this one is a keeper.<br><br>The plot is a bit odd, Rob Schneider plays a corrupt time share salesman who's made millions,gets caught and sent to prison. Naturally his main fear is that he is going to be violently raped over and over during his stay and so enlists a martial arts master (Carradine, who better?) to teach him how to defend himself before he's committed. There is more to the plot of course, but I don't want to give anymore away.<br><br>There really are some good parts played by some surprise actors, some unknowns, and a fair share of MMA fighters, and all in all they all play pretty funny roles. This movie isn't a masterpiece, there's some plot holes, and some of it just plain didn't make sense. But that's beside the point. This is a funny movie and more people should see it.<br><br>Did I mention Rob Schneider totally knows martial arts and kicks ass? Because he does.","user":"terrencepatrix","rank":[60,78]}]
