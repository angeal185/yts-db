[{"title":"Writer who doesn't want to see","rating":28,"date":"28 August 2003","review":"This is my first time to comment on a film on this site. I have enjoyed reading y'all's comments. After 4 viewings, I found peace with the mysteries I saw in the film. Barton, though he talks a good show about wanting to write about \"the common man\", doesn't see anything around him as worthy of being a subject. He fears learning about the common man, or anything else outside his experience. His experience  teems with material for a watchful writer, but Barton sees nothing. When the wallpaper peels, he doesn't look for what's underneath or an explanation, he feverishly tries to cover up what's \"exposed\" as fast as he can (uno metaphoro). I agree with all comments about Goodman presenting Barton with a \"common man\" right in his own room. He has a research subject to learn from and to use as a springboard to break through his \"writer's block\", but he can't see anything that \"god\" presents for him to use. And the Woman on the Beach. Interesting that he never sees her face. He can never really SEE her but seems drawn to her and fascinated by her. He is drawn to the fact that she is \"unseeable\". In the end he \"sees\" her and doesn't explore that possibility either. The Box? He never opens it. We assume what we want to assume, but Barton, who is in control (!) simply attaches to the box without ever \"discovering\" it. He is all show and no substance. I agree, his one hit (the play) may be all he has in him. He's a one-trick pony posing as a seeking writer, intent on revealing the inner \"common man\" but is petrified by fear, ignorance or what-you-will. Look at the film again with an eye to his inability to \"see\" what is clearly revealed to him. you may \"see\" what I mean!

Why this is a masterpiece: (READ ON)","rating":10,"date":"10 July 2004","review":"Spoiler Alert 98% of the above user comments have totally missed the idea of this movie, and yet some have gotten it exactly correct without even realizing it. Here is THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MASTERPIECE MOVIE...<br><br>Those that stated that the first 2/3 of the movie is boring and then it starts to pick up when the action begins, have unwittingly seen the plot, and masterfully fulfilled its premise. See, Barton Fink is a boring, artsy, impassioned Jewish writer, that gets one lucky break, and is instantly summoned to write a movie that the execs are sure \"will be a winner\" (no pressure there, right Hollywood?). But since he is so much an \"artist\", he cannot lower himself to the level of writing a simple wrestling film, desiring instead to write witty stories about \"the common man\", films that \"really mean something\". Then he refuses to listen to common man stories, stuck instead on his own ideas of what that should be. <br><br>Well, OK, what is obvious here? Well the Coens for one, are Jewish WRITERS/ FILMMAKERS, who got one lucky break, \"Blood Simple\", and then were given the open door to make Hollywood films, are always branded as mere \"artists\", too idealistic for the majority of the masses (their movies are rarely fully appreciated or understood, and make only a small profit, but their genius high critic ratings keeps them afloat). So THEY ARE Barton Fink, quite literally and intentionally. It is THEIR personal tale, ensconced in a symbolic cloak. <br><br>Summary: Barton wants to write for the common man, and yet what the common man wants to see is this dumb \"B\"-rated wrestling flick, not some heartfelt idealistic piece about some friendly yokel. They want predictable mystery, unadulterated violence and blood, guns blazing, detectives crunching, and loud sex. As Barton stares at the image of his idealism (the beach picture), he longs for his ill conceived idealism to take form and materialize onto the paper. But of course it is a failure, because he sees himself as an \"artist\", not as a business man with epic visions. <br><br>Which is why finally, the mysterious Audrey (the real writer he is supposed to consult), who always helps Mayhew's stories out of a jam, becomes the catalyst for this story as well, by initiating the sex/horror/detective story as soon as she is asked to. Normal writers apparently are like either Fink or Mayhew, but she sees through to what makes for real-world successful writing (not some dorky contrived \"common man\" story), and she initiates the final action-filled finale immediately. <br><br>This is PURE GENIUS! \"Adaptation\" as one user here mentioned is like this film, because of the similarity in how the plot loops back in on itself. But this one is much more subtle, to the point where the \"common man\" would not even understand this movie, and thereby fulfill its message, that all people want are the action films that Hollywood dishes to us, just like the mogul states over and over, and we see delivered on the last third of the celluloid. In the end, Fink realizes his idealism, that what he really wanted is to get his artistic view rejected, so that he can maintain his idealistic (unrealistic) outlook, which is his true passion, the \"fight\" for self fulfillment. This is personified by the appearance of the girl on the beach, with Fink still not realizing what would be in the box, because he doesn't comprehend Hollywood thinking or action movies (or \"mainstream\" movies or plots). But he has achieved his goal, as has the movie for Joel and Ethan, as both being an incredibly well-thought and executed film, both an art flick, and an action piece with more perfectly executed symbolism than anyone since Wells.<br><br>Now you know why it won all the Cannes awards that year, and why these two brothers from St. Louis Park Minnesota are gods of the art film, while the contrasting Warchowski brothers were once gods of the \"common man\" film (the first Matrix at least). The Warchowski's even named the subtitle of the Matrix Reloaded as \"The Burly Man\", which if you look closely (zoom in), is the name of Barton Fink's mystery screenplay, thereby once again fulfilling the intention of this film to the fullest (that what common people want is delivered like clockwork in the Matrix), just like pure Bible prophecies. <br><br>Amen, brothers.","user":"mistagenki","rank":[223,269]},{"title":"Another Coen Brothers Classic!!!","rating":9,"date":"21 May 2007","review":"I recently purchased \"Barton Fink\" along with \"Miller's Crossinhg\", another Coen Brothers gem.<br><br>Barton Fink quite simply is a writer who cannot see the forest for the trees. He is so taken with the fact that he is a writer that he can't write. He is so idealistic that he misses fantastic opportunities to become a writer for the ages because he wastes precious time proselytizing. John Goodman perfectly sums up everyone's frustration with Barton Fink when after a series of unfortunate occurrences, Barton asks him \"Why me?\" to which John's character answers \"Because you don't LISTEN!\" Set in 1930s Hollywood we follow the exploits of a one-hit wonder, Barton Fink, who has written a successful Broadway play and is summoned by the powers that be to Hollywood. After much cajoling to take the job from his agent, Barton arrives in Los Angeles determined to become the writer for the common man where he insists true stories live. The trouble with Barton, however, is he does not have time for the common man because he has so romanticized their lot as well as his particular quest in speaking for them.<br><br>Excellent performances from John Turturo, John Goodman, Judy Davis, John Polito (often overlooked, but his scenes ALWAYS become his!!) and the inimitable Tony Shaloub.<br><br>I have decided after a slew of Coen Brothers films I currently have in my collection, that any project these guys are involved with deserve more than passing scrutiny.","user":"RaiderJack","rank":[90,105]}]
