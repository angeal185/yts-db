[{"title":"IT'S A SLASHER FLICK, WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING??!","rating":7,"date":"3 October 2018","review":"This movie was entertaining enough for what it is... a slasher flick. I'm not sure slasher type movies would ever earn 10 stars because there's usually not much acting, just a lot of screaming and running. LOL. <br><br>HellFest was a good flick to see in the theater. The misleads were fun, the graphics and style reminded me of 80's horror. You don't expect to see an Academy Award winning movie, you expect to have fun. And this was a fun ride. <br><br>I would recommend seeing this movie if you like campy, fun, slasher-horror movies. Not sure why it would only get 1-2 stars,...you saw the trailer and knew what to expect for the most part.","user":"gerimease","rank":[59,69]},{"title":"It was decent","rating":6,"date":"3 October 2018","review":"Pro - \n-&gt; Liked the premise in a theme/scare park\n-&gt; The villain has a frightening presence, great mask\n-&gt; Filled with action from the beginning<br><br>Con - \n-&gt; Didn't care about any of the characters/potential victims\n-&gt; Very little clarity about the killer and his motivations\n-&gt; Was too predictable<br><br>I think it is worth a watch for horror fans, better as a rental than seeing it in the cinema.","user":"georgemjs","rank":[47,56]},{"title":"Cool retro horror","rating":8,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"I probably can't add much more here, but I felt I had to step in to push aside the haters. I love a good slasher flick and this film really hits the spot! Great costume design and soundtrack too! Highly recommended.","user":"darylanders","rank":[79,98]}]
