[{"title":"\"This Darn Hosiery cannot be bought\"","rating":9,"date":"4 December 2009","review":"If you look at the whole career of that madcap genius Cecil B. DeMille, his style and preoccupations changed considerably over time, but one thing was evident from day one – his unshakeable pomposity and over-confidence. That is why he was always a ripe target for satire. Getting an early shot in on the heels one of DeMille's earliest successes was Charlie Chaplin, with his farcical yet precisely aimed Burlesque on Carmen.<br><br>These were the days when people would go to see a popular picture many times over. Chaplin too has clearly studied the original, and played upon the familiarity it would have had with audiences of the time. He has mimicked the sets, set-ups and even copied many of the titles verbatim. He even bases gags around very minor aspects of the DeMille film such as the soldiers and smugglers pushing at the door. All this provides a rich environment for Chaplin to tweak into hilariously disrespectful mayhem.<br><br>This doesn't appear to be an especially popular or well-known short, perhaps because without the genuine little tramp and modern setting it is not considered kosher Charlie. Personally I feel it is one his best Essanay pictures, for a number of reasons. Virtually the whole of Chaplin's act was satirical on some level, whether he was lampooning the upper class, social norms or modern fads, and generally the bigger the target the bigger the laughs. And simply because of its period trappings it allows him to do funny business with props and situations he would never normally get hold of, such as the numerous gags involving his sword. With his semi-faithful recreation of a contemporary drama, you get to see the considerable straight acting talents of Chaplin and his leading lady Edna Purviance, in a role unlike any other she played, but one she is very suited to. You also have John Rand being very funny in his own right, and Leo White getting the lengthiest and most creative pummelling he ever received from Charlie. Burlesque on Carmen is a unique standout in Chaplin's career, but also great fun to watch.<br><br>All of which brings us to the all-important statistic – <br><br>Number of kicks up the arse: 0 (although it does contain practically everything else)","user":"Steffi_P","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Works Pretty Well","rating":27,"date":"27 July 2004","review":"This combination of Charlie Chaplin's familiar slapstick and mannerisms with some of the plot ideas from \"Carmen\" works pretty well.  Although Chaplin retains many of the features of his usual screen persona, playing even a parody version of Don José is still a change-of-pace that he handles well. Edna Purviance combines enough of the expected Carmen character with her own style that so often complemented Chaplin in numerous successful comedies.<br><br>Note that, of the two \"Burlesque on Carmen\" titles that list Chaplin in the cast, this (the 1915 filming) is the one to see for Chaplin fans.  The 1916 release was created when someone apparently decided that it might be a good idea to take this perfectly good original and pad it with a lot of extraneous, non-Chaplin footage to produce a much longer movie.<br><br>Parody is an inherently fragile genre.  For it to produce anything of lasting value, the source material has to be both familiar and worthwhile, and then the adaptation has to be clever without forcing too many artificial parallels.  Many parodies are over-praised upon their release, enjoy a vogue while their source material remains popular, and then fall into deserved obscurity.<br><br>The story of \"Carmen\", though, has a timeless combination of themes, and yet it is not at all stuffy or highbrow.  While the original classic is now, unfortunately, less widely-known than it was in Chaplin's day, the material itself is still far more worthwhile than are the pop culture elements that are used as fodder for many parody films of the present era.  While by no means one of his very finest efforts, Chaplin's \"Burlesque on Carmen\" is an enjoyable comic adaptation of the basic story, and for that reason it will always retain an appreciative, if small, audience.","user":"Snow Leopard","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Early Chaplin: Refining Burlesque","rating":8,"date":"8 August 2005","review":"Chaplin liked Cecil B. DeMille's \"Carmen\"; this, I think, was his only effort devoted to parodying a sole film. I disliked DeMille's \"Carmen\"; neither the direction, nor narrative impressed me, and Geraldine Farrar was annoying. Edna Purviance is much easier to watch. Her caricature of Farrar's obnoxious narcissism was entertaining and rather satisfying--nearly making the experience of watching Farrar's performance worthwhile. And, Chaplin is funnier here than in any film he had done before. This, not \"The Champion\", \"The Tramp\", or \"Police\", is what I consider the jewel of his outturn at Essanay.<br><br>This short follows the same plot of DeMille's \"Carmen\", nicely condensed, absent the melodrama. And, I'm discussing the 1915 \"Burlesque on Carmen\", not the bastardized version Essanay created the following year, after Chaplin had left the studio. That one includes a subplot involving Ben Turpin, which pads on two more reels to the formerly 2-reel short. This, the original, preferred version is a visually coherent, appropriately photographed short (other than some jump cuts). Chaplin took the style, or look--tinting, mise-en-scène, composition and such--right out of DeMille's film. As a result, this is one of Chaplin's better-looking films from his early work. If nothing else, DeMille made some pretty pictures.<br><br>Chaplin did transform, or mature his comedy while at Essanay; although, of his Essanay films, only a few are very discernible from his Keystone shorts. You may witness a slight maturing in his other Essanay movies, but \"Burlesque on Carmen\" seems to introduce a radically more mature burlesque for Chaplin. And, I mean \"burlesque\" in two senses: first, this film is a burlesque in that it parodies another film, and, second, it may be that Chaplin learned to refine the broad, crude and frantic humor of his Keystone upbringing in the process of parodying that film. There's a clear focus here--in parodying DeMille's film, and thus we get a substantial refinement in Chaplin's style.<br><br>There are some very funny moments here, too. The swordfight, which turns into a wrestling match, is great. Chaplin continually interrupts the photoplay by breaking down the fourth wall, including winking at the camera. Another of my favorite gags is when Chaplin, looking as close to the tramp as in any part of the film, stops at a saloon before continuing with the expected storyline.","user":"Cineanalyst","rank":[5,7]}]
