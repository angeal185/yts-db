[{"title":"Special Film","rating":9,"date":"9 October 2018","review":"This is a beautiful love story. It really hit a nerve as it was highly emotional. I couldn't help but get swept up in this gem of a film. Highly Recommend!","user":"bohemianpirate-871-383487","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Good low budget gem","rating":9,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"OK so I watched this last night and I'm only leaving a review based on what others have said because it annoyed me a bit.<br><br>First off the film is low budget, you can tell right away. But I felt the story really hit home with me. I felt the acting was brilliant, despite what other reviews said. <br><br>Best way to sum it up would be a low budget gem; it has a very powerful message which I think others have failed to see. I think as long as you're not expecting Hollywood spectacle you'll be fine. There's something to take note of here.","user":"johnasura","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Really bad acting","rating":1,"date":"5 September 2018","review":"I don't know how this is rated so highly. First thing that hits you is the terrible acting by all the cast, very robotic and scripted, no emotion. Then there is the terrible plot line and the misplaced music, almost everything about this movie is bad. Highly don't reccomend","user":"dem-16990","rank":[7,11]}]
