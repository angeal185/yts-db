[{"title":"Pretty Predictable","rating":6,"date":"7 January 2019","review":"Not a bad movie, my guess is they spent most of the budget on Donald Sutherland, but money well spent. Others talk about how this movie reflects on the criminal justice system, and it does, but I think it does so just as well on court of public opinion, the media, and social media. It does beg the question of how anyone does get a fair trial in today's 24 hour news cycle and viral social media.","user":"lkemplewis","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Interesting but fails at the end","rating":4,"date":"9 May 2019","review":"Maybe a story that has been told in a way, but it is interesting take. A few problems.\n1) Donald Sutherland's mustache, seriously trim that, totally distracting. like nose hair coming out of his lip.\n2) If the killer wanted to get caught just turn yourself in\n3) At the end. no way they go in just randomly shooting. also he had the choice not to hold the gun. stupid saying the killer gave me the gun. don't take it, or drop it. the cops knew exactly where the hostage was and what he looked like. they could have easily pin pointed the killer of which they knew what he looked like and what he was wearing.","user":"chad-963-334113","rank":[20,24]},{"title":"The Great White North Harshes on The Red, White & Blue in \"American Hangman\"","rating":5,"date":"21 August 2019","review":"\"American Hangman\" is a made in Canada crime thriller that fires plenty of pot shots at the American judicial system. While the points are laid on a bit thick, there is still much to chew on here. Well intentioned. Well acted. And the great Donald Sutherland (a native Canuck) classes up any joint.","user":"jtncsmistad","rank":[5,5]}]
