[{"title":"Wtf","rating":1,"date":"26 January 2019","review":"Worst acting ever!! And so low budget..it was almost comical...","user":"angelawesson-12610","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"just the worst","rating":1,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"I don't really write reviews but this movie wasted an hour of my time. I didn't know why I finished it, maybe i just loved cinderella so much or maybe I just wanted to see how punished the sister and mom would be. But I regret finishing it, worst acting I have seen in forever!!! The story didn't make it any better at all. Such a waste of time and money. Please don't watch it","user":"katnieva","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"So disappointing!","rating":2,"date":"14 April 2019","review":"Like another review said.. poor acting and low budget! Actually, it was terrible and cheesy acting, I really can't believe this movie made it to the public as is! The girl who plays Cinderella was the best actress of them all - the rest were just so fake and unbelieveable!<br><br>In the scene with the dancing, it was the same few actors in the background throughout and they didn't seem to move.. some 'big ball' that was! And in the scene where the sisters have to clean and one washes the table, it's funny how she sets down the glasses then she's washing the table again and then it jumps back and forth with the final result being a table dressed much differently!<br><br>If you want to laugh at how poorly this movie was made.. watch it, otherwise don't waste your time!!","user":"icybluesnow","rank":[2,2]}]
