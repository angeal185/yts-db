[{"title":"Great Coming of Age Story","rating":10,"date":"20 January 2019","review":"Rockaway is a great story about two brothers, a group of friends, and a family that goes the lengths for each other. Taking place in the summer of 1994 in Rockaway, New York, the film brings back the nostalgia of pure good trouble-making fun with friends while learning the reality that each of your friends has a whole world inside of them. Coming from different homes and backstories, the story centers on brothers John and Anthony, who protect each other from their abusive father they combat with themselves to love, understand, and live with. No matter how bad it gets at home though, they know they have each other and their friends-- a true team. The boys learn to endure and get past the pain through sticking together, but not without a journey along the way. Rockaway stands as a great coming of age story for a boy growing up, turning learned behavior into absolute love.","user":"mcleary-35418","rank":[17,30]},{"title":"A Brother's Love","rating":10,"date":"5 January 2020","review":"Congratulations to John Budion, the writer and director of Rockaway. He has captured the hearts of viewers with his story of friendship and survival. I found myself laughing and crying at the same time, and the genuine love shown between the friends and brothers touches the viewer's soul.<br><br>The acting is outstanding and the actors were brilliantly cast....one of the best movies! Especially loved the personal touch of real-life childhood photos during the credits.","user":"LindaNYC","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Amazing","rating":8,"date":"20 November 2019","review":"I'm absolutely stunned by the different highs and lows I was brought to throughout, from the absolute freedom of cycling around the city in the summer to the, very literally, tear-jerking ending, which was so beautifully handled. The film truly was a beautiful experience and testament to the possibilities of independent film making, and I want to thank you for sharing this story to the world!","user":"dcorbet264","rank":[4,5]}]
