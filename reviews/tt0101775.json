[{"title":"Don't let her turn you into one of them!","rating":9,"date":"21 January 2003","review":"Drop Dead Fred is a difficult film to review. I saw it for the first time when I was 13 years old or something, and I absolutely loved it because I was right in the middle of the age group at which the film is directed. I watched it again recently, and while the film's slapstick comedy did not hold quite the same massive appeal (although I was still hugely entertained) as it did when I was younger, I regretted to discover that I had grown out of a lot of the goofy antics that went on in the movie.<br><br>However, I was reading through some of the reviews written on the IMDb by other users, and was amazed at how offended a couple of people were by this film, revealing in their reviews a total detachment from their own inner selves and a complete misunderstanding for the little people that we call kids. No, for example, I would NOT recommend a seven year old girl to psychiatric help for making a mess. This is arguably one of the most ludicrous ideas that I have ever read on the Internet Movie Database in my entire life, and believe me, I have read some jaw-droppingly moronic comments on this beloved site.<br><br>If you read through the user comments for this movie, you can so clearly see the difference in the people who liked it and the ones who hate it that it almost makes you laugh out loud that these people can't see that they are exactly the kinds of people that the movie rebels against. Drop Dead Fred begs Elizabeth not to let her mother turn her into one of them because he doesn't want her to turn into the kind of person who is so uptight and frigid and barren that she would be incapable of enjoying exactly the kind of entertainment and fun that Drop Dead Fred is.<br><br>This is a movie that was made for people who are still in touch with their inner child, people who realize that a little girl with a mother who has absolutely no understanding of the mind of a child has every right to escape into the world of an imaginary friend if it will help her escape the grayness and responsibility imposed on her by her mother, who demands absolute perfection and hasn't the first clue about how to raise a child. Very similar things can be said about various IMDb users, such as ones who refer to Fred as a product of a deranged mind or say anything about psychos or brutality or insanity.<br><br>Drop Dead Fred is not a film about an insane little girl. Indeed, I like to think that the world is populated mostly with people who understand that the minds of young children operate slightly differently than their parents'and our own, and that they can be forgiven for getting into a little mischief. I am generally against grouping together people who did not like a certain film, but in this case it seems overly obvious that the people who wrote negative reviews of this fun comedy are simply the people who resent being pointed out as the kinds of people that they are.<br><br>Drop Dead Fred is a movie that was made for fun, to be enjoyed, laughed at, and respected for reminding us that we need to lighten up occasionally and, while not necessarily flinging spaghetti in a nice restaurant, act like children every once in a while to prevent ourselves from being driven insane by the fast-paced society that we live in. And if you can't do that, if you hated Drop Dead Fred because you simply can't understand that concept, if, indeed, you think that Elizabeth is in dire need of psychiatric care, you may want to step back and look closely at your life and your views.<br><br>\nYOU may be the one in need of therapy.","user":"Anonymous_Maxine","rank":[188,221]},{"title":"Fred is REAL!","rating":30,"date":"30 August 2002","review":"I am amazed by the amount of people who have discussed this movie in the terms of being about \"mental illness\".... it should become clear by the end of the movie that this is a fantasy, Fred is not an imaginary friend he is \"real\" he exists and his sole purpose in life is to help children in a dark place and bring them out of themselves.  Imaginary friends do not move on to another child, imaginary friends are the property of those who imagine them. I wouldn't be at all surprised if I saw a review of \"Gremlins\" on here by the same people who said \"nasty little creatures who create distruction around them are not funny\".  This is a funny movie, plain and simple.  Rick Mayall is outstanding as Fred and Phoebe Cates gives the perfect performance as the downtrodden daughter and wife.  Anyone who says bad things about this movie has obviously never seen a fantasy movie before and taken it for what it is.  I am surprised that they didn't call Demi Moore delusional in \"Ghost\" because she was refusing to let go of her boyfriend and \"imagined\" all the stuff that went on.  This is a fantasy folks, a pure unadulterated fantasy and it is a bloody funny one at that.  Watch it, it will make you laugh, it will make you smile, and it will make you chuckle.... what more can you ask and again Rick Mayall is brilliant.","user":"Theoriginaltruebrit","rank":[80,106]},{"title":"A future cult film?","rating":9,"date":"27 August 2005","review":"Isn't it funny how this film, whilst massively dismissed as rubbish by critics when it was first released, has attracted a very loyal following of people who hold it very dear to their hearts - isn't that basically the definition of a cult film? Why? The special effects are terrible, it's basically a \"breaking into the USA market\" vehicle for Rick Mayall, and Marsha Mason looks exactly the same in the \"21 years ago\" flashbacks as she does in the current time-line.<br><br>This film is special because it has that certain endearing uniqueness to it that makes it very personal. Those who love it have watched it many, many times. I've never seen anything like it before or since. It's a Hollywood-style comedy about a mid-20's dippy girl that is re-visited by her childhood imaginary friend when her life starts falling apart... or, it's an increasingly dark study of a girl descending into madness, only to choose reality over fantasy in the end.<br><br>Phobe Cates is fantastic in this film. She reacts to Mayall's familiar but still funny \"Rick\" routine in the sweetest and cutest way. The comic timing of both is excellent. Check out her expression when she asks her mother to \"sit down\" after Mayall has just delivered his \"Cobwebs\" line... Adorable.<br><br>A curiosity is after Fred's first encounter with Elizabeth's mother. After having his head squashed flat by a fridge door (\"Oh no my head, the Megabitch squashed my head! The Bitch! She squashed my head! The evil one reigns supreme!\"), the following references by Fred during the rest of the film refer to her as the \"Megabeast\". Perhaps half way through filming the producers, thinking this would be a lovely summer kiddie film thought it was a tad too \"adult\" to appeal to a young audience and told the makers to tone it down a bit.. The opening scene, where Marsha Mason reads a bedtime story to her 4 year old daughter only to be told \"What a pile of S**t\" pretty much sets the scene. Hilarious! There are so many genuinely funny and heart-warming scenes in this film. When Fred makes a \"real\" mud pie with the 4 year old Elizabeth, the little girl seems to be genuinely enjoying herself (\"it's so fun!\"). You can't help but smile. And whilst the final goodbye between Elizabeth and Fred is pretty formulaic Hollywood, it still tugs at the old heart strings.<br><br>Some people perhaps read too much into the film when they see it as a study of schizophrenia etc, but then again you can't help think that underneath the zany comedy, the writers are subtly giving the film a deeper edge. The scene that really hinges Elizabeth's descent into madness is when she finally despairs of her cheating husband's hopeless ways (\"I'm scared to be alone\") by Fred, who beckons \"come with me\" with a very creepy invitation to succumb to insanity.<br><br>To me, this film succeeds because it naughtily mixes Hollywood's clich√©-ridden nicey-nice \"family\" comedies with the anarchic British alternative comedy of the 90's. You'll either \"get it\" or think it's crap. The choice is yours. To those that love it, perhaps it just sparks that missed childhood innocence that runs throughout, as well as our desire to be more rebellious and independent than we are now as adults. The ending is lovely too... Fred carries on helping kids in his own way.<br><br>P.S. Carrie Fisher will always be remembered and associated with Star Wars, but she is a superb comedy actress. \"But didn't Elvis kill himself?\", \"Yes, but before that he was really interesting!\"... Superb!","user":"Sofalofa","rank":[29,37]}]
