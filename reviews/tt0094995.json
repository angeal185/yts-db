[{"title":"Kawajiri's earlier works..Still not a master but enroute!","rating":7,"date":"12 March 2002","review":"Not Bad. Actually better than a lot of anime's out there. Usual storyline. Demons trying to take over tokyo thus the world. Father tries to stop the villain but fails, 10 years later comes the prodigal son and wham-bam blah blah &amp; so on....Good action, english dubbing is Ok. Needed a little bit more insight on the storyline and the characters lacked some depth. If you follow Kawajiri's work you can c glimpses of his genious. But fans who r looking for Kawajiri's mastery wont find a lot of it in this one.","user":"virtualcrime","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"good plot, no character development","rating":6,"date":"18 July 2000","review":"The son of a Nempo master must stop a sorcerer from raising hell. This is a Bruce Willis meets anime type of film. There isn't much character development at all. What's good about the film is that although the plot line is common in anime, it still entertains. See this if you're fond of lots of action and could care less about emotion.","user":"blackhawk.sc","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Just plain awesome","rating":10,"date":"28 December 1998","review":"This anime kicked butt. Lots and lots of action and a good story. Great demons and interesting super-powers. Just a great movie. If you like anime you'll like this.","user":"Dr Worm-2","rank":[15,18]}]
