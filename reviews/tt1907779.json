A local guide and the helicopter pilot join the team and the group heads to the jungle. During their trip, they find a stowaway in the helicopter, the son of Jonathan. Soon the helicopter is attacked by flying creatures and crashes in the jungle in the beginning of the last journey of Jonathan Marchant and his team.<br><br>\"The Dinosaur Project\" is a predictable and lame dinosaur movie, a combination of the clich√©s of \"The Lost World\" with the exhausted style of the \"reality\" of \"The Blair Witch Project\". It is amazing that the viewer can predict what is going to happen on the next scene, and most of the dialogs are ridiculous. My vote is three.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Projeto Dinossauro\" (\"Dinosaur Project\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[22,29]},{"title":"Great Movie","rating":8,"date":"8 September 2012","review":"The movie has a very fun story to it, which leaves a lot of space for action and playing around with.<br><br>Yes, some of the acting was cheesy, some of the story was cheesy, but all in all the story was very entertaining.<br><br>I think they should have dropped the POV style of filming, because as a normal movie it would be great.<br><br>Fun shots, lots of action, and a cool story.<br><br>There are also very original takes on the whole dinosaur-man connection which I haven't seen in any other movie.<br><br>CGI was really well done, which is pretty rare in movies that seem low budget.<br><br>I think for some reason people are just hating on the movie for no good reason (there is no reason why this movie deserves 1 star...)<br><br>The ending leaves lots of space for a sequel, and I cant wait to see it.","user":"ejehuda","rank":[44,64]}]
