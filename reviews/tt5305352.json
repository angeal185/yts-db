[{"title":"Good ideas , generic execution","rating":5,"date":"15 May 2019","review":"In the days where modern superhero movies dominate the box office. The trailer for this movie teases a self referential masked vigilante flick. A struggling film maker wants to get financing for a superhero movie , so finds a woman who can really do martial arts to get her to go fight crime for real and film it to drum up interest via viral videos to secure financing for a film, and in the meantime they end up taking on more serious criminals . That concept is fantastic, coupled with a very likable lead actress and some inventive fight scenes. Sounds like a winner. It could have been , however that initial concept is introduced but soon forgotten for more altruistic and generic hero motivations . After that it just goes into standard low budget superhero action flick with an air for camp . Think Kick Ass turning into Black Scorpion or Batman Forever. The bad guy is just silly, and is super obvious who he really is ( Hmm what character has been introduced and done nothing with ??) The climax confusingly removes Valentine from the equation , and actually means the character has had little impact on the conclusion of the plot . The bad guys motivations are contrived, and when it's revealed i couldn't help but think what were the Shadow's henchwomen getting out of all of this ? Whilst the stunt work is good, the editing and camera work that films it are not leading to choppy action sequences . The acting with the exception of our lead actress &amp; one police officer is ott and campy . There still is stuff to enjoy with this, it is fun, fast paced lots of action. It just could have been more, but didn't take any risks . It teased being self referential , clever and commenting on the superhero genre, but never pulled the trigger on those ideas , favoring tried and tested genre tropes","user":"geeklegionofdoom","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Watched on a whim","rating":8,"date":"18 May 2019","review":"Really good, I thought it was going to be bad, but to my surprise it was really good watch. I watched the English dubbed version. The character valentine was on point and her martial arts skills were also really good. I love to see movies like this I feel this could pickup where kickass left off and give us more.","user":"jrrow-56488","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Budget movie entertainment","rating":8,"date":"17 May 2019","review":"On a budget but still entertaining with good effort by the whole cast","user":"alfredtimothy","rank":[12,17]}]
