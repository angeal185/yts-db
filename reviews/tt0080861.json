[{"title":"3/10 **/5 ~ Beloved Bug Bites Bottom.","rating":3,"date":"5 April 2004","review":"This third and last theatrical sequel to the classic Walt Disney Production The Love Bug (1969) brought the enormously successful franchise about a magical Volkswagen to a screeching halt. Herbie deserved a better send-off.<br><br>There's just no love left in the poor little disrespected cash-car. Filmed on the cheap in Mexico, this entry has none of the quality and charm of its original and trashes all that was good about the preceding sequels. Vincent McEveety, the weakest of Disney's three main directors during this period, was assigned the project after having done a fair job with Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo, but makes no effort to elevate the project above the level of its poor script. <br><br>The frenetic, maudlin result is one of the worst Disney films. Talented comic performers Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman and Charles Martin Smith are wasted on unfunny material. Only the clever stunt and effects work save this mechanical destruction derby from oblivion.<br><br>The Love Bug was eventually revived for a brief TV series and made-for-TV movie, but Disney was flogging a dead V-Dub.","user":"Doctor_Mabuse","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"A journey too far","rating":3,"date":"1 April 2002","review":"Easily the weakest of the series, this is a film the Herbie franchise could have done without.  Having a child as the nominal lead in an essentially adult role is a surprisingly common motif in children's movies; surprisingly, because more often than not it fails to work and it certainly fails here.  Eight-year old taxi drivers?  I think not, not even in Mexico. Our Paco is more annoying than lovable and I found myself rooting for the villains instead.<br><br>Clearly the writers are to blame for the mess - the cast is actually quite good, e.g. you cannot ask for much better villains than John Vernon, Alex Rocco and Richard Jaeckel, but they were fighting a loosing battle against a rotten script. <br><br>The best asset of the film is Harvey Korman who shows the right spirit, and is given the freedom to act out his madcap humour.  Neither his routines nor his character fit very well into the story, but the story is so weak one does not care.","user":"SMK-4","rank":[14,18]},{"title":"adios Herbie","rating":3,"date":"3 June 2002","review":"This was the last Herbie movie to my knowledge. If it wasn't the last, it was defintely the worst. What else do you call a movie when a Mexican child calls Herbie \"ocho\" ( he adds up Herbie famous number \"53\"  and gets eight). Then this Mexican child does a horrible paint job and starts using Herbie to run a taxi service. In my humble opinion the only reason to watch this film is to see what sort cellouiod trash Disney was putting out before Michael Eisner took over.","user":"Baldach","rank":[13,17]}]
