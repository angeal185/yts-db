[{"title":"Powerful Story and a must see to those not afraid of reality","rating":9,"date":"3 February 2017","review":"This movie is a gripping, moving, and powerful revelation into the dark world of human trafficking. Many negative reviews were watching this for entertainment but this movie was filmed as almost a story telling documentary. Too many people live in a fantasy world and don't want to face the harsh reality that lay just beneath our everyday life. This story is a wake-up call and should be absorbed as such. <br><br>Joel portrays James, a man at the end of his rope who finds purpose in helping those trapped in this terrible world. His evolution and triumph in the face of adversity should be a lesson to all. Thank you Small bone family for such an amazing film. God Bless","user":"bolyami","rank":[30,44]},{"title":"The other reviewers must have seen a different film","rating":3,"date":"31 January 2017","review":"From many of the other reviews I was really expecting something special, I have just seen Lion and so my expectations might be a little high as that is a great film. <br><br>What can I say? Not sure why the high scores from so many reviewers but I can only suspect they were simply adding their \"SHILLings\" to the mix and have no idea what they are talking about. <br><br>Bad \"made for TV\" movie comes to mind, sub-par acting. No real depth to the characters, forgettable in every way with cliché after cliché. Bad Music, bad set pieces, lazy script. <br><br>Hour and a half of my life i'll never get back. C'est la vie","user":"mywildimagination","rank":[40,67]},{"title":"Honest to Good Goodness","rating":8,"date":"9 February 2017","review":"I had no idea what I was getting into with this movie. Throughout the whole film I kept getting the feeling that it was really trying hard to make the good guy look cool. To make doing the right thing seem like the right thing to do. I really like that. The bad guys weren't overly glorified or vilified either. I don't think they went too far, and it doesn't smack of the in your face over the top cheese-fest that other movies dealing with the subject usually have. I know the story well from made-for-TV movies though never was it so professionally shot or well acted. <br><br>There are only a few gripes i have about the movie, and they are personal irks that I can understand probably were taken into consideration and decided against by the creators. <br><br>1,) I really wish they had used the word RAPE at any point in the film. Everything else was so honest and boldfaced that it seems a shame to try and sugar coat it with euphemisms and allusions. 2,) The end seems really rushed and cut short. There are a lot of questions left unanswered, but I believe it is because they needed to get their message out after the climax instead of a concise denouement. 3,) They could have done a better job with working in the daughter and her relationship and importance to James. As it is it seems a bit contrived and little fake. <br><br>None of those are great detriments, and the message is important too. The movie was legitimately entertaining and kept my attention from very early on. I'm planning on watching it again with certain friends and recommending it as well. I'm glad I saw it.","user":"Xlyfindel","rank":[19,29]}]
