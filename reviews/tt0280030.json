[{"title":"Not a true sequel","rating":1,"date":"14 October 2006","review":"Take this review with a grain of salt, because I am a massive fan of Peter Pan and all things properly based on the James Barrie classic. This sequel, however, made me cringe. I've enjoyed liberal interpretations before - Hook and Finding Neverland, for example - but this movie completely trashed whatever character Peter Pan is supposed to have. Peter Pan is not a hero - he is a mischievous and often forgetful boy. He is entirely selfish and entirely charming, and these are his two flaws. However, in \"Return to Neverland,\" this character of \"Peter Pan\" is a mere ghost of the complex Barrie creation. Whatever beautiful messages Peter Pan has about nostalgia and childhood, \"Return to Neverland\" turns them upside down at worst, and simply ignores them at best.<br><br>The animation wasn't bad, though.","user":"mad4u689","rank":[38,50]},{"title":"Magical","rating":8,"date":"15 February 2002","review":"All you need is faith, trust and pixie dust!  This is a surprisingly pleasant sequel.  The C.G. Tinkerbelle is not as ...delicate as I remember from the first, but she is still made well and is just as spunky!  I think they did a very good job on this movie...so good of a job that I would not classify it with normal sequels.  I think it will be on the shelf with the other classics.  They still have the Tink that turns red when she's mad, and the lost boys haven't changed a bit.  Peter is just as I remember him, and in all this they did a great job.  And overall, I love this movie.  The credits did surprise me.  They reminded me of the last page in the Little Golden Books I read as a child.  Very similar artistry...very similar lay out.<br><br>Also, I'd like to add that the music was actually not torture for me to listen to...which counts for a lot for my opinion of cartoons.<br><br>I would not miss taking my children to this movie.  It's even a sweet date movie.<br><br>I think you will like it.","user":"pnc777","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"A good Disney sequel","rating":10,"date":"30 December 2002","review":"One thing I've noticed about most Disney sequels is that the storyline tends to be the opposite of the original. It's not different here. In the original \"Peter Pan\", Wendy has no intention of growing up too soon and instead goes to Never Land for a while, where she'll never grow up. But in \"Return to Never Land\", Wendy has grown up, gotten married and had kids of her own. Her son, Danny, who's still very young, is always intrigued by his mother's stories of Peter, but her older daughter Jane, who feels as though now her father's gone to war, she must protect her family, it means no more silly stories. And then the movie develops from there, when Jane is thought to be Wendy and is kidnapped by Captain Hook. Then, of course, Peter Pan meets her and then the story continues from there. Jane thinks she's really mature, and it's up to Peter and the Lost Boys to bring out her childish side again.<br><br>I think \"Return to Never Land\" is one of the better Disney sequels, as heaps of others have turned out to rip-offs of the original. If they thought this was going to be like the others, they would've released it straight to video. So, if you have to see a Disney sequel, then this is a pretty good one.","user":"funky_little_angel","rank":[30,42]}]
