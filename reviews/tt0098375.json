[{"title":"Tobe Hooper plays with fire.","rating":4,"date":"3 April 2010","review":"I really wanted to love Spontaneous Combustion: I like the basic idea, Brad Dourif is a cool actor, Tobe Hooper is the legendary director responsible for my favourite horror film, and some of the flame effects are pretty intense (I repeat: 'some'). Hell, there's even a fun cameo from John Landis. The problem is that the film just doesn't make a lot of sense.<br><br>Dourif plays Sam, a young man who discovers that the anti-radiation experiment which caused his parents to spontaneously combust in the 1950s is now responsible for some equally strange side effects in his own body. As Sam tries to prevent himself turning into a small pile of smouldering ash, he realises that his whole life has been a lie perpetrated by sinister industrialist Lew Orlander (William Prince).<br><br>With some incomprehensible cobblers about an evangelist who preaches to Sam over the radio, a puzzling sub-plot involving a nuclear power station, a killer who inexplicably uses glowing green goop in a syringe to bump people off, and the never-adequately explained presence of a continually growing birthmark on Sam's hand, I lost the plot about half-way through and had to content myself with the occasionally impressive body burn stunts and a modicum of manky make-up effects.<br><br>The first movie made by Hooper after his unsuccessful three film deal with Cannon, Spontaneous Combustion unsurprisingly didn't set the box-office on fire either, and the director's career has failed to reignite ever since.","user":"BA_Harrison","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"The temperature is boiling a volcanic firestorm.","rating":4,"date":"4 October 2009","review":"Not as bad, as it's credited to being (Hooper's done far worse) more so disappointing for me. Such an imaginative concept, which is never really tapped in to by Hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky (excuse the pun) writing. It goes so sinister and over-the-top in a dead serious tone, becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy-laced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt. Because of that, the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and Brad Dourif (cool to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with an off-balanced performance, despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off-colour character. Even though it's cheaply done, there's a competent technical attitude to it. However it doesn't seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts (which some do work) and strikingly steaming special effects (flames, flames everywhere) instead. Hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery (more so towards the latter end), and the camera-work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating. The performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small, but amusing cameos especially Landis. Nothing surprises, but it's passably engaging.","user":"lost-in-limbo","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"The Last Great Tobe Hooper Film","rating":10,"date":"2 December 2005","review":"Unlike most reviews of this movie that talk about how bad this movie is and how this was one of Tobe Hoopers worst films, all those reviews I completely disagree with. This is easily Hoopers last great film and a very well executed film at that. The story line is simple, Brad Dourif plays the role of Sam in the movie. He finds out that his parents were part of an experiment that had to do with the atomic bomb and that later would kill them. As an adult, Sam discovers he has a great power to control fire and electricity but with horrible results to his body after using them. This all lead to a very odd and some what anticlimactic ending. This is good because the movie plays very dramatically and at times can be almost depressing. Brad Dourif plays a very good role in this movie (Unlike what other reviewers say) and the rest of the cast does a good job also. The only downside of the movie is the special effects were mediocre and could have been better. But, this does not take away from the movie at all. Also, to set the record straight, the only similarity to this and \"Firestarter\" is the main character can control fire. Other than that, these are two completely different movies. So, if you have been disappointed in Tobe Hooper's work in the past 10 to 12 years and you have not seen this movie, I say buy it. This truly is a great movie. 9 stars","user":"CMRKeyboadist","rank":[25,41]}]
