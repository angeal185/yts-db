[{"title":"Novice attempt needs work","rating":4,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"There were some good lines, a good twist, a good concept. But seriously it was made cheaply and it shows. There was some terrible direction with stunted editing. It was an old and tired trope with very little to make it worthy. It would not surprise me if it gets some terrible reviews.<br><br>That said I did laugh a few times, at the end. It was good for a student work. But this was not what I would call a blockbuster film.","user":"raven-sirius","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Amateur hour","rating":1,"date":"13 February 2019","review":"Total waste of time...bad plot, bad acting, terrible!\nLots of fake reviews, how can this get 9 or 10 stars?","user":"tirigliu","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Would be better as a show than as a movie.","rating":5,"date":"31 December 2018","review":"My wife thought this was a lame movie, with bad acting and a cheap plot. Me on the other hand thought Clyde Cooper was made with the intention to look like an old detective series in the style of Mannix, Magnum, PI, Moonlighting or other detective shows from the eighties. Peter Daskaloff must have watched all those shows when he was young, like me and many others did. If you watch Clyde Cooper with those shows in mind then it isn't that bad. I could see Clyde Cooper as a detective show instead of a movie, that would work better. But I can see the point of my wife, the acting isn't award winning neither is the plot, but I saw much worse so it wasn't all that bad to me.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[3,4]}]
