[{"title":"Dumb but not in a funny way","rating":2,"date":"26 June 2014","review":"Useless waste of my time and money. There were maybe three spots that were funny. Most of it was old regurgitated jokes. Black people complain about 'token blacks' and then do EXACTLY the same thing with a white guy. Couple of places I was bored to the point of yawning.<br><br>Kevin Hart failed so badly that I was surprised when I heard this made a lot of money in the first weekend.<br><br>The first one was hilarious and I laughed all the way through. I barely was able to stay in the theater for this one.<br><br>They should have spent more money on the script and more time.<br><br>This movie was so bad that I have run outta things to say about it but I have to fill space because for reasons unknown the webmaster thinks a review has to be at least a certain length.","user":"gregg_shoe","rank":[38,53]},{"title":"Poorly written disappointment of a movie","rating":1,"date":"6 July 2014","review":"I did not enjoy this movie. I felt it was too much coonery and poor dialogue. Kevin Hart in my opinion is not funny. He tries way to hard to be funny. I have read both of Steve Harvey's books and felt the movie should have been more of a comedic drama in the vein of Waiting to Exhale. Here was a chance to make a slick, sexy, glossy movie using the guidance Mr. Harvey provides in his books. Instead it was turned into a slap stick vulgar train wreck. Dennis Haysbert, Jennifer Lewis, Tarji Henson, Jim Piddock and Michael Ealy are good actors whose talents were wasted in this movie. Even Gary Owen who is funny could have been utilized better. A lot of the scenes were contrived and predictable. I knew at the end that Zeke would walk across the water to get to Maya. Regina Hall has the makings of a good actress but she has yet to get the right material to showcase her craft. They just threw celebrities in the movie probably to attract more viewers. For example, Drake, Floyd Merriweather served no purpose in the movie and Drake's lines were terrible. I'm surprised that Mr. Harvey would sign off on a movie where the \"N\" word is used. This movie is no different than the chittlin circuit plays produced by Mr. Perry. Just a greasy bag of chicken.","user":"allaboutlydia2003","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Horrible, not funny, obnoxious characters and stupid storyline","rating":1,"date":"7 July 2014","review":"I never review movies, but this one was so bad that I'm writing this as soon as I got home. I didn't expect much, but I knew that there were some well known actors in this movie. I found that Kevin Hart's character was so obnoxious and that the only good part of the movie was the 30 seconds piece with Drake.<br><br>I NOT recommend this to anyone--even if they're a Kevin Hart fan. If you like comedies like 22 jump street or the neighbors, you would be wasting your time by going to see this movie as it does NOT compare what so ever.<br><br>I am so upset with what I saw and I regret seeing it.","user":"lspotter98","rank":[21,33]}]
