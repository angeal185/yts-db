[{"title":"A relationship movie that feels fresh","rating":9,"date":"19 September 2011","review":"My rating: 88/100<br><br>I ended up seeing this movie at the Toronto film fest in a rather circuitous way but I'm awfully glad I did.<br><br>Nary a car chase nor explosion, but instead a quiet and thoughtful film. It touches on relationships, death, siblings, betrayal, unrequited love, honesty, fears, and forgiveness and does so in a very believable and refreshing way.<br><br>Most of the movie takes place at a secluded rustic waterfront cottage, a family cabin that Iris (Emily Blunt) has suggested her 'bestie', Jay (Mark Duplass) visit to clear his head; he's still emotionally stuck at the one year anniversary of his brother's death. <br><br>The secluded locale - without phones, computers and the usually daily distractions - is the conduit which allows the abundance of emotions and introspective feelings bubble up and expose themselves to a trio of characters connected in various and interesting ways.<br><br>These three individuals are both frustrating with their flaws, yet endearing with their fragility and weaknesses. How easy it is to identify with all of them!  which can perhaps be attributed to the impromptu conversation Director Lynn Shelton nurtured and encouraged from the mere 70 page script. She confessed that 75% of the dialogue was improvised allowing a unique honesty to develop within each character, thanks to a stellar cast.<br><br>I'm thankful Shelton stuck around Toronto for this third screening – she's originally from Seattle which is where this was filmed - and was more than willing to open up to the audience at a post Q&amp;A where we heard her speak passionately and reflectively about the 12 day shoot (wow!) with almost no funding and how she lucked in to Emily Blunt coming on board (thanks to a shared agent) who was keen on the challenge and experience. Also it was nice to hear that during the festival the film had found distribution through IFC, and that cast and crew would now be compensated for this wonderful collaboration.<br><br>This film's a winner to me. I hope you have an opportunity to see it.","user":"wxgirl55","rank":[59,74]},{"title":"Love, love, love this movie","rating":10,"date":"13 October 2012","review":"This is the first time I have ever felt so strongly about a movie to write a review. I watched it on an airplane yesterday and cannot stop thinking about the characters. I can't get over how real they were and how great the acting was. I laughed and cried and wanted to be friends with them. The end kills me though! I need a sequel!! Or I've even kept imagining a television series. I would LOVE to be able to continue watching these characters and see their lives play out. When I saw the preview, I thought, hmm this should be interesting with just 3 people in the movie pretty much the whole time, but I seriously loved it and thought it was brilliant. I didn't want it to end!","user":"kellyblove","rank":[47,61]},{"title":"your sister's sister, and other complications","rating":8,"date":"18 February 2012","review":"Lynn Shelton's 'Your Sister's Sister' opened the 2012 Glasgow Film Festival and received a near-rapturous response. This is a keenly observed tale of individuals as complex and frail as you, me and everyone we know...<br><br>Iris commemorates the passing of her partner Tom at a gathering of Tom's friends, where Jack, her best friend, offers up a less than flattering eulogy. Jack, coincidentally Tom's sibling, is packed off to a remote island lodge to get his head together, where he encounters Iris's sister, Hannah. Complications ensue - by the bucket-load.<br><br>Shelton took time to explain her process in the Q&amp;A at the Glasgow Film Theatre screening. The cast improvised to a certain extent, but spent a vast amount of time creating back-stories for their characters. That preparation pays off in naturalistic exchanges, interruptions and repairs, gestures and looks that remonstrate, encourage or deter in a convincingly authentic manner. The film is very, very funny, and then genuinely touching and fraught. Throw in an ending you will either love (like me) or loathe, and you have a mature, entertaining film whose execution and polish defies the 12-day shooting period.<br><br>Wonderful performances from Emily Blunt, Rosemarie DeWitt and Mark Duplass as the conflicted trio. Blunt gets to explore more range here than My Summer of Love or anything else on her CV, and shows a growing maturity. The film is involving from the very first frame and holds your attention throughout. Shelton has found a refreshing formula. Bigger budgets and less challenging schedules may follow, but one hopes the stringent process remains.","user":"CountZero313","rank":[47,63]}]
