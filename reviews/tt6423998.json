So grab your poppers and your favorite tricks!","user":"AndreaVerdura","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Awful.","rating":1,"date":"17 July 2019","review":"I'm not even going to go into how offensive these cardboard cutout characters are. If you don't see it in the first 5 mins, you never will. But I know exactly no one who acts/speaks like this and I hang out with the Sisters Of Perpetual Indulgence. Apparently we call anyone we sleep with \"Trade\". The drag numbers are laughable and they aren't supposed to be THAT funny. The decisions and happenstances that make the movie possible make zero logical sense. Time changes without notice just because they need it to be nighttime. Also no one goes by the name PuppyPup. What the absolute hell? This is a train wreck from start to finish. I hated every frame. Want queer horror? Check out Hellbent. Want tired old stereotypes and a story that makes no sense? This movie is for you.","user":"SJLiam","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"Not campy enough.","rating":4,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"A lot of the scenes are each member of the cast saying hello to every other member of the cast. Then catty banter. The film only shines when the titular character is doing his thing. Some of the death scenes are truly inventive. The ones with the arm and the funnel are novel. Danny and PuppyPup are about as pleasant of characters as you will get. And their burgeoning love story simmers like a good stew. But for having a clowny crew of drag personalities, most of the film is more annoying than kitschy.","user":"Otkon","rank":[2,5]}]
