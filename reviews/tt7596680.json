[{"title":"So disappointing","rating":2,"date":"3 August 2019","review":"Saw this at the Traverse City Film Festival. Was really excited as it had Damian Lewis and was described as, \"... comes this whip-smart, rapid-fire, political sizzler that delivers all the AARON SORKIN vibes you want.\" Yes, they actually used his name. And they delivered none of that.\nThe biggest problem with this movie was the story. Plain and simple. It bored me to tears. The music &amp; cinematography were good as was Nina Dobrev, but everything else was tough to sit through.\nI'm guessing the only reason this movie got into the festival was because director Ricky Tollman agreed to speak afterwords. We were told he left early lol. He knew it was bad, that's why he was a no-show.\nI wouldn't have thought about writing a review until I overheard at least 9 other people complaining about the movie.","user":"datadata-69167","rank":[23,33]},{"title":"Amateurishly Inept","rating":6,"date":"6 March 2020","review":"It is truly breath-taking an amateurish this movie is. With the many, and pointless, use of split screens, the director seems to be seeking a postgraduate degree from film school. The script seems unable to figure out what story it is trying to tell (and tells it poorly). Ultimately it is a pity party for millennials, without giving the audience any reason to join in.","user":"mja-78224","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"I don't understand it","rating":9,"date":"9 March 2020","review":"I tried really hard to understand this story, but I don't understand it. The film begins with some really wordy discussions or debate, which I already lost me. The mayor is portrayed to be horrible, but the people on the opposite camp is not that nice either. The story is just not very engagingly portrayed.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[4,6]}]
