[{"title":"excellent horror drama","rating":10,"date":"10 November 2018","review":"This is not exactly a horror movie, this is drama about child abuse and how HORRIFIC it is to the soul of a child that can become a monster. Very intelligent and well done. So, for those of you who are looking for shallow horror flick , skip it. It is not about psycho running around with ax, although there is enough gore and blood. I surprised it went so under radar since it deserves more recognition. Highly recommended.","user":"mageh","rank":[41,53]},{"title":"Well Worth Watching!","rating":9,"date":"18 November 2018","review":"This movie is one of those gems that you find every now and then. It's original and actually has an endearing story line with good acting that blends well with the gore and twisted mindsets around the main characters. It's the first time I recall shedding a tear during a \"horror flick\".","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[35,45]},{"title":"Great overall","rating":8,"date":"26 October 2018","review":"Can someone explain the ending to me? A little confused... how did she turn human again? Was it because she let him go and showed humanity and compassion?<br><br>Great acting and story line very real and gritty!
