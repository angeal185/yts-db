[{"title":"''Let's Have A Drink On It!''","rating":8,"date":"4 May 2006","review":"Yes, \"The Happiest Millionaire\" was Walt Disney's last film. Yes, it was obviously made to top \"Mary Poppins\" and yes, like many late-sixties musicals, it flopped at the box office. But the fact remains that it is a glowing, beautifully made musical (with songs by the Sherman Brothers who were responsible for \"Poppins\") and it never got the recognition it truly deserved. The cast, headed by Disney Stalwart Fred MacMurray and legendary star Greer Garson (in her last film appearance) is excellent. The musical numbers are fun and engaging and the players do them well. Both Lesley Ann Warren and John Davidson were introduced in this film and proved an ideal pair of romantic leads. Warren, who became an overnight star courtesy of her delightful performance as Cinderella in the 1965 Rodgers and Hammerstein television musical, literally shines as Cordelia Drexel Biddle. Many scenes are stolen by Geraldine Page playing Davidson's haughty mother, and Tommy Steele can sing and dance with the best of them. There is also a grand performance from Gladys Cooper as the family matriarch. And, for \"Poppins\" fans, Hermione Baddely appears as the Irish housekeeper. There is also a brief bit by Joan Marshall, the star of William Castle's \"Homicidal\" (billed as Jean Arless) as a maid. The fact that this story is (loosely) based on the prominent Biddle family of Philadelphia, adds to the fun. Because the film was released after Disney's death and exhibitors complained about its long running time, it was drastically edited, shortening and removing several scenes, as well as one musical number (\"It Won't Be Long Till Christmas\"), and here is where the controversy comes in. Garson was originally cast as Mrs. Duke, after the part was turned down by several actresses, including Geraldine Page. Just before filming began however, Page changed her mind, and Greer ended up as Mrs. Biddle. (a part she was not anxious to play). She agreed to the switch when she heard the score--especially \"It Won't Be Long Till Christmas\" which was her one musical number. Indeed she COULD sing, and she did so in a few of her '40's films. Because her song was subsequently cut from the film (after it's Hollywood world premiere) she declined to attend any further premieres, though she had been at the Hollywood opening. Thanks to the newly restored roadshow edition, the song has been restored, and Garson and MacMurray perform it to perfection, truly the highlight of a warm and wonderful story that makes for perfect holiday viewing.","user":"phillindholm","rank":[34,35]},{"title":"The last true example of Disney brilliance","rating":10,"date":"15 October 2003","review":"The Happiest Millionaire has stayed with me since the first time I saw it when I  was a child of four.  Since then I have watched this brilliant blend of brilliant  writing, music and even better acting dozens, perhaps a hundred times.  Why should my comments weigh a little heavier than other posted?  Because I am only 21 years old.  This movie came out twenty five years before I did and my  love for it speaks of its timeless charm.  I won't give away one single hint of the  plot for those who are checking this having never seen the film.  Do yourself a  favor and let the picture remind us of a time ( a time some of us have never known) of great innocence and beauty.  I speak not only of 1916, when the film  took place but also of 1967 when shortly before his death Walt Disney himself  oversaw the making of this movie.  It has been said in reviews that this film was  supposed to compete with the earlier success of Mary Poppins and while the box office or revenue reports will show that the masses did not experience it, it  does not show that they would not have appreciated it.  I am your run of the mill 21 year old college student who likes all sorts of movies but I treasure this and  several other films of the era with many of the same actors, DO NOT MISS THIS  FILM!!!!!","user":"todd836","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"Fantastic Family Film","rating":10,"date":"10 May 2002","review":"I have always loved musicals, but I've never cared for the most popular ones from the 50s and 60s, such as \"The Sound Of Music\".  However, \"The Happiest Millionaire\" scores on every level.  The music is superb, and there's a ton of it.  Tommy Steele does indeed steal the show as a new immigrant who shows up for an interview to become a butler, not quite realizing how wacky the Biddle family really is.  His tunes are the most lively, particularly the bar scene.  However, others such as Fred Macmurray and Leslie Anne Warren really shine here too.  And who knew John Davidson had talents outside of being a game show host?  This is a real diamond in the rough.<br><br>Some minor guidelines - the Roadshow edition has quite a bit of extra footage, and for those of us who know the standard edition by heart, it's great to find little bits and pieces (20 minutes worth, overall) that we've never seen, including parts of some of the songs.  However, the standard edition is a tighter movie and keeps things moving more quickly - and since the standard edition is already over 2 hours and 20 minutes, I'd recommend it first.  Then if you like it, the Roadshow gives you more of the best stuff.<br><br>This was Disney's last picture, and from all accounts he loved it, even though it was unsuccessful due to being released at just the wrong time. With 30 years distance, though, it is still so much fun that I'd love to see it made into an actual Broadway show.  Oh, well, one can dream...","user":"AkiraKaneda","rank":[12,12]}]
