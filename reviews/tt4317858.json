Let me explain... There are a couple of characters in this movie that are borderline offensive in almost any situation and for a minute I found myself thinking 'wow theses are characters you really don't need in your movie' however if you give it a minute the movie fully explains itself and pays off a lot of ground work adding a lot of extra layers to characters that could of been mistaken for throwaway Sopranos imitations.<br><br> I love Tracey in this role she is having a ball stretching her comedy chops. There is one scene I think you should look out for when Jenna and Johnathan profess there feelings to each other, not only is this a really well written and naturally performed scene but the two leads make it believable and I bought it (Keep and eye on Tracey's face in this scene, that's an actress in the moment).<br><br>So yeah I really enjoyed the flick, I was taken aback at moments but that's the sign of a good comedy (your supposed to feel a little uncomfortable). Everyone in it is great in there respective roles, big shout outs to Joseph D'Onofrio and Tracey Birdsall in particular. Its a quick, its funny, its laugh out loud and an easy 90 odd minute light hearted good time. I strongly recommend so get it watched.","user":"haldon-365","rank":[2,14]}]
