[{"title":"Wots with the bulging eyeball obsession?","rating":6,"date":"23 March 2020","review":"When i checked there was only one glowing review on IMDb n the trailer was enticing. When I posted my review, that time too there was the same single review.\nApart from the first 5 mins n few eyeball bulging scenes, this film has nothing more to offer.\nThe bulging eyes n the the eyeball horror scene is comedic.\nFound the babe Georgia Hirst hot, especially her big wide eyes that too in a movie filled with bulging eyeballs due to adverse effects of stimulants.\nNatasha Henstridge is present for few mins but her name is listed predominantly cos none of the face is recognizable except for Georgia Hirst from Vikings.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[27,29]},{"title":"Getting the best out of ...","rating":7,"date":"27 December 2018","review":"Well out of a story I'm probably going to continue right? Let's stick with that and imagine there is no pun intended. Back to the movie that really has not many levels or social commentary to it. And it doesn't pretend to be anything else than just pure horror mixed with one of the passions of the director: DJ-ing/hosting parties.<br><br>If that sounds sufficient enough for you to be entertained, then you will be. There are some \"stock\" character, some cliches and all that, but it's all made in good fun and gore. Since the movie does not pretend anything else, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and a rating of 7 instead of a 6. It really was a decent horror with some good effects","user":"kosmasp","rank":[9,15]},{"title":"Party 'Til You Drop!","rating":8,"date":"28 March 2020","review":"Really enjoyed this movie, no Academy Awards coming its way any time soon but it was a ton of fun and a really interesting premise. Solid performances all around and terrifically silly special FX supported by a banger soundtrack.","user":"strangerinthealps","rank":[1,1]}]
