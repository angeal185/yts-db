[{"title":"Honest review: Rough and tough Craig Fairbrass delivers without the usual punches!","rating":8,"date":"1 March 2020","review":"Out of the 6 current reviews, the two 10's are fake, the 2 is a wannabe critic, and the 8 &amp; 9's real reviews are on point. Anyone questions this review, click my username to see my 1000+ ratings and 800+ reviews.<br><br>I've always been a fan of Craig Fairbrass, and have always enjoyed his rough and tough kick-ass B-grade films with hardly any story-line. But this one was quite the unexpected surprise. Sure I missed the tough guy I was expecting to see, but in this film, he proves once again, that he's also a very talented actor.<br><br>Philip Barantini the director, and one of the two writers - George Russo, are seasoned actors (Russo plays Sean Franks in this film) turned newbie filmmakers, and I have to say, I am impressed. I'll assume the majority of the writing was done by Greg Hall, who although not a seasoned writer, came up with a great story that manipulates your sympathies with unexpected twists that played out really well.<br><br>Sure there were some minor plot and technical issues, and I really wasn't a fan of the many slow-mo scenes, but this film kept me engaged, thrilled and unable to predict what's next - probably due to my expectations of a kick-ass Fairbrass that was pretty much a regular normal guy pushed to his limits trying to protect his family.<br><br>The pacing was a little slow in the \"family dynamics\" scenes and maybe should've been edited down a little, but the 97 min runtime still flew by. Even the score was on point, fitting, and not overbearing, typical in B-grade films.<br><br>If you're a fan of Fairbrass, you have to see this film. You may be disappointed in the lack of action you'd expect from him, but his role and performance in an actual story-line will make up for that.<br><br>It's a well deserved and honest 8/10 from me!","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[14,21]},{"title":"A thoughtfully, well acted, well written addition to this worn genre.","rating":9,"date":"28 February 2020","review":"The British crime and gangster genre is one which has been exploited by a number of very low end productions of late that have given it something of a poor reputation. It's much to the credit of the team behind Villain, that someone clearly sat down and said 'How can we make something more powerful and meaningful with characters in that world?' because this film very much suceeds in doing so on many levels.<br><br>Eddie Franks (Craig Fairbrass in an extremely well measured performance) is a man just released from prison, trying to start a new life and avoid his old criminal ways. His younger brother Sean (The excellent &amp; underated George Russo who also co-wrote the film) unfortunately owes money to local villain Roy Garret (Robert Glenister, played with appropriate menace) The opening scenes for both brothers marks their different paths from outset. Sean's life revolves arounding his coke addicted dsyfunctional girlfiend and wheeling and dealing with rumours following him that he might be an informer for the Police. Eddie wants to do up their old pub and run an honest business. A fight with two local heavies soon brings Eddie to the attention of the Garrets and Sean can't control his drug issues or their debts. (Look out for rising star Taz Skylar, as Sean's dealer, Jason) Eddie also tries to re-connect with his estranged daughter Chole and meets old friend, the successful Michael (The criminally underused Mark Monero, great that he is given a decent role here) and has dinner with his family where they recount the old days (A scene so naturual it could have been improvised) and Michael longs for the old life which Eddie assures him is 'long gone'. When Eddie takes on his brothers debt and tries to protect those he cares about, the scene is set for unstoppable forces to collide in a manner that will change everyone's lives forever.<br><br>Villian is driven by two superb performances in Fairbrass &amp; Russo, whose characters feel real and belivable in the world they inhabit. Topics around child abandonment and fatherhood normally not given screen time in such dramas are given room to breathe here, which only adds to the stakes for Franks character and makes the ending of the film more poignant. The scenes with his daughter ( A great turn from Izuka Hoyle) are well handled while Franks torment over re-offending is given equal consideration. Fairbrass has played similar characters before, but here he really gets to show his acting chops, his speech to the Garretts underscoring his talent quite vividly and he gives his character much light and shade in one of his best performances to date.<br><br>While some elements on the film feel familiar (And perhaps they should) the grim realaties in taking a life, for example, are not something normally dwelled upon. This is not a film advocating violence, quite the opposite in fact. This is a production that feels everyone clearly understood the vision for this story and pulled in the same direction. Everything is a cut above the norm here, from the visuals of DOP Matthew Lewis, through to the performances of the supporting cast, production design and direction. It's not an unfair comment to say that the female roles are under-written but it is a male character driven story and I have no doubt that some scenes were included to tick a box for the distributor, but even the violence is shot with greater care and visual flair here. Phillip Barantini has brought a fresh, well crafted addition to this genre, which people will remember long after its imitators have faded. Recommended.","user":"azanti0029","rank":[14,31]},{"title":"Solid Brit film.","rating":6,"date":"2 March 2020","review":"This was a sold British film about a man who after spending ten years in prison, gets released, only to to learn that his brother has gotten into a bad business drug deal and tries to saves him from the people he owes money to. But the twist comes at the last part of the movie and culminates in the betrayal of a brother's trust. The end scene truly reminds me of the ending of Carlito's Way....solid.","user":"whitemanfromtowne","rank":[5,9]}]
