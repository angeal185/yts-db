[{"title":"A Film to Remember","rating":15,"date":"15 July 2001","review":"When I was young I was probably the only kid in years who had checked out our library's copy of Walter Lord's \"A Night to Remember.\"  It began a lifelong fascination with the ill-fated liner.  I was home sick on the couch a short time later when I saw this film for the first time on TV.  Forty years later, I still remember how this movie touched me then.  Even then I was hooked -- not just because the film dealt with the Titanic, but for some visceral reason I couldn't put my finger on.  Still can't -- decades later. I'm not ashamed to say I continue to get choked up by the scene where Webb is on the slanting deck with his \"son\", telling the boy he's never been prouder of him.  Fast forward several years and I'm sitting on the couch watching this film with my own son for the first time.  Sure enough, I'm having a tough time not losing it all during the Webb and son scene (especially poignant now) when I sneak a peek over at my boy.  I've seen him cry maybe two or three times in his whole life yet there he sat with unmistakably moist eyes.  What a moment to share.  I'm very happy to see so many other people here feel positively toward this movie. One of the defining movie experiences of my life.","user":"dennis-68","rank":[72,79]},{"title":"Restrained but yet engaging melodrama","rating":14,"date":"14 October 2007","review":"The media is full of reports of the maiden voyage of the unsinkable Titanic and all are excited about the prospect, whether it be the third class passengers travelling to a new life or the first class passengers travelling to continue the good life they have. Richard Ward Sturges is not a passenger but he buys a third class ticket off someone else then makes his way up to first class. He has done this because his wife has taken his son and daughter on board the Titanic. Tired of an uncomfortable life among the British upperclasses, Julia Sturges is seeking a \"normal\" life for her family back in her native America, and if that means being away from the stiff and very English Richard then so be it. As their marital drama is played out, the Titanic sails on ever faster, with bigger problems just over the horizon for all of the passengers.<br><br>Many decades before James Cameron delivered Titanic as a disaster movie with a dramatic relationship at its core, someone else had already done it with this 1953 disaster melodrama. The main difference in the narrative is perhaps a note on the difference with our time because the story is not about romantically intertwined young people but rather an older married couple and their romance. Aside from this difference the approach is similar because the majority of the film is a melodrama driven by the characters, which then is fitted into the bigger drama of the ship sinking, taking many with it. Unlike the effects-heavy modern version, this film puts the focus on the family drama happening.<br><br>This works well in making for an engaging film as we see the very English Richard clashing (in an English way) with the more modern Julia in their relationship. Of course it all comes good in the end (well, in a way) but up till then this centre-piece held my attention well. The emotion during the actual sinking of the ship is well received as well, it is restrained and very much the stiff-upper-lip type of thing of the period. Compared to the manipulative use of music and sweeping expressions of emotions in the remake, I must admit I found the changes in the characters played out with restrained emotions of the disaster. The cast work well with this. Webb is strong in his character, retaining what makes the man while also softening towards the end. Stanwyck does likewise, convincing in her early character but yet able to find the love inside her character from the past. The rest of the cast are solid enough but do not really have the same material as the two leads; Dalton, Aherne, Wagner, Basehart and others are all good enough for what is asked of them and, as normal, Ritter is entertaining in her usual character.<br><br>Overall then, an engaging melodrama that maintains a very British sense of emotion but yet is still quite moving. Those who have not yet seen the remake for what it is should perhaps take a pass at this and see if they prefer this version for being shorter and more restrained.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"A Fine Drama With an Outstanding Bonus Documentary","rating":8,"date":"31 January 2004","review":"Winner of three Academy Awards, the 1953 \"Titanic\" (dates are important because of the plethora of identically titled films about the great disaster), was recently re-released by 20th Century Fox as part of their important DVD Studio Classics series.<br><br>Fascination with the fate of the huge and opulent liner is as strong as ever, especially since improved technology has led to more breathtaking visits to the ship's resting spot on the floor of the Atlantic where state-of-the-art robots with cameras explore the crumbling interiors of the still eerily majestic but rapidly decaying wreck.<br><br>The first film dramatizing the fate of the White Star Line's greatest ship came out very soon after the 1912 sinking.  Since then there have been many movies and several Broadway shows about the loss of over 1500 lives (\"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" and, of course, \"Titanic\").<br><br>20th Century's contribution to the genre came before the historically much more accurate \"A Night to Remember,\" based on Walter Lord's bestselling book of that title.  And of course it can't begin to match the special effects and wizardry, to say nothing of a cloyingly popular tune, of James Cameron's international top money grosser.<br><br>But Barbara Stanwyck and Clifton Webb bring a dramatic and impelling story to the screen that remains powerful and, really, very sad decades after the movie's release.  Directed by Jean Negulesco, \"Titanic\" has major (and what could have been easily avoidable) errors about the April 1912 collision with an iceberg.  That doesn't matter because this film is about the relationship of rich, haughty, upper class European (no nationality specified) Webb and his estranged American wife of some two decades, Barbara Stanwyck.  They have an ingenue teenage girl who is a Parisian snob and a younger boy who adores his dad.  The feeling is mutual until Stanwyck reveals that her husband, from whom she's fleeing so the kids can grow up in darkest rural Michigan as Americans, isn't the boy's father.  The ship is the setting for a family in dissolution with every first-time viewer knowing the matter won't be resolved when the ship docks in new York.<br><br>Of course the tempestuous exchanges between Webb and Stanwyck, strongly and believably acted, must give way to the exigencies of dealing with a mortally stricken vessel. Stanwyck and Webb are at the height of their acting careers..  The last dialogue between Webb and his son as drowning approaches is among the most moving and heart-wrenching I have ever experienced in a movie (maybe it's just a guy thing).<br><br>Barbara Stanwyck said in an interview that when her lifeboat scene ended she burst into uncontrollable tears, so strongly had she felt the experience of the survivors.<br><br>DVDs frequently have extra features which can and do run from the inane to the outstanding.  I have yet to encounter a more valuable and fascinating extra than the documentary \"Beyond Titanic,\" a ninety-five minute film only a bit shorter than the movie itself.  While many Titanic documentaries focus on the causes of the maritime debacle or the exploration of the sunken ship, this film is about the social and cultural significance and heritage of one of the world's most consistently engrossing and endlessly studied tragedies.<br><br>\"Beyond Titanic\" presents the cinema history of the voyage from the first silent reels emerging soon after the event to the most recent movies. Authors of outstanding books on the Titanic are interviewed and film clips from movies and newsreels bring the story to life.<br><br>While watching the movie before we saw the documentary, my teenage son turned to me and cynically asked why women and children should have had a right to available lifeboat seats before men were debarked from the listing vessel.  \"Beyond Titanic\" tackles the social mores of the time and quickly but clearly shows that the heroism of men who yielded the opportunity to get into the boats, and thus forfeited their lives, was a standard that those opposed to woman's suffrage applauded. Fighters for women's rights were embarrassed, indeed appalled, and many clearly felt that no such consideration should have been extended on the basis of gender.  Probably no one disputed that children should have been saved before adults (at least I hope so).<br><br>There are more extra features including newsreels.<br><br>And to think that this new release cost but $9.95.  <br><br>For the movie, 8/10.  For \"Beyond Titanic,\" 10/10.","user":"lawprof","rank":[29,32]}]
