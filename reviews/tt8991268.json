[{"title":"Humbling, Unforgettable","rating":10,"date":"6 October 2019","review":"\"One half for me, one half for you.\"<br><br>3 years. 400+ hours of footage. My 2nd viewing. Yet I am still at a loss for words at how a film like this is even possible.<br><br>It somehow manages to present a grounded narrative, a parable of rural life, and a kind environmental message, all quietly captured through observational lens and intimate scope. You will witness everything from a cow giving birth to the near-drowning of a child (which, while brief, is very difficult to watch). The editing and fly-on-the-wall filmmaking style is superb.<br><br>Do not miss.","user":"DjMethod","rank":[113,118]},{"title":"An eye-opener with stunning and raw scenery","rating":10,"date":"28 September 2019","review":"This documentary definitely regained my hope for Macedonian cinema. I just don't know where to start but i'm going to start my review with the protagonists. For me, Atije is symbol of strength and persistence. She is something this world needs badly. She proves that even in the hardest times, people need to be aware of doing the right thing, no matter how bad life gets. Also, we are all connected in this world, humans, nature, flora and fauna. That's why she always puts nature first. In order to take, you must give. But greed gets the best of us. That's what this documentary proves. Sincere, caring and self-less are the words to describe Atije.<br><br>While i was watching the documentary, i thought of how every moment was captured at the right time. Even they hired the best actors and actresses in the world, it wouldn't have been nearly as good as this documentary.<br><br>Local people with a troubled story reflects on a global ecological problem. - That's how i would describe this piece of art.<br><br>If you want a true wake up call that will get even to the hardest of hearts, go with this one.","user":"nikita-chikita","rank":[54,61]},{"title":"Masterpiece about life.","rating":10,"date":"24 November 2019","review":"This is a movie not about the bees, not about the honey, not even about the main character, but about life itself.
