[{"title":"I liked it anyway","rating":23,"date":"23 August 1999","review":"I've heard people trash this movie left and right yet I found that it kept my attention for the duration of it's running time and all the technical aspects were top-notch (especially Tippett Studio's CGI realization of Goliath).  The characters weren't great and weren't bad either.  Sure, we've seen it all before in other films but I have little hope of finding a film that's completely original.  Frankly, I got about what I expected out of it - motion picture fastfood.  You enjoy it as you take it in and digest it and forget about it after you leave the theater.  It's just entertainment and not bad for what it is.  Unlike LOST IN SPACE or BATMAN AND ROBIN, this film isn't boring.  It moves at a quick enough pace to where you don't find yourself checking your watch all the time.  I'm not sure what the deal was with Donald Sutherland's character who displays no sense of logic whatsoever.  Had they dropped the stuff with his character, it would've helped the film.  If you're bored, check it out.  It's worth at least one viewing.","user":"LJ27","rank":[34,40]},{"title":"Salvage, salvage","rating":8,"date":"30 December 2005","review":"Say what you want about this movie not meeting expectations of the 90's but it was very entertaining and thats most of what I expect from any good movie.<br><br>Bad aliens, greed, bravery, bravado, science gone bad and survival all play major parts in this flick.<br><br>Strong women, brave men and treacherous men are a good mix for any story and this movie has them in abundance.<br><br>The aliens seem to want something from humans and its not in the best interest of these humans to meet their needs.<br><br>Try not to be comparing this movie to other sci-fi and just enjoy an interesting twist on the genre.","user":"shhazam2","rank":[34,41]},{"title":"Better than evreyone makes it out to be","rating":7,"date":"13 July 2006","review":"A mediocre storyline (i.e. Titanic) can become a world class film with character development, believable dialogue, and, for lack of a better word, some Hollywood magic. This film could have been a blockbuster with less action, less noise, less effects and more humans being human. Look at 2001 A Space Odyssey, Jaws, Titanic and countless other films, and you'll see that the story was about as interesting as Virus, and the actors, equally talented. Virus failed to deliver characters that we could believe and identify with.<br><br>I still recommend this film highly, as its interesting, it contains Jamie Lee Curtis (a hottie) and Donald Sutherland (a 20th century legend), lots of effects and action. In a way its sort of fun to watch quality actors attempt to make the best of horrible dialogue.<br><br>A 7 out of 10 for storyline and casting","user":"Christopher-Peznola","rank":[61,78]}]
