I'll give it a pass on historical accuracy, the story itself is the real let down.<br><br>One for showing primary school kids on the last day before summer holidays and that's about it. A for effort D for execution.","user":"Stevocity","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"What was that?","rating":3,"date":"16 December 2019","review":"The only part I understand is those kids steal apple then afterward, I don't understand what they are doing and all are non sense killing.....I'm\nsorry","user":"ks-60500","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"So many WHY's","rating":2,"date":"13 November 2019","review":"WHY did this film need to be set in the 1st Century? The setting comes off as a really cheap Medieval Faire.\nThe detail of the four main characters is utterly missing. They're supposed to be Welsh, but sound and look like 21st Century UK college kids in costumes.\nFor a limited budget production, the vision is all over the place. The youth are attractive, but I doubt this project will be a prize in any of their résumés.","user":"cruzarts-73946","rank":[1,1]}]
