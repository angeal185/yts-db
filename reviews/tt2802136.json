[{"title":"Don't' Upset Mumsy","rating":8,"date":"26 July 2015","review":"Wasn't prepared for this twist on the happy, white, middle class, family storyline. I was leaning towards another redundant rom-com (Hollywood not N.Y. style) and should have paid attention to the knife on the DVD cover. It seems, and there's a bit of assuming in this, that 9 out 10 one star ratings come from females and/or families with little ones surprised (upset even) that this film turned out to be a bloody dark comedy. Perhaps hitting too close to home that one of there own should have such a nasty disposition. Leaving aside personal taste I was surprised at how well written, acted and twisty this turned out. Not having any personal connection with an urban/suburban white middle class lifestyle I did not feel violated or offended. We have a super competitive, scrapbook, goal setting obsessive-compulsive mom with an acquiescent former used car, now furniture salesman (2nd &amp; 3rd most ridiculed professions, behind lawyers) dad with two polar opposite kids (reflecting their parents, of course). Final thought, for the squeamish mentioned way above you can sleep better knowing that, no, the kids did survive (those were screams for another).","user":"westsideschl","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"Funny In All the Wrong Ways","rating":8,"date":"14 May 2015","review":"My friend Bryan recommended that I watch Home Sweet Hell, thinking that I would enjoy it. He was absolutely correct. This movie is a twisted little black comedy about a man who cheats on his frigid, OCD wife with a woman he hires to work in his furniture store...a woman he believes is sincerely sweet and genuinely interested in him as a man. The affair goes sideways and his life spirals out of control when his wife becomes aware of the situation. That is as close as I can get to sharing spoilers, aside from the fact that anyone who saw the trailers for the movie is already aware that the wife informs her unfaithful spouse that the only solution is for him to kill the woman he had been having the affair with...so that part should be no surprise. Patrick Wilson manages to succeed in coming across as the bumbling, panic prone, jackass of a husband without any difficulty, but the true star of this movie is Katherine Heigl. This was a very different role for Katherine Heigl...and she pulls it off exceedingly well. I never really felt one way or another about her as an actress, but I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by her performance here. This was an entertaining movie, no question about that. I like this sort of movie though, this sort of dark humor is just my kind of thing...though I tend to prefer things that go a little bit more perverse and a bit darker in my comedy, this one manages to satisfy.","user":"Necroambulant","rank":[26,35]},{"title":"Good performance, catchy music, subpar direction.","rating":18,"date":"18 April 2015","review":"Home Sweet Hell is basically a dark comedy.<br><br>It's not a comedy per se because it has jokes or funny situations. It's comed-ish because of the very efficient performances of the 2 leads, Heigl and Wilson. That's what makes this movie tick in my opinion. The performances are exaggerated but they never become ridiculous. Even some weird and cartoon-ish grimaces delivered form Wilson.<br><br>The music helps the movie a lot. It gives the proper tone especially when the movie take its dark turn.<br><br>The direction is OK I guess but nothing to write home about it.<br><br>The plot soon becomes evident, but there are some twists even after the final credits start to roll.<br><br>Jim (not James!) Belushi is here too. Gives a professional performance in a rather small part.<br><br>Overall: A low budget violent dark comedy that will keep you entertain because of the performances and the chemistry of the 2 leads. Good but nothing spectacular.","user":"Dr_Sagan","rank":[20,27]}]
