Much as I enjoy tacky spoof humor, this movie just falls flat. So many of the film's jokes are so drawn out that whatever humor originally present just gets diluted. It was funny kicking a celebrity into the pit of death once. Five times later, it's just stale and dragging. If you've seen the trailers to this, you've basically seen about 90% of the film. The script could have been easily condensed to a 10 minute sketch for Saturday Night Live. The humor is so repetitive; almost all of the jokes play off either the Spartans questionable sexuality or celebrities' promiscuity. A blurred-out vagina just isn't that funny, why did the movie choose to use it 5 times? While there were numerous pop-culture references, there simply wasn't much done with it. Someone forgot to tell the middle-schooler who wrote this that having a poorly impersonated celebrity appear isn't funny by itself.<br><br>Don't see this movie, even if you liked similar spoof movies (like Scary Movie).","user":"tymothy","rank":[214,279]},{"title":"Terrible in every way possible.","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2008","review":"A dismal failure of a spoof with only the slightest bit of funny. This dreck breaks all the rules of good spoofing.<br><br>1. Be timely. A joke about Ellen in Mr Wrong? Really? <br><br>2. Be funny when offensive. Accident prone kid in Scary Movie 3, mildly funny. Assault on a kid by Spartian, not funny.<br><br>3. Be subtle sometimes. Not everything has to go to the extreme.<br><br>4. Be broad. Go everywhere for your spoofs, not just the same wells over and over.<br><br>AND MOST IMPORTANTLY....<br><br>5. DON'T EXPLAIN EVERY RIFF AND SOURCE MATERIAL. If you have to tell your audience where it comes from, chances are it's not funny.<br><br>The fact that this film is only 60 odd minutes plus one of the longest credit sequences loaded with even more unfunny deleted scenes (seriously can't those wait for the DVD no one should buy either), that's just adding insult to injury.","user":"Queer-qatfm","rank":[440,593]}]
