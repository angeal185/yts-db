[{"title":"If it's Christian it ought to be better","rating":1,"date":"29 November 2014","review":"The overall message is good. But just like many Christian movies before it the acting isn't great. The audio is also not great at times as well. The sad thing is that many Christian circles will see this movie and think that it's great. when in reality the only good thing about the movie is the message. But guess what, when it comes to movies the message isn't the only thing that makes a good movie. You have to have good actors, a good sounds score, and better effects. All of that will help push the overall message and make people care about what's going on in the movie. Christians should demand better movies then this. If the movie is good then more people will see it. When you make bad movies you can't blame the world for not liking them. The movies should be as good or better then any other non Christian movie that's out there. No one is going to care about the message if the movie is filled with bad actors.","user":"Isaiah-Sheppard","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"Ugh...","rating":1,"date":"3 September 2014","review":"Listen, I really hate to be that kind of person to give 'the lone star', but this film is really, really rough. Aside from the wardrobe and make up departments, the rest fell on their faces. The story felt disjointed, the special effects were poor, and the acting...well...<br><br>Attention Christian film makers. I know you all feel that the message of the story is the most important thing. Well, you are wrong. Sure you need a solid message, but how you communicate that message is more, or at least equal to, the importance of the message itself. If you all insist on using Ben Davies, at least persuade him to invest in some acting lessons. He is so robotic, so unconvincing it seems like he either just got the script the day of filming or has zero life experiences to draw on. One other thing: Stop casting Eric Roberts, period. Look him up on IMDb, as of right now he has 75+ films in progress. He is seriously taking every script that comes across his desk. He has faded into irrelevance because of his poor judgment. He is not a name that will boost your film sales, so just stop...please.<br><br>On the upside, the supporting cast were all pretty good. But their performances were over shadowed by too many issues.","user":"saltyfilmcritic","rank":[28,40]},{"title":"Good movie based upon a potential version of Biblical prophecy","rating":6,"date":"1 December 2014","review":"This is a movie that seems to be judged, and therefore rated to either extreme by either non-Christians or Christians. Any reviewer should understand this: It is a Christian themed movie. With that in mind, I thought they did a good job with the budget they had and saw no major issues worth condemnation. The prophetic theme was both necessary and appropriate. I felt most of the acting was good. There were a few exceptions of certain actors that were not particularly great; nevertheless, the main characters were proficient enough as not to detract from the story.<br><br>The back story running concurrently with the plot was well done. If you are a believer in the Bible and literal biblical prophecy you will probably enjoy it--I did.","user":"rlhaag-174-797498","rank":[13,18]}]
