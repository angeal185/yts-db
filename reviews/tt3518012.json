[{"title":"Brilliant.","rating":9,"date":"14 August 2015","review":"\"Best of Enemies\" is incredibly effective at achieving multiple thematic ends without coming off as dense. Here's a few of things it managed to touch on. <br><br>It's a sound, but passive, attack on the current state of our discourse, giving us a history lesson on the genesis moment of television punditry. <br><br>It's a fascinating look inside network news in the time of American political convention \"gavel- to-gavel\" coverage. The last time that ever happened.<br><br>It's an exploration of how TV changes us, or at the very least, reveals us to ourselves, both as people who long to sit in front of its cameras, and as a nation who watches its images. <br><br>It's about how the two sides of the late 60's culture war found their primetime voices. <br><br>It's about class, and how where we come, or how we where we wish we had come from, affects how and what we think. <br><br>It's about the personal journeys of the intellectuals at the center of it - gay-left leaning best selling counter-culture author Vidal and establishment defending policy-affecting conservative Buckley - and how their confrontation never really left the center stage of their own minds.<br><br>But most spectacularly, it's about how the issues of a turbulent period (our republic caught in an ongoing war of attrition, race riots in the streets, the all too familiar rhetoric of income and racial inequality at the center of the political debate) never really ended. <br><br>And it does all of those things with a sense of real legitimacy, never once feeling like it's assigning more importance to the story than it deserves. A perennial fault in the doc genre. But it's not just a good story. It's a good story told well. <br><br>The whole thing is brilliantly structured, wonderfully cut together, incredibly funny and tragic, and far-reaching in its ambition. It's political positioning is measured, either because of or in spite of it's co-director being affiliated with the conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation. <br><br>It features great talking heads, including political historian Sam Tanenhaus (who I sorely miss as the New York Times Book Review editor) and avowed socialist/Marxist/anti-leftist/cultural contrarian Christopher Hitchens, who manages to bloviate even from beyond the grave. <br><br>This is one of my favorite documentaries of the year. A perfect double feature with last year's excellent, \"Last Days in Vietnam\". Catch it if it interests you. It didn't do as well at the box office as it should've.","user":"JoshuaDysart","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"The erosion of TV debate","rating":7,"date":"27 July 2015","review":"For anyone interested in how we arrived at todays angry confrontations and four way screaming matches on news programs - this documentary might be for you.<br><br>\"Best of Enemies\" covers the ten televised debates from 1968 between conservative William F Buckley Jr and liberal Gore Vidal. The debates,for all the wrong reasons, helped inspire TV networks to move towards the format of screamfests we now know. The focus being the act of conflict of opposing opinions, rather than substance. Today you can almost hear the producers scream at debating participants \"energy people.. energy! And Go! \"<br><br>The film homes in on the verbal confrontations of Buckley and Vidal. The arrogance and intellectual wit of both men combined with their serious character assassination attempts of each other is a spectacle. It is however, also the very distraction from the subjects they discuss and you can almost hear the future echos of a Jerry!.. Jerry!.. in the wings (be it a highbrow jerry springer chant). This is emphasized by the fact the debates are not shown in their entirety but instead edited to fit the documentary. Instead commentators in each corner of Buckley and Vidal provide the social and political context around the subjects. The film hereby focuses mainly on the confrontational segments. A deliberate choice of the documentarians, but it comes at the expense of the viewer missing the very important piece to understanding why Buckley and Vidal were the debating heavyweights of their time - detailed positioning of argument! <br><br>The accompanying storyline is the struggle of ABC news and their bid for ratings. It does detract from the debates but provides more media history context.<br><br>The film can be seen as an introduction to Vidal and Buckley but will not provide a thorough insight to either of these two political warriors. Mainly The documentary shines a light on the subject of TV debate and where the erosion of TV journalism might have started. <br><br>With the recent loss of Christopher Hitchens and an ageing Noam Chomsky,it seems that the times of fearless intellectual exchanges between debating parties is over. Gutsy political commentary, social criticism and satirical wit appear to no longer be coming from intellectuals but comedians. Once Bill Hicks and George Carlin. Now Bill Maher and Jon Stewart. But even they cant live forever. Who will replace <br><br>Gore Vidal was asked as one of the last living legends of the literary scene why no one seemed to be taking on the mantle of work and standard of writing of him and his peers. Vidal replied \"Because no one took on the mantle of reader\". Maybe we also didn't take on the mantle of viewer.","user":"stubbornpanda","rank":[22,26]},{"title":"\"Confrontation of life styles\"... dawn of a new TV era","rating":8,"date":"24 October 2015","review":"\"Best of Enemies\" (2015 release; 88 min.) is a documentary about the infamous 10 televised debates that took place during the 1968 Republican and Democratic Presidential Conventions (in Miami and Chicago, respectively), between conservative William Buckley Jr. and liberal Gore Vidal. As the documentary opens, Vidal is commentating about old pictures hanging up in his house and one of them is showing Buckley and Vidal at one of those debates. We then get some background as to who these 2 guys are, and why ABC veered away to bring the \"unconventional Convention\" coverage. And then we get to the first debate... To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br><br>Couple of comments: this documentary is co-directed by Morgan \"20 Feet From Stardom\" Neville and Robert Gordon, who is affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank. If you think that means the documentary is kinder to Buckley that to Vidal, think again. The two men are pitted against each other, and vehemently disdain each other, even before these debates, and much more so afterwards. \"It was a confrontation of life styles\", as someone comments. Yes, it was, but as it turns out, these debates had another unexpected consequence: ABC's ratings went through the roof, and the other mainstream networks quickly realized they had to have their own versions of these \"point-counterpoint\" programs. In other words, the Buckley-Vidal debates set into motion what would eventually become the Fox's and MSNBC's news channels. Apart from the historical legacy created by these debates, the documentary also examines the long shadows cast be the debates over the personal lives of both Vidal and (even more so) Buckley. If you have any interest in politics and/or in TV history, you will not want to miss this documentary. It makes for completing viewing, period.<br><br>\"Best of Enemies\" made quite a splash at the Sundance film festival earlier this year. The movie's been out for months and I didn't think it would reach theaters here in Cincinnati, but then out of the blue t showed up this weekend at my local art-house theater here. I figured this would not be playing very long and went to see it right away, The matinée screening where I saw this at turned into a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. A shame, as this is a riveting documentary. If you get the chance to see this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, do not mist it! \"BEst of Enemies\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","user":"paul-allaer","rank":[11,12]}]
