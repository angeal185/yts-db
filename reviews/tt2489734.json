[{"title":"Rest In Peace Muhammad Ali!.","rating":10,"date":"25 July 2016","review":"Source of the Review : http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/trials-of-muhammad-ali/<br><br>BY Bill Siegel | IN Identity<br><br>Premiered April 14, 2014 About the Film The Trials of Muhammad Ali explores the extraordinary and complex life of the legendary athlete outside the boxing ring. From joining the controversial Nation of Islam and changing his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali, from his refusal to serve in the Vietnam War in the name of protesting racial inequality to his global humanitarian work, Ali remains an inspiring and controversial figure.<br><br>Focusing on some of the most noteworthy and provocative aspects of the legendary athlete's life, the film explores his lifelong journey of spiritual transformation. From his Louisville roots through his years in exile to receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Ali's path was that of poet to pariah to global ambassador for peace.<br><br>In 1964, when the 22-year-old Olympic gold medalist won his first heavyweight championship, he shouted, \"I shook up the world!\" But his earthshaking had only begun. Soon he announced he had become a Muslim with a new name: Muhammad Ali.<br><br>In 1967, after being denied conscientious objector status, Ali refused military induction. Convicted of draft evasion, he was sentenced to five years in prison and his passport was revoked. Stripped of his title and banned from boxing, Ali faced an American public enraged by his opposition to the Vietnam War and unwilling to accept his conversion to Islam. Vilified in many corners at home, he became an international symbol of opposition to an unjust war.<br><br>Filing round after round of legal appeals all the way to the Supreme Court, he supported his family via a nationwide speaking tour across a country divided over the war abroad and racism at home. Rare archival footage of Ali's fiery speeches on college campuses and heated exchanges during TV appearances show him fearlessly speaking his mind as he fights for freedom.<br><br>Archival scenes highlight the forces that supported and opposed him, including his spiritual mentors, Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, and critics of his stance, such as Jackie Robinson and Joe Louis. Most of the interviewees have never been featured in any Ali film before, yet are central to his life story and the global impact he had. Interviews shot exclusively for the film include his brother, Rahman; his former wife, Khalilah Camacho-Ali; New York Times writer Robert Lipsyte; and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. What emerges is the hidden history and a complex portrait of Muhammad Ali.<br><br>The Filmmaker Bill Siegel has more than 20 years of experience in documentary filmmaking and education. He co-directed the Academy Award-nominated documentary The Weather Underground; was a researcher on the films Muhammad Ali: The Whole Story and Hoop Dreams; and a writer on One Love, a documentary on the cultural history of basketball by Leon Gast (When We Were Kings). Siegel is Vice President of School Programs for the Great Books Foundation, a non-profit educational organization dedicated to literacy and lifelong learning.","user":"HealthyLove","rank":[130,130]},{"title":"The greatest will live forever!","rating":9,"date":"19 July 2015","review":"We've all seen the highlights of Muhammad Ali's boxing career, but what happened in his life is just as important. \"The Trials of Muhammad Ali\" has a title that one might interpret as a double meaning. There was the US government's prosecution of him for refusing to fight in the Vietnam War, and there were the events in his personal life. The point is that Ali stood up for what he believed, and made sure that the world heard his opinion.<br><br>We could be cynical and say that the documentary gives a little too much time to the interviewees, but the archive footage makes up for that. It's clear that the government saw all black political movements as suspect, especially Islam. Among the interviewees, John Carlos - who made a political statement at the 1968 Olympics - makes probably the most important comment.<br><br>Well, Ali got vindicated. He lit the torch at the 1996 Olympics and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005. There's also a clip of him interviewed right after the 9/11 attacks warning not to view all Muslims as Osama bin Laden.<br><br>Definitely see this documentary.","user":"lee_eisenberg","rank":[95,95]},{"title":"A Good Watch for fans and everyone else","rating":7,"date":"18 June 2016","review":"Offers great insight into the story of the man, Muhammad Ali aka Cassius Clay. An incredible and outspoken boxer who transcended boxing, and even all of sports. It begins with the journey of a man, the principles he fought for, the trials and tribulations he had to face throughout his life to stand for these principles he believed in, the courage rebellion, and his continuous evolution, reverence and relevance in public folklore, with a popularity that went soaring in the 60s and 70s, and later come to be known as the greatest of all time. Its a genuine tribute to the man, who will not be forgotten, and stands as an inspiration to millions of people, for generations to come.","user":"Vick41","rank":[80,81]}]
