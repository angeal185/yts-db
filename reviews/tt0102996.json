[{"title":"Still Da Bomb!","rating":9,"date":"9 May 2003","review":"I remember seeing this movie back in 1991, and a couple of times on TV, then it just disappeared.  I was surprised to find that it was still in print on VHS, and I purchased it immediately!  Tommy and Joseph are great in their roles.  Not to mention it's great to see Halle Berry in her dope early '90s fashion, complete with ripped knee jeans and a leather jacket.  Samuel Jackson plays his role great too as the boss from hell!  This is a fun movie, and is very enjoyable to watch multiple times.  It would be great to see it available on DVD in the future, but the VHS still looks great even after all of these years.","user":"dgordon-1","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Fun movie.","rating":10,"date":"30 August 2002","review":"Good clean movie with a message. They don't make them like this anymore. This movie reminds me of a later movie Mo Money!, though more for comedy with the Wayman brothers still clean and fun to watch. I gave this movie a 10 for entertainment value.","user":"GPeoples","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"good comedy","rating":10,"date":"1 June 2002","review":"Strictly Business is a good feel-good comedy movie.  Tommy davidson and Joseph Phillips are awesome as an on-screen duo.  Halle Berry looks good in this one.  This movie is bombed by critics, but I think it's good.
