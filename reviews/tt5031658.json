[{"title":"Beware, most reviews are fake","rating":1,"date":"17 May 2019","review":"This is a very low budget and poorly made film with terrible acting and high school level special effects (the few that are there). The reviews written that rate this about 5 are 100% fake.<br><br>The premise is a possession type story and has no consistency. I think the writer had no idea how to fill in the time and just copied scenes from other movies and pasted them together. The twist was terrible and the ending was even worse. Now if they had simply been honest and stated that this was a hobby movie then I wouldnt be as harsh and maybe would give this thing a 3/10 but since they clearly wrote fake reviews, they get a 1.<br><br>Dont waste your time.","user":"marc5477","rank":[33,50]},{"title":"Low budget but worth a watch","rating":7,"date":"5 April 2019","review":"I'm not from crew or cast or a fake review it has some good special effects that create some good horror scenes. It's not boring and the story flows good slow getting going but once it does the movie works. The actors arnt amazing but they are good.It's cross between evil dead and amytiville.\nI recommend giving this one a go","user":"jakejake-985-155608","rank":[33,54]},{"title":"Most Of The Other Reviews Are Fake","rating":3,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"The movie is not the worst horror film I've ever seen, but it's still pretty bad. The story had potential but is hampered by horrible acting. There isn't much to say about this movie and the only reason I'm bothering to write anything at all is because most of other the reviews for it are fake.<br><br>If you click on the name of the user who wrote the 7, 8, 9 and 10 star reviews you will see that almost all of them have been users for less than 6 months, and many have given high ratings to the same 10 or so films.<br><br>The opening credits are probably the best thing about this, to be honest. They hint at a story that is more interesting that what is actually delivered. There are some interesting moment scattered throughout and a couple of times it was pretty creepy, but these moments were ruined by inconsistent performances. Speaking of which...<br><br>Kate Rose Reynolds, whose character is introduced as being a \"dark Wiccan\" *CRINGE*, is actually a decent actress. She plays a creepy part pretty well, and I would watch another movie with her in it just to see how she does.<br><br>Aurora Heimbach and Sandra Mae Frank play twins, and both are bland enough to be interchangeable, except that Sandra Mae Frank is deaf. I DO like the way that they worked sign language into the film, and the moments where we viewed a situation from Frank's perspective were effective. Otherwise they both deliver decent performances; I don't hold this movie against them, but I'm not in a hurry to see anything else they might do.<br><br>The male actors...whoooo boy. They need to not be actors. They need to go on a walking tour of the continental US, along with the writers and directors, apologizing for, well, being themselves. Especially Craig Fogel and Derek Long. Those two are just the worst.<br><br>Anyway, I wouldn't have gone into all of this were it not for the fake reviews someone either made alt accounts for (or paid someone else for). Balance in all things.","user":"Kaptain_Bluddflagg","rank":[13,19]}]
