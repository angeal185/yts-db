[{"title":"Ever Watchable Classic Swashbuckler.","rating":9,"date":"10 December 2013","review":"The best swashbuckler ever made is how many regard 20th Century Fox's THE MARK OF ZORRO. Produced in 1940 for the studio by the uncredited Raymond Griffith and Darryl Zanuck the picture was Fox's answer to Warner Bros. who up to that time had, more or less, cornered the market with their finest array of swashbuckling adventures. With the perfect hero in Errol Flynn, who swept across our screens in such classics as \"Captain Blood\", \"The Adventures Of Robin Hood\" and \"The Sea Hawk\" and all to the brilliant music of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, other studios found it difficult to equal Warner's expertise in creating such flagship adventures. But Fox's THE MARK OF ZORRO was one that did and in its star Tyrone Power they even had a comparable hero to Flynn. From a story \"The Curse Of Capistrano\" by Johnston McCully it was splendidly adapted for the screen by John Taintor Foote, crisply photographed in black and white by the great Arthur Miller and the whole thing was adroitly handled by Russian director Rouben Mamoulian.<br><br>It is 1820 and a nobleman's son Don Diago Vega (Tyrone Power) returns home to California after spending some years at a military school in Spain. But he finds the province has greatly changed and has fallen under the dictatorship of an autocratic governor Don Luis Quintero (J.Edward Bromberg) and his ruthless sword wielding army Captain Estaban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). The people are heavily taxed and oppressed. Don Diago covertly takes up their cause and dons the guise of a masked avenger while maintaining a foppish and carefree persona to his family and friends. He raids the army coffers, returns to the peasants their meagre funds and avenges any harm that they incur. The picture ends with the people rising up against their oppressors, regaining their freedom from tyranny and Don Diago and Pasquale locked in an outstandingly staged sword fight to the death.<br><br>Performances are superb from the entire cast. The swashbuckling Don Diago Vega is one of Ty Power's most likable and best remembered roles. It also revealed his fine flair for comedy. As the fop he could be quite amusing (on being informed that the villainous Captain Pasquale was once a fencing instructor in Madrid Don Diago looks through his monocle at Pasquale, sighs wearily and quips \"How exhausting\"). It's a shame he didn't do more movies like this. Two years later he was a pirate on the high seas in the enjoyable \"The Black Swan\" and in 1947 he appeared in Fox's colourful epic on the Conquistadores \"Captain From Castile\" but that was all. Historical roles in \"Prince of Foxes\", \"The Black Rose\" and \"Son Of Fury\" were also enjoyable but none of these films ever gained any swashbuckling status. Excellent too was Basil Rathbone. His villain almost as sly and as cunning as his Guy of Gisbourne in \"Robin Hood\" two years earlier. And supplying the love interest was the lovely Linda Darnell who the following year would again star with Power in the Fox classic \"Blood And Sand\" again directed by Mamoulian. Also of interest is the casting of Eugene Palette as the church friar almost exactly the same role he played in \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\".<br><br>Of some note also is the brilliant score put together and conducted by Alfred Newman. The exciting main Zorro theme was written, not by Newman, but by the uncredited Hugo Friedhofer. It is an exhilarating heroic motif that the great Korngold himself would be proud to have written for Flynn. Great music is but one element that makes THE MARK OF ZORRO an unforgettable movie. Its popularity has endured since it was made almost 75 years ago and no doubt it will continue thrilling audiences for a long time to come.","user":"jpdoherty","rank":[36,37]},{"title":"A masterpiece of screen Swordplay...","rating":9,"date":"3 June 2000","review":"Tyrone Power - the swashbuckling answer to Errol Flynn - is cast as the agile masked avenger who decides to take up the people's cause in disguise leaving his 'mark' \"Z\" everywhere, on walls, coach, wooden barrels and human chest...<br><br>Power - in a double leading role - is at his best as Zorro, climbing, jumping, riding and fencing, determined to finish with tyranny and oppression by terrorizing, and retrieving taxation funds and by challenging a cunning officer, proving in public his indifference, his ostentation and irony as a perfect pacifist fop in 19th-Century Spanish California, confusing and deceiving his aristocratic father Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), the deposed Alcalde...<br><br>The inspired casting (in supporting roles) recalls \"The Adventures of Robin Hood.\"<br><br>Linda Darnell is the pretty Lolita, Quintero's charming niece, who loves the mysterious hero and can't tolerate the fop until she is told that they are the image of the same person...<br><br>Basil Rathbone, one of the most durable of screen villains who has mastered stage fencing but never won a Swordfight, plays the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale, the Alcalde's military adviser...

This film has not aged a day in 63 years.....it is still a great tale of old California and the masked caballero, Zorro.  Tyrone Power plays it to the hilt, and is especially good in his alter ego of the effeminate fop, Don Diego.  He may not be quite as acrobatic as Fairbanks was in the original silent version but it doesn't detract from the performance.  And Power was a fencer, so his sword fighting scenes certainly rang true.  Put him with that elegant gentleman, Basil Rathbone, also an excellent swordsman, and you get one of the best sword fights in film history. Rathbone is the other shining star of this film.  He oozes evil and was the master of the condescending sneer.  The supporting cast is impeccable.....Palette, Sondergaard, Bromberg, Love, and the young, extremely beautiful Linda Darnell.  It is curious to note that both Gale Sondergaard and J. Edward Bromberg were caught up in the Red Scare in Hollywood in the late 40'3, early 50's and their careers were basically destroyed by it.<br><br>This is a rousing, fun film with great dialogue and should be on everyone's \"must see\" list.  One curious thing.......how did those very revealing tight pants worn by Power and Rathbone get by the Hays Office?  These were the days when you could not even show a married couple sharing the same bed and those pants didn't leave much to the imagination!","user":"Bucs1960","rank":[30,34]}]
