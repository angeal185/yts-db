[{"title":"Give it a chance. Keep an open mind.","rating":8,"date":"20 June 2019","review":"I was surprised to find this movie was made. I was skeptical, but I like to keep an open mind based on previous spinoff series. While the original series is a classic and can never truly be recreated, this was a refreshing delight. I think it's a fantastic way to keep progressing the Scooby Doo franchise for future generations. This movie opens doors for bringing Scooby Doo into the present. While other movies and series have done a great job it was awesome to see character development for two characters that are stereotyped from the 70s. These girls were assertive, smart, and great characters in their own rights. The plot wasn't super strong, and it was easy to pick the villain but isn't that kinda the charm of Scooby Doo? I always felt like a rockstar detective as a kid watching the shows. Overall, I think it's a great movie.","user":"jenkinsholly-53-283206","rank":[42,48]},{"title":"Wholesome, fun and funny","rating":10,"date":"1 February 2019","review":"Plus great modeling for young men and women. Nice arcs for the main characters and it's good to see a new take on a tired show.","user":"Jessattard31","rank":[33,44]},{"title":"Awesome!","rating":10,"date":"5 January 2019","review":"Great movie for kids and families!
