[{"title":"Funnier than expected","rating":7,"date":"7 July 2015","review":"Get Hard was a film I really wasn't expecting to like much, but it was significantly funnier than I expected it to be. Will Ferrell's films have had a tendency to be a bit like Russian Roulette as of late, but this one is fortunately one with no bullet in the chamber. Ferrell plays James, a market trader with (in some people's books) an idyllic life: beautiful house, beautiful fianc√©e (the boss's daughter) and more money that Trump could shake a stick at.<br><br>But the idyll is shattered when he is arrested and then convicted of corruption on a massive scale. Wanting to set a public example , the judge sentences him to the delights of San Quentin and James has 30 days to \"Get Hard\" before being thrown to the mercy of the inmates. Helping him in the task is Kevin Hart (\"Ride Along\") who, primarily for reasons of personal financial gain, pretends to be much more 'street' than he really is.<br><br>What I enjoyed about this film was the leisurely set up of character and plot before the real comedy (the 'training') kicked in. This is where Ferrell and Hart really work together well, and I thought Hart was excellent in his role. Also good to see Craig T. Nelson (\"Poltergeist\", \"Blades of Glory\") back on the big screen as James's boss.<br><br>There are few films where I have guffawed out loud so much at certain points: some really good visual slapstick humour. However, the film will be far from everyone's tastes, with some very close to the knuckle jokes. In particular things come to a 'head', as it were, with some mano-a-mano action between Ferrell and Matt Walsh (\"VEEP\", \"Into the Storm\"), where the crudometer gets cranked up to \"Farrelly\". The film is also let down by a weak ending and if there was a joke to be had in the last line of the film, it completely flew over my head.<br><br>Recommended for some good belly laughs for the broad minded.<br><br>(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to get future reviews.

Considering the comedy talent at hand, I understand that some might be disappointed in this. But it's still decent enough, even with some mediocre jokes thrown in there from time to time. Not to mention the fact, that this is as predictable as it gets (story wise that is).<br><br>Not sure if the jokes about homosexuality work most of the time either, but you have to give/cut them some slack for trying (while not dumbing them down too much). The word play is there (see title), which is played out pretty nicely in one particular scene (turning point sort of). Don't expect too much and you'll be entertained","user":"kosmasp","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Funny moments but disappointing from this comedy duo","rating":5,"date":"10 June 2015","review":"Get Hard is a comedy starring two of the funniest actors out there today, and having this duo of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell you would think would make for an extremely funny movie, unfortunately it doesn't but it still had its fair share of good laughs. They had pretty good chemistry and most if not all of the good funny moments came from the interactions between the two of them. They played off the racial stereotypes for pretty much the entire film and as the film went on it got less funny and repetitive. The good moments of the film in terms of the comedy came in the middle of the film, thats where you have everyone introduced and the build up is over but you are also not yet exhausted by the repetitive jokes. In terms of their performances, there is nothing new here, it feels like they were both playing similar characters that they have played many times before in their previous films. But the characters did fit very well into the plot. <br><br>The plot of the film was a little predictable, but at the same time i wasn't bored of following the plot. It didn't feel like certain plot points happened in order to get a few quick jokes in, everything flowed pretty well and i was still interested in seeing what was going to happen next. There is not much else i can say about this film, there is nothing new to see here from Will or Kevin, but the film does provide with some good jokes and an interesting plot that can get you through the film fairly entertained. So i guess if you are a fan of either member of this comedy duo then you will enjoy seeing them together in this film. - 5/10","user":"stephendaxter","rank":[53,80]}]
