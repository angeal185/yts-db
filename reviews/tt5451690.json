[{"title":"Why the negative reviews? It's not a perfect movie but well acted for a young inexperienced cast","rating":8,"date":"11 July 2018","review":"I don't usually write reviews for films on here but I had to for this one, purely to counter balance the many negative reviews! Is the movie perfect, no, but it's actually pretty good if you like a little more 'indie' films and like alternative music. \nThis movie isn't a 'supernatural' film but more like a thriller message about the dark side of the 'rock and roll music industry' and how wanting fame has it's costs on yourself and those around you.<br><br>I also thought the inexperienced actors were better actors and more convincing than the 'veterans'. I hadn't heard of Andy Biersack or Ben Bruce before this but for musicians to act they did a really good job and were very watchable, funny and convincing. The soundtrack is also very good plus 'The Relentless' bands music too has been on repeat since (Remington Leith's voice is perfect for Johnny Faust').<br><br>Overall it's not a bad movie, it's just more a film you'd stream at home than go and see at the movie theatre. I actually hope there is a follow up/TV series that had been suggested as I'd definitely watch it. <br><br>So if you're willing to not take yourself and this movie too seriously then I'd recommend watching it","user":"sophiexjane","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"Not what I hoped for...","rating":5,"date":"1 November 2017","review":"I have been looking forward to this movie since I saw the IMDb page and watched the trailer. I was hoping that it would be THE movie for fans of metalcore. But it wasn't just my overly high hopes for this movie that made me incredibly disappointed. I am usually very good at seeing the good parts of bad movies, as in, \"Well, the acting wasn't very good, but the story was great!\" While parts of this movie were alright, maybe even good at parts, not one aspect of this film was good all the way through.<br><br>Writing: 3/10 The basic story of American Satan might have been good if it was handled better. However, the script, if indeed there was a script, was awful, and many, many times it was hard to tell if the bad product on screen was because of bad writing or bad acting. The production quality didn't turn out to be good enough to convincingly carry the scope of the film, which could have been better handled if the writer/director knew his own limitations. <br><br>Directing: 4/10 When I saw the movie, I didn't know that the writer/director, Ash Avildsen, is the CEO and founder of Sumerian Record, the label that produces Asking Alexandria, (a great band, for the record). If I had known this I might have had a slight inclination that this movie was made with no better prospects than to reel in Andy Biersack fangirls, and metalcore fans, myself included, and not delivered with passion for or love for the music, or even quality movies. What was caught on camera and put on screen, at times, was so chaotic and incoherent, as my friend and I were watching the movie, at a pivotal part of the film, my friend looked over at me and asked, \"Wait, what happened?\" and I had to explain what I was pretty sure had happened but was not clearly shown. Also, what the trailers showed of the band playing in the movie looked great and I was really looking forward to it, however what was shown in the movie looked like it was ripped straight from a concert tape of your average rock band. I couldn't get into it, even as a huge fan of the kind of music they play. All in all, it just wasn't good, and I believe the person most at fault for this entire catastrophe is the writer and director himself. <br><br>Acting: 5/10 The acting in this movie is very spotty. Sometimes it seems like the newcomers to acting and stars of the movie, Andy Biersack and Ben Bruce are doing very well with their acting debut, and other times its painful to watch. This goes for the experienced actors of the film to, finger pointed straight at Malcolm McDowell. But, as said before, it's often hard to tell if the poor product on screen is the fault of an actor doing their job poorly, or if the script they were given was just god-awful. <br><br>Overall: 4.5/10 There's not a lot to like here unless you're a die-hard Andy Biersack, Black Veil Brides fangirl, or boy, and consider everything he touches to be descended straight from heaven. Anyone who considers himself a fan of quality films, or at least have one thing, one good aspect of a movie to praise after devoting almost two hours to it, should probably go look somewhere else.","user":"isaacmhunsinger","rank":[33,51]},{"title":"Calm down, haters","rating":8,"date":"1 April 2018","review":"I've never been inclined to write a review before until I saw all the terrible and undeserved reviews others were giving this movie. Like, back off pseudo-Eberts. It's not like this film was gunning for Oscar contention so maybe calm down with the criticism. <br><br>Was the movie perfect? No, but it was still very watchable and I actually enjoyed it. As someone who has sat through some absolutely terrible movies with acting that makes me cringe in embarrassment and pity for the poor soul fumbling around on screen, I can say with certainty this is not one of those films. Unless you are going in with unreasonably high expectations, I don't think the average viewer will be disappointed. <br><br>More importantly, as a bigger fan of music than film, the soundtrack and American Satan album are stellar. Not gonna lie, if the Relentless were a real band, I'd probably be a groupie. I also can't understand the hate around Andy Biersack not being the real voice behind the music. The director didn't want people to think of Andy Biersack of Black Veil Brides. He wanted people to connect with the character Johnny Faust. I applaud this decision and think it worked well. <br><br>tl;dr...don't trust the bad reviews this movie is totally worth the watch. Oh, and buy the soundtrack and album.","user":"beastiegirl-70131","rank":[22,37]}]
