[{"title":"A honest review for Tone-Deaf","rating":4,"date":"24 August 2019","review":"First off, this film is classified as a horror comedy, but the only real comedy comes in the form of a few awkward moments and a couple attempts of 4th wall breaking humor of Millennials and Boomers taking some cringeworthy jabs at each other (which are not funny at all and seriously bring it down a whole point by themselves).<br><br>To keep this review short and to the point, any positives that I have to say about this film goes to the production and acting. There is some nice cinematic shots, good sound design, and solid effects. The acting is slightly above average but there will be no award nominations coming their way for this movie.<br><br>The story on the other hand, is a mixed bag of mediocrity. It is all over the place and changes tone several times during the film. At some points it tries to be a serious thriller. At other points it is a light-hearted dramedy. Yet at other times it's an arthouse parody that really makes little sense.<br><br>Overall the movie is weird and doesn't seem to have a good sense of itself. There are a couple good scenes and there is some decent production to it, but the majority of it is a just a nonsensical mess that's just not very entertaining. Not a film that you're going to want to watch twice and very forgettable. 4/10","user":"mikedegroot","rank":[43,62]},{"title":"Demented and hilarious...","rating":7,"date":"15 January 2020","review":"This...is NOT high art. But it's fun. Robert Patrick really made this movie for me, breaking the 4th wall about Millenials. I'm sure if I really studied this as a metaphor I'd find something to be offended about. Since I see it as great cinema I'm not going to narrow the view on it. Great movie.","user":"goatrope67","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Strange Flick, Terrible Pianist, 4th Wall Cringefest","rating":4,"date":"24 August 2019","review":"Weird script, weirdly executed, with chuckle/cringe-worthy generational shots fired throughout the film. The story execution did achieve in keeping my attention throughout, however the disillusionment in what could have been a way better film is well established half-way.<br><br>All-in-all, prioritize viewing other films you might have missed in your life, but give this a go if you want some \"wtf were they thinking\" moments.","user":"ok-patrick","rank":[28,41]}]
