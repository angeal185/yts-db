[{"title":"Amazing.","rating":10,"date":"10 December 2019","review":"Michelle Wolf is one of the best american stand up comedians.","user":"paulosoaresdalmeida","rank":[22,42]},{"title":"Starts strong, but gets more cringy and less funny as it progresses.","rating":5,"date":"10 February 2020","review":"I like Michelle and her comedy. But this wasn't her strongest work (or delivery for that matter).<br><br>This brand of comedy feels like a classroom conquered and run by a band of unruly kids. They're not funny, don't practice good comedy, yet consider themselves edgy, woke and more relevant than the rest of the world....sorry, I don't think so.","user":"gina_gemini","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"\"Joke Show\" is a very appropriate title","rating":10,"date":"19 December 2019","review":"I gave it 10. Never have I heard myself and the audience laugh so many times PER MINUTE. Michelle Wolf may be a little \"screechy\" but she doesn't have to spend a lot time \"setting up\" a joke. Everything \"lands big\", funny, funny, funny. Now, be warned, she talks about abortion, birth other things that you may not want to hear. But for people who are open to about any subject, oh, she's great. Netflix.","user":"j_ryberg","rank":[6,10]}]
