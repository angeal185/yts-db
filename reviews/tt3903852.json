[{"title":"It's just so bad","rating":2,"date":"26 June 2016","review":"You know when a movie is so bad, it's good? That's not this film.<br><br>I watched the whole thing—like rubbernecking a car accident—I knew I shouldn't, but I just couldn't look away.<br><br>The script was terrible, most of the acting was terrible, the storyline was weak and disorganized, characters weren't believable or even likable, and it was just stuffed full of terrible clichés. I honestly just didn't care about what happened to anybody in the film. I mean there was a baby where I thought, \"Please don't use this kid as another gratuitous and clichéd plot device,\" but even then, it was more of not wanting to see that on the film, and not because there was any emotional investment beyond not wanting to see the depiction of atrocities committed to infants) No spoilers here, so I won't say whether or not I got my one wish.<br><br>A little bit of production talent could have cleaned the script up and tightened up the storyline; some technical consulting in the action sequences to actually lend credibility to the idea that these guys are 'operators' who understand even basic weapons-handling, combat strategies, (and even how to use their weapons' sights for f**k's sake), could have taken this weird train wreck and upgraded it into at least a guilty pleasure.<br><br>I went into this not expecting a masterpiece. I assumed it would be a 'guilty pleasure' shoot-em up and, as such, I tried really hard to like the film. <br><br>Unfortunately, the whole thing just falls disappointingly flat.","user":"wrenchmonkey","rank":[25,27]},{"title":"The director and the vigilante wrote this crap fest.","rating":1,"date":"23 June 2016","review":"This movie is for the simple minded. It has a comic book feel about it. You like gun play .Like stuff blowing up. You like hot Asian chicks. You like a script that makes no sense?<br><br>Well look no farther. This movie has all that and more. <br><br>This was just awful. Acting was poor to say the lease. Loads of war type action. People getting killed left and right. Man bun documentary movie guy is annoying. No character development. Story jumps all over the place. And so does the vigilante. And can you believe they set this up for a sequel. I guess you would have to been a fan of the TV series of the same title to even like this movie.","user":"mastercraftsman","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"Weird, cheesy, but ultimately boring movie","rating":6,"date":"22 June 2016","review":"This is a hard to rate movie. <br><br>The actors, I liked a lot of them - and not just the Asian hotties, I'll have you know. I mean the main character is a muscleman with no charisma whatsoever, but there you got Michael Jai White, Jason \"Jay\" Mewes, Michael \"sooo annoying\" Madsen, even Danny Trejo and James Russo do some cameos. Add to this serious dudes like Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson and the entire Armenian cast, who did very well, and you got some cool people there with both acting and/or physical action handled.<br><br>The story is all over the place, from a vigilante that is called The Vigilante, but doesn't seem to do anything during the movie, to the Armenian mob, terrorist nuke attacks, data hackers with weird 3D air interfaces, getting the captured wife and son back, shadow men that manipulate everything, etc. The problem is the script. It just ... sucks! Nothing is connected, no characters are developed, things go from one place to another with absolutely no emotional impact. It made the whole thing confusing and boring.<br><br>Then there is the production values. Expensive cars, weapons, some decent CGI... but the action stinks! The action scenes feel like little kids made them: no tactics, no strategy, people walking in a line without cover, ridiculous fight scenes. You feel it even stronger when Michael Jai White starts moving and you realize how pathetic everything was before that. Jax rules!<br><br>Anyway, it was a decent effort, with enough resources to make at least a good film, and with a lot more possible. Unfortunately, it isn't a decent movie: it's barely a 6.","user":"siderite","rank":[22,27]}]
