[{"title":"Wish for Christmas: Bad even for a Christmas film","rating":1,"date":"29 November 2018","review":"Wish for Christmas is a terrible festive movie in an ocean of already bad Christmas movies. Every year we see dozens of these low budget clones pounded out ready for television premieres but they aren't usually this bad.<br><br>Now the three words that tend to be used excessively and badly out of context are agenda, objectification and propaganda. I hate seeing them used in reviews because they usually aren't but conflict with a persons stance on something. I however for the first time will use one of them.<br><br>This is a propaganda film. It tells the story of a girl who not getting her own way makes a wish to make her Christian parents lose their faith. In doing so everything goes to hell (Pun intended and hilarious).<br><br>From there I'm sure you can work out exactly how the movie goes and I don't see how anyone could claim that isn't the definition of propaganda. I haven't seen a worse Christmas movie of this type since the embarassment that was Kirk Cameron Saves Christmas (2014).<br><br>Beyond that it's cheesy, poorly acted and the plot makes me hate this time of year more than ever.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Nope<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Cheesy<br><br>Dreadful acting from start to finish<br><br>Simply religious propaganda<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>Christmas movies need more Santa and less Jesus to be even remotely bearable<br><br>My wish for Christmas is a year without Christmas movies","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[26,37]},{"title":"Probably the worst Christmas movie ever","rating":1,"date":"18 December 2019","review":"1) Not all atheists are evil.\n2) Not all people who believe in god are nice people.\n3) If you agree with either of those statements you will find this film vomit-inducing, I certainly did.\n4) I wish you could rate a film zero","user":"alexdurrani","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Much Better Than Average Christmas Movie","rating":9,"date":"7 December 2018","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that it would be a shame to listen to religiously bigoted folks and miss this delightful movie. It may have elements slightly reminiscent of other films, but they are remotely similar, at most. A fabulous reminder that what the world truly needs all year long is less Santa and more Jesus. If you think that we're all here due to an illogically intricate bunch of cosmic randomness and genetic mistakes, you'll probably hate this movie. But if you're convinced there is eternal wisdom at work and it affects everyday life, enjoy!","user":"crvierra","rank":[11,20]}]
