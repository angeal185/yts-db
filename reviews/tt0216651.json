[{"title":"Maybe the best anime piece ever","rating":10,"date":"26 July 2004","review":"As we saw that Vampire Hunter D was high ranked on IMDb, we decided to give it a shot. Loaded up with some expectations, who comes naturally when a piece is placed good at IMDb, we enjoyed the movie from the very early beginning to the very end. I was astonished! At first, the whole piece is animated in a way that I really find attractive. I mean, not the regular ninja-banzai-anime-style, but instead this beautiful way of animating this alternative reality put up on your tv. I really like ancient stuff like vampires and more goth related stuff when it comes to animes, and this one got it all. With a terrific story the piece develops and bounds the viewer into the magic world of Vampire Hunter D. I just simply love it because of the vibe it gives me! A sober 10 out of 10, no doubts about it.","user":"scobbah","rank":[90,112]},{"title":"One of the greatest adult animated films ever","rating":10,"date":"15 July 2005","review":"Yoshiaki Kawajiri's style is so detailed, so precise, you just get the feeling that each frame of animation has been slaved over and perfected, making Vamp D Bloodlust the best showcase of his directorial style. Of course, the actual chara designs are by Yoshitaka Amano and here is perhaps the most accurate depiction of his unique style. The soundtrack also bears mentioning and is right up there with the Hollywood's best.<br><br>Story-wise, its an eclectic mixture of Gothic horror, Science fiction, Westerns and Samurai, apparently based on a novel I've never read. Its genre cannot be classified simply horror, and while there are plenty of great action scenes, the near-perfect pacing allows for quiet moments of conversation between the characters.<br><br>Its full of great moments, but the best is the climactic finale - absolutely unforgettable. A must-see, right up there with classics of anime such as Studio Ghibli's work...","user":"juubei-2","rank":[63,78]},{"title":"Perfect!","rating":10,"date":"4 April 2004","review":"Can there be a sequel better then the original? Yes there can, and this one proves it. Well worth the purchase even if you have to pay a bundle for shipment like I did. <br><br>I'm proud to add this fantastic piece of manga to my expanding collection. I'll put it right next to Mononoke Hime, Akira and Ghost in the Shell. This is a classic already and every manga/anime fan should watch it. All the characters are amazing and original, they could all get their own movie and I hope at least some of them do.<br><br>The style of drawing is rough and dark, yet elequent and beautifully detailed. No expense has been spared. D has been buffed up a bit and has more powers than ever. <br><br>This movie is exciting to the extreme. 1Â½ hours flies by. 10/10","user":"mGoLos","rank":[78,101]}]
