[{"title":"One of those times when I wish IMDb allowed a ZERO rating.","rating":1,"date":"27 October 2017","review":"This movie was so bad, it doesn't even warrant a review. However, I feel compelled to issue a warning. Seriously, it's bad and not bad in a way that may result in a cult classic but rather, bad in a way that you want to sue those responsible for wasting your time and money. <br><br>Bad acting, worse scripts, poor camera work, ridiculous special effects, and atrocious science (or anti-science).<br><br>Sorry, I have nothing to really say about the scenes except to say that within the first ten minutes, you will understand why I gave this a 1 rating. If your time is precious, stop after ten minutes because it doesn't improve.<br><br>There was absolutely no talent involved in the making of this movie. Even the title is stupid.","user":"connelly-shawn","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"GeoDisaster terrible movie, don't waste your time.","rating":2,"date":"14 October 2017","review":"The acting was terrible in GeoDisaster, at one part the teenage girl says, \"Mommy\" and all I can say is most of the parts are cheesy. The special effects are terrible and look fake. <br><br>Probably one of the worst movies we have seen in a long time. Don't see this movie, there are other new releases out there that are worth watching. We saw Happy Death Day last Friday, it was awesome. \"It\" was good and if you like movies about faith go see \"The Power of Faith.\"","user":"kimberlymurray00","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"Tedious characters","rating":4,"date":"26 October 2017","review":"Nothing ruins an action movie more, than whiny teenagers who are self centred, selfish, shallow and thoroughly pathetic. A teenage girl who whines because she has to tear off the sleeve of her shirt to stop the bleeding of a badly injured person should be killed off in the first scene.<br><br>The makeup was not good,unless the actress who played the doctor at the observatory looks like a goulish crypt creeper......and THAT was before the devastation started.","user":"hilary_mae-912-80561","rank":[11,13]}]
