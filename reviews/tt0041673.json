[{"title":"An Auspicious Debut for Dean and Jerry (But Also Strange)","rating":3,"date":"3 August 2005","review":"This is a strange little comedy in which the appearances of Dean and Jerry almost seem an afterthought. \"My Friend Irma\" was already a successful radio comedy featuring the brilliant Marie Wilson. Marie played a hard core scatterbrain who had a knack for getting herself into and out of trouble. When it was decided to bring Irma to the big screen, I think Paramount decided to hedge their bets by including Dean and Jerry. This unlikely trio of comedians seems occasionally at odds struggling for whatever laughs might exist in this thin script. But there are some definite highlights for all of them, and the climax presents a bizarre commentary on how much the effects of consumerism had absorbed the American culture just a few years after World War II. The dippy Irma wins a radio contest by accident, and the last scene milks every last ounce of joke material out of the fact that she has been rewarded with a mountain of expensive presents.","user":"russellkishi","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Martin & Lewis is the reason My Friend Irma is still in circulation today","rating":7,"date":"16 August 2011","review":"Just rewatched this film which marked the debut of the comedy team of Dean Martin &amp; Jerry Lewis on YouTube. They're shoehorned almost awkwardly into it since this movie was based on a popular radio sitcom about a young woman named Jane Stacy (Diana Lynn) who's trying to snag a rich guy named Rhinelander (Don DeFore) by working as his secretary and having to deal with her scatterbrained roommate Irma Peterson (Marie Wilson) and her con artist boyfriend Al (John Lund). Martin &amp; Lewis are a couple of orange juice stand employees named Steve and Seymour who's discovered by Irma and Al as Steve sings a little something there. Despite many contrivances, the way Jane and Irma seem to fit certain stereotypes of women at the time, and the fact that Irma cries constantly whenever she realizes when it's her fault, this was quite funny especially whenever Lewis is on screen. And Martin shows just how appealing a crooner he was though I'm sure even then some thought he was just a Bing Crosby imitator. The cast as a whole manages to make the somewhat slight material go down easy. In fact, one of my favorite lines comes from a bit player named Hans Conried who says of Irma and Jane, \"One with her head in the air and the other with air in her head.\" So on that note, My Friend Irma is worth a look for comedy fans especially that of Dean &amp; Jerry.","user":"tavm","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Great martin and lewis beginning...","rating":14,"date":"14 May 2003","review":"This is one of my 2nd favorite Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin movies the only one that is better is The Caddy. This movie was also the first of D/M &amp; J/L that I had ever seen. It's quiet little movie but with so many good songs and lots and lots of great laughs by Jerry and a couple of laughs from Irma. This comes highly recommended by me and I hope that you see it after you've read my comment. 9/10","user":"ajohns1","rank":[12,17]}]
