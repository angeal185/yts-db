[{"title":"Nothing fun about BatmanFunReviews","rating":30,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"I haven't viewed this movie yet but it is recognized with WINNING multiple awards over multiple categories. I will see it one day soon.<br><br>Regardless, I wanted to talk about this so-called reviewer BatmanFunReviews who gives absolutely every review s/he writes as 1/10, but then give many HBO First Look shows mostly 10/10. Huh?<br><br>You have to wonder why this fool would watch dozens of movies that s/he decides are only worth 1/10. Must have a lot of free time (and much frustration).<br><br>Hey Batman, what happened to the \"...great responsibility\"?!","user":"imdbi-degaite","rank":[11,25]},{"title":"Great great great!!!","rating":10,"date":"23 December 2018","review":"Real topic in this movie. Every adult should watch. I like it. It doesn't have bunch of pink and rainbows, it has real thing in it.","user":"mazetastan","rank":[3,9]},{"title":"Depicts an America of old.","rating":8,"date":"22 December 2019","review":"This film is a very good fairy tale. The characters were quite rounded and the writing is excellent. You get very invested in the story very quickly. I was certainly drawn in.<br><br>Spoiler alert after this point:<br><br>The end was the part I found to be a cop out and not realistic at all. In today's America there would be no happy ending. The girl would have gone to detention and been raped and abused there until she was deported back to her impoverished country. The boy would have been unceremoniously dumped into Mexico to become a victim of gangs and there would not be one chance in hell that he would be able to return to the USA to go to university. There would also not be any sort of a decent chance that lawyers would take this case on pro bono or even on spec and I am skeptical of there even being a judge that would be as fair as this one. The rich people would win. They have money for better lawyers.<br><br>As much as it was nice to see justice done in the film, I really think that Americans need to see what the reality is in order for them to understand what crimes are being perpetrated against good honest innocent people every single day.<br><br>I read about one of those crimes just TODAY. <br><br>I would love to see more films being made about \"illegals\" and how they are NOT harmful to the country. About how they are being scapegoated by the ultra rich in order to deflect blame for the unconscionable wealth gap in America.","user":"thyrza-610-920510","rank":[0,2]}]
