[{"title":"Wow","rating":1,"date":"6 March 2019","review":"I didn't know they started making mainstream movies that try to be pornography so hard. Acting is horrible, first 20 minutes or so are us watching strippers who don't seem to ever actually do the one job they have. The directing has me wondering if there was one, the story doesn't seem to want to materialize.

Could you imagine women in swimsuits fighting to the death online... millions of views. Scary!<br><br>It's not Fight Club but didn't have those expectations going in. If looking for some weekend entertainment watch Kiss Kiss.. women are hot and Gibson is dark!","user":"hughesmafia","rank":[11,20]},{"title":"Wow. Bad. Really Really Bad","rating":1,"date":"12 March 2019","review":"This is Cinemax After Dark soft core porn with some of the worst acting you will ever witness.<br><br>There is nothing interesting in this movie. The chicks are all like mma fighters which means they have way too many muscle to be attractive.<br><br>Keep looking.","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[9,19]}]
