[{"title":"Id like to interview those that gave this 9/10","rating":3,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"The story has merit with some potential, however the acting is terrible, the entire cast needs to head over to their nearest drama school and get some lessons, I've seen Vlogs with better acting skills than this.","user":"mr_iceman","rank":[15,21]},{"title":"Not a Hollywood movie, but a good film in terms of AusFilm","rating":6,"date":"23 October 2019","review":"Loved the first one, great gritty Aussie crime film, Was one of the breakout movies for Firass Dirani as well. This one follows on obviously but like a majority of sequels it's not as great, in saying that it's a decent crime plot. Acting is up to Australian low budget film standard so not much can really be expected.<br><br>6-10 for overall film, but in terms of Aussie film I'd give it an 7-8/10","user":"travis_hates_martin","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Solid Film","rating":8,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"This film explores topics which are currently affecting today's society, particularly in the Western Suburbs of Sydney.<br><br>Most, who are oblivious to what is actually going on around them; or refuse to accept the truth about what has become socially acceptable in today's society rather, are part of the problem, which try to brush the issue under the carpet and stick their heads in the sand rather than addressing it.\nSadly, those types of people are the ones more prone in leaving negative reviews for a raw film such as this and attacking honest reviewers.<br><br>This film depicts the issue of racism, and crime and wether you like it or not, it's a real issue and it happens. Irrespective of the fact that we are entering 2020 and should have by now moved past exterior differences, which we have no control over, we (as a society) are in fact standing still, and allowing this behaviour to continue. While the rest of us are just surviving, through racism, criminal activity, stigma, segregation and other issues.<br><br>It's one thing to acknowledge that this behaviour exists, it is another thing to acknowledge that you yourself are an instrument of that behaviour.","user":"miz_maya","rank":[3,4]}]
