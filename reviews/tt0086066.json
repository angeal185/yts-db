[{"title":"Don't worry about the critics, it's a classic now!!!","rating":12,"date":"12 July 2004","review":"This lovely film was universally trashed and smashed by all the critics. FF Coppola directed it, but they still smashed it. I don't get that.<br><br>\nThe then unknown cast was: Patrick Swayze, Matt Dillon, C. Thomas Howell, Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, and Leif Garrett. All these actors went on to fame, but the whole movie, the performances, the writing, were trashed.<br><br>I thought the cinematography was exceptionally lovely. The \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\" sunrise scene was gorgeous. The camera angles during the hair cutting scenes were creative and intimate. The music was \"epic\" sounding, yeah, but this film had a huge tie in with Gone With The Wind, remember. I thought the soft lighting and the creamy edging made the film look very much like IT was filmed in 1939!!!<br><br>I don't know. I thought the chracters were very engaging and the performances excellent. Lots of people loved this film, regular people like myself, that is.","user":"PeachHamBeach","rank":[167,215]},{"title":"Great Movie and Accurate Adaptation","rating":10,"date":"6 March 2005","review":"I had to read the book in seventh grade and we also watched the movie. I though both of them were fabulous. Francis Ford Coppola has adapted almost every detail of the book into this movie. I thought the acting was great and the plot was good for teenagers, which is the movie's, as well as the book's, target audience. I was surprised on how many stars were in this movie (seven) and it was much better than I thought it would be. It didn't seem cheesy and small but you felt like you were watching a real film. Even though the Greasers seem to be born into undesirable lives, watching this movie makes you want to go back to 1967 in the Southwest and be a Greaser, too. Fabulous movie and perfect for teenagers.","user":"gracegibson","rank":[115,155]},{"title":"When trouble finds you, don't back down.","rating":4,"date":"4 June 2000","review":"A gem from Francis Ford Coppola based on S.E. Hinton's novel. Teenage gang members in a mid 60's Oklahoma town become involved in murder, leading to tragic consequences for all concerned. Filmed mostly in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with a very impressive list of young actors on their way to stardom.<br><br>The cast includes Matt Dillon, Patrick Swayze, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise. Also featured are Emilio Estevez, Diane Lane, C. Thomas Howell, Gailard Sartain and Ralph Macchio.<br><br>A coming of age movie that packs a punch. Very much worth your time.","user":"michaelRokeefe","rank":[117,160]}]
