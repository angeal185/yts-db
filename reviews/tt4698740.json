[{"title":"Not the usual romance","rating":7,"date":"10 January 2020","review":"This movie is more real than most Hallmark movies. It is about what real people do in weak moments or when they have given and given but felt like they were betrayed. These are not perfect people, and some might argue (reviewers have argued) that they are not very nice people. That's the point. The point is not to criticize their flaws but to see what could be, what might be, maybe what should be.<br><br>There's a scene late in the movie where Abby makes a mistake that really isn't all her fault. All the repairing of the relationship seems to fall apart and that's reality too.<br><br>This isn't the most entertaining Hallmark movie I've seen, but the story is totally unlike 99% of their stories. The subject matter makes it worth watching through to the end.<br><br>Karen Kingsbury writes a lot of Christian stories and there are references to God in this movie but they are not overpowering or particularly preachy at least in terms of religion. There is some preaching in terms of fidelity and family.","user":"Jackbv123","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Emotional Hallmark","rating":9,"date":"8 November 2017","review":"One of the best from Hallmark movies. Rekindling a romance is one of my favorite plots both in books and movies and Karen Kingsbury is one of my favorite romance authors. the story is very emotional and a lot of couples could relate to. The two leading actors were great, Jennie Garth was so convincing, and Dan Payne is one of a few Hallmark stars that have the needed chemistry for his roles. Hallmark doesn't always get it right, but this was one of these few times they did. I watched it more than once.","user":"crystal-viola45","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Omg","rating":27,"date":"27 July 2016","review":"Okay so Jennie Garth is so so unhappy being married to a wonderful man who is handsome and bright but wears sweatpants and sweatshirts... Poor. This woman is so annoying. If she smiled once in the first hour her face would have cracked. Miserable to be around and if I were her daughter I'd say HEY MOM for goodness sake smile. What is with those kids anyway? They can't see misery in that woman's face and the attitude she's throwing off? Give me a break. The doom and gloom of mom is enough to turn the channel. I felt bad for the husband John who didn't have a clue . He's better off divorcing that sour puss and hooking up with the red head.","user":"bronxgirlcl","rank":[10,24]}]
