[{"title":"A fascinating and occasionally frustrating exploration of loneliness","rating":7,"date":"28 April 2015","review":"First off, I have to applaud the bravery of the western men and eastern European women who agreed to be filmed during their search for a partner. It can't have been easy, knowing how they risked appearing to an audience. <br><br>That aside, I think the stars of this documentary would be the first to agree that something has gone wrong in their lives that they have resorted to such unorthodox measures. Understanding the desperation and deep loneliness of the men is key to understanding how they can be deceived by both themselves and the morally bankrupt businesses and individuals that exploit that loneliness for their own aims. The documentary-makers sympathetically but astutely expose these issues, through uncompromising filming and pertinent interview questions. <br><br>The question the interviewers keep returning to - what is love - is a thought-provoking one that perhaps has no satisfactory answer. I'd suggest that the men asked in the documentary revealed the extent of their disconnection from reality and self-deception with their naive and romantic answers. While viewers may not be able to say what love is by the end of the documentary, I think they'll be more confident in saying what love isn't.","user":"YouAreNotTheGuy","rank":[52,58]},{"title":"Nice Film","rating":15,"date":"15 May 2016","review":"One reviewer stated that the entire purpose of this film was to expose what a scam the entire \"mail order bride\" industry was. I completely disagree. I think the point of the movie was to explore and show the different experiences and motives of the men and women using these services, which it did quite well. Some of these men seemed to have unrealistic expectations, looking for a super model type wife even though they themselves were overweight and older, but a couple seemed very genuine and sincere in their search to connect with someone. It was disheartening to see one man who was outright scammed and misled by a woman, and two more who were likely scammed. Two of the couples do get married, and the bond between one of them is quite evident and they seemed very genuine and in love--it was cute to watch them. The nicest thing about this film is that it shows the honest perspectives of both sides and even some of the parents, and it's very nice that it follows the story for quite some time (at least a year, if not more--I didn't keep track) to show how some of the relationships didn't work out while others seemed to get better.","user":"anatisfairywheel","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Loved It!","rating":8,"date":"26 December 2015","review":"BE WARNED - SPOILERS<br><br>This is an excellent exploration of a misunderstood concept. Mail order brides conjures up a lot of stereotypes. This film shows that it's not necessarily what we think it is. It follows 6 men to the Ukraine and shows the very different experiences each man has in trying to find a wife.<br><br>Of the six, Bobby was perhaps the saddest. His desperation oozed out of him like pus. It was just palpable and he was, perhaps, the most unrealistic of the group. Ron, while being something of a jerk, was realistic. Robert was my favorite because he seemed to be looking for love and was fine with it if it didn't work out. It did in a big way for him though :)<br><br>Michael - he was a creep through and through and so very unrealistic and delusional, it was almost shocking the lack of self-awareness.<br><br>The documentary shows both sides of the story - the perspective of the men and the women. It's fascinating and absolutely worth seeing.","user":"shelleyn76","rank":[9,10]}]
