[{"title":"Funny And Influential","rating":9,"date":"9 January 2000","review":"A great ensemble cast, a loose, funky script that left room for improvisation and a great (nonstop) pulsating disco/soul soundtrack make this film a pleasant diversion and definitely a document of its' era. It also served as a blueprint for many other primarily black-cast comedies to come.  When writing 1997's \"Friday,\"  Ice Cube was quoted as saying he wanted to create a fun film just like \"Car Wash.\"  Many funny scenes, some in questionable taste, but still harmless enough.  For those who lived through the period, it'll bring back some memories.","user":"G-Man-25","rank":[28,30]},{"title":"It might not be Hamlet but It's a Classic","rating":6,"date":"6 December 2000","review":"I am only 21 years old and have lived in New Jersey all of my life. I never experienced the 1970's nor have I been lucky enough to live in southern California. This movie gives me the best of both worlds, to me this movie represents southern California during the 1970's as it truly is meant to be. It's not about young rich white guys going surfing, or the limelight of Hollywood it just shows you a common everyday struggle of a man trying to make an honest buck in sunny southern California in the 1970's. The movie uses both humor and realism to make it's point.   One thing that is a mystery to me about this movie is that for some reason as time has passed Danny Devito's role in the movie has vanished. A great movie that will stand the test of time!","user":"ndimeo","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Disc -o dance!!","rating":10,"date":"4 December 2006","review":"The first time I saw this movie I laughed so hard my stomach hurt. My family had owned a car wash, detail company before and I could see that the writer of this movie had done his respective homework on the character development!! The motley crew that we had employed, were just about in the exact same 'vein' of life as these, 'cons' 'crazy men' and 'criminals' that made up the perfect cast in 'Carwash'! I loved this for simple reasons, it simply hit right on it.<br><br>Sully Boyer, the car-wash owner was a perfectly in place, dis-placed business owner, complete with bad marriage and regrets of owning the wash and not making it a parking lot, like his brother, who could now buy and sell him. There was T.C. (Theodore Chancey Talcott)played by Franklin Ajaye, who's 'hook' in the story was he was imagining that he would be a super hero, named 'The Fly'. \"I'd be sharp, sharp, sharp, man. No one would mess with me.\" Standing with Lloyd by the rag sinks. But he was also in love with Mona. The fine foxy broad who worked at the caf√©, 'Five Spot'. With the whole 'dryer line' to dry the cars as they pulled out from the washing area. The Mexican worker who would harass his Indian friend and back and forth it would go, all the while on the clock! The fighting couple with the classic Mustang to the hippie Jewish kid, well versed in ghetto speak. This movie had it all. Enter Richard Pryor, as the fast-talking money grabbing Rev. Daddy Rich. accompanied by the Pointer sisters! Hilarious!! The more I watch this the more astounded I am at how true to life and form these characters interact with one another. <br><br>Even an ending that was serious enough, to put a well-rounded effect on the out come of the plot and m.o. of the players. It showed, Loni cared about a young upstart punk, enough to see more in him than he himself(Ackbar-'Duane')could see for himself. Loni(Ivan Dixon's character)simply believed in Duane. That was what Duane needed to not end up in prison. He needed someone to believe in him, not use him to rob a company and go straight to prison.<br><br>I recommend this highly to those who love the seventies, a great comedic 'everyday' work-situation and doesn't necessarily need car chases or explosions, special effects etc. Bravo.
