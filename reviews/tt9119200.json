[{"title":"Ok first part then formula","rating":5,"date":"9 April 2020","review":"A warning about posting pictures on Instagram or Facebook is quite good. But the birth mother coming to get her daughter thing is done to death on Lifetime.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Just Terrible and Superficial!","rating":1,"date":"4 April 2020","review":"The movie did not have a logical medical basis.\nThey have described the biological mother as someone with psychosis and severe mental problems. But she did not show such symptoms and she was basically looking to reunite with her missing daughter. Murders could also be attributed to the rage within her, since her daughter has been taken away from her by force.\nAdditionally, the way her address was found through social media was very funny. No one gives her address over there, especially if they want to be out of reach.","user":"amir_vf","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"realistic and good topic","rating":5,"date":"8 March 2020","review":"I liked this movie for having a good topic and presenting it in a realistic way. The story looks serious and real enough. It's all about relationships, family and health issues. This movie shows us how everyone can get angry, sick, and become a criminal. Actors look like real characters from real life, for example daughter looks like typical daughter, mommy like typical mommy, employee like typical employee, policeman like typical policeman, and psychiatrist like typical psychiatrist. Also unlike in worse movie this one at least got police and more places and characters involved. Better than those movies like Hushed that show only one place and very few characters. Locations look convincing and real. But except looking real and good topic, actors and acting still look amateur, no depth in actions, mystery, emotions. Can't be compared to CSI series. Maybe good movie for kids and women only, as it is not harsh.","user":"asocialis","rank":[0,0]}]
