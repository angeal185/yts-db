[{"title":"Hope Maia Mitchell's back is ok after carrying the entire cast throughout this movie","rating":2,"date":"5 May 2019","review":"Maia Mitchell was her typical self. Great acting. The rest of the cast was beyond terrible. At times it was hard to watch. The writers don't know teens at all. I'm a 22 year old grad student (definitely not a teen), yet I felt my eyes rolling into the back of my head over how out of touch this script was. It was like how a nerdy 35 year old man would write a movie about what he thinks the cool kids were like in high school. If I hadn't drank an entire bottle of wine while watching it, it would've been unbearable.","user":"salturner-62564","rank":[75,88]},{"title":"The worst of this movie is how old actors are","rating":2,"date":"5 May 2019","review":"How are we supposed to believe these kids are in senior high school years when most look like they are 30?!!<br><br>Seriously, besides a terrible plot with boring characters, every one of these actors are oks enough to be out college, let alone high school.<br><br>The producers would've done much better picking younger cast (19-22 YO's), but picking these 27 YOs and have them deliver lines about what to do after high school is just cringy.","user":"cmeneses-74957","rank":[28,32]},{"title":"Cringe!","rating":1,"date":"5 May 2019","review":"This was one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Bad acting, bad script, just scenes cut and thrown together which don't make any sense.","user":"untrustus","rank":[43,53]}]
