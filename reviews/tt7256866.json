[{"title":"Ignore the bad reviews. I'm glad I did","rating":8,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"This is my first review. I felt I had to give this movie some love with all the hate it was getting. People are so harsh these days... I almost didn't watch the movie due to the low rating and bad reviews. My wife and I decided to give it a try anyway. We went into it with zero expectations and ended up laughing quite a bit. We were both surprised at how much we ended up liking the movie. It's full of stupid-funny humor. I wouldn't pay to see it, but it was great for popcorn on the couch at home.","user":"mikegtk","rank":[74,107]},{"title":"Not that bad","rating":7,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"I almost didn't watch thsi because of the bad reviews. I am glad I did. Yes the movie is stupid but that's what makes it funny. I had a really good time watching this. Would have been even better if I were stoned though.","user":"arihiza","rank":[38,57]},{"title":"Not bad compared to recent comedies","rating":6,"date":"22 July 2018","review":"A 6/10 for a comedy is ok in my book. Still doesn't have replay value but I'm happy to watch a comedy in this era that doesn't involve the plot line of everyone getting hammered or partying. It fell short but not a garbage movie.","user":"kylekj-49868","rank":[16,22]}]
