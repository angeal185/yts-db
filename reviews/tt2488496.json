[{"title":"A Rerun With A Continuity Gap","rating":3,"date":"2 December 2018","review":"I am not the world's biggest Star Wars fan, but I have watched the old episode 6 (and the 2 before it). Star Wars: The Force Awakens is number 7, but in number 6 Leia, Luke and her resistance rebels were victorious. In this film they are again rebels and just have one base again and so forth. What is going on here?\nThe scenes are borrowed, but the acting is inferior also.\nI am writing this and becoming confused. What happened?","user":"jen-foller","rank":[423,530]},{"title":"Jar Jar Abrams Never Watched Star Wars Before","rating":16,"date":"16 June 2019","review":"Or he would know that the rebels won in Episode VI!<br><br>This is the Worst Star Wars-related show so far<br><br>I hate every scene of this reboot, there is always a joke, it does bore even if it says \"Star Wars.\" This remake is the reason why I don't drive to the cinemaanymore, it reflects the era very well unfortunately. I hope they cancel Star Wars and let it recover from the emarassment for years.","user":"sufyanmesiah","rank":[254,314]},{"title":"Too Many Jokes","rating":3,"date":"4 December 2018","review":"Disney has subverted Star Wars into one of its lame and boring childish films aimed at selling toys to preteens. I am sure McDonalds was poisoning more people than ever before by hawking Star Wars toys from Disney.\nNot a film for adults.","user":"hiromi_tsubetae","rank":[444,559]}]
