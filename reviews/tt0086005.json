[{"title":"Never Cry Wolf portrays elements of wilderness most of us are oblivious to, silence and melancholy.","rating":10,"date":"16 December 2001","review":"I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it over 15 years ago. But as I have read through numerous reviews,  I find them missing a few elements that make this movie so wonderful.<br><br>There are two subtle elements of wilderness, that unless you have experienced them, you will probably miss in the movie, silence and melancholy.<br><br>When one experience solitude and wilderness as Tyler does,  the first thing you notice is the  silence that surrounds you.  The only noises that can be heard are the ones you make, and simple actions like scratching your hand, striking a match, or the rustle of  your nylon parka as you simply move all become a symphony of noises you never noticed before.<br><br>The director, Carroll Ballard,  takes great pains to illustrate this in the beginning of the movie( knowing all the while most viewers will miss these subtleties)  as Tyler is left on the a frozen lake with all his gear strewn about.  Rosie  guns the engine to his plane for the third time and finally gets to takes off.  The sound of that single engine plane is deafening and overpowers everything within 25 miles, but the silence Tyler is left with as the last throb of the plane's engine disappears in the distance is even more so. All of Tyler's actions at this point center around the noise they make. Notice this when you watch.<br><br>The next element of wilderness and solitude  the director so painstakingly portrays is melancholy.  There is no better way to describe it. Melancholy is an intangible, an emotion, yet for any who have experienced wilderness on the level that Tyler does knows how overwhelmingly real it is. It is palpable. The melancholy not only comes from within but comes from all around.  It is an element of wilderness that is there even if man is not.<br><br>The scene that best depicts this melancholy is when Tyler is out sitting on the rock, alone, with only creatures of the tundra to keep him company. It is twilight.  His hair and glasses are wet from an earlier snow, and he sits and plays his oboe.  Not a song but a phrase, an echoing phrase that sings out  his loneliness to the empty expanse.  And off in the distance is a kindred reply, the howl of a lone wolf, a cry that says I know, I understand.<br><br>Never Cry Wolf is a tremendous film and is equally underrated.  In one sense it is a master piece, one that will never receive mass appeal or recognition.  It speaks to us on multiple levels and with subtle intensity, but  unfortunately most of us  aren't able to hear the message.","user":"rstubblefield","rank":[82,86]},{"title":"A haunting masterpiece that will move you","rating":10,"date":"3 November 2001","review":"I remember when this movie came out I had no interest in seeing it. I thought it was a Disney kid's movie and basically forgot about it for years. About a year ago I caught it one night on cable and began to watch it. I immediately knew that I was seeing a great film, it was obvious within 5 minutes. Since I caught it in the middle and had missed the beginning, I decided to not ruin it and I turned it off with the idea of renting it the very next day, which I did.<br><br>\"Never Cry Wolf\" is a beautiful and breathtaking film about a biologist who travels alone to an extremely remote part of The Yukon in order to live with white wolves, and study their behavior. Charles Martin Smith, who I've always felt is an under-rated actor (see \"The Untouchables\" and \"Starman\") gives an unforgettable performance. The cinematography is spectacular, the music is superb, and the message is subtle and haunting.<br><br>One of those rare films that can easily be rewarding for adults and kids. \"Never Cry Wolf\" is a true classic in every sense of the word, I would give it a 10 out of 10 and I do not throw the \"classic\" word around lightly. Do not miss this film.","user":"thirdi","rank":[63,66]},{"title":"Fine fictionalized documentary ahead of its time","rating":8,"date":"28 July 2002","review":"This fictionalization of the Farley Mowat book about his Arctic adventures studying wolves is amazingly enough perhaps the most controversial film Disney studios ever made. How sad is that? The reasons for the controversy would seem minor: first, the movie is not entirely true to Mowat's book; two, it's lightly plotted; and three, a man is seen running around naked in the tundra. To which I say, so what? so what? and gee, how offensive. (Maybe they should have clothed the wolves.)<br><br>The latter complaint is the major reason for all the ranting by some \"reviewers.\" To them a Disney film showing human nakedness seems a sacrilege and they want their bowdlerized world returned to them, and they want Disney censured and made to promise never to do anything like that again! The complaint that there wasn't enough tension in the film is also off base since this is a contemplative, even spiritual film, not a slick thriller. People with sound-bite attention spans who need to mainline exploding cars and ripped flesh to keep them interested need not apply.<br><br>The criticism that Director Carroll Ballard's film is not entirely true to the book is legitimate, but I would point out that movies are seldom if ever entirely true to their source material. A film is one kind of media with its particular demands while a book is another. It is impossible to completely translate a book into a movie. Something is always inevitably lost, but something is often gained. Here the cinematography and the beautiful musical score by Mark Isham are fine compensations.<br><br>The acting by Charles Martin Smith as \"Tyler\" (Farley Mowat) and Brian Dennehy as Rosie, the exploitive redneck bushpilot, and Samason Jorah as Mike the compromised Inuit (who sells wolf skins for dentures) and especially Zachary Ittimangnaq as Ootek, the quiet, wise man of the north are also pluses. Note how compactly the main issues of the film are exemplified in these four characters. Indeed, what this film is about is the dying of a way of life, not just that of the wolves, but of the Inuit people themselves who are losing their land and their resources while their young people are being seduced away from what is real and true and time-honored for the glittering trinkets of the postmodern world. This is a story of impending loss and it is as melancholy as the cold autumn wind that blows across the tundra.<br><br>What I think elevates this above most nature films is first the intense sense of what it would be like for a lower forty-eight kind of guy to survive in a most inhospitable wilderness, and second the witty presentation of some of the scenes. Ballard works hard to make sure we understand that it is cold, very cold and desolate and that there are dangers of exposure and weather and just plain loss of perspective that have killed many a would-be adventurer and might very well kill Tyler. I think it was entirely right that near the end of the film we get the sense that Tyler is going off the deep end emotionally, that the majestic and profoundly melancholy experience has been too much for him.<br><br>Tyler begins as a greenhorn biologist dropped alone onto a frozen lake amid snow covered mountains rising in the distance so that we can see immediately how puny he is within this incredibly harsh vastness. The following scene when Ootek finds him and leaves him and he chases Ootek until he drops, and then Ootek saves him, gives him shelter, and leaves again without a word, was just beautiful. And the scenes with the \"mice\" and running naked among the caribou and teaching Ootek to juggle were delightful. The territorial marking scene was apt and witty and tastefully done. (At least, I don't think the wolves were offended.)<br><br>This movie was not perfect, however. For one thing, those were not \"mice\" that Tyler found his tent infested with. I suspect they were lemmings posing for the cameras. Those who have seen the film about the making of this movie undoubtedly know what they were; please advise me if you do. Also the \"interior\" of Tyler's tent was way too big to fit into the tent as displayed. Also it would be important from a nutritional point of view for Tyler to eat the \"mice\" raw as the wolves did! (The actual creatures that Mowat ate I assume were mice.) If Tyler had to exist purely on roasted and boiled rodent for many months, he would encounter some nutritional deficiencies. Still, eating a diet of the whole, uncooked mouse would be sustaining whereas a diet of lean meat only would not. (Add blubber and internal organs for an all-meat diet to work.) Incidentally, the Inuit people get their vitamin C from blubber and the contents of the stomachs of the animals they kill.<br><br>Where were the mosquitos and the biting flies that the tundra is infamous for?<br><br>Since this movie appeared almost twenty years ago, the public image of the wolf has greatly improved and wolves have been reintroduced to Yellowstone Park. I think everybody in this fine production can take some credit for that.<br><br>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)","user":"DeeNine-2","rank":[54,61]}]
