[{"title":"Where Blade Runner feared to tread","rating":21,"date":"21 April 1999","review":"I watched Safe for our coverage of 1980s's health movements and the AIDS virus with a special eye for the conflict between New Age healers and \"the medical profession.\"  Safe connects so well with both; although there's no real homosexuality anxieties in the film, AIDS seem the unconquerable illness penetrating the lives of happy suburban people.<br><br>First of all, Julianne Moore is absent in the film.  Her character, Carol White, is a model, rich California suburban housewife.  We notice how absent she is from the moment that sex with her husband produces nothing in her, but she goes through the motions of kissing him and petting him afterwards.  She has mechanical conversations with friends, with mother, with cleaning lady in her ultramodern, lush, carpeted, fashionably lit house with gardens surrounding it and police patrol by night.  She goes to her workouts, cleaners, and arranges furniture.<br><br>This is a really tragic film.  It's also brilliantly shot, edited, acted, and its sets are so appropriate.  The use of teal and sky blue becomes numbing, anesthetizing in Carol's home, as does the harsh lighting of the doctor's office and the hospital.  The Wrenwood Center itself resembles where Deckard would have gone at the end of Blade Runner as the orig. end credits seemed to indicate: mountains and nature as an antidote to the city.<br><br>However, it's not URBAN life that seems to be killing Carol- it's SUBURBAN life, it's Northern California, it's fruit diets, mini-malls, 80s music playing in health clubs, housewifes, gardens, pools, teal green couches, endless lines of cars, power lines, and street lights.  It's dismal, and her family life is no big help having no real life to it.<br><br>At one point, in a really wrenching scene, Carol cries, looks at Greg from the bed and asks \"Where am I?  Right now?\"  He responds flatly but tenderly, \"You're in Carol and Greg's house.\"  She only cries more.<br><br>The question is: what is really wrong with Carol White?  Did she succumb to depression and make herself a psychosomatic illness?  Is she really sick and dying?  Is she just afraid of living?  It seems to me the more that Carol is told that she is the only one with the power to cure herself, the less power she seems to have.  The final monologue where she stands in front of the group and discusses how far she's come is inarticulate, random, unthought, and not a good sign.<br><br>The acting is done well for its purposes, especially by Peter Dunn, the leader.  He creates an interesting portrait of a man who is so determined to be a victim that he's created people who are dependent on him.  Peter is the only dynamic presence in the film, but even he wants peace, love, and tranquility in our hearts.  That doesn't seem to feed Carol.<br><br>This film reminded me of Koyaanisqatsi, visions of emptiness and life out of balance.  Carol looks out her car window at the highways and powerlines and headlights, and she reminded me of someone watching that film, fearing technology.  Yet even retreating from technology is not an ALTERNATIVE: it's a sign of defeat, isn't it?<br><br>The film doesn't offer solutions- only one of the most frightening, eerie, and numbing indictments of suburbia and the New Age that I have ever seen.  It puts its images, sets, sounds, actors into a collective vision of decay, expressed through the decline of the model suburban housewife.  See it, but don't look for answers or happy endings.","user":"DannyBoy-17","rank":[95,109]},{"title":"How not to survive in a crass, contagious, consumer prison...","rating":7,"date":"17 December 2006","review":"Julianne Moore is one of my favorite actresses and that's the reason I decided to watch this one.<br><br>This film is labeled as Drama/Thriller. Well, the drama's here, no doubt, as Carol White (Moore) slowly begins to succumb to the multiple effects of all types of pollution that pervade our technocratic consumer societies. There's psychological drama also as her husband, Greg (Xander Berkeley) tries to come to some understanding about Carol and how his marriage seems to be slowly disintegrating. And, there's drama also when Carol reacts violently to various chemicals, such that she is hospitalized and undergoes a battery of tests...<br><br>But... Thriller? Not at all, not by a long shot.<br><br>This is something better than mere thrills  at one level, it's a modern horror story that we are all living, because we are all part of this petrochemical world that we cannot reasonably escape. At another level, it's also the horror that results when a person decides to dislocate from the polluted world we all live in and construct another world within the mind. The end result of such an act is usually madness... eventually.<br><br>Beautifully acted by all the players, so that it seems that they aren't acting; it is, after all, all too real, is it not? The musical background is simply stunning  brooding, dark, menacing, and reminiscent of a David Lynch soundtrack. Visually, for the first half, you are battered with repetitive images of unending lines of traffic, excessive noise, mindless activities, rampant consumerism  all designed to reflect the battered mind and body of Carol as she struggles to determine her future in a world that is increasingly threatening.<br><br>How she does that forms the second half. Does she succeed? I could say Yes and No, but I'll leave it up to you to decide when you see it. Enjoy...if you can!","user":"RJBurke1942","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Gripping - with a masterful performance from Julianne Moore","rating":9,"date":"24 June 2003","review":"'Safe' is enigmatic, anxious, bewildering and captivating. It will divide viewers, but I argue that this is the hallmark of all true art. You will either love it or hate it, you will either get it or you won't. But it won't leave you indifferent.<br><br>Julianne Moore plays Carol White, the film's childlike protagonist with a phenomenal skill. In the hands of a more showy, ostentatious actress, Carol's 'illness' could have appeared trivial, her character, flighty, whiny and irritating. In the hands of Julianne Moore who is, in my opinion, the most intelligent, thoughtful and captivating actress working today, Carol's predicament is moving amd her character endearing. Her performance truly is astonishing. Never does she feel the need to overact, to emphasise Carol's confusion or her fear. She plays her with a childlike acceptance, a surface simplicity and a sing-songy girlish voice, and she is a master of restraint, implication, understatement. I have yet to see a more impressive performance from an actress whose skill lies in making it appear like she is doing very little, when really there is a huge amount going on underneath the surface. The film would be worth it for Julianne Moore alone, but it also has other things to reccommend it.<br><br>There's the excellent direction from the genius, Todd Haynes. His mainstream hit, the wonderful homage to Sirk 'Far From Heaven' catapulted Haynes into the mainstream, but I find this work even more affecting. Haynes is a genius at utilising the mise-en-scene for the maximum effect. He uses his camera as a painter would with colour - each shot is masterfully composed, with the director never allowing us to get too close to Julianne Moore's character, making her predicament all the more confusing and alienating. This is a film which demands thought and concentration, and what you take from it will depend upon individual disposition and experience.<br><br>The dialogue is generally sparse and quite functional, meaning that emphasis is placed onto the menacing soundtrack (giving the film a horror/thriller feel), the meticulously orchestrated mise-en-scene and, of course, the amazing nuances and depth of Julianne Moore's artistic gifts. In terms of what the film is trying to say, there is a real sense of satire in the second section of the film (When Carol goes to the commune to be 'cured') but there is no insistence upon one single message. This is reflected with a deeply ambiguous ending which leaves one feeling anxious and confused.<br><br>Overall, 'Safe' is a masterful piece of work. The team of Julianne Moore and Todd Haynes is (as we have seen with 'Far From Heaven') a match made ... in heaven. I would urge those who appreciate non maintream, thought provoking and unconventional films to give it try, just don't go in with 'Hollywood' expectations as you will be disappointed. Finally, I'd like to end by reiterating what is possibly the film's main strength - the presence of Julianne Moore. This truly is a captivating performance from her, and certainly one of the most astonishing I am likely ever to see. 'Safe' gives us the chance to watch this gifted actress in one of her most underrated, little seen, yet most remarkable roles.","user":"Jen_UK","rank":[63,76]}]
