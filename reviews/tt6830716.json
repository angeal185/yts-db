Just don't worry about waste your time.!","user":"vauxhallgraham","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"Garbage","rating":1,"date":"6 September 2019","review":"I don't mind low budget movies. I think it's great seeing people try to follow their dreams and make a film.\nThe film makers for this movie never had dreams of making films. This is a bad first draft from someone that knows nothing about film making.\nIt's complete garbage.","user":"a_c_thompson","rank":[13,16]}]
