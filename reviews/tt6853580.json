[{"title":"Amateur time","rating":2,"date":"25 May 2019","review":"Rachel and some friends take a camping trip to find out what happened to her uncle at lot 24. He mysteriously disappeared doing some research. All seems to go relatively well until the local sheriff comes to visit the friends. Information is exchanged about the missing relative and that's when the hi jinks kicks into high gear. The short run time does not save this movie in the least bit. The dialogue is atrocious which can also be said for the acting. Maybe the character Rachel was the better of the performers but not by much. Majority of the film takes place 3 scenes. Very amateur film. Beware the movie rating at the top of the page does not reflect what the real rating should be.","user":"mentalityx","rank":[39,40]},{"title":"Rated 7,4 in 27/12/2019","rating":2,"date":"26 December 2019","review":"Really 7+ rating for this waste of production's money?\nWhat did they find so fascinating for rating this non sci-fi movie so high?\nDon't waste your time,watch something else","user":"leonidasstathopoulos","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"It's not worth watching the movie","rating":1,"date":"20 December 2019","review":"The rating of 7.8 (Dec 2019) is definitely bad.
