[{"title":"The real noir Los Angeles","rating":14,"date":"14 April 2004","review":"This film was shot on location in and around the Bunker Hill area of Los Angeles in the 1950's.  The seedy trailer park, the crummy cocktail bars, and the Union Station (built in 1939) are the backdrop for a much better than average tale of revenge.  Dick Powell gets off a train at the Union Station after spending 5 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  He is met by a cop (Regis Toomey) that thinks he not only did the crime, but that he has stashed the loot.  Also on the welcoming committee is Richard Erdman as an alcoholic former Marine that provided Powell with an alibi that got him out of prison.  Rhonda Fleming plays the wife of a pal of Powell's that remains in prison for the crime.  Powell intends to prove not only his innocence, but that of his buddy.<br><br>Add to the mix William Conrad as a bad guy with his own agenda and you have a better than average noir.  The dialog between Powell and Erdman is dark and funny at the same time.  The cinematography captures a part of Los Angeles that fell under the urban renewal wrecking ball that ripped the soul out of this part of the city.  Not the greatest film noir ever made, but one of my favorites.  Why isn't this film out on DVD?","user":"ike395","rank":[40,40]},{"title":"Sorely Underappreciated Masterpiece of Atmospheric Noir","rating":10,"date":"16 June 2004","review":"Ike basically took the words out of my mouth (for which I applaud him!), but I'll pledge my love for this film anyway.  I'm fairly new to film noir (started getting into the style in my mid to late teens, and now at twenty, I'm a fanatic) and while I've seen almost all of the massive hits, the films that define the genre to the critics and the movie-loving public, I've found that my personal favorites are films like these, the ones that are so obscure you just might stumble upon them on accident and find that you've unearthed a treasure trove!  An undiscovered gem that is virtually ignored altogether now (and perhaps then as well), \"Cry Danger\" is undoubtedly in my top ten favorite film noirs of all time.  Many people will chalk this up to pure foolishness or relative inexperience with the genre on my part, but before you form these opinions, let me state my case. From the first long-angled shot of this film, the richly-textured atmospheric style is laid out.  Our lead character steps off a train, fresh out of the jail where he spent five years of his life paying for somebody else's crime.  He looks down a long, cylindrical tunnel at the station.  The exit.  But the tunnel represents something else.  It represents the life he left as a younger man and the life he must return to as a forsaken, middle-aged, unemployed former gangster.  It represents his cloudy, uncertain future, and his clinging reluctance to meet with it. From there, we're introduced to a set of characters so shady and so thoroughly corrupted by circumstances beyond their control that the story itself must logically take place in one of the seediest, most dilapedated settings to have ever been featured as a primary backdrop in a film noir...a worn-down trailer park!  Yes, it's uncharacteristically rustic and completely atypical, but that's another one of this film's charms.  The cramped trailer that Dick Powell and Richard Erdman share looks like it could have easily been ground zero for a moderately large hurricane, but as this is a west-coast noir, the above theory can be easily disputed. Beyond the trailer park lie villainous clip-joints and a non-descript deli which houses some mysterious vanishing bookies.  Every civilian is a potential thug and every cop is on their payroll!  The beauty of this film isn't necessarily the plot, as others have pointed out, even though I am certainly intrigued by the dilemma of our hero and the resolution of the story should be fairly unexpected.      But the real reason to watch this film is for all the little things. So many fine details woven together to form a tapestry that, taken as a whole, makes for a really fun rainy-day noir caper!  Dick Powell is awesome as a basically decent guy who's been set-up and screwed over one time too many.  Richard Erdman really deserves glowing praise for his portrayal of a wise-cracking, one-legged ex-Marine (who lives in a trailer park!  See why you should rent this right away?!?!).  I've seen Erdman in a few things (most notably \"Stalag 17\" and \"The Twilight Zone\") and this film is the perfect vehicle to showcase his understated, cynical stage presence and his emphatic, cooly-paced and bitingly sardonic delivery.  An underappreciated actor who really brings it to this role. All in all, this film is too smart and too cynical to win any awards, but if you enjoy a truly sinister noir with some very unique settings and memorable performances, \"Cry Danger\" just may be that film.  All negative criticisms aside, see this and decide for yourself.  I think you'll be glad you did!","user":"MovieMarauder","rank":[52,55]},{"title":"A peevish Powell seeks redress in Los Angeles' post-war underbelly","rating":8,"date":"15 June 2003","review":"Among the male stars of the noir cycle, Dick Powell was the most peevish. When Humphrey Bogart smart-talked, it was with a wry bonhomie; when Robert Mitchum did it, it was with mumbled nonchalance.  But when Powell snaps back a retort, you know he's got his dander up.  This drastic change from his earlier days as happy-go-lucky hoofer began with his assumption (the first) of Philip Marlowe in Murder, My Sweet and continued in Cornered, Johnny O'Clock, To the Ends of the Earth, and The Pitfall.  His prickly temper informs Robert Parrish's Cry Danger, the last true noir he would appear in before affecting a pipe and cardigans in The Bad and the Beautiful.<br><br>Carrying a grip with the weight of the world in it, Powell steps off a train in Los Angeles; he's just spent five years in prison for a robbery and murder for which he took the rap.  Luckily, a war-wounded and hard-drinking Marine (Richard Erdman), with whom he was supposedly drinking when the job was pulled, surfaced to give him an alibi.  But Powell has never met this old buddy before.<br><br>Nonetheless, they throw their lot together and rent an armadillo-like trailer in a run-down park, where the wife of his old partner (Rhonda Fleming) lives, too.  Powell has scores to settle, beginning with big-time bookie William Conrad who, he reckons, owes him $50-grand.  Conrad pays off in classic mob fashion, by giving him a tip on a fixed race. The payoff money puts the police on his tail, as its marked bills are part of the take from the old robbery.  But all traces of the illegal book have vanished, so Powell can't prove his innocence.  He starts stalking Conrad for revenge, even though he's dodging pot-shots in the trailer park, while the duplicity that ensnared him lies much closer to home....<br><br>Cry Danger has a number of points in its favor, chief among them the pitiless photography of Joseph Biroc (it's decidedly the low-rent side of the City of Angels).  Parrish keeps hustling the story along, nonetheless slowing down enough to allow Erdman a craftily underplayed, memorable performance (the same can't be said of Fleming, who simply lacks the wherewithal to function convincingly as femme fatale).  There's a high quotient of violence, too Â– particularly when Powell extracts a confession from Conrad through a one-sided game of Russian Roulette.  Somehow, though, the ingenuity of the earlier part of the picture starts to peter out near the end, turning its oddly low-key ending into something of an afterthought.","user":"bmacv","rank":[43,47]}]
