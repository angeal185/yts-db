[{"title":"The \"shocking\" truth about a woman's right to choose","rating":9,"date":"13 November 2018","review":"I'm not surprised to see the reviews claiming this movie \"glorifies\" abortions. I know it might be hard to watch a story that accepts the decision of a character to have an abortion without showing that character in turmoil over the decision or experiencing regret over the decision- but that is accurate for some women. This is why people are Pro-choice (not Pro-Abortion) because each woman knows whether she can personally live with the decision. Really. We know. Just as there are some women that couldn't imagine having an abortion, there are those that have abortions and (gasp) don't feel guilty about it.\nI thought this movie was funny and the character of Donna was one we rarely see. A female character that is still struggling at the ripe age of 28 (I guess only male leads can be post-college age and still trying to figure out life and love?). A female character that is still learning to love herself. A female character that has center stage. It is only fitting that the movie ends with the main character watching Gone with the Wind for the first time while recovering on the couch.\nTomorrow is another day.","user":"annieer","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"A genuine and authentic look at womanhood, featuring a truly star-making lead performance.","rating":10,"date":"12 June 2014","review":"Over the years, the film industry has churned out plenty of comedies about the perils of dealing with unexpected pregnancy, but never has the subject been approached from such a refreshingly different point of view than in Gillian Robespierre's Obvious Child. <br><br>Donna (Jenny Slate) is an aspiring stand-up comedian whose relationship with her long-term boyfriend has just come to a screeching halt, courtesy of his philandering. Angry and despondent, Donna unleashes her frustration onstage, crashing and burning in front of the audience before finding solace in genuine nice guy Max (Jake Lacy), with whom she shares a few drinks - and a bed.<br><br>When Donna discovers a few weeks later that she's pregnant, her life is thrown into upheaval. A child certainly isn't on her list of desired acquisitions, and after evaluating her options with best friend Nellie (Gaby Hoffmann), she elects to have an abortion. There's just one problem: Max, the one-night stand who also happens to be the sweetest, most courteous person Donna has ever met, and is obviously interested in more than just a casual fling.<br><br>Obvious Child differs from other pregnancy rom-coms by approaching a uniquely feminine issue from a decidedly feminine point of view. This is Donna's story, and while the film is most definitely a comedy, it treats the subject matter with respect and dignity. It's also a standout performance from Slate, who runs the full gamut of the emotional spectrum, gleefully reveling in Donna's raunchy stand-up act one moment, and losing herself in a tearjerking scene between Donna and her overbearing (but not unloving) mother in the next.<br><br>Obvious Child will likely bear the unfortunate distinction of being known as \"the abortion movie,\" but to oversimplify the film and marginalize it in such a manner is a huge disservice. Yes, it deals with abortion, but more importantly, it deals with womanhood in a way that few films have ever dared. It's an authentic, emotional, and yes, hilarious portrait of a young woman trying to find her way, and should be considered a landmark achievement in feminist filmmaking.<br><br>-- Brent Hankins","user":"BrentHankins","rank":[73,129]},{"title":"Wonderful little Indie Comedy but Pro-lifers and Conservatives might wanna skip it","rating":8,"date":"4 February 2015","review":"Gillian Robespierre makes an endearingly funny film about unplanned pregnancy and abortion with Obvious Child. Don't believe us? Watch it! Obvious Child, written and directed by Gillian Robespierre, is the breakout indie comedy that swept up audiences hearts at both Sundance and SXSW festivals.<br><br>Obvious Child follows a stand up comedienne named Donna Stern, played by Jenny Slate. Donna was recently dumped, and not just dumped, but had her heart ripped out and stomped on by her now ex-boyfriend and needless to say she is going through a rough patch. What does one do when one is heartbroken? Well, dancing in her underwear to music, one-night stands and maintaining a certain level of drunkenness seems to be the remedy for her. Unfortunately for Donna this leads to further complications when she finds her uterus fertilized which forces her to address aspects of her life she's been avoiding.<br><br>It is incredibly difficult to tell where Donna Stern ends and Jenny Slate begins in Obvious Child. All the characters written by Robespierre are realistic, engaging and fully formed, especially Donna's best friend Nellie (Gaby Hoffmann) and straight-laced paramour Max (Jake Lacy). Whether it be from the actors' talents or the superior writing, either way, Obvious Child is a fast-paced film with entertaining and intellectual dialogue.<br><br>Obvious Child is not a film for everyone. If you gripe about the sanctity of marriage and have considered or participated in a pro-life rally then this film is probably not for you. You've been warned. Obvious Child is definitely slanted toward the liberal agenda and lucky for this film, so am I.<br><br>Please check out our WEBSITE for all the REVIEWS of recent releases, indies and awards contenders.","user":"ArchonCinemaReviews","rank":[19,29]}]
