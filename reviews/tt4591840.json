[{"title":"Just a pleasant small Christmas themed Irish movie.","rating":25,"date":"25 December 2015","review":"I found this movie on Netflix streaming. I watched it with my wife on Christmas Eve, as we both were suffering with very bad head and chest colds. Bah, humbug!<br><br>The story focuses on young Erin Galway-Kendrick as Noelle O'Hanlon, so named because she was born on Christmas day and, because her dad had vehicle issues, she was born in a manger of sorts and delivered by an older woman who had only delivered calves before.<br><br>Noelle grows up much like all her friends in their small sea-side town, but she finds she has a talent, the ability to perform \"small miracles\". Usually manifest this way, when two people were quarreling she could look at them, squint a bit, and all would become happy and cooperative.<br><br>The drama comes when Rob James-Collier (the nasty guy on Downton Abbey) as Pat McKerrod comes back to town. He grew up there but obviously with great disdain for the place and its struggling snow globe factory. He has returned to represent himself as their savior, he will buy the company and assure jobs for all, but he is lying to them. He is working for Pierce Brosnan back in the States, who literally phones in his role as Mr. Shepherd, a tough businessman who only cares about himself.<br><br>So the resolution of the various stories requires Noelle and her young friends to discover the truth and to point it out so that her small town and its snow globe business can be preserved.<br><br>It is all fairly trite and over-simplified but I don't believe the filmmakers ever thought they were making an award-winning movie. It is just a small movie with a Christmas theme and entertaining for those in the right frame of mind for it.","user":"TxMike","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"When you wish upon an Irish star...","rating":7,"date":"27 December 2016","review":"This is better than most of your Christmas films, which seem to bog themselves down in sentimentality and Christmas Spirit. This isn't a bad thing since that's what Christmas is about. However, when you get a film like this which is set in more realistic situations it's a nice break from the over cheeriness of the usual Chrimbo fodder.<br><br>What also make this a movie worth watching is the acting, which, by and far, is superb. They actors did a great job and must have taken more than a few notes from the cameo \"Stars\" in the film, as this was the intended purpose of the Television Festival for Young People.<br><br>That said, the film could've done with a bit better script and direction, there were times when my attention would stray, and the acting wasn't enough to keep me glued to the gogglebox.<br><br>I recommend this film to all and we need more Christmas films like this - and more films helping young actors to come forward.","user":"stephenabell","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Watch this","rating":7,"date":"23 August 2016","review":"Nice change of pace from the typical American Christmas Movie If you are familiar with the Bible then you will understand the phrase \"And A Child Shall Lead Them\" Born under the Christmas Star, Noelle believes she has the gift to perform miracles, so when conniving developer McKerrod threatens her peaceful life she and her friends determine to use this gift to thwart his plans and save their village. with the Bible you will understand when I say \"And a Child Shall lead them\" . This film is short and sweet. If you h ave a chance to view it to advantage of the opportunity. This is not a by the number \"Hallmark\" film. It has a nice \"Disney Vibe\" to it. There is even a few cameos in this film for the adults. <br><br>This film is very good. It is safe for the family to watch. Not a well known movie but it should be.","user":"Christmas-Reviewer","rank":[9,11]}]
