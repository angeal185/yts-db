[{"title":"Not bad at all","rating":7,"date":"14 October 2019","review":"I guess I have the honor to write the first review for this Venezuelian movie. I'm pretty sure it's a first for me, to watch a movie from Venezuela, and for a first it was a pleasant surprise. The acting was on top, nothing bad to write about anybody from the cast. The storyline is worth watching, maybe a bit slow at times but you never lose interest as the mystery factor keeps everything together and interesting. To me there could have been a bit more gore to make it more special but overal it's a movie worth a watch.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[9,13]}]
