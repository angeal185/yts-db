[{"title":"Why Joe's part was played well by G. H. despite the popular opinion otherwise","rating":8,"date":"8 July 2006","review":"I think some comments of how poorly Joe was portrayed by Gene Hackman are greatly incorrect. Here's why: he played the character as Mamet most likely intended. We are used to seeing the bright sheen and slick attitude of movie con-men (Danny Ocean, Henry Gondorf, et al) and any offering less suave is not well received. <br><br>Joe was an aging has-been. The film alludes to his down-slide the whole time. He gets \"burned\", loses his take and gets forced into another \"thing\". Bobby even voices this explicitly to him when he \"walks out\" on the \"thing\". **side note: Bobby obviously was putting on the dog and pony show for Jimmy when he said those things, but they still have merit as I'll explain**<br><br>So, why am I under the opinion G.H. did a better job then most give him credit for? <br><br>Joe was down and out- supposedly weak in the game and broke. He had to keep up this illusion to successfully allow everyone else (but Bobby and Pinky) to under-estimate him. He also feared there was probably validity to his supposed weakness. He musters his talent to execute a great heist and dodge the complications. Essentially, Gene Hackman had to play a character who was descending into age and loss, gathering his talents for \"the thing\" and dealing with betrayal, have the confidence in himself but also the fear of his \"lameness\", and put on a front that he was a foolish has been. He did not play him \"weak\", but played the \"has-been with doubt who thinks he can pull it off but keeps a 'lame' front\". The layered complexity of the character was portrayed by G.H. very well but lost on those who fail to see it.","user":"ewilmot-1","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"How long IS a Chinaman's Name?","rating":7,"date":"7 May 2006","review":"It's hard to go wrong with a story about clever criminals who must worry not only about the authorities but about the treachery of other clever criminals. Master thief Joe (Hackman) decides to call it quits after a profitable jewel store robbery in which his unmasked face is caught on camera. Trouble is, he's already committed to another, bigger job--stealing a gold shipment from a Swiss freight plane--for his fence &amp; paymaster Mickey (Devito). Mickey won't pay off for the jewel job until Joe does the \"Swiss thing.\" The film's first big flaw is that the animosity between Joe &amp; Mickey, who are apparently longtime friends &amp; associates, is never explained enough to justify why they are so willing to stick it to one another. This is a problem because Hackman's character is supposed to occupy the moral high ground (always important when everybody's a criminal) but, in the story, comes across at least as treacherous as Devito's. Fine portrayals by Hackman &amp; Devito cover up rather than diminish this flaw. From then on it's all one twist after another, not all of which twist without leaving open holes behind. Will Joe do the job and, if so, end up doing it the way Mickey wants? Does Joe's supercool, Impossible-Mission crew (Lindo, Jay &amp; Pigeon) trust him &amp; stick with him all the way? Is Mickey's brash young nephew &amp; protégé Jimmy (Rockwell), whom Mickey sends to watch Joe, really as cluelessly macho as he seems? Joe's heist plans (\"cute as a pailful of kittens\") are too complicated to work unless His Honor Judge Murphy is too sleepy to enforce his law. But they provide a marvellous venue for Mamet to work the lost magic of Welles &amp; Hitchcock: developing characters through interaction &amp; dialog. The supporting cast carries most of this task &amp; does it very well, particularly thieves Lindo, Rockwell &amp; Jay. Jimmy's pushy questions to the other thieves are met by cool, obfuscating questions in reply (\"How long's he been with that girl?\" \"How long is a Chinaman's name?\"). Pigeon is suitably hard-edged for this taut film, but a lone actress surrounded by so many tough actors has to bring something extra to stand out. Though he'll probably be best remember for \"Hoosiers,\" and with respects to DeNiro in films such as \"Heat\" &amp; \"The Score,\" Hackman is the most accomplished actor in films such as this, whether as a cop (\"The French Connection\"), a private-eye (\"Night Moves\"), a technician (\"The Conversation,\" \"Enemy of the State\"), a spy (\"Target\") or even an attorney (\"Under Suspicion\"). He's the top master because he rarely fails to score, even in films with plot holes, weak premises &amp; contradictions, with his strong &amp; convincing characterizations, the almost insane passion that lurks just beneath his plain Midwestern veneer. Fine production values, understated but effective actions scenes &amp; an above-average music score help Hackman &amp; Co. make \"Heist\" a watchable rather than forgettable thriller. Enjoy the portrayals &amp; action but don't think too much.","user":"tom-darwin","rank":[34,45]},{"title":"The perfect model... trips at the end of the runway","rating":7,"date":"26 September 2002","review":"The cast alone suggests that this will be an amazing movie...and it was. The amazement however, ended just before the movie did.  The performances were all great - however the writing talents were not well suited for actors of this caliber.  The writer's talents were more on par with ... well... fortune cookies.  This is not to say that the whole thing is bad.  It is just that the ending is just over done.  The whole 'tricked-ya' thing is a little old, but still acceptable.  The 'tricked-ya tricked-ya tricked-ya' type endings are about as creative as a dream-sequence ending.  To the defense of the movie, it is better the second time, as you are no longer worried about the ending and just enjoying the acting.","user":"Epsillion","rank":[15,18]}]
