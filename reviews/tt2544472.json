[{"title":"Left wanting","rating":2,"date":"1 March 2015","review":"The film started off promising, giving hints that this could be a surprisingly good low budget film. Unfortunately I was surprised but not in a good way. The film built up as any good horror film would however at the first opportunity to capture the audience the acting failed miserably. I have seen several high school projects and the the students in those projects gave far better performances than this crew. The acting was below terrible. The character shallow with no depth in any way. At no point did I want any of the characters NOT to die. The lines, camera angles, unrealistic reactions (or complete lack of reactions) and absence of a basic plot made me register on IMDb so that I could warn others about this film.","user":"jayerasmus","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Just another generic haunted prison movie we don't need","rating":3,"date":"12 April 2015","review":"I'm here to give you a REAL review of this movie, not some extreme movie critic review bullsh*t. You may find some of the things I say to be spoilers, but this movie is already spoiled. Don't watch this and expect to get what the title of the movie tells you. I hated every single character of this movie and couldn't wait for them to die. Joel and Kate want a vacation yet their adult career is a ghost hunter. The fat guy is always talking about food and acts stupid, then just vanishes from the movie. Roger is just that irritating anti-everything that nobody really wants in the group and all he does is inconvenience everyone. The story of the location in this movie is very short but sweet. Classic twisted doctor that tortures people in a few interesting ways compared to your standard murderer, just not enough ways. The guy in charge telling the story was creepy as f*ck the whole time. Sh*t started to pick up eventually with something I've never seen in any of these movies, but then they ruined it with cheesy music. You can find scarier music/sound files in a Google search. Before I knew it, the movie was over and only one person died. What an unfinished, generic story. This had potential to be good if it was done a little better and the actual story extended. Not worth watching. Grave Encounters is way better.","user":"foxdogehound","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Enjoyable horror movie","rating":9,"date":"5 October 2016","review":"A group of paranormal investigators belong to some TV show need to deliver that thriller stuff to boost the ratings of their struggling TV show, so agree to film an episode in an old abandoned prison. I read some reviews that were too negative, so I was not hoping this movie to be as good as I experienced myself.it's a worth watching movie.i shall recommend this one. Nice acting plus story with some nice scares.the movie kept my concentration throughout the movie. Overall I felt like it was a good attempt.specially I like the ending.If you are a horror fan then I consider this movie as a success.It has that thriller ,horror mystery kind of elements that I like to see in a movie. They did full justice to this movie.","user":"usmanbaig-84712","rank":[4,5]}]
