[{"title":"Cool!","rating":9,"date":"23 March 2000","review":"I'm not trying to say that this movie is the greatest movie ever made, but I feel that it is too bad that more people do not know about S.F.W.  It's a bit hard to believe the plot, but since when have movie plots played within the guidelines of normal society.  Stephen Dorff gives an amazing performance as Cliff Spab.  This was the first movie I ever saw him in, and seeing S.F.W. really made me think he is destined for big things.  I liked how the story shifted from past to present constantly.  This way, you had to wait until the end of the movie to find out what happened at the beginning. Makes it all the more intriguing.  I love this movie, and most people would too if they gave it half a chance.","user":"Wes-26","rank":[24,34]},{"title":"Ahead of it's time","rating":14,"date":"14 May 2001","review":"I just watched S.F.W. and was amazed at how, at least five years before the major trend of 'reality TV' became the in-thing, this movie satirized it, and showed it for how wrong and un-real it is. This movie scathingly commentates on the media's ability to warp and distort truth, and to give the mundane deep meaning. Cliff Spab is a meaningless person trapped in a meaningless society that does not appreciate the horror of his ordeal and ruthlessly tries to cash in on his pain. This film is chock-full of meaning and irony, and it is simply brilliant.","user":"alissaroode","rank":[15,22]},{"title":"Such a great movie","rating":10,"date":"25 June 2001","review":"I saw this movie about 3 or 4 years ago, and fell in love with it.  It was at a period in my life that I needed something to show me that I was still alive and things could always be worse, this movie was it.  The characters, the plot, the cinematography, all of it.  Every minute of this movie kept me wondering what would happen next, and a lot of had edge of my seat suspense. Stephan Dorff did such a great job of playing this character.  Having to balance such an emotionally scarred but still nonchalant young man must have been difficult.  I really believed that he had been put through these awful things though, because his performance was that good.  Reese Witherspoon also gave a great performance.  I believe her role in this movie was slightly under-rated, she played your typical romantic interest but she also was the reason that Dorff's character didn't lose his mind. <br><br>I often find that the cinematography is better in independant films, and I believe this was independant.  It had some bad language in it, but that doesn't bother me.  The symbolism that is throughout this movie amazed me, and I notice something new everytime I watch it.  SFW is based on the book 'Madison Heights Syndrom', and even though I've never read the book, I'm sure they did a great job adapting it.   There was not one thing about this movie I didn't like and would recommend it to everybody.","user":"learan84","rank":[18,33]}]
