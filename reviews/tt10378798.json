Really bad action scenes and the mummy mask looks like it was bought out of the Halloween bargain bin. Dont even waste your time with this one. Your player will thank you.","user":"logavierre","rank":[22,23]},{"title":"AHHH!!

Who can make the worst movie ever? Poor acting and the award winning camera \"shake\" for action scene. Makes it hard to tell the difference from an Asylum movie.","user":"Max_Lucas","rank":[21,23]}]
