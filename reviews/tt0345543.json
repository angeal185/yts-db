[{"title":"Journey to the Big Water","rating":6,"date":"2 April 2009","review":"The Land Before Time IX: Journey to the Big Water, the ninth installment in the Land Before Time series and once again I really enjoyed this sequel. Honestly what was so wrong with this film? I thought it was absolutely adorable. Again I know that these movies are a bit silly and very kidish, but they are just light hearted fun that provide entertainment for the whole family. Seeing Littlefoot and his friends on another adventure together, though these kids seem to get into more trouble than your average group of friends, these stories are nevertheless always very fun to watch. The animation is getting brighter, it's a little different than the original, but it's still all good and I'm enjoying what these sequels have brought since the original Land Before Time.<br><br>When heavy rains create a mysterious \"new water\", Littlefoot sets off to explore the Great Valley. All his friends are busy trying to fix whatever happened during the rain to their land, so he goes beyond the Great Valley. He quickly becomes friends with Mo, a swimming fish like dinosaur who has been isolated from his pod by the weather. Littlefoot's friends finally catch up with him when they're all done with their chores and are introduced to Mo. They decide to help Mo get home safely, but the families don't want to risk the possible danger ahead of them. Littlefoot decides to go ahead anyways and his friends are going to help him. When Littlefoot and his friends get separated from their parents because of the Earthshake, they help Mo get back home to the Big Water, while avoiding a hungry dinosaur that looks like the Lochness Monster. On the way, Littlefoot and Mo discuss such interesting and see dangerous things like imaginary friends, the concept of loneliness, and the true meaning of a brother.<br><br>The Land Before Time IX: Journey to the Big Water is a good family film, I mean how could you not love Mo? Yeah he's a bit hyper and crazy, but still he was so cute and such a party animal. I loved the friendship between him and Littlefoot, it kind of reminded me of Chomper from the second sequel in the Land Before Time series. This has great morals, good humor, and a fun story as the adventures continue, OK that's a little cheesy, but these movies are making me smile. Don't take the ratings on here seriously, these are great family films and are just harmless fun. Littlefoot, Mo, Spike, Cera, Peetry, and Ducky are awesome! If you don't like them, you have no heart.<br><br>6/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"How many more of these are they going to do?","rating":4,"date":"15 August 2003","review":"Now there is going to be a number 10 coming out in December!! Enough already! I am so burnt out on these!  The characters were cute a few times but not 10 times now.  The adventures are old as you can see from the ratings on this movie (LOW).  Enough with the land before time, these are getting really old and the quality is steadily declining each time they make another.  A new idea would be so much nicer!","user":"afamouspetty","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Guess what? The Great Valley's bunch of young explorers is in trouble AGAIN!","rating":31,"date":"31 May 2004","review":"The Land Before Time series keeps going on, and I see no end to it. 16 years ago, the first installment remains timeless, and that could be expected from Don Bluth. But to go as far as the eighth sequel ... the series should be wrapped up after X, but I hear XI is brewing. <br><br>After lots of rainfall, the well-known band of adventurers Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Petrie and Spike set off to the Big Water for a second time, to help a new friend, Mo (probably an icthyosaur), who has been carried inland by the floodwaters. Needless to mention the swimming sharptooth that dogs them every step of the way. <br><br>Last year's The Big Freeze was a change for the better for the series, and the Journey to the Big Water continues the same way. Sadly, it once again is spoiled by horrible songs, with lyrics that embarrass me when I realize I'm listening to them, especially with someone else in the room. The first had no such problem to hold it back, so the addition of songs to every sequel seems utterly pointless. The story is simple, and not too ambitious. It rarely deviates from the main plot, which is a good thing. I was quite astonished to find out that the film had covered 75 minutes. One of the major failures was dialogue: it just sounded unnatural and the acting wasn't confident enough. There was no depth to the voices or the material they had to work with. It may be a cartoon, but such a lack of realism as the film has must be avoided. During the journey, Mo must leap over a tall rocky outcrop at a waterfall. There are small rocks at the side, which are easy to jump over, and big gaps between them. Why Mo could not have taken the simpler course is a mystery. The writers clashed with the layout artists and won, just for the sake of another obstacle in the way. But to the film's credit, it has some better dramatic scenes than some of the other video releases. The storm and the violent water of the lake in the final monster sequence was refreshingly beyond all other such scenes in the sequels. Also, the scene is a good example of the special effects in the film, not to be found in the predecessors. Although no substitute for the exquisite artistry of the first film, the computer effects are a step forward. But the use of it isn't consistent. Some of the trees look like plastic models, not computerized props. This is most obvious early on, when Cera and her father are rolling the treetrunk out of the way, and the first shot of the sequence is the log rolling towards the screen. But for the remainder, the computer work is a step in the right direction. May it be even better in the next installments. Layouts, painted or computerized, are very good. It is at its best early on, with landscape shots of the Great Valley.<br><br>\nAlthough the sequels to The Land Before Time are forgettable, they do provide a decent viewing for over an hour. The Journey to the Big Water is better than most of them, but still not more than 75 minutes of time lost to light entertainment. May the series fold soon, and the greatness of The Land Before Time that broke new ground in 1988 be what is remembered through the years to come.","user":"rapt0r_claw-1","rank":[7,9]}]
