[{"title":"Against re-establishes Johnny To as the best working action director.","rating":26,"date":"26 April 2000","review":"Lifeline, A Hero Never Dies, and you think he couldn't top himself off. This film manages to be one of the most intelligent action films ever made and still fits in a compelling love story told in three scenes better than most films can tell a love story in the entire film.  The gag premise, a man with 4 weeks to live takes on the Hong Kong police is only part of the brilliance of the film.  I have to thanks the script writer for a constantly innovative script, as much as Johnny and I await their next collaboration with much anticipation.","user":"suburban madman","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Hollywood just doesn't make 'em like that...","rating":8,"date":"19 December 2000","review":"Not high art, not even exceptionally innovative, but a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Funny, fresh, intelligent - there are still people out there who don't need millions of dollars to hide that they're out of ideas.<br><br>When you compare this to your average Hollywood action flick, you're comparing a homemade meal with a big mac.","user":"dhahn","rank":[24,29]},{"title":"To and Lau equal excitement","rating":9,"date":"10 March 2000","review":"I just purchased An Zhan (Running out of time) on DVD and it was an excellent film I must say. Not really action-packed, in terms of gun play, but definitely exciting and witty. I do not think I have seen Andy Lau in better form. And the editing on this film was very well executed. Go watch this now if you are a fan of Lau or HK thiller/action film!","user":"movie_guru","rank":[6,6]}]
