[{"title":"Brutal","rating":6,"date":"31 December 2005","review":"I tried to watch this film once before and made it up to the second rape scene before leaving the room, believing I was seriously about to throw up. I finally forced myself to watch it all the way through recently, and I'm glad I did. <br><br>Jennifer Hill is a young, hip, free-spirited woman of the 70s, who leaves her home in New York City for a long vacation in Connecticut, where she plans to write her first novel. Jennifer soon attracts the attention of four lowlife scumbags as she sunbathes in her bikini. The semi-evolved thugs kidnap Jennifer, drag her into the woods, rape her, beat her, sodomize her, beat her some more, follow her home, rape her again, kick her when she's down, make fun of her manuscript, rip it to shreds, rape her with a bottle, beat her up one last time and leave her, bleeding and unconscious on the floor of her vacation home. Damn. They send the retarded Matthew back into the house with a knife and instructions to kill her, but Matthew can't bring himself to do it. He tells the guys that he has killed her, and they stupidly believe him and leave. But Jennifer is alive, and as she heals from her hideous wounds and recovers her strength, she plots revenge against her rapists. <br><br>Roger Ebert called this the worst film ever made and feminists damned it to hell for all eternity, but you know what? I'm a woman and I liked it. Jennifer is no weak, whimpering, helpless little victim. She tries her best to fight back. When threats and violence fail to work in her favor, she uses the only other weapon she has: sex. The men are all stereotypical slobs, disgusting pigs who are clearly already emasculated and use Jennifer as an outlet for their frustration and rage. The rapes have nothing to do with sex and are portrayed most realistically - they are ugly, brutal, violent, nasty and completely devoid of eroticism. The sodomy scene was the one scene that horrified me the most, as Jennifer emits the most bloodcurdling scream of pain ever heard. It is very difficult not to flinch from that sound. Jennifer's revenge is every bit as bloody and painful, and nowhere is it more sadistic than in the infamous \"bloodbath\" scene. These guys all get what's coming to them, and Jennifer makes sure that the punishment fits the crime, turning the men into the helpless, pleading victims and feeding their own sadism right back to them.<br><br>Okay, so not all of the plot points make sense, and not everyone is going to agree with Jennifer's decision to kill the men, but it's still a powerful film. It's told primarily from Jennifer's point of view but it never takes sides. It simply tells the story and lets you decide - is Jennifer an insane psycho-killer who ought to go to jail for her crimes, or is she an angel of vengeance delivering poetic justice?<br><br>Scaredy cats like me might prefer to watch this film with the audio commentary by Joe Bob Briggs turned on. Joe Bob provides a lot of interesting information about the making of this film, and also supplies some much needed comic relief throughout.","user":"Gafke","rank":[153,177]},{"title":"Widely misunderstood.","rating":15,"date":"15 January 2002","review":"Of all the films that were implicated in the absurd and sickening tabloid-fueled \"video nasties\" witch-hunt in the UK, some were demonised more than others.  I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE joins a select few as being one of THE films cited for causing the most problems at the time.  Certainly, the title and advertising campaign (in classic exploitation fashion) was garish and contentious, but unlike some other films that suffered the same fate (such as SS EXPERIMENT CAMP), Zarchi's film is extremely powerful and disturbing... not to mention widely misinterpreted.<br><br>I've read a large number of reviews of this film.  A worryingly high percentage of them accuse this movie of somehow advocating rape, and being sexist and demeaning.  That is the last thought that crosses my mind whilst watching this.  The whole \"rape/revenge\" genre is one that is fraught with moral contradictions.  In essence, films of this type ARE exploiting the subject of rape (and sadly, often presenting it in a sexually ambiguous way) but does this mean that they are not able to condemn the subject matter, or offer a powerful criticism of the behaviour of many men towards women?  The same school of argument is used against critical film-making like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST- can a film truly condemn what it exploits?  I believe so, and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a triumphant example of this, putting forward more powerful a message about violence of rape and the attitudes of some men towards it than any other movie I care to mention.  However, it goes even deeper than this in this particular case.  Zarchi doesn't praise the rapists- nor does he condemn them.  Similarly he offers no moral judgment on the revenge that is carried out by the female protagonist.  I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE offers a truly subjective message in that it presents gritty reality and leaves the viewer to make up their mind on the matter.<br><br>Much is made of the fact that the rape scenes last for around forty minutes. It seems that a lot of critics think that by proxy, long scenes of violence equal pure exploitation.  In this case, this is far from the truth.  The scenes are horrific, grueling and ugly.  There is no kind of glorification of rape here.  The scenes are shot practically real-time which brings home the gritty and sickening nature of what is being displayed.  Furthermore, a lot of the scenes are shot from the victim's perspective.  The revolting sight of sweating, grunting men is absolutely anti-sexual and anti-erotic, which is of course EXACTLY what it should be in this context!  Rape has little to do with sex, and a great deal more to do with violence and power. This is expressed superbly in the sequences in this film.  Sanitising the scenes that are supposedly \"exploitative\" would trivialise the very serious issues at hand. <br><br>The men presented in I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE are nothing to emulate.  Nothing is even said about the backgrounds of their characters- they are totally faceless within the context of the film (other than one long shot later on which shows one of the men with his family- merely proving him to be a liar and cheat as well as a rapist).  The point here is that they don't even NEED character building- they represent the threat and actuality of sexual violence that women face every day. The final and most telling twist is that these men are then so gullible and arrogant that they could be seduced and murdered by the person they had attacked.  If Ebert and all his sniveling comrades are really right about this film \"promoting sexual violence\", they must see something appealing in the behaviour of these men.<br><br>Despite what you might read elsewhere, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a tightly constructed and well crafted piece of film-making containing some powerfully symbolic imagery.  Scenes such as Keaton sitting broken and alone in her house after her attacks or her swimming costume limply floating in the river are extremely effective.  There is also practically no music in the entire film.  The viewer can almost feel the sense of isolation at every stage of the story- initially it is liberating but it quickly becomes frightening as events unfold.  The simple cinematography reflects the isolated feel of the locations that frame this film. <br><br>Many horror films can be fairly accused of being misogynistic.  I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE takes these concepts of misogyny and totally turns them around. This film is EMPOWERING, and whilst it does have the cynical production of an exploitation feature, Zarchi took this and created a powerful, bitter and dynamic story with many issues being explored therein.  It's great.  Check it out if you haven't already, and if you've watched it before with the wrong approach to it, I demand you have another look.  This is one of the pinnacles of the genre but sadly it is (in)famous for all the wrong reasons.","user":"Moshing Hoods","rank":[70,81]},{"title":"A neglected cult classic worthy of an larger audience.","rating":9,"date":"19 November 2003","review":"I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978) is one of the most notorious pictures ever released during the seventies. Along with LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and Thriller: A cruel picture, it's one of the greatest revenge flicks of that era. A feminist writer goes out to the country so she could have some peace and quiet whilst working on her first novel. Instead she runs into a group of male locals who decide to have some fun with her. Unlike many other movies of this ilk, I.S.O.Y.G. is not like other\"exploitation films\". There is nothing sexual or provocative in this picture. The director wanted to show what it's like to be raped and the after effects of such a traumatizing event. He went through great lengths in research and from his own personnel experience. I found it to be a very different film than all of the others that deal with the same subject matter. The film-making (for a first time director) was very well done and for the most part the acting was up to par. I am proud to admit that I have this film as part of my collection. Don't believe the hype. This is a good movie. <br><br>Highly recommended.<br><br>P.S. The subject matter is real graphic, but rape is not enjoyable. The director did an excellent job of portraying the true horror of it instead of hollywoodizing this dirty, degrading act.","user":"Captain_Couth","rank":[110,141]}]
