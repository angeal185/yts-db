[{"title":"Don't call me crazy","rating":3,"date":"29 September 2017","review":"If you have seen on exorcism film, you have seen them all. 1) Introduce Priest. 2) Introduce characters 3) break out the dreaded Ouija board 4) Break out red contacts and demon voice distorter 5) Think of cute demon name like Abaddontrump. 6) if budget permits twist head around (their budget didn't permit) 6) Perform exorcism, break out Holy Water 7) have someone die in the end.<br><br>Some films are done better than others. This was one of \"the others.\" Tara Marie Kirk wasn't too bad as the lead until she became possessed and then she couldn't pull it off. It was funny to watch her pretend she was possessed. The supporting cast didn't help the script that A listers would have a hard time saving.<br><br>3 stars is generous. I like redheads.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Exorcist clone on a limited budget","rating":1,"date":"17 September 2017","review":"EXORCIST: THE FALLEN is a laughable indie horror flick from Oregon. It's, unsurprisingly enough, an obvious clone of THE EXORCIST, made with little in the way of wit, originality, or style. The plot is about a girl who becomes possessed by a demon and the efforts of a priest to save her, but as with most indies, the supernatural content is limited to just a couple of scenes and the rest is all boring small talk. Watch out for the geeky priest who's a spitting image of George W. Bush.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Garrett Benach needs to find another career","rating":1,"date":"10 January 2020","review":"This movie, Victoria's Exorcism (original title) and is even displayed as such at the end of the movie, is seriously rubbish. I've seen bad CGI before but this is just ridiculous, devil eyes are superimposed, blood is superimposed and not all that well either. The portrayal of Victoria as being a happy go lucky person, doesn't mean having a stupid laugh and at anything. Definitely no comedy or horror. Whoever fronted the cash for this production needs to ask for a refund. Don't waste your time on this rubbish.","user":"staunton-gary","rank":[0,0]}]
