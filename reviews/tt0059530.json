Cool Spaghetti full of fury , action, and portentous duels . This decent as well as enjoyable Paella Western owes a considerable debt to Leone and packs violence , shootouts , high body-count and it's fast moving and quite entertaining .

Leone-style Western with nice performances and fine direction by Rafael Romero Marchent who creates some good action scenes and exciting set pieces . It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist Craig Hill against Jose Guardiola and his brothers : Hugo Blanco , Lorenzo Robledo and Piero Lulli . The movie contains typical particularities Spaghetti , as is full of fury , sadism , bloodbaths , and close-ups of grime-encrusted faces .

His main enemy is rightly performed by Jose Guardiola as a cruelly baddie role is terrific, he subsequently would play similar characters .

The westerns written and directed by Spaniards tend to be very different in terms of technique, tone, and thematic preoccupations from those made by Italians. Like most Spanish westerns, this movie is more crudely made than their Italian westerns, but as the movie progresses there are actually a number scenes which are evocative if rough-hewn such as the Carter Brother's funeral, the sequence in they stalk their victims and in turn are hunted, and especially the movie's final scene. As such, it is much better than contemporary films like Tierra de Fuego (1965) or I Tre del Colorado (1965). If you enjoy Eurowesterns, it is worth giving this movie a chance on it's own (limited) terms.<br><br>Ocaso de un pistolero (1965) was written by Joaquin Marchent and directed by his brother Rafeal. Together they were responsible for many of the best \"Paella westerns.\" The story is told economically and skillfully, with two partially independent story lines dovetailing in the psychological deterioration of Dan Murphy and not in the usual series of (unneeded) plot complications. <br><br>Where these \"Paella westerns\" match the Italian examples of the genre is in their own unique conception of the relationship of the individual and their society, one presumably rooted in the Franco regime and the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. Violence is a brutalizing contagion, resorted to by the protagonists out of necessity to protect something they value, but resulting in their corruption and ambiguous destruction. Their actions are motivated by good intentions, but in a world where the law is a tool available to anyone who can seize it each act only results in the confirmation of the inevitable final condemnation. Violence corrupts them and they become like those the brutalized them. The powerful individual may be killed (and usually is), but power itself is a raw enveloping force and physical presence that will collapse on the protagonist regardless, annihilating them. By the end, the protagonist must be destroyed as well in an ambiguous exorcism. Personally, I find some of these \"Paella\" westerns\" fairly effective because of this recurrent desperate drama.<br><br>In contrast, the Italian movies tend to have subtexts of resurrection and revolution, leaving them with a strange optimism only thinly disguised beneath overt, cynical gestures. Though westerns declined as a genre in Italy in the early-1970s, many of their themes were taken up in the popular crime movies of the time. It is in these movies that a similar disillusionment can be seen.<br><br>In this movie, the filmmakers do a surprisingly good job imitating a low-budget 1950s American B-western with only a small amount of the usual surreal pre-Leone pastiche. Yet, the Iberian western underneath slowly rips through the facade, force and violence rending the image. The basic plot involves a gunman named Dan Murphy (Craig Hill) and his wife (Gloria Milland). Years before, on the run and attempting to find a place to settle down, Sheriff Rogers (Jesus Puente) accidentally shoots and kills there son, Andy. In retribution, they steal Roger's own son. They raise the boy as their own, naming him Andy. At the wedding of a neighbor, Roger's deputy finds Murphy. The same evening, the Murphy gets into a fight with the Carter brothers, the local criminal bullies. These threads are pulled and Murphy's life begins to unravel.<br><br>Much of the movie seems to be focused on the contrast between the institutions of law and the insoluble problems of justice. Murphy is seeking justice for the murder of his child and, later, of his friends. The Carter's are seeking justice for the death of their younger brother. The town's sheriff is simply an impediment to justice and is denounced, then murdered.<br><br>The movie seems to modeled after American westerns such as The Gunfighter (1950) and The Fastest Gun Alive (1956), in that it centers on a famous gunman attempting to escape is reputation. In the conflict between Murphy and the Carters, the movie seems to be recreating that between Earp and the Clantons in My Darling Clementine (1946). The overarching \"gothic family\" plot is a favorite trope that recurred in a number of Eurowesterns such as Pistolero dell'Ave Maria, Il (1969) or Tempo di massacro (1966).<br><br>The dubbing is terrible. The theme music by Angelo Lavagnino was reused in number of low-budget Eurowesterns. While unspectacular, but it does have a strange \"lounge Morricone\" vibe to it, being a laid-back deguello.","user":"rmahaney4","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"An Above-Average But Tragic Spaghetti Western","rating":7,"date":"1 January 2018","review":"Not only did \"Hands of a Gunfighter\" constitute Rafael Romero Marchent debut as a film director, but also the Spaghetti western marked the first time that American actor Craig Hill made his initial movie in Europe after he had spent more than a decade searching for stardom. After a couple of roles in American movies and television, Hill returned to Europe and spent a little over 30 years starring in a variety of westerns, horror epics, and crime movies. Marchent's \"Hands of a Gunfighter\" doesn't qualify as a run-of-the-mill horse opera about a pistolero who has hung up his six-guns and settled down with a wife and a son. Dan Murphy (Craig Hill of \"Siege at Red River\") and his wife Miriam (Gloria Milland of \"Hercules Against the Barbarians\") are riding through a town in a covered wagon when the town lawman, Sheriff Rogers (Jesús Puente of \"A Bullet for Rommel\") takes a shot at Murphy with a rifle and kills Murphy's son. At this point, the narrative becomes muddled. Years elapse, and we learn that Murphy and Miriam are living the quiet life of a rancher with a son, Andy (Francisco José Huetos), but Andy isn't their son. Actually, Andy belongs to Sheriff Rogers, and one of Rogers' deputies come to get him and return him to his biological father. Andy has been living with Dan and Miriam long enough that he believes that they are his parents. Meantime, trouble brews between Murphy and the Castle brothers who own a ranch and cast a giant shadow in the community. The Castles are ruffians, and they pick on Dan and his friends, a young couple who have moved into a nearby ranch. The Castles have been trying to bait Dan into a fight, but he hasn't accommodated them. Eventually, after they murder and burn out the young couple, a reluctant Dan buckles on his six-shooter, and he gives them the opportunity that they have eagerly awaited. The problem is that they aren't prepared for the showdown, and they pay the consequences of years that they harassed Dan. One of the Castles, Davy (Piero Lulli of \"My Name is Nobody\"), discovers that he should never have bullied Murphy. The showdown between these two hombres is singular in the annuals of Spaghetti westerns. Dan brandishes two revolvers, and he loads one bullet into one of them. Afterward, he hands the shooting irons to a bystander and instructs him to shift them around so that nobody can possibly know which one contains a bullet. Murphy has him pitch the guns into the dust, and he gives Davy first go at choosing the loaded firearm. Predictably, Davy selects the wrong six-gun, and the hammer clicks six-times on each empty cylinder. Conversely, Dan takes the other revolver and shoots Davy dead on the spot. Meantime, Miriam has gone to visit Andy who believes that he will have a chance to see his father. When Dan arrives at Rogers' ranch to take Andy home, Rogers' ranch hands blast Murphy to pieces in a hail of gunfire. \"Hands of a Gunfighter\" isn't your average reformed gunslinger western, but it is an interesting variation on the theme. Composer Angelo Francesco Lavagnino provides another memorable orchestral soundtrack for this striking Euro-western.","user":"zardoz-13","rank":[0,0]}]
