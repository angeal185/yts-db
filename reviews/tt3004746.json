[{"title":"There's something (weird) about Kim","rating":6,"date":"2 September 2016","review":"Well her character of course and not Ms. Basinger herself. There's also something very wrong about this movie. It's strange and kind of has a lot of flaws, but it's still mesmerizing and kind of takes the viewer on a journey if he/she embarks and embraces it. A very dark one that touches subject matters that are really mean and can be considered very bad indeed too.<br><br>But if you let yourself in (not that the characters seem to have any redeeming values or merits apart from the struggle they apparently and obviously are in), you will have a suspenseful movie to watch and appreciate with a magnificent performance by Kim Basinger and her co-star. The pace might be slow, but the impact can be perceived as strong nevertheless. Tough subject, tough movie","user":"kosmasp","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"a dark, tense and creepy place to go but I'm glad I did","rating":8,"date":"18 February 2015","review":"This is one seriously messed up movie: If you like films like 'Repulsion', 'La Pianiste' or even 'Black Swan' (which I didn't think all that much of) or just beautiful unhinged women going further off the rails generally, I recommend you give it a look.<br><br>It's a European production from Danish director Morgenthaler, and feels miles away from anything made by Hollywood, yet it stars the bewilderingly youthful-looking Kim Basinger, who here is a revelation at her very best, with flawless support from Jordan Prentice and the always reliable Peter Stormare.<br><br>'I Am Here' is a dark, still, tense and creepy place to go, but I'm glad I did.","user":"rampantpolanski","rank":[30,40]},{"title":"This film is nothing like you would possibly expect from anything you can read here.","rating":7,"date":"16 November 2015","review":"That probably includes my review. It is so odd and different and though the basic story is quite easy to describe, the filmmaker's approach to the subject matter is so unique that I found it elevated what is admittedly a flawed film. Bassinger and Jordan Prentice both do an excellent job in their starring roles. I think the original title \"I am here\" fit the film much better than the title the 11th hour. I think the intent was to market it a little more as a suspense film, and it may be the reason for the lower rating. It is more an art house film that can be criticized by some as being a bit slow, but the director Anders Morganthaler really does some neat stuff with a continuing theme of Bassinger communicating with the soul of her daughter that she miscarries early in the film. That is why I liked the earlier title. I don't think I have given any true spoilers by discussing this issue. It is not a great film, but certainly worth watching if you are in the mood for something far from the norm.","user":"somf","rank":[8,9]}]
