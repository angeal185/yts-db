[{"title":"Hard to Watch","rating":2,"date":"24 October 2017","review":"I appreciate the artistic perspestive in this film, and its fresh storyline, but I have to say this movie left me feeling confused and frustrated that I spent that much time investing in the storyline for little payoff. It's unrealistic that the characters wouldn't follow up with the 'dramatic' ending of their relationship with Andy, and that Andy wasn't even really a character much at all. We know nothing about any of these people the ENTIRE movie. The main characters are expressionless and very hard to watch on screen because of the lack on intrigue and character. Donny has ZERO personality...It makes the viewer really frustrated to not know any backstory to a character. Andy was just a quirky guy, no substance, no background... no follow up. I'm sorry but I'd suggest not watching this movie.","user":"langstonmegan","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"boring","rating":4,"date":"31 October 2017","review":"lame movie. legit had to skip through it sucks because the characters were likable and it had promise. it just dragged on a lot and really there was nothing redeeming about it at all in the end. just don't watch it, save your time, you're gonna think its gonna be good because its indie and cutsie and reminds you of movies that are much, much better.<br><br>don't do it.","user":"slowguy","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"Vapid","rating":2,"date":"25 March 2018","review":"The two main characters were not likable and it was difficult to sympathise with them.<br><br>The direction was very amateur. Oddly jarring cut scenes, dialogue that seemed unnatural, unbelievable or over-the-top performances played for comedy but falling flat.<br><br>I think Andy played a believable love interest however there was never any resolution to his story.<br><br>There are many good films about love triangles; this is not one of them.","user":"hal_hunt-81-867994","rank":[4,6]}]
