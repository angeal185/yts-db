[{"title":"Art Deco Science Fiction","rating":4,"date":"4 May 2004","review":"There are some film classics that we have almost lost. I don't mean the might-have-beens, like Laughton's \"I Claudius,\" but films that were released and quite successful and are now in grave need of rescue. The hallmark of such films is the terrible quality of the available prints because the master negative is lost. \"My Man Godfrey\" and \"Nothing Sacred\" come to mind. And, of course, \"Things to Come\". <br><br>If the abstractions of the art deco aesthetic could be reified into a story, \"Things to Come\" might be the result. If the Chrysler Building really were a rocket ship and could fly past the moon and stars and comets of art deco friezes...if we could look into those naive mindsets, whose visions of man's destiny were being energized by the discoveries of relativity, atomic energy and deep space...we might indeed embrace the images of \"Things to Come\".<br><br>Some of the scenes may strike us a corny - as might those of Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" - but they are no cornier in their context than those in \"2001, a Space Odyssey\" or, for that matter, \"Starship Troopers\". Here is an honest attempt to project the world into the future, not some silly cowboys-in-space flick. <br><br>\"Things to Come\" makes only a couple of demands: first, that we ditch our smug sophistication and presentist prejudices; second, that we have the discipline to see past the print quality. It may take repeated viewings, as it did with me, but in the end you will be rewarded by a unique odyssey, not into our future but into the future of history.","user":"jacksflicks","rank":[106,123]},{"title":"\"Is it this? Or That? The Universe? or Nothingness?\"","rating":17,"date":"17 February 2003","review":"Powerful, yet creaky science fiction film from the 30's by the Korda clan. H. G. Wells's work is brought to the screen as a vision of what warfare will bring mankind in the century to follow.  The film shows the destructive nature of war and how is will catapult us back to a state of barbarism, warlords, and another Black Death-like plague called the \"wandering Sickness.\"  However, because man clings to science, man will rise above all this and create a new, modern society free of warfare.  The film has a lot of historical inaccuracies to its discredit NOW, yet much of what is preaches is plausible sometime, and much of it has some truth to it in some form.  The theme that man can prevail and keep discovering/conquering new vistas is a laudable one.  The film shows that progress and science are the things which advance us as a people.  I thought of Ayn Rand and Atlas Shrugged as I heard one of the characters say something to the effect that the scientists/inventors had formed their own civilization, free of corruption and violence.  The pace of the film is somewhat tortoise-like at times, yet many scenes are very compelling.  The set designs are outstanding in the futuristic world of 2036(where they valiantly try to put a rocket in space to make a preliminary orbit around the moon).  Acting is good with Raymond Massey and Cedric Hardwicke giving good performances, but it is Ralph Richardson as a \"Boss\" who deserves the most praise for giving a powerful performance of a man with inherent human traits that stymie progress.  A though-provoking film indeed!","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[54,61]},{"title":"Despite The Flaws A Hugely Imaginative Piece Of Science Fiction","rating":8,"date":"11 January 2010","review":"There be very little doubt that HG Wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century . Jules Verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices . Wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales . Perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including Richard Dawkins consider it a near certainty . There's no evidence of this of course and one can't help wondering that is was Wells who introduced this to human thinking ? Undoubtedly it was Wells that planted the seed .<br><br>THINGS TO COME was adapted by Wells himself from his own novel . It is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays . The dialouge is often laden , heavy handed and unconvincing . One case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war \" Why must we murder one another . Why ? \" This mirrors the criticism , near naked contempt that Orwell had of Wells in his essay Wells , Hitler And The World State and it is true that Wells anti-war message is painfully overstated . It'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an RAF pilot and his opposite number in the Luftwaffe a few years later <br><br>That said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from 1935 predicting a world wide war taking place in 1940 that heralds the end of civilisation . There's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of The Wanderng Sickness is wonderfully realised . Even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature It's the images that makes this film along with Arthur Bliss score that makes the film so memorable . And to be fair Wells does ask the question \" The universe or nothing . What shall it be ? \" . In short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive","user":"Theo Robertson","rank":[13,13]}]
