[{"title":"Very Strong","rating":7,"date":"21 November 2019","review":"Strong performances, intimidating villains, claustrophobic situations; this level of authenticity is very seldom (if ever) found in Hollywood where they go for safe and cheap thrills. There's no superheroes here, no easy resolutions, no good guys. It's all gritty and grey and asphyxiating in its determination to drive the plot forward without relying on the usual stupid (albeit entertaining) tropes.<br><br>Somehow, in this age when we've already seen all there's to be seen in such a thoroughly explored genre as this (crime, drugs, gangs), this movie still manages to deliver and I applaud it.<br><br>All in all, Realistic: 8, Immersive: 8, Entertaining: 5, Resourceful: 7, Suspenseful: 7.","user":"Tyndareon","rank":[22,31]},{"title":"Slow","rating":2,"date":"31 August 2019","review":"The twist at the end is interesting but the journey is painful. You don't care about any of the characters. Its slow. Screenplay was thrown together in five minutes. Meh.","user":"dabeava","rank":[32,51]},{"title":"Extreme Violence But It Kept Me Engaged","rating":6,"date":"4 December 2019","review":"Extreme violence and some confusing plot elements in this crime thriller, but it did keep me engaged throughout with its air of menace.<br><br>Liam Hemsworth stars as Moe Diamond, a jeweler and money launderer, whose friend Skunk (Emory Cohen) has hooked him up with some jobs for his mobster uncle (Zlatko Buric). However, Moe and Skunk decide to do a multi million dollar drug deal on the side which goes terribly wrong and all kinds of mayhem will ensue. The twists at the end just add to all the wild and crazy happenings.<br><br>Overall, if you don't mind the over-the-top violence, the explicit language, or some confusing plot elements the film did keep me engrossed throughout.","user":"larrys3","rank":[9,13]}]
