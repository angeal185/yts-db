[{"title":"Inspired storytelling","rating":9,"date":"12 May 2002","review":"K-Pax is a very intriguing film.  Is Prot (Kevin Spacey) really an alien, or is he a mentally deranged human who just thinks he is an alien?  That is the question that Dr. Powell (Jeff Bridges) must answer before the self proclaimed deadline that Prot sets for his departure from Earth.<br><br>As the film unfolds and more evidence is uncovered, both theories grow in credibility.  His ability to map from memory the area of the galaxy where his home planet is located indicates a knowledge that no human could possibly possess.  Yet the hypnosis sessions lead us to a real person with a very real and traumatic life, filled with devastating events that could have caused such a personality aberration.  The ending seems to give the answer, but is just ambiguous enough to make you wonder if you really know. Normally, I don't like lady or tiger endings, but this one is tantalizing. I have my own theory that fits all the clues, but I don't know that my theory is any more correct than anyone else's.<br><br>Director Iain Softley (`Wings of the Dove') spins the tale delicately, with great skill.  This is a rare example of the director staying in the shadows and inducing outstanding acting performances out of talented actors to let the story dominate.  This is not to say that the directing is technically inferior, because it is excellent.  However, Softley remains unobtrusive, delivering great power through the use of subtlety, a pleasant change from today's vanguard directors who visually grab and shake the viewer as if to scream, `Look how brilliant I am!'<br><br>Kevin Spacey once again delivers a marvelous performance as Prot.  This is a part that is extraordinarily demanding, requiring Spacey to render the cool and logical Prot one minute, and then switch gears to conjure his tormented alter ego under hypnosis the next.  Spacey is so believable as both alien and human, it makes the viewer's task that much more difficult.  Jeff Bridges is also terrific as the relentless psychologist who becomes obsessed with learning the truth about Prot.<br><br>This is inspired storytelling for the thoughtful viewer.  I rated it a 9/10. If you must have closure at the end of a film, this movie will be very frustrating.  However, if you like a fascinating mystery that keeps you thinking long after the credits, you won't be disappointed.","user":"FlickJunkie-2","rank":[254,271]},{"title":"A Charming, Hidden Gem Of A Movie","rating":13,"date":"13 April 2002","review":"It never ceases to amaze me how movies like this get made.<br><br>No car crashes, no explosions, no pyrotechnical performances with people screaming at each other or themes/bravura megalomaniacal rants that self-consciously have \"Please nominate me for an Oscar\" whispering in the Academy's ear.<br><br>No, instead we're given a quiet, enormously fascinating, compassionate, well-intentioned film that sits back and realizes that above beautiful cinematography (Which it has in spades), before performances which nail you to your seat (Which it carries in abundance), the most important thing of all is story.  And K-Pax despite all \"common sense\" in Hollywood, throws out every safe-bet to get a movie produced and gives us just that.  Wonderful story.  Marvelous story.<br><br>I don't need to talk about that.  Everyone from the science fiction fans (Who appreciated the depth and seriousness of the subject matter) to the warm n' fuzzy brigade (Who \"Get the message\" of the movie) have done their part to praise the various facets of a film that refuses to be categorized and is simply a very, very good story.<br><br>And perhaps because of that, because no one knows precisely what it is, just that's it's wonderful--Not unlike Prot himself--the people who came to this picture and created it have made a film that doesn't slant itself one way or the other but does a wonderful job of juggling seemingly disparate elements--the science, the drama, the message,the psychological aspects--and approach the movie fresh-eyed and innocent.   The cinematography is, at times, simply beautiful and inspiring.  And Iain Softley obviously had an enormous respect for the material because when it came time to tell the stories and let it speak through the actors, he pulled back, kept it simple and left the audience to witness to incredible performances by Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey to leave viewers with the same feeling; the acting is beautiful and inspiring.<br><br>Kevin Spacey's \"Prot\" is a wonderfully understated character with the gentle, knowing presence of an outsider who understands.  It is his very calmness and seeming omnipotence that make his emotional outbursts, when they come, that much more intense and painful for audiences.  He brings to the story the delicate sense of ironic humanity that comes from someone who may not actually lay claim to being human.<br><br>Jeff Bridges provides the warm, tired, cynical but still hopeful center of the film that provides reality to Spacey's quiet otherworldliness.  Jeff Bridges is the much needed Everyman of this movie who is like so many of us out there; intelligent, wanting to do the right thing, essentially a good person at heart who is perhaps little lost and a LOT tired of the shackling nature of every day life in a first world nation.  He asks the hard questions, he clings to his perceived reality.  But he also wants to help. And all he's looking for is an excuse, some kind of spark to ignite his hope.<br><br>I suspect that K-Pax is going to occupy the same space in most people's hearts as that of a good book.  I can't see it raking in buzillions of dollars, despite the fact that far, FAR less worthy films do that every summer.  Instead, it will carry along, fondly or even maniacally supported by lovers of the film by word of mouth, quietly finding a new audience and making change where ever it goes.  It's a gentle, engaging, quiet film that punches viewers between the eyes not through editing, action or shouting, but through that most basic and often forgotten art of cinema, finding a strong story and just letting it tell itself.","user":"shoeless-1","rank":[370,398]},{"title":"One of the most underrated films of the past decade","rating":9,"date":"11 March 2006","review":"Due to a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw this film in theatres at the relatively young age of 10. The trailers on TV portrayed the film as a comedy, and I bugged my parents until they took me. After seeing the movie, I was blown away. I had no idea what to think. Totally different than anything I had seen before, leaving far to many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning was the first time I'd watched in in probably 2-3 years, and I still think it's one of the greatest films made in the last decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in top form, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist that develops a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. The supporting cast are near perfect as well, each resident of the mental institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. The open ending was handled very well, giving lots of evidence to support whatever you believe happened in the end. How this movie failed to receive at least a nomination in that year's Oscars is beyond me. If you haven't seen this film, run to Wal-Mart RIGHT NOW. The DVD is usually in the bargain bin, pick it up! <br><br>9.5/10","user":"Vampenguin","rank":[167,186]}]
