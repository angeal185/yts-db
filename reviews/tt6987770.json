[{"title":"Funny and charming","rating":8,"date":"8 January 2019","review":"I laughed almost from start to finish. Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder are adorable together as two ridiculous people in a ridiculous situation. Anyone who likes dry humor and flawed, broken characters will love this movie.","user":"shell-74334","rank":[98,108]},{"title":"Before Sunrise for the broken","rating":10,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"Really, really enjoyed this film. I haven't laughed so many times watching a movie in quite some time. The dialog is fantastic and comes at break neck speed expertly executed by both actors as if it were their own words they are speaking. Great seeing Keanu in a comedic role and Winona, well, just in anything. These two make a great pair. Definitely worth a watch. Charming film.","user":"michaeljohnson2020","rank":[315,372]},{"title":"Very wordy and clever, laughed out loud and found it amuzing","rating":8,"date":"8 September 2018","review":"Just saw this movie with my 18 year old son. We both laughed out loud. It is a very verbose script with lots of sardonic humor and dialogue. But we really liked it. Always a fan of Rider and Reeves. They are just my generation and I have a certain affection for their movies. What was surprising is that my teenage son liked it so much. I was a little skeptical taking him to see it because I knew it had mixed reviews. In the end he said he found it entertaining. The whole movie is all about the two charters meeting each other and their interpretation of the wedding. There is no other context or character interaction, but it works. It's an amusing delightful weird unorthodox relationship movie.","user":"amerry-21798","rank":[172,211]}]
