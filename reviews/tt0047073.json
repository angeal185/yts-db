[{"title":"actually surprisingly good","rating":8,"date":"21 May 2008","review":"Yeah, it telegraphs all of the big \"reveals\", it has some overly dramatic acting, the major plot points are easy to see coming, the \"red shirts\" are obvious, the scenes are kinda cheesy, the characters are all one-dimensional, the plot motivators are simple (\"he needs fresh air\" or \"we didn't have time to test the torpedo tubes\") but dang I loved it! It was almost like a bond movie without the gadgets, the unbelievable stunts, or the bad double entendres. It is an instant classic in my book; it is just on the edge of something that you can take seriously. If you go in not expecting much and you realize that this was made many years ago before all of the methods used in it became trite due to overuse, then you will walk away with a smile. There are many worse submarine movies, some of which consist of \"I'm in charge!\"...\"No I'm in charge\", while this one has some strategy, some minor humor, some action, and some larger-than-life threats, and some explosions.. all in all worth the rental.","user":"j_chy","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Them Dastardly Reds","rating":5,"date":"21 May 2005","review":"Hell and High Water is a great Fifties film with Richard Widmark and his handpicked crew of WWII veterans trying to foil a dastardly Communist plot to start WWIII.<br><br>Widmark is a former submarine commander who's been hired to check out a secret base that the Communist Chinese seem to be building in the islands north of Japan. The group that's hired him is some kind of consortium of western scientists who seem to be operating as a secret society. Like Captain Midnight or heaven forfend, the Tri-Lateral Commission.<br><br>Parts of the plot and definitely some of the footage is taken from another submarine picture that 20th Century Fox did, Crash Dive. It's so obvious, especially when you have Richard Widmark's voice with no closeups, over the footage from the previous film. That also concerned a secret Nazi base in the Atlantic and the submarine crew that went to clean them out.<br><br>Along for the ride in the submarine are scientists Victor Francen and his assistant Bella Darvi who was Darryl Zanuck's main squeeze at the time. Ms. Darvi had a short and tragic life and her story would make a real interesting picture.<br><br>Far more interesting than this, though I will say the submarine special effects are outstanding.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Silly criticisms","rating":7,"date":"29 August 2006","review":"While I was earnestly waiting for some of the moments of hilarity one of the reviewers wrote about (which I never found), I thought it would be worthwhile to point out some of the sillier criticism also made.<br><br>First of all the bucket scene happened before the ramming scene - not after. Plus, submarines have buckets on them. Isn't that strange. It seems the makers of submarines sort of figured stuff like that out - sometimes subs take on water and it must be moved. And yes, they would have lots and lots of buckets. More than one sub in WWII was saved because of them. The reviewer may also not have seen the part where the buckets are being returned.<br><br>He also comments on if the sub was already underwater, where were they taking the water. Again, submariners got that one figured out too. They were taking it to a place where there was a working pump to pump the water off the sub.<br><br>Overall it was a decent diversion. But then I'm a fan or Richard Widmark so I may be biased.","user":"joe-1035","rank":[18,23]}]
