[{"title":"Real Samurai example!","rating":7,"date":"20 May 1999","review":"American cryosurgeons tried to anatomize frozen body of Yoshimitsu Taga, the great samurai general of 400 years ago, then found he had been in suspended animation. Occasionally, a guard of the institution tries to steal the priceless katana(samurai sword) of resurrected warrior, to be slashed with the very treasure. Yoshimitsu wanders about modern American town, happens to slay street gangs with guns to save an old man. Yoshimitsu is living in laws and morals of ancient war age, so that is very natural to him. But cryosurgeons want to kill him secretly to avoid trouble, and of course, police force tries to shoot him down...<br><br>You can easily see how silly the plot is, however, I recommend this film. The samurai in this film is REAL. Actor Hiroshi Fujioka is genuine sensei of swordsmanship, so he knows how to use katana and how a samurai think, feel and act in a strange situation. Fujioka's presence made this lame plot a memorable tragedy.<br><br>Magnificent and sad music by Richard Band is another salvation of the feature.","user":"Vlad-27","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"\"Action thrills from the makers of Troll!\"","rating":5,"date":"12 July 2010","review":"\"Action thrills from the makers of Troll!\" Yoshimitsu (Fujioka) is a Samurai in 1500's Japan. A duel goes awry and he falls into a frozen lake. When some skiers discover his frozen body in the 1980s, Yoshi is shipped to L.A. supposedly for an autopsy at the California Institute For Cryptosurgical Research. The building is inexplicably gigantic. Dr. Richards (John Calvin) decides to revive him and it actually works.<br><br>Yoshi is helped by Chris Welles (Julian), a scientist who speaks some Japanese. She befriends him, but when a greedy orderly tries to steal Yoshi's swords, the orderly is killed and Yoshi escapes into the go-go 80s.<br><br>What will happen to this ancient warrior in the modern world? Yoshi sees a helpless old man being menaced by a gang of 50 year old punks and, true to his samurai code of honor, decides to intervene. The guns and knives of the AARP punks can't compete with Yoshi's top quality samurai swords.<br><br>Fujioka is excellent as Yoshi. He brings much more class than is needed to this Charles Band production. He looks at cars, lamps and TVs like they are new and strange things. He is totally believable doing this. A movie highlight comes when he sees metal band W.A.S.P on a TV and gets scared.<br><br>Two humorous bits are when, firstly, the character of Burger is introduced. He is a lazy, cigar-chomping slob and provides some mild chuckles. Secondly, when Yoshi enters a sushi restaurant, a man exclaims: \"It's Toshiro Mifune!\".<br><br>The character of Chris narrates the tale. Is it necessary? Only you can be the judge. One of the more interesting aspects of Ghost Warrior is how Yoshi's old life parallels his new life. The film cuts back and forth between the two.<br><br>According to the back of the VHS box on the Lightning label, Ghost Warrior is in the \"Time warp tradition of Iceman!\" We would also add Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time (1991) and Encino Man (1992).<br><br>The movie is somber and somewhat mediocre. There's not a lot of action until the end and is worth seeing for the performance of Fujioka and not much else.<br><br>For more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com","user":"tarbosh22000","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Imaginative samurai timewarp concept.....","rating":6,"date":"20 March 2008","review":"Instead of trotting out a generic plot, \"Ghost Warrior\" is propelled by it's imagination. Suspend disbelief, sure, but this \"fish out of water\" scenario works. The story is straightforward and almost fable-like. The introduction of an honorable 16th Century fighting arts master to the sometimes dishonorable reality of modern Los Angeles, inevitably forces confrontation. An ancient warrior, re-animated by science, must battle for his life. The film is beautiful, especially flashbacks to the samurai's past. No better than average acting is easily forgiven, because the imaginative script holds your interest. Recommended for anyone looking for something out of the ordinary. - MERK","user":"merklekranz","rank":[8,10]}]
