[{"title":"Does Family Dysfunction Rate Tabloid Coverage? Yes, If You're British!","rating":7,"date":"21 July 2012","review":"Tom (Chris Langham) and Sophie (Amanda Hadingue) have an ordinary upper-middle-class British life; having raised two daughters to adulthood, they perhaps don't have much to say to each other any more, but they are rubbing along more or less comfortably, companionable at least in their care of their three-legged dog Boy. One afternoon, Tom is walking in the neighbourhood woods and comes across Blake (Colin Hurley), an apparently odd but gentle and perhaps sad man with some strange story-telling ways; on an impulse, Tom invites Blake home for tea, and he ends up staying for the weekend. At the end of which time, unfortunately, Blake has died at the family table; even more unfortunately, news of this gets out to the British tabloids, who accuse the family of being murderers. How they got to that point, and how to straighten it all out again, is the focus of \"Black Pond.\" The story is told documentary-style, with the family members all being interviewed, along with family friend/kind-of mascot Tim Tanaka (Will Sharpe), himself rather confusedly in love with both daughters. As a result, we know at the beginning that Blake will be dead at some point. The way that events unfold is shown in flashbacks, while each family member has an entirely different take on what is going on and on who Blake is, as well. We never fully know who any of these people are, except that they are all quietly unhappy in that snarky, sometimes vicious British way. But they are all generally good people, with the definite exception of Eric Sacks (Simon Amstell), a self-styled \"psychotherapist\" whom Tim visits, only to be subjected to merciless, mean-spirited mockery. Only at the very end do we find out what really happened, and it turns out to be, in its way, rather beautiful.<br><br>This is a short film at 82 minutes; it's got a lot of biting dialogue that co-writers Tom Kingsley and Will Sharpe have honed to a fare-the-well, and the actors are quite wonderful, especially Langham as Tom and Hurley as Blake - there's a lovely, poetic sense of connectedness between these two men who have been strangers up until 10 minutes ago, and the two actors do a terrific job of bringing that relationship out. If you're not fond of British family (melo)drama, this might not be for you, as the marital relationship in particular is quite harsh and mean at times, but there's much to be said for the simple connections that are also present in the film; one wants to know how these people will be getting along 5 years down the road, or 10. I don't know if there are any release dates set for North America (the showing at FantAsia 2012 was the Canadian premiere), but it's well worth looking out for if it comes your way.","user":"alisonc-1","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"Ignore the IMDb summary,it's not really about a murder!","rating":8,"date":"13 December 2011","review":"Please don't let the IMDb summary,and indeed the film's own trailer deceive you. This film is not really about a murder,except that's what they are accused of.It's about a dysfunctional couple(with two away from home daughters) and how their lives are changed,and indeed turned upside down by the entry into their lives of a clinically depressed neighbour called Blake. It's one of those films that will benefit from repeat viewing,as it has many nuances that you just cannot pick up in one time. A good thought provoking,and at times moving film. Do give it a try.I am not sure how this film will go down in the US,as although they have the same family problems there,they also have a different way of looking at things.","user":"winles","rank":[28,34]},{"title":"an independent black comedy surely set for cult status","rating":9,"date":"28 February 2012","review":"An incredibly impressive debut film from youthful newcomers Will Sharpe  and Tom Kingsley. Black Pond is a delightfully grim black comedy about  the Thompson family, who're embroiled in a tabloid scandal about the  death of a new family friend. They say that truth is stranger than  fiction and, while this IS fictional, it has a realistic plausibility  and a documentary style which makes the almost farcical events seem  hilariously absurd in contrast with the repressed sobriety of the  upper-middle-class English milieu.  It's one of these films that will have you grinning like a Cheshire cat  all the way through, giggling and snorting like a child who's just  heard an old man fart during a quiet church service and eventually  letting out a proper belly-laugh every now and then.  Colin Hurley, Amanda Hadingue, Simon Amstell, Will Sharpe  (writer/director/actor) and the whole cast are excellent and Chris  Langham makes a long-awaited return to film (with the controversy of  his own personal ordeal with negative publicity perhaps adding its own  somewhat dark undertone to the film  almost definitely NOT a conscious  effort by the producers though!).  It's a fine example of typically British satirical wit and exemplary of  the potential of indie cinema, considering it was made on tiny budget  of £25,000. The lack of money means this film will only be seen by few  people on its limited release, but as it gathers rave reviews and  serious respect, it will no doubt earn cult status by the time it's out  on DVD.  More like this and more from Sharpe and Kingsley please!","user":"Greigx3","rank":[22,36]}]
