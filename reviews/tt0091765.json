[{"title":"A Missed Opportunity","rating":1,"date":"10 May 2005","review":"As an avid cricket fan, I am constantly puzzled and dismayed by the negative depiction of the sport on the big screen. Sadly, \"Playing Away\" is no exception.<br><br>A group of West Indian cricketers from inner city London are invited to participate in a charity match against a village team from rural Suffolk.<br><br>So far so good. But rather than portraying cricket as a potent social glue, the director instead chooses to use the game as a source of anger and bigotry. Throwing in some predictable racial stereotypes for good measure.<br><br>Indeed, the only time that black and white appear to reach an \"understanding\" is illustrated in a particularly tacky scene when one of the visiting players has sex with a local girl in the village churchyard.<br><br>\"Playing Away\" was released at a time in the eighties, when British movie makers felt compelled to \"educate\" their audiences about perceived social injustices rather than just try and actually entertain them.<br><br>Little wonder then, that UK cinema goers preferred watching Bruce Willis blowing up a fleet of jumbo jets in a vest as opposed to this moralistic claptrap.<br><br>I for one cannot blame them.","user":"robert-turner-1","rank":[6,23]}]
