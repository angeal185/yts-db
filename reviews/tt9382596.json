THAT'S how awful I believe this movie to be.<br><br>I found this movie while browsing for something to watch one day and was so excited to watch it. I couldn't believe they made a sequel to one of my favorite movies of all time and I hadn't heard about it! Within 5 minutes I was almost in tears with disappointment and I sat thru the entire thing hoping... praying it would redeem itself. It never happened. This is the first time I've had a top 5 favorite movie of mine spawn a sequel that became one of the top 5 WORST movies I have ever seen. The story sucks, it's hard to follow, it jumps all over the place, and \"The Car\" is just a casting extra in the movie. The worst part was where I could see the cameraman in one scene (when the girl gets off the elevator in the office building and walks by the desk, look at its reflection). Total garbage. 2 Girls 1 Cup was a better example of filmmaking than this.","user":"pseudodoodoo","rank":[7,10]}]
