Well-trained and endowed with magical powers, they must fight Rumpelstiltskin and his army of thralls before he enslaves everyone on earth<br><br>It could lead to a good story... But it didn't. The acting is hurtful and embarrassing, the plot ridiculous and even the fighting scenes are horrendous. So if you've got time to spare watch something else. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!","user":"sputnik2905","rank":[45,59]},{"title":"I didn't last 30 minutes.","rating":19,"date":"19 March 2015","review":"Why isn't there a negative scoring system? 1 (Awful) is being kind.<br><br>There is a 10 paragraph review in here on this film and I couldn't keep a straight face whilst reading it. Let this be a lesson; Trying to ride on the backs of multimillion dollar movies with a budget of $25 is not advised, even if you do have the opportunity to hire 5 MILFS and a couple of actors ready to shame themselves due to owing a backlog of rent. I suppose one shouldn't blame the actors, we all have to eat. I suggest to them a change in Agents. <br><br>I would rather wait for eternity for the right script and never see it than enter into a project that would of stunk on paper as bad as this surely would of.<br><br>This film was made as a tax write off, Right? .. Right? I believe I probably watched it a little longer than most, right up until Snow White demanded the others \"Get In The Car!\" at which point I watched the rest in fast forward skip mode.<br><br>To painful for words. Do yourself a favor and stick to the original fairy tales &amp; marvel Comics that this modern pooper derived from.","user":"dabalonairian","rank":[50,70]},{"title":"Not Actually Terrible!","rating":5,"date":"18 June 2015","review":"This movie has a lot of problems. There are moments of truly terrible acting. Some of the lines are extremely poorly written. There are continuity issues (especially glaring \"how did they run off and suddenly get to a completely different location in a split second?\" ones.) The character motivations and choices are some so illogical, and so bad, that they make no sense, some of the characters are ill defined, and the progression is sometimes so so, sometimes obvious, and even sometimes just bad. And all this, this gigantic pile of weird- bad, the movie isn't terrible, not actually. <br><br>The name choice doesn't help. It's a terrible choice for a name for this movie, other options, pretty much any other option, would have been better. It sounds like it'd be a comedy-style-version of avengers, but it's not. It has nothing to do with Marvel at all! <br><br>The core concept though, it's really not bad. <br><br>This is a movie that has moments of true B movie hilaribad and the occasional moments of \"oh my gods this would be awesome if it wasn't bad\". <br><br>If you like B movies, and are a forgiving personality who can laugh at the parts that don't add up, this is a diamond in the rough.","user":"hminiarj","rank":[16,20]}]
