[{"title":"How does something like this get approved for production.","rating":1,"date":"23 May 2005","review":"Sometimes we can be over critical of a movie and call it the worst EVER made. but this is one film that i couldn't be critical of enough.<br><br>it's a family film i guess but it's not even slightly funny on any level. the performances of all the cast is woeful, Ice Cube snarls and does his usual thing so i suppose he does fine, but the leading lady and children act like they have been plucked off the street. its embarrassingly bad at times, then again i guess the abysmal script doesn't help. C'mon who writes this rubbish. Fart gags, puking gags, and i need a pee gags. it really is terrible.<br><br>If someone suggests renting this out from the video store i'd run a mile. avoid at all costs this is TERRIBLE.","user":"james_kelly547","rank":[66,110]},{"title":"Worst movie EVER","rating":1,"date":"19 March 2005","review":"I have never written on IMDb and never have on any other movie review sites but i felt compelled to for this one. What a load of garbage. The worst movie i have ever seen at the movies by far. I was coaxed into going little did i know that it was a kids movie - it has Ice Cube in for God's sake. I thought at least it could be like one of those crappy DMX action movies but it wasn't even up to that low standard. I mean come on people! A summary of why this the worst movie i have ever seen<br><br><ul><li>typically American style for a kids flick - ie really cheesy, corny lines, happy ending - need i go on - predicable - gee, i din't see that last seen coming - nothing new: man falls in love with a woman the first time he sees her - had no moral message - Plot summary: just cos she's beautiful; he offers in an attempt to get into her pants to look after her kids who surprise surprise are brats; they don't like like him at first then they end up liking him; the woman doesn't appreciate what he does until she sees how her kids love him and see him as their new dad; then the final scene is them kissing on new years at midnight - </li></ul><br><br>Absolute GARBAGE - i cannot emphasizes this enough If any sane mined person with an IQ of above 50 wants to spend $12; WARNING this not the way. The only thing that kept me in the theater for the whole tow hours 110 mins was the comfortable seats<br><br>rating:0/10000000000000000000000000000","user":"nedzelic","rank":[27,42]},{"title":"Real laughs from clean comedy and a cute story line","rating":8,"date":"21 August 2005","review":"What is up with the low ratings? This movie had us laughing all the way through it! Clean, somewhat predictable but in a fresh way. These kids did great in the movie; we enjoyed it a lot! Could easily lend itself to a sequel and another \"road trip\" kind of scenario. I see it as engaging and charming as \"Home Alone\" was so many years ago. I did think the mother's reaction at the end was a little extreme and that could have gone differently, but I didn't expect an Oscar-winning storyline with this fun, punchy, movie. I guess if there had been more swearing, sex, and violence it would have caught on better; seems to be where our culture likes to go these days. I say kudos to the writers and actors...you done good with this one and guess what...we're going to watch it again today!","user":"srmtn1","rank":[38,65]}]
