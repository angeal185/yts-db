[{"title":"Hilarious and touching.","rating":8,"date":"29 August 2017","review":"If you watch the trailer, you'll know everything you need to about this fictional documentary of a short-lived TV show that never existed. It's a sober look at an utterly bonkers Japanese program, in particular the troubled but brilliant (or perhaps not) actor, writer, and director Takeshi Takamoto. The aspect of this film I appreciate the most, besides the comedy, is that it actually delivers emotional moments and the story is not so crazy that it defies plausibility. One could easily be forgiven for thinking it's a real documentary about a real show.","user":"jonathan-a-chapman","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Why isn't this on Netflix?","rating":10,"date":"24 December 2017","review":"This film needs to be seen by a larger audience outside of the festival circuit. Really hope a streaming service picks it up in 2018. Go see it if you get a chance.","user":"sumwhanino","rank":[4,11]},{"title":"Why was this made?","rating":3,"date":"6 February 2020","review":"For one this is all just a tease. It's a movie in documentary style about a movie that was never made. I think I'm going to watch a purposely made cheesy 80's samurai movie but it's not that at all. Was disappointed and I don't understand why they just didn't make the move but only made a couple of scenes to refer to as context.","user":"boogyknightz","rank":[0,0]}]
