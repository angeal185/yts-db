[{"title":"Great movie.","rating":9,"date":"27 February 2019","review":"I've seen quite a few animated movies, but this one was very theatrical and memorable. Great choice of cast for voices, great story, and great animation. Not just a kids movie -- a lot of adults will like this as well.","user":"rdoubleoc","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Great songs and great characters","rating":9,"date":"26 November 2016","review":"I knew I was in for a good music movie when the first song gave me chills.<br><br>I went into this movie expecting lots of songs and gags, and they are there, but I didn't expect to start caring about the characters and their stories. SING brings together a talented cast and writers for a movie that transcends some of the animated movies out there. The whole family loved it so feel free to bring anyone from 5 on up. Even the younger ones may enjoy it when it's available at home.<br><br>Every voice actor delivers and the animators nailed it. The pacing and directing are also very well done. In fact, I could have done with even more of the \"auditions\" at the beginning.","user":"klchu","rank":[114,160]},{"title":"I don't know what's wrong with this rating","rating":10,"date":"18 May 2019","review":"This animation is quite amazing. The animation as well as the story is really awesome. It's rating should be 8.0 or more in my sight. Don't believe me! go and see this movie and judge my review","user":"siamngnt","rank":[5,5]}]
