[{"title":"Mythica The Iron Crown: Part 4, on par with the rest","rating":6,"date":"10 October 2017","review":"I love fantasy genre films, there simply aren't enough of them. When Hollywood make them they're often pants and when indie developers try they usually swing above their weight and simply can't make a movie of that type on such a limited budget.<br><br>Along came Mythica back in 2014, a crowd funded fantasy effort that though flawed had a real charm about it and developed a real following and a flock of sequels.<br><br>4 movies in, with the same cast and following the same story, Mythica is holding ground and though nothing special in the grand scheme of things they are perfectly watchable.<br><br>Here our party of heroes return minus Teela who fell in the last film, with a returning Kevin \"Atheists are bad derp-de-derp\" Sorbo and arch villain Necromancer.<br><br>As with the previous three I enjoyed every hokey minute of it and was left wondering what the Mythica series could have been with a bit more money behind it.<br><br>With a delightful recurring cast and a real light hearted charm Mythica scores with a win again even if it isn't a big one.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Fantastic cast as usual<br><br>Some great ideas<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Kevin Sorbo<br><br>Not the best story","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Enjoyable fantasy","rating":8,"date":"14 May 2017","review":"I picked this up in the charity shop. I hadn't seen any of the earlier Mythica movies but that wasn't necessary. The film does a good job of setting the scene, and you get the idea of what it is all about from the first 10 minutes or so. The plot at first seems somewhat contrived (apparently there are several powerful magical artifacts involved), but as the story progresses it begins to make more sense. The main characters have good chemistry and I thought that the \"bad guy\" was really good too. Of course, it's pretty standard Dungeons &amp; Dragons fare (the main characters are a Mage, Ranger / thief, and a Fighter / Paladin) but if you are OK with that then you will enjoy this.","user":"fig-75275","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Good looking, and, um...","rating":7,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"Episode 4 sees Marek and chums in pursuit of something or other, probably another bit of the Darkspore, in a pickup truck dressed entirely in old floorboards, while pursued by some bloke with tomahawks, a flying machine also made entirely of old floorboards, and assorted thingies in black bin liners. Eventually they end up in a shalliow lake where an ancient Egyptian bodybuilder hangs out.<br><br>I now know what to expect. Production value in costume and locations, special effects ambitious but limited, acting adequate, fight choreography unconvincing, script OK, story a bit ho-hum. And there's usually a moment which makes you go \"Oh, come on!\" In this case, Marek is rolling around fumbling for her staff while the creepy bad thing which is trying to kill her... doesn't.","user":"neil-476","rank":[2,2]}]
