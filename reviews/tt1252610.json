[{"title":"Comic off-road movie about loneliness in a remote winterland","rating":9,"date":"1 May 2009","review":"This film got highly praised at the Berlin festival before it's cinema release in Norway, winning two of the main prizes. It also became a huge hit at the festival, with tickets going on the black market.<br><br>Well, the film isn't a blockbuster. It's a nice, though tragic, but warm story about 30 year old Jomar, not particularly successful in his life. Actually his life stinks, and he has problems. And he knows it. Lying to his shrink, living unhealthy, and not caring about anything. In fact so uncaring, that he finds himself burning down the ski center where he works, almost forcing him to look somewhere else for the meaning of his life.<br><br>So Jomar goes off on a 900 kilometers trip up North to find what is supposed to be his four year old son, of which he didn't know about, before slapping his best friend who'd run off with his girlfriend some time ago.<br><br>On this trip he meets all kinds of lonely people, all having some kinds of wisdom to offer. And Jomar? Does he change their lives? Maybe he does...<br><br>This story by Norwegian master-writer Erlend Loe, gives a great feeling of both great winter-nature, and human understanding. It'll be seen upon as exotic by most foreigners, and the film has some scenes you'll never forget. <br><br>This film is another example of how great Norwegian storytelling on film has become. Great acting, also from the amateurs. No fake Hollywood stuff here. Pure Nordic realistic storytelling with a hint of humor. If you liked the films of Bent Hamer and Coen-brothers, you also like this. <br><br>The only thing dragging down is the film being too short. We'd actually like Jomars trip to be longer. And that's a sign of a great road move. Or rather, a great off-road movie, since the film is more going on off-road, than on road. I still think I'll put it in the genre of road-movies.<br><br>Another spot on Norwegian film! What a gem!","user":"OJT","rank":[41,45]},{"title":"a wonderfully droll, delightfully surprising, unexpectedly funny and offbeat road movie from Norway","rating":7,"date":"27 August 2009","review":"NORTH is a wonderfully droll, delightfully surprising, unexpectedly funny and offbeat road movie from Norway of all places. Jomar has been traumatized by recent events from his past and has sunk into a quagmire of apathy and indifference. But one day he gets out of bed determined to change his life. He heads out across country to visit his child, travelling some 900 miles by snowmobile and, when that breaks down, skis. Along the way he is literally burning his past behind him. The people he meets along the way also help him reassess his life and move on. Making his debut feature, Rune Denstad Langlo's direction is suitably low key and he delivers a droll and visually stunning movie that finds humanity in the loneliness of the long distance traveller. There is a winning performance from Anders Baasmo Christiansen, and the largely non-professional supporting cast adds to the film's eccentric nature. Philip Ogaard's rich widescreen cinematography captures the superb wintry, snow-covered landscapes, and Ola Kvernberg's beautiful score adds to the film's immense pleasures. A real winner!","user":"gregking4","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Little Big Man on a snowmobile","rating":8,"date":"1 February 2010","review":"I saw this last month at the 2010 Palm Springs International film Festival. This is a quirky dark comedy written for the screen by Erlend Loe who also wrote a book that another great quirky Norwegian film was adapted from recently called in it's English title Gone with the Woman. Nord reminded me an an abstract sense of the film Little Big Man where the lead character goes through a journey meeting a wide variety of people along the way in wonderful small on screen roles with even an old wise and worldly Saami fisherman waiting to die instead of an old wise and worldly native American waiting to die. Jomar (Anders Bassmo Christiansen) is a former skier who works at a ski hill and has battled alcoholism and has been hospitalized with psychiatric problems since he lost his girlfriend five years earlier. After a fight with his former best friend Lasse (Kyree Hellum) he learns his former girlfriend had a son by him so he sets out on a snowmobile for an improbably long journey of a few hundred miles to northern Norway near the arctic circle. He meets along the way some very isolated people in Lotte (Marte Aumemo) and her grandmother, Ulrik (Mads Sjøgård Pettersen), and Ailo and his granddaughter. (Lars Olsen). Excellent winter scape cinematography by Phillip Øgaard and smartly directed by Rune Denstad Langlo this is not a long film and it's definitely worth a look. I would give this an 8.5 out of 10 and recommend it.","user":"johno-21","rank":[9,10]}]
