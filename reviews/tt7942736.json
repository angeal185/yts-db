[{"title":"Boring to almost unbearable","rating":3,"date":"2 September 2019","review":"The message at the beginning states \"Based on real events\"; I really cannot believe events so absurd and forced could ever happen.\nThis is another Mossad movie where agents are incredible bland with everybody but themselves. Where forced and basically unrealistic setups are used in order to obtain information but at the end things solved just miraculously.\nA great actress as Monica Belucci is basically unused here. An outstanding actor as Kingsley has to carry a character that too boring and to be bland to be realistic.\nThe rest of the cast simply cannot act.\nThe story starts interesting for the first minutes; but then expends almost two hours in father / son relationship or on love story; both of them unnecessary an unrealistic and completely boring.\nWhen the not so unexpected ending comes; it is almost impossible to believe a bunch of incredible smart people were played for fools. Do not waste your time it is pretty stupid and worthless.","user":"abisio","rank":[34,41]},{"title":"Is Kingsley joining Michael Madson and Nicholas Cage","rating":15,"date":"15 December 2019","review":"Seriously, is there some giant hole in his pocket to explain that he has been in nothing but pure garbage the past five years?","user":"random-70778","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Unbearable writing, I couldn't finish past the 2nd half","rating":3,"date":"4 September 2019","review":"1 hour and 53 mins of blah blahhh blahhh. Wow, what were the writers thinking? As a fan of Ben Kingsley, all the useless, boring and unnecessary dialogue they gave him, made even him unbearable. I guess the producers never heard of editing a film down with proper pacing to make it viewable. This should be a 1 star from me, but all 3/10 go to Ben Kingsley and the fairly decent directing and cinematography.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[23,35]}]
