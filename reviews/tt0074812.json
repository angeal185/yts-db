[{"title":"Before Luke, There Was Logan","rating":8,"date":"18 April 2002","review":"In the year 2274, a faction of the human race, following global war and other apparent catastrophes that have ravaged the Earth, live together in a giant domed city, completely sealed off from the outside world. Here, in this bubbled society, the young, healthy, beautiful people who populate it live in total and complete pleasure, free of labor &amp; strife, and free to do anything &amp; everything they want, sexually or otherwise. It's a total state of hedonism.<br><br>But there's one catch: no one is allowed to live past the age of 30. On your 30th birthday (known as \"Lastday\"), the little jeweled lifeclock attached to your hand blinks, and you must be expelled from this society of pleasure through an arena event known as \"carrousel,\" in which, the city's young people believe, your soul is \"renewed,\" afterwhich you will be reborn into the city's society and start all over again.<br><br>But some 30 year-olds in this city know the real truth about carrousel---that it is, in fact, a death sentence---and they try to escape. They're called \"runners.\" The domed city has a faction of policemen who hunt down runners, and they're called \"Sandmen.\" Logan (Michael York) is a 26 year-old Sandman. Life in the city is good for him, but suddenly, he is given a secret mission by his boss---the city's master computer---that will change him. Logan's assignment is to go undercover as a runner, escape the city and go outside, where he is to find a so-called haven for escaped runners called Sanctuary, and destroy it. But Logan soon learns the truth about carrousel himself, and, with the aid of a beautiful girl named Jessica (Jenny Agutter), whom he falls in love with, he must now figure out how to free his people from their horrible fate at the age of 30....<br><br>1976's \"Logan's Run\" is an all-time science fiction classic, and one of my personal favorite films ever since I first saw it on TV as a kid. I've always been fascinated by the storyline, and although the film's Oscar-winning visual effects have long since been surpassed, they're still quite colorful to look at (including the groundbreaking use of holography). There's fine performances all around, such as the perfectly-cast Michael York as Logan, the very lovely Jenny Agutter as Jessica (she &amp; York have terrific chemistry together), as well as the delightful Peter Ustinov as Old Man (who Logan &amp; Jessica discover living alone with his cats outside the city), Richard Jordan as Logan's best friend Francis, and there's even an enjoyable appearance from Farrah Fawcett (Majors) in her sexy, 70's prime, as an attractive assistant working in a facelift shop called New You. And director Michael Anderson steers the film quite nicely from beginning to end.<br><br>Some have criticized \"Logan's Run\" as being too long, saying that the film bogs down in the middle when Logan &amp; Jessica get outside the city and meet the Old Man. I say hogwash---I've always enjoyed this part of the film, featuring Ustinov's charming turn as the Old Man. Besides, it's an important part of the story, as Logan &amp; Jessica fall in love with one another, and learn through meeting the Old Man that there IS, in fact, life after 30. Without this segment of the film, \"Logan's Run\" would be pointless. It's there for a reason, and I like it just as much as the rest of the film.<br><br>Upon it's release in 1976, \"Logan's Run\" was arguably the \"hippest\" sci-fi film ever made up to that point. Then, of course, the original \"Star Wars\" was released the following year, which pretty much knocked \"Logan's Run\" off the sci-fi pedestal. But no matter---the film remains an enduring classic of it's genre, with a big following to this day. Over 25 years later, \"Logan's Run\" is still a ton of futuristic fun. :-)","user":"Gazzer-2","rank":[134,156]},{"title":"And I Thought Turning 40 Was Supposed To Be the Bad Age....","rating":7,"date":"11 June 2000","review":"I must admit that I should be ashamed as a sci-fi fan: I hadn't seen this film until recently, and I wanted to better understand the parody from \"Free Enterprise\".<br><br>But I enjoyed the film.<br><br>Watching this film against the more recent glut of sci-fi films, I have to say that they made them a little more original back in the 70's-80's, instead of everything being techno-computer-CG-spaceship fights.  A grim look at the downside of maintaining an \"ideal\", utopian society.  When you hit 30, you either have the option of willingly submitting yourself to be killed under a pretense of renewal, or having the Sandmen play with you before they go in for the kill.  Neither option seems really appealing.  But the idea of one of the killers having to face their mortality is an interesting idea.<br><br>A little slow in places (but I did keep wanting to see what would happen next), and some of the special effects look really dated (even to '77's \"Star Wars\"), but the story holds up well, and it's an entertaining ride overall.<br><br>It's truly a classic of the genre, and I wish I had seen it sooner.","user":"GuyCC","rank":[101,119]},{"title":"Dated, a bit silly, but still fun","rating":23,"date":"23 May 2004","review":"I was twelve when Logan's Run came out and I thought that it was the best thing since sliced bread. It blew me away. So when I picked it up recently on DVD and watched it for the first time in twenty-eight years I was wondering how it would fare after all this time.<br><br>Well, not too badly. Many of the IMDb reviewers of Logan's Run hit the nail on the head when they say that this film is definitely a product of its time. Yes, the special effects are sort of laughable now (the teeny tiny maze cars zipping through the a model of the city that looks about six inches tall), but you have to judge those sorts of things in the context of the time they were made. As strange as it may seem to people who now expect Lord of the Rings-quality special effects, Logan's Run was cutting edge in its day. And a few of the special effects still stand up fairly well. The light envelope that comes down over the Carousel or the matte shots of Washington. Not great for twenty-first century film-making, but a minor miracle for 1976.<br><br>The story has more holes than a piece of swiss cheese and the acting is a bit touch and go, but that doesn't get in the way of a fairly entertaining movie. Seeing the movie all these years later I suppose the few moments of bad acting hit me more than anything else. As a kid I thought that Peter Ustinov's old man was brilliant, but now it just seems like awkward overacting. Which isn't to say that his character isn't somewhat endearing.<br><br>Michael York, a really wonderful actor, misses the mark a few times, but generally he and Jenny Agutter do a fine job.<br><br>Listen, this isn't a brilliant movie, but it does have its moments. Most science fiction movies made in the 1970s haven't endured the test of time especially well. With the purple mascara, pastel-coloured costumes and hair feathered like a great phoenix. But all in all I still found Logan's Run to be an entertaining and enjoyable trip back to the strange world of 1976.","user":"roulin","rank":[190,230]}]
