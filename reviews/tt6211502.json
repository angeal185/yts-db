[{"title":"Could have been better without the melodramatic villain","rating":5,"date":"15 January 2017","review":"Last night Lifetime offered a \"world premiere\" of something called \"Open Marriage,\" a TV- movie from our old friends at MarVista Entertainment, directed by Sam Irvin from a script by Jason Byers and apparently shot under the working title \"To Have and to Kill.\" I'd been determined to watch this movie ever since I saw the promos, mainly because — unusually for a Lifetime movie — it features two devastatingly hot guys, Tilky Jones and Jason Tobias. The plot: Becca (Nikki Leigh) is a doctor with a killer work schedule who wants a child and is getting worried because her husband Ron (Tilky Jones) doesn't seem capable of giving her one — not that they've had sex in quite a while. Ron is a struggling builder trying to put a contracting business together but he needs a big job to do that — which he hopes he has when the city they're in decides to build a community center and he thinks he has a good chance at landing that contract. Becca has a friend from her college days, Mindy (Kelly Dowdle), who's married to a 1-percenter (though we're never told just where his money comes from or what he's doing career-wise now) named Max (Jason Tobias), who's pretty much the same physical type as Ron — only Max has frizzier hair and Ron has an elaborate tattoo covering most of his left arm, which is the main way you can tell them apart. The film shows us a lot of Ron and Max in bathing suits and nothing else (way to go!) for the straight women and Gay men in the audience, while any straight men watching this get enough glimpses of Becca and Mindy similarly attired in swimwear to get their sort of charge. During one evening when the two couples are having an outdoor get-together Max and Mindy announce that they've \"opened\" their marriage to sexual experiences with other couples. Ron and Becca are reluctant at first, but the mere thought of a four-way with their good buddies turns them on enough they get it on for the first time in months. Ron, Becca, Max and Mindy have their first \"open\" encounter at Max's home and set ground rules — they won't do anything unless all four are involved and they'll use \"protection\" against both pregnancy and STD's. Their second open encounter occurs at a private sex club called Caligula (which made me wonder if they specifically catered to people who want to have sex with their siblings, the way the real Caligula did), which you get invitations to through text messages on your smartphone that tell you what the password is for that night. (No, it's not \"Swordfish.\") <br><br>Had screenwriter Byers stopped there he might have had a very interesting movie about people who think they can handle the sexual underground, find they really can't, and suffer picturesquely along the way before reverting to monogamy at the end. One particularly interesting twist is that Ron isn't entirely infertile but he's told by one of the doctors at Becca's hospital that he has only one-one hundredth of the chance of impregnating his wife as a normal man. That leads to the tantalizing possibility that the entire \"open marriage\" business was stage-managed by Becca as a way of having a child; since her husband couldn't give her one, she decided to go after Max and see if he could do the job (which could have led to an intriguing sequel 20 years later, as the kid, now grown, learns that his biological father is fabulously wealthy and goes after his money). Instead \"Open Marriage\" takes a turn into typical Lifetime melodramatics that significantly weaken it. \"Open Marriage\" could have been a titillating joyride and a moral tale instead of writing the \"villain\" character in and turning the resolution flat and ordinary.","user":"mgconlan-1","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Don't understand giving it more than one star","rating":1,"date":"28 June 2017","review":"Don't understand how anyone can give this movie more than one star.<br><br>First, it was pretty obvious from early on that Mindy was the villain in the movie and she was the stalker. The way she kissed Becca on the cheek at a lunch and the fact that she was buying her matching dresses was a dead give away. Also, it was pretty easy to tell that Mindy was the one in the club with the mask on and the straight hair.<br><br>Next, I originally thought Max was really cool, but as the movie went on, it turned out that he was actually quite wimpy.<br><br>The acting in this movie was atrocious! The ending was no surprise, but what I was surprised by is the way both men took a passive role in taking Mindy down. Max actually made Becca do the deed, while he and Ron did nothing. Even when it looked like Mindy might shoot Becca, there was no reaction or help from the men. Max had not heartbreak or shock that his wife was the one? At the end, Becca and Ron were all sweet and happy when they found out who was the father of her baby. They made out on the couch like all's well that ends well? After what they had just been through and all the cheating, they are back to normal that very night? This movie could have been done a lot better. It was disappointing.","user":"treesh-30563","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Typical LMN letdown","rating":1,"date":"13 February 2017","review":"Am I the only one that seems to have realized that Max and Becca were having an affair all along? Although the movie itself never shows them together alone, it becomes obvious in the movie that all of her double shift at the hospital may not have really been double shifts. This all becomes evident at the last dinner between the couples. It was obvious at their last lunch date when all four were getting the text messages. when the message comes through about Ron, she is so upset, and then the message comes through about her (Becca)and Max, Becca stands up and admits they did in fact go back, but that wasn't the worst part and before Becca can admit everything, Max abruptly ends everything and tells them to get off of his property. It's made even more clear at the end of the movie when Becca gets a paternity test. Why would a woman need a paternity test unless she had been having unprotected sex and unfaithful? She knew what she was doing, she just wanted a baby and I can understand that, but using her husbands best friend?????? The whole open marriage thing was just a set up so they (Becca and Max) could get together in a more open setting without the sneaking around, which would cost him (Max) everything. If you watch and listen real close when she (Becca) sneaks and goes back to the club a second time, Max is already waiting for her at the Club. He says just because Ron and Mindy want to call things off, doesn't mean things have to end between us (Max and Becca). Thats when Becca rubs her belly and indicates to Max that she is pregnant and that she is calling things off between them. She tells the man whom the thinks is the father before even telling her husband, but only tells her husband she didn't want to tell him until she found out there were no complications.<br><br>For a LMN movie, I guess it could have been better and should have been in more detail, but this is what I've come to expect from Lifetime.","user":"machhh","rank":[4,5]}]
