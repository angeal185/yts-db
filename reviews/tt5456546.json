[{"title":"Bollywood is not progressing because of this","rating":30,"date":"30 September 2017","review":"Rating: NA Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor said that Bollywood makes garbage movie because film lovers don't want to watch good movies. This is partly true. Cine goers seek entertainment, not preaching documentaries. However Bollywood has always been best when it mixes entertainment with light moments and some lessons. Whenever such movies are made they work wonders. Judwaa 2 does not fall in that category. It is a typical pot boiler that takes Indian film industry and audience 20 years back to a senseless subject for over two hours and you are forced to move out before your head blasts. There was no point in making the remake of a typical comedy that makes you smile even today. With added loudness and overacting by the three leads, this movie is an indigestible Masala.","user":"saketsaurav-86828","rank":[43,45]},{"title":"Movie gave me Cancer.","rating":1,"date":"29 September 2017","review":"I thought the 90s were already over. Don't know why they choose to remake the movie and call it \"Judwaa 2\". Everything was same like the early movie \"Judwaa\" then what's the point in making remake. I think Bollywood is running out of story. <br><br>They just copied everything don't know what to watch. Movie made me sick can't tell about acting also when all frames are clich√©.<br><br>If you know this is a remake you are old too. I could write better stories than this in my sleep. Call me Bollywood.","user":"DeadMan66","rank":[55,60]},{"title":"this is the kind of movie because of which people think Bollywood sucks.","rating":1,"date":"30 September 2017","review":"a guide on how to make a Bollywood movie.<br><br>1) take a guy (who thinks he can act but in reality a goat can act better then him) he must be son of a director or an actor. 2) take some hot girls(acting skills not required coz no one gonna watch there acting anyway) 3) copy script from Hollywood or tollywood.<br><br>4) take old songs n put some shitty music in it(lets call it remix) 5)make girls dance to those shitty songs in short skirts n let the guy show his abs.<br><br>6)go to every accessible place on earth for promotion.<br><br>7) cross your fingers and hope for stupid people to watch your movie.<br><br>8)profit.","user":"chinu-97000","rank":[84,94]}]
