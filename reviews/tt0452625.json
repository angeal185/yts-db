[{"title":"Many funny parts in a not-so-funny movie.","rating":6,"date":"8 September 2007","review":"If you like Dane Cook then chances are you have seen his movies and while Good Luck Chuck is better and in some instances funnier, it still is just another Employee of the Month. I personally enjoy Dane Cook's humor and I thought Employee of the Month was....decent. I was hoping Good Luck Chuck would be a hilarious smash hit but throughout the advanced screening I kept thinking to myself \"Okay well this is funny but it's so typical.\" Now I don't want to give anything away but let's just say if you've seen at least one romantic comedy in your life then you know the entire story of Good Luck Chuck already. <br><br>Don't get me wrong, I laughed pretty much all the way through the movie although there were occasional points where it died down a little. Sad to say there were only a few really memorable funny parts to the movie though. Most was just slapstick style humor and revolting sex jokes. The humor in Good Luck Chuck was by far raunchier than Employee of the Month but then again that was PG-13 and this is R. <br><br>I mentioned that the movie was typical and when I say typical I mean every romantic movie cliché possible was used. It was like they took a blueprint for a love story and then just added Dane Cook and Jessica Alba and then made them do funny things. Granted there are moments where they stray a little or add a funny twist to the formula but it definitely didn't take long to come up with the progression of love in the film.<br><br>If you want your next dose of laughter after Superbad then go see Good Luck Chuck but don't expect anything new or inventive in terms of storytelling. It is however something to note that there are tons of sex scenes, lots of boobs, extremely raunchy jokes, and Jessica Alba does not reveal any body parts although some side boob can be glanced for a brief moment in the movie. (Just an FYI for all those who were dying to know)","user":"stronz-1","rank":[136,197]},{"title":"Better luck next time, Dane","rating":5,"date":"13 September 2007","review":"A very uneven comedy. If 3 out of every 10 jokes working is enough for you, then go ahead.<br><br>If you're hoping to see Dane Cook (nearly) undressed, you won't be disappointed. He strips more in this movie than Demi Moore in \"Striptease\".<br><br>If you're hoping to see Jessica Alba undressed -- too bad! Scanty attire is the best you'll get.<br><br>If you're hoping to see Dane be as funny as he is in his stand-up -- you'll be disappointed.<br><br>If you're hoping to see Jessica be funny -- what are you, nuts? She's got no comedy chops! And that old tired \"pretty girl falls down a lot\" shtick wasn't funny when it became a movie cliché about 5 years ago.<br><br>The only funny moments seem to be when Dane is improvising. When he's doing the written parts of the script, it clunks hard. (Him dressed in a penguin costume? Yikes.) The two leads try SO hard to show us they have chemistry (a lot of shoulder wiggling and cutesy facial expressions mostly) that it backfires.<br><br>There were a lot of gross-out moments that just weren't funny -- the fat sidekick scrubbing his backflap with a scrub-brush for sexual pleasure, a penguin eating his crap, two seduction scenes with obese women (straight out of \"Norbit\" -- also unfunny).<br><br>The sidekick is so foul and obnoxious he throws the movie completely off-balance. You feel like the movie needs a sorbet after one of his scenes to get the bad taste out of your mouth.<br><br>The only likable person was the guy playing Jessica's brother (Lonny Ross of \"30 Rock\"). I actually think he might have made a better romantic lead, than Dane -- who was somehow off-putting.<br><br>Maybe Dane will have more input into his next comedy movie. Maybe that will help.","user":"hellokristen","rank":[209,320]},{"title":"Nothing special","rating":4,"date":"18 September 2007","review":"Keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy 'Good Luck Chuck.' Overall, the movie is generic and predictable. Cook and Alba do good jobs with a paper-thin script and add some great moments with the physical humor such as the flying dental tools and jump starting Dane Cook as seen in the trailer. However, this is also one of those movies where most of the best punchlines are in the trailer which is disappointing.<br><br>Expect lots of nudity from everyone including Cook but not Alba. 'Chuck' comes well stocked with lots of naked girls and breast jokes. However, be warned if you're trying to make this a date movie and know there are some very crude parts to this movie. 'Chuck' definitely earns his 'R' rating.<br><br>Cook doesn't evolve much from 'Employee of the Month' here but he is enjoyable. Alba is decent at the comedy. Together they have a alright chemistry but the movie is so typical it takes away from the overall experience. <br><br>One last note. Cook's sidekick, played by Dan Fogler, is extremely annoying and ruins the momentum of the movie on more than one occasion.","user":"daveandthomas","rank":[97,160]}]
