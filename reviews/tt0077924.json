[{"title":"A good portrayal of a moment in time?","rating":9,"date":"6 January 2006","review":"According to reports at the time, the Federal Republic of Germany (or \"West Germany,\" as it was known then,) became somewhat of a police state in the mid-70's.<br><br>The embarrassing, massive blunder of the Munich '72 Olympics segued into the Baader-Meinhoff, and at some point the German government started using police tactics that had more to do with Orwellian practices than civil rights. This movie reflects that, and it does so while showing the arduous process experienced by its protagonist (admirably played by Bruno Ganz,) who must literally rewire his brain after the forces of the State almost kill him by mistake and then try to blame him in order to cover things up.<br><br>There must have been a measure of freedom left in W. Germany for this movie to have come out somehow. Is Ganz's recovery (from vegetable back to human being after having had his memory wiped out) an allegory of Germany itself (from Nazism to freedom and back to a police state again)? Go figure. All I know is that is movie left an indelible impression in my mind, which is saying a lot in an era when German cinematography was coming up with a gem every other month.<br><br>Seek it out.","user":"brownieboy","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Great actor Bruno Ganz in at once serious and humorous movie.","rating":9,"date":"12 December 1999","review":"This movie is both serious and humorous and it's worth seeing alone for the superb acting of Bruno Ganz. He's just so watchable and has an amazing way to deliver his lines. It also has one of the most scary and brilliant endings I know. It makes the movie continue in your head after the credits roll.","user":"jorgen.dss","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"A regrettably overlooked masterpiece","rating":12,"date":"12 April 2001","review":"Bruno Ganz is astonishing as a man recovering from traumatic brain injury. His performance is more realistic than most cinematic depictions of brain injury (aside from the idea that brain surgery could have been performed without shaving his head!), which is in itself remarkable; the many ways in which there is a knife in his head, literally and figuratively and symbolically, add layers to an already brilliant performance.<br><br>Angela Winkler also shines in her complex and troubled relationship to the injured man.<br><br>It's been years since I saw this film, and yet it stays with me.  I really want to see it again.  I have to say I think it's a real shame that it was not more widely seen initially, and that it never seems to make it back to the revival houses...","user":"agnest","rank":[19,20]}]
