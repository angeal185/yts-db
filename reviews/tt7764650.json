[{"title":"IMDB really needs to get a handle on these fake reviews","rating":1,"date":"18 October 2018","review":"The first four 9/10 star reviews are all from brand new users with only one review, yep, this mess of a film. It's so obvious it's laughable.<br><br>At what point is IMDB going to do something about this. It's unfair to everyone.","user":"BananaHeads","rank":[60,84]},{"title":"Unrelated, uncoordinated jumps from one scene to another..","rating":1,"date":"18 October 2018","review":"There's no flowing story line it just jumps from one scene to another nonuse watching this","user":"lfc-09524","rank":[60,85]},{"title":"What movie did the rest of you watch?","rating":19,"date":"19 October 2018","review":"Pay no attention to the positive reviews on this \"film,\" obviously they were not watching the same movie I was. The acting is non-existent, the plot is about 10 minutes long stretched out to 80+ minutes and worst of all, it's just plain a chore to play attention. I realize I'm not the demographic for a Logan Paul movie but I've seen more cohesive and better productions from a grade school Christmas play. Your kids will love it but please for your own sanity don't let them talk you into watching it with them.","user":"misko3000-222-576900","rank":[47,69]}]
