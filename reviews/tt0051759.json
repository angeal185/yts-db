[{"title":"A funny and fascinating story with a great lead from one of many wartime heroes","rating":15,"date":"15 February 2004","review":"When the British intelligence service is faced with the challenge of convincing the Germans that they intend to invade from North Africa they are stumped - the attack is clearly going to come across the channel into France, they know it and the Germans' know it.  However, when Major Harvey visits a theatre he happens upon an actor who impersonates General Montgomery as part of the show.  Within days Corporal Clifton-James is recruited to impersonate Monty in the Mediterranean in order to trick the enemy into thinking an attack is due from that direction.<br><br>I only found out about this film after hearing the Goon show's spoof `I was Monty's treble'; at that time I was vaguely aware of the history, but not of the details and not of this film.  The film is based on the memoirs of the events from the point of Clifton-James himself and are reasonably factual, despite the fact that the film has an enjoyably comic tone to it for the majority.  What it does do very well is to portray him as a real person; his reluctance to take the job, his nerves, his insecurity and so on - at no point is he a strong-jawed, guns-blazing hero, instead he is a man doing what he needed to do in wartime.  This really helps the film and is actually complimented by the comic tone.<br><br>What helps it even more is the presence of Clifton-James as himself.  His performance is very normal - by which I mean he never plays to the fact that he is a hero, he comes across as a very unassuming gentleman, as I find those who serve in the military in a low/medium rank for some time tend to be.  In both his book and this film he could have made himself look more heroic and less reluctant but he never does.  Mills is excellent in the supporting role and enjoys a more comic touch than many of his war films allow him.  The support cast are just as good and it is fun to see so many well known faces including Cecil Parker, Sid James, Leslie Philips and John Le Mesurier sending up the profession of acting!  Of course it is Clifton-James who is the draw even alongside these big names; he is a true hero - and it's impossible to forget that as you watch this, these are not fictional risks, he lived this for the greater good.<br><br>And it is this that made the film so fascinating to me.  Many flag waving films will miss this point, but heroism is often not natural; it often comes forced onto people and is found in the most unlikely of places.  In this film we see first hand how an ordinary man with no real confidence or ability is called and rises to the challenge, not because it is his dream or desire but because his country needs him and needs must.  Although he plays it quite light here, I will always remember what he did and who he was - I shall be looking for his book on the internet once I finish writing here.<br><br>Overall this is a tremendously fun war movie.  It lacks action until the end and focuses on Clifton-James as a person as he goes from put upon little actor in the military to one of the most important people in the Normandy landings.  A fascinating story, a real inspiration and a funny film to boot - should be seen by as many people for as long as possible. Lest we forget.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[41,41]},{"title":"I'm glad Montgomery led the troops, but I'd rather have a good chat with Clifton-James","rating":7,"date":"30 January 2008","review":"As improbable as it seems, Hitler sent a panzer division and 50,000 troops to the south of France just before the Normandy invasion. Hitler did it because he was so impressed by the performance of a second-string actor who up to May, 1944, was most proud of his lead role as Charley's Aunt in British regional rep. In this case, however, M. E. Clifton-James was playing Bernard Montgomery. Clifton-James bore an uncanny resemblance to the field marshall. When MI5 realized this, they organized one of the great WWII cons. Up until then, Clifton-James had been a middle-aged, low-ranking officer, in for the duration, who'd wound up in the Royal Army Pay Corps. He was pulled out of that, assigned for a few days to Montgomery's staff posing as an enlisted man so he could secretly study Montgomery's mannerisms and style, then sent as Montgomery first to Gibraltar and then to North Africa. Once there, posing as the field marshall, he attended high-level meetings, reviewed the troops, gave inspiring speeches...and all the while MI5 was insuring that his \"secret\" visits were being leaked to German intelligence. Would the Germans take the bait and believe Monty was prepping the field for a major landing at the underbelly of Europe? MI5 and Clifton-James had their answer when German fighters attacked the transport carrying the false Monty to another North African location. Then German commandos arriving by sub managed to kidnap \"Montgomery\" and move him to the beach before British soldiers (in the movie, two good-looking officers, one played by John Mills) daringly rescue the actor, who by now had fainted. <br><br>All true? Well, supposedly, most of it. I'd take the kidnapping and the rescue with a grain of salt. Clifton-James after the war wrote his auto-biography titled \"I Was Monty's Double\" and it sold briskly. He was 46 during the seven weeks of his training and impersonation. MI5 kept him in seclusion in Cairo until after the Normandy invasion, then returned him to duty in England in the Pay Corps. He probably never had a better role, and certainly never a more important one, in his life. He was 60 when the movie was made and died five years later. He carries off playing himself very well. He holds his own with John Mills as the fictional Major Harvey and Cecil Parker as the fictional Colonel Logan. Parker runs the scam; Mills makes sure Clifton-James doesn't lose his nerve and stays with him during training and in North Africa. This being a sort-of Mills war movie, Mills is cheery, competent and loaded with upper-class confidence, either when trying to rekindle an old love while on leave or gunning down a large group of tough German commandos. <br><br>The tone of the movie, with a screenplay by Bryan Forbes, is one of British insouciance, the undertaking of deadly serious actions with under-played bravery and deprecating humor. Some of the humor comes from cracks made by Mills as Major Harvey about actors' vanity. The last 20 minutes of the movie turns into a more standard war story with a midnight beach landing, silent knifings, an attack in the waves and bullets flying on the beach. The movie regains its footing of good cheer at the close. <br><br>I Was Monty's Double may not be an unknown war classic, but it's a well-made, well-scripted and well-acted movie. M. E. Clifton-James turns out to be a sympathetic and even endearing person, something that would never be said about Montgomery.","user":"Terrell-4","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"'Monty's' Grand Tour","rating":7,"date":"22 August 2010","review":"With some considerable dramatic license the story of one of the best intelligence operations of World War II is told in I Was Monty's Double. The film is based on the book by actor F.E. Clifton James who plays himself and Bernard Law Montgomery as he did for a fateful few weeks in World War II.<br><br>John Mills and Cecil Parker two officers from British Intelligence become James's handlers in the terminology we would use today. Mills while attending a service variety show sees James do a walk on as Field Marshal Montgomery and is struck by the audience reaction to him. The germ of an idea comes to Mills to have the actor play Montgomery for the widest audience possible, to give him a grand tour of the various fronts of the war. This in order to divert Nazi attention from the United Kingdom where the cross channel invasion is being prepared and Montgomery very much a part of the planning. In fact you can see some of his real role there in the TV mini-series Ike and in The Longest Day.<br><br>Of course James carried the masquerade off beautifully. My favorite scene is James at a press conference in Cairo with allied war correspondents where he's at first hesitant with this cynical bunch, but grows in confidence and wins them over with a speech that you might have seen the real Bernard Law Montgomery deliver during his lifetime.<br><br>Two others who give noteworthy performances in the film are Michael Hordern as the Governor General of Gibraltar and Marius Goring who is a German agent whom Mills, Parker and James deliberately give misinformation to in order to confirm how effective the plan is working.<br><br>The whole business in the end is pure fiction which I won't reveal, but that doesn't detract from making this a first rate account of an amazing adventure. One even Stephen Spielberg would envy.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[8,8]}]
