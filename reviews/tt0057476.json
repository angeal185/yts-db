It helps,also, that the investigating officer seems to have an uncanny knack of getting to the heart of the matter - without seemingly doing much investigating - and thus does all the figuring out for you.<br><br>Aren't aside, it boasts wonderful ensemble playing from actors, many of whom I've come to know and love as staples of the series, including Joachim Fuchsberger, as Dick Alford; Werner Peters, as Fabian Gilder, and a young Klaus Kinski, as an ex-con butler.<br><br>The film has a number of good nocturnal chase scenes, excitingly filmed. It also boasts a wonderfully kitschy soundtrack.<br><br>Ratings-wise, I'd probably say 7/10: the first-third of the film where too many characters are introduced causes it to drag, unduly; the final third more than makes up for it in my book; as does the ensemble playing, the chase and fight scenes; the music, and the nocturnal cinematography.","user":"Joseph_Gillis","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Atmospheric Edgar Wallace thriller!","rating":3,"date":"3 January 2004","review":"Atmospheric Edgar Wallace thriller, about a large treasure hidden in an old country estate.  Several persons show up, who happen to be employed by the lord of the estate, but only to get their hands on the treasure. However, a black-hooded killer soon makes his entrance, and begins killing those who know the secret.  This is one of the better Edgar Wallace thrillers I've seen to date, and features some really spooky scenarios.","user":"copycat1025","rank":[4,7]}]
