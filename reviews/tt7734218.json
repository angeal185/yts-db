We enjoyed it.","user":"nicduffy","rank":[49,71]},{"title":"fun movie!","rating":8,"date":"4 October 2019","review":"A perfect light evening filler where I laughed a lot. Bautista and Nanjinani worked great together. A movie I would probably watch again, which I can not say a lot these days.","user":"nyodoko","rank":[41,60]},{"title":"The Marketing Almost Killed This","rating":6,"date":"1 August 2019","review":"There are many reasons to be grateful for movie theater subscription cards, but the biggest one is that I find myself checking out movies I wouldn't normally have gone to see, mainly due to poor marketing. Stuber is the common case of an awful marketing campaign that turned out to be a pretty solid summer buddy film, with two rising stars in Hollywood in Nanjiani &amp; Bautista. It borrows from many buddy-cop classics but their chemistry is enough to put some of the comedy that falls flat over the edge and bring some laugh out loud moments to the forefront. Granted, there were many big comedic scenes that were in the trailer, but that's inevitable in this day and age, and shows you even further how poor the marketing was for the film. It won't make enough money, but I could have definitely gone for more entries into this series with Bautista &amp; Nanjiani.<br><br>6.9/10","user":"ThomasDrufke","rank":[29,42]}]
