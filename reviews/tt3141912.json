[{"title":"Gun Woman","rating":2,"date":"23 June 2015","review":"The Japanese are renowned for their whacky sense of humour, but they also have a darker side, or in this case a sicker side. Sadism, rape, murder, necrophilia, cannibalism? These are schoolboy jokes, not adult entertainment. Alas, all and more are included herein. The wife of a doctor is murdered before his eyes by one of the most degenerate human beings on the face of the planet; the doctor himself is crippled by the same lowlife but left alive so he can tell the world what a wonderful person his benefactor is. Not. He decides not unreasonably to exact revenge on this individual, and comes up with an extremely novel plan (one that is physically impossible in several ways). This is where Gun Woman comes in.<br><br>At this point she is his slave, but he promises her her freedom if she completes her bloody mission, which involves an act of mass murder, even granted that all those who are to die almost certainly deserve it. Can she really trust this man though, who murders an innocent woman in front of her eyes as part of her training? More to the point, doesn't the Doctor realise he has become what he seeks to destroy?<br><br>Any points this one gets are strictly for mild special effects, and a half decent soundtrack by Dean Harada.","user":"a_baron","rank":[15,21]},{"title":"What a mess!","rating":1,"date":"28 January 2015","review":"I decided to watch this film, because the concept struck me as interesting. As a scriptwriter and film buff, I'm always open to unconventional ideas.<br><br>I forgive low budget results, but I don't forgive sloppy film making.<br><br>The basic premise of this movie revolves around the promise of nudity, blood, and action. The nudity is fine. The blood is fine. The action is eh with some interesting nude fight scenes. The music, lighting, and photo direction is low quality.<br><br>The story is where things really unravel. We're told early on the 'master mind' is a cripple. He can barely walk, but during the training sessions he can fight like bruce lee.<br><br>The training sessions are far from interesting and take up a good chunk of the movie running time. Yawn, yawn, and more yawn.<br><br>We're told she must bury the weapons in her own body to smuggle it. The guards use guns linked to their own finger prints to ensure that they can't be used against them. Fair enough. Ever heard of a knife? She manages to take out one bulky guard in hand to hand combat with no weapons. Why not cut off his finger to use it on the gun? There is also a lack of emotional connection with the main characters. The mastermind is seeking revenge over the death of his wife, but he coldly kills a naked woman to showcase how long it takes for someone to bleed to death from a breast wound. Yikes! I'm not sure what is more creepy, his psychotic Japanese lectures, or the mad laughter of the necrophiliac that peppers the film in disturbing frequency.<br><br>The suspension of belief hit another brick wall with the whole bleeding thing. How can the woman tear up her flesh to extract the gun parts without shutting down from pain? The amount of so much blood pouring out of her in seconds makes it hard to believe that she can still stand let alone fight. At the rate of blood flow, which magically disappears later, 22 minutes seem impossible.<br><br>Overall, this is a 1 star movie. It's worth watching for the nude fighting scenes. I'm of the opinion that this idea should be transplanted into a different story, which is better executed, and hopefully with a coherent script.","user":"nineveh-4","rank":[19,28]},{"title":"The very first 5 minutes explains the rest of the film.","rating":1,"date":"13 May 2019","review":"The assassin in the very first shot of the film is played stiff as a board, wearing a trench coat, sunglasses, a moustache... ducking and diving at nothing.. walking then stopping for no reason. He gets in a car and talks to his accomplice - who is as nervous and vacant as him. Then the rest of the film is basically riding along with these two people you don't care about as they tell a story...<br><br>The best actor/actress of the film is the main character \"gun woman\", and a villain or two. The rest of the actors appear to be friends and family thrown in to fill gaps at the promise of seeing a naked lady or guy.","user":"mike-c-b","rank":[13,18]}]
