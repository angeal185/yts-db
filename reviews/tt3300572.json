[{"title":"What is a wasp's favorite movie?","rating":7,"date":"19 April 2015","review":"A horror movie doesn't necessarily always have to be good or surprising. Sometimes it's more than sufficient already if it lives up your hopes and/or expectations. In case of \"Stung\", for example, I had only set my hopes on seeing an unhinged and over-the-top giant creature-feature with plentiful of gore and a straightforward simplistic plot. Guess what! \"Stung\" delivers just that! And if you aren't too skeptical either, you're guaranteed to have a fun time with this German/American co-production that is (nearly) a genuine throwback to the glorious days of 70s animal-horror. There exist several bee-movies (like \"The Swarm\", \"The Deadly Bees\" or \"Terror out of the Sky\"), but apart from Roger Corman's \"Wasp Woman\" there aren't too many movies about killer wasps to my knowledge. The recipe for pure entertainment here exists of a totally bonkers plot, good old- fashioned gross-out special effects and bad but likable acting performances. The nervous and uptight Julia has just taken over her father's catering company and constantly worries that things will go wrong, in sheer contrast to her co-worker Paul, who just wants to relax, smoke weed and make out with Julia. They head out to cater the annual garden party of the eccentric Mrs. Perch and her creepy son Sydney at their secluded country estate. Mr. Perch used to make a fortune in the pharmaceutical business, but now his wife and son remember his death through annual garden parties where several prominent community members come to, like Mayor Caruthers for example. The evening quickly turns into a nightmare, as hundreds of mutated wasps intrude the party and viciously attack the guests. Since oddball Sydney experimented with chemical pesticides and fertilizers, the wasps are oversized and extremely aggressive  and they lay their eggs inside their victims' bodies, with horrendous subsequences. After an admittedly rather slow start, \"Stung\" is a non-stop fun and thrill- ride with too many gory highlights to list. The sight of humongous wasp-monsters bursting out of their human hosts is just terrific, especially because quite often the human leftovers – like entire heads – remain stuck on their insect armor. There's a nicely balanced mixture of traditional special effects and above-average decent computer engineered effects. The sound effects of the films are also imaginatively nasty. Apparently the sound of cracking lobster shells can be used to imitate the sound of giant fake wasps! As said, the acting performances aren't very good, but they are definitely likable. There's a nice and almost natural chemistry between Matt O'Leary and Jessica Cook, while the familiar faces Lance Henriksen and Clifton Collins Jr. are responsible for the more memorable and flamboyant supportive roles. <br><br>Oh, and the answer to the riddle in the subject line is: Stinging in the Rain","user":"Coventry","rank":[33,51]},{"title":"Good time no alcohol required","rating":7,"date":"3 July 2015","review":"Fun fun fun ride with extremely likable characters. I will jump on a leg here and guess the budget for the movie wasn't very big, but the cast did an outstanding job. It's above average that's for sure. I mean I've seen way way way more expensive movies this year, that were classes below this one. (Jupiter Ascending is a good example).<br><br>I don't really know the two main protagonists as actors, but I sure do hope to see them again. Both are pretty natural and just plain cool.<br><br>Perfect flick with friends for a Saturday night. No nudity, its somewhat safe for juveniles as well, so bonus points for that.<br><br>If you like that genre, grab the nachos and have some fun with this one.","user":"kk-yanakiev","rank":[23,36]},{"title":"Truck loads of buggy fun","rating":8,"date":"6 July 2015","review":"Stung offers truck loads of buggy fun. From its opening scenes through to its conclusion this a fun filled, unashamedly camp horror, complete with a cast of colourful, intentionally stereotypical, characters. <br><br>Stung taps into the 1950/60's big menacing bug genre. Its all been done before but I have to say, probably not this well, in a long time. In spite of its modest budget, Stung, is a polished affair. The acting is good, the special effects reasonable and whilst the storyline is predictable, its so well presented you hardly notice. There's a few moments of black humour thrown in too, which further enhance what is already a decent film. <br><br>If you like your horror a little camp, quirky and generally over the top fun you should give Stung a try. Eight out of ten from me.","user":"s3276169","rank":[17,27]}]
