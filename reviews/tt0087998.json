[{"title":"This is the kind of horror film that inspires","rating":22,"date":"22 October 2003","review":"This movie has a bigger cult following than many might think, and I am proud to say I am part of it. I see this film in the ballpark of \"The Evil Dead\", \"Re-Animator\", \"Bad Taste\", and many other classics of splatter legend. I don't feel the need to criticize the acting (unless you count the first two hapless victims), and this is because this movie does what most movies don't with their characters: it makes them REAL people. The fantastic elements blend beautifully with the boring, frustrating mess of most people's everyday life. Still, this is a fun b-movie, which means instead of depressing us with the real-life stuff, it puts some humorous spins on it. The gore and creature FX are amazing. Don't let that R rating fool you, this is one HARD R, so those with weak stomachs need not apply. The creature FX I was amazed by most of all. I would love to know how they did this with such a low budget! Everything in this looks extremely vivid and real (with the exception of some amateurish backgrounds at the beginning and end that are obviously pictures somebody painted or whatever). Even the computer cartoons of \"Jurassic Park\" do not hold a candle to these creature FX in the least. This is definitely one of the greatest indie/sci-fi/horror/splatter films ever, and I do wonder why it hasn't got the kind of recognition that movies like \"Evil Dead\" have (no big-budget sequels maybe?). As for those who call \"Parasite\" a sequel to this, I don't get it. Not only is this a film far more superior to \"Parasite\" and was seemingly made by totally different people, there is absolutely no way to connect them unless you're talking genre-wise. \"Parasite\" is in the far-off future, this one's in the present. \"Parasite\" is about genetically engineered creatures, this one's about space aliens. This one has a sense of humor. \"Parasite\" doesn't. In any case, I love \"Return of the Aliens: The Deadly Spawn\" (no matter what title it's under) for it is the classic that \"Parasite\" should have been and much, much more.","user":"one4now4","rank":[28,30]},{"title":"Before the Slugs, Slither n Night of the Creeps, there were these slimy creatures with hell lottuva teeth. Watch out for the decapitation n defenestration scenes.","rating":5,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"I first saw this in the mid 80s on a vhs.\nRevisited it recently.\nThe initial kills r offscreen with jus blood on the ground, on the spectacles, on the bulb n on the wall with lots of slurping noise but the film does get gory later but nowhere tensed or fast paced.\nA woman's face gets munched upon by an alien suffering from bruxism.\nAn old uncle gets devoured by the aliens offscreen.\nA teenager gets decapitated by an alien's teeth n the aftermath defenestration scene of the rubber body will make u lol.\nThe salad scene from the film Slugs was inspired by a similar scene from this film.\nInspite of the running time only 82 mins, the film gets tedious considering the old ladies' chit chat n the teenagers conversations.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"A gory gem straight from the heart.","rating":26,"date":"26 February 2004","review":"I'll keep it short and sweet. If you like your horror with a big fat daddy budget, this ain't for you. there's no CGI, There's no a-grade actors, there's no intense orchestral score by Danny Elfman. So, now, for the rest of you that are left - this movie is great. It has the same elements that made Peter Jacksons \"Braindead\" and \"Bad Taste\" so good, heart. the people who made this film obviously loved what they where doing and managed to pull off some great special effects and gore whilst doing so. i wish this film had another equally low-budget follow-up because the creatures are really great and after watching it you can almost smell all those 80's creature features looming round the corner. I would be very shocked if the people who made critters hadn't watched this first. So i recommend this anyone who likes mad little flesh eating beasties and lots and lots (and i do mean lots) of gore.","user":"GraveyardChimp","rank":[20,22]}]
