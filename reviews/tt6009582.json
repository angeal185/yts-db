[{"title":"a road flop","rating":1,"date":"5 March 2019","review":"Its a road movie , with 2 girls, riding along for new york, where ones going to met a boyfriend. they makes a few stops, at a gaz station, at a street corner shouting at some old men are stopped by the police for speedin,gets away wit tears, cheats the jimboburger boy for the check, enters eventually a bar, gets drunk and nearly shoots some horned up men, picks up a wrecked driver,whom they whack with their shooter, and in the end the girls tries to kill eachother and so on....<br><br>you might say this is like thelma and louise, but its definately not. its more the jealous twisted beauty-girl- hater going amock on every girl she defines as better looking than herself.<br><br>i dont know if it is the filming or the acting, but its so bad. the psycho looks like she's had a gallon of botox behind her lips. the other one changes appearance from shoot to the next shot aka changing hairstyle and makeup in one sentencs. the soundwork are not professional at all, and i do recommend the use of a car with less engine noise, and wheel whir at next project, i had big trouble hearing what they said, and definately more exhausted then the girl by the noise.\nthe score are i guess meant to make tension to the psychoterror, buuuut its sounds like a squeeling pig trampling on a contrabass in the butchers corner,so beware.<br><br>so i'm making flippy-floppy, and trying to do my best , the grumpy old man give one star to this nonsense mock-up of mock shuffling filmmaking,no recommendations from me.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[27,38]},{"title":"Good Gone Wrong","rating":1,"date":"22 March 2019","review":"Rumer must have taken acting lessons from her Mom. Emma did a really good job but she looked she was about to die from starvation. Plot was good but once again like so many movies now days just not thought through. Just a thrown together piece of trash.","user":"tinahale-25109","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"Waste of time","rating":1,"date":"18 May 2019","review":"Such a waste of time..absolutely not worth watching!!","user":"desi_keil_88","rank":[6,8]}]
