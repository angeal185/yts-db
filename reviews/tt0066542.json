[{"title":"Passion in the Great Smokies","rating":6,"date":"8 March 2017","review":"A Walk In The Spring Rain has Fritz Weaver and Ingrid Bergman as a college professor of political science going on sabbatical in the Great Smokey Mountains of Eastern Tennessee. Him for peace and quiet for a year so he can publish rather than perish, she for a little time away from being a mom, grandmother, and babysitter not necessarily in that order.<br><br>They take a cottage and the local handyman is Anthony Quinn doing a Smokey Mountain version of Zorba the Greek. He's married to psalm singing Virginia Gregg and she's no fun. Quinn has a son in Tom Holland who like his dad takes his action where he finds it.<br><br>The educated Bergman intrigues Quinn and he gives all kinds of hints as to his availability. But this one is doomed for all kinds of reasons.<br><br>I'm all for romantic stories with older protagonists and Quinn and Bergman fit the bill. The stars get good support from the rest of the cast. This is Bergman and Quinn's second film together and they acquit themselves well.<br><br>Still it won't be listed among the best for either.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Ingrid and Anthony, Sitting in a Tree....","rating":8,"date":"6 April 2010","review":"Ingrid Bergman goes with her husband Fritz Weaver, a college professor, off to the country in the winter in order for him to write a textbook. They are welcomed by Anthony Quinn, who takes an instant liking to her, despite the fact he's already married. And, the viewer can tell she likes the attention. In fact, she even encourages him. Due to her husband's absorption in his own world of writing the book, she has felt neglected, and Anthony succeeds in making her feel special.<br><br>There's the usual feelings for each other and guilt involved: hello there; oh, no; well maybe; no no. But what makes this special is of course Ingrid Bergman's exquisite acting and the inspired casting of her and Quinn, who make a very passionate pairing. (They had been in \"The Visit\" together, but that was nothing like this.) Also, there's the subplot of his son not liking her at all and a total unexpected development.<br><br>But, what makes this even more mature and realistic is the relationship between Ingrid and her daughter. She wants Ingrid to come home so Ingrid can babysit her grandson and she can finally follow her dream of going back to school to better herself. Obviously, Ingrid doesn't want to leave Anthony. Why should she leave, when she's so happy? The heated argument between them at the kitchen table, about the double standard for women and mothers and how they are fulfilled or not fulfilled by a devoted home life, isn't likely to be forgotten by the viewer, especially for mothers and daughters.<br><br>Ultimately, what follows is handled very well and is likely to make a lasting impression on the film's female viewers. If you've never seen Ingrid take \"A Walk in the Spring Rain,\" then treat yourself to this unknown and very underrated film of hers and enjoy the seasons with one of the best actresses ever.","user":"JLRMovieReviews","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"A Worthy Bergman Film!","rating":21,"date":"21 September 2003","review":"Ingrid Bergman was totally devoted to getting this film right - as she was with all her films. She spent a lot of time \"thinking\" while waiting for takes. I agree with the other people who commented, so there's not a lot to add. Perhaps I could just say that Ingrid didn't want her character to commit adultery and that was why the romance with Cade came to nothing. By 1969 films were so much more open about sex and this lovely film was, in a way, rejected by audiences of the time. In 1940 it would probably have been a big hit - \"Brief Encounter\" style. For Ingrid Bergman fans this film is a must see and must have on video! I would VERY MUCH like to see it on DVD, as it would almost complete the Bergman series on DVD. If anyone has any influence in this field, perhaps you could pass on the wish! Compare Ingrid's \"Goodbye Again\" of 1960 - another film which doesn't end satisfactorily for her character, but which had European style and is probably a better film, as \"film\".
