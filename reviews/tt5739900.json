[{"title":"Great movie to watch with your teens","rating":10,"date":"29 April 2018","review":"Love this movie! It has a gently delivered message of forgiveness &amp; redemption as it carefully deals with difficult subject matter. The script is believable &amp; the actors deliver natural performances that ring truth! This is Christian movie that isn't preachy and should appeal to a broad range of people, religious or not!","user":"jeanne-634-743199","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Sick and twisted","rating":1,"date":"4 March 2020","review":"03Mar2020 {1/10stars = F} Recommend?

I like it. It's a faith film... so if you want to see stuff blow up.... watch something else. If you want to reflect on how good God is to us, this is for you.","user":"lamarof9","rank":[0,0]}]
