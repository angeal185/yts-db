[{"title":"pretty good movie with amazing music","rating":18,"date":"18 June 2004","review":"I happen to like this film... apparently quite a bit more than most people. I even still have a copy of it on VHS somewhere. First and foremost is the music. Absolutely INCREDIBLE old time jazz. The best scene to me is clearly the 'battle' between the sax players at the club. The music in the club throughout the movie and the background score during the non-club scenes is about as good as it gets. And I'm not really a huge jazz guy though I have always liked the Miles Davis - John Coltrane type stuff. This is my favorite non - Angelo Badalamente (sp?)film score. Seriously, see this flick just for the music alone. <br><br>And, see it for Miranda Richardson who is AWESOME in this movie. I think she really steals the show in this one. J. Jason Leigh is solid and plays the part of a not too bright, not very successful midwest girl decently. Also, Harry Belafonte is great as Seldom Seen and he just looks and sounds the part so well. Steve Buscemi, Dermot Mulroney and the woman who plays J. Jason Leigh's sister are all quite good in supporting roles, and Michael Murphy is perfect for the part of the slightly confused, yet somewhat powerful husband to the kidnapped Richardson character.<br><br>The clothes, cars, and look of the film is nicely done (cmon it IS an Altman picture!!!) and really does make you feel as if you are in Missouri circa 1935-1940. Add to that a slightly twisted ending and you have a really good and def. underrated film that I really want to see again... on DVD this time to REALLY crank up the music scenes. I give Kansas City 7.5/10","user":"dblaa2000","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"A Fantastic Film with a Bonus of Great Music","rating":9,"date":"27 April 2005","review":"Bottom line, whether you love or hate \"Kansas City\" will depend on your reaction to Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance. Leigh's character Blondie anchors the story as a desperate wife trying to save her husband from the gangsters he tried to rob. Leigh looks great in this role, she is fit and trim which makes her face cuter and her character more fragile looking. The contrast between her almost angelic appearance and her tough persona is intentional because the toughness is an affectation, qualities she has adopted because she loves her husband and they are a turn-on for him. <br><br>Her's is the key performance of the film, the twist is her emulation of Kansas City native Jean Harlow (\"The Public Enemy\" and \"Girl from Missoui\"). Watch Harlow in \"Red Headed Woman\" and you will see the incredible physical resemblance between the two actresses. Personally I found it both touching and humorous; her character worthy of the brave heroine hall of fame. But it is almost a caricature and some viewer will be put off by this tiny woman talking so tough.<br><br>As in \"Nashville\", there are great songs (but jazz rather than country) throughout the film. It is important to realize that \"Blondie's\" behavior is intended to mirror the \"cutting contests\" between the jazz musicians on-stage at the club. Just as the musicians borrow from one another and weave each others stuff into what they are improvising, \"Blondie\" borrows from the movies and weaves Harlow's tough girl phrases and expressions into her conversation.<br><br>Leigh and Miranda Richardson spend most of the film in each other's company. Although Richardson's character is doped up on laudanum (tincture of opium) most of the time, you get the idea that she is taking in a lot more of the situation than she is letting on. There is almost a \"Thelma and Louise\" quality to their relationship, in part because Leigh doing Harlow ends up sounding a lot like Geena Davis doing Geena Davis. The two women are polar opposites in the way they react to the desperation in their lives; one has lost all restraint, the other has lost everything but restraint.<br><br>Richardson's character is unexpectedly touching. An emotional bond is subtly forged between the two women as the film proceeds, with Richarson gradually becoming totally protective of her kidnapper. The ending is shocking but you understand the motivation, then looking back you pick up on the various foreshadowing devices that Altman placed throughout the film. He goes out with a bass duet of Duke Ellington's \"Solitude\" performed by Ron Carter and Christian McBride.<br><br>Like many films with downbeat endings, \"Kansas City\" is destined to be more appreciated 25 years after its release.","user":"aimless-46","rank":[27,33]},{"title":"One of Altman's best","rating":10,"date":"6 October 1999","review":"This film is so deceptively constructed that it took me a few<br><br>viewings to completely get it.  Not the most inviting recommendation for a film, but even at first look, there is much<br><br>to enjoy. The music is superb, the performances outlandish and<br><br>entertaining, and the take on politics and race relations truly<br><br>incisive. For example, kidnapping really was a political tool in<br><br>1930's Kansas City; Blondie's (Jennifer Jason Leigh) real crime<br><br>is kidnapping a politician's wife for personal reasons. Though<br><br>his contempt for romanticism is truly bitter, this remains one<br><br>of Altman's best films.","user":"sws-3","rank":[29,40]}]
