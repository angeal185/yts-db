[{"title":"Crime drama about Hamburg's prostitution scene","rating":6,"date":"5 May 1999","review":"This film about Hamburg's prostitution scene appears rather dated today, although this may have more to do with changed society than with the film being overly unrealistic.  The cast is excellent, but perhaps a little too excellent: most speaking parts are cast with well-known German character actors; while they all can handle their parts quite comfortably I watched this constantly thinking \"where have I seen this guy before?\" and therefore I found it impossible to suspend disbelief.  Anyway, a film that features both Horst Frank and Werner Pochath as villains cannot be a complete failure.","user":"SMK-4","rank":[1,3]}]
