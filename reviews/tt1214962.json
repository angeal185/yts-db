[{"title":"Entertaining and better than I expected","rating":7,"date":"16 January 2012","review":"I was not very interested in watching Seeking Justice but I decided to risk myself, because the publicity and the title suggested a typical tale of personal revenge in the purest style of B cinema, and besides, Nicolas Cage can be a good actor whenever he wants to. To my surprise, the film ended up defying my low expectations with a screenplay which is more ambitious than I expected, and even though it eventually tangles itself too much for its own good, I never found it boring or predictable.<br><br>I found the concept of Seeking Justice very interesting...something like an hybrid thriller, built with parts from Fight Club, Straw Dogs and Strangers on a Train. The combination works pretty well until the half of the film, when we get into conspiracy fields which quickly become confusing, improbable and even a bit ridiculous. However, Roger Donaldson's dynamic direction avoids the movie from getting boring. Cage makes a credible work in the leading role, and he is well complemented by the solid performances from January Jones and Guy Pearce.<br><br>So, I would say that the screenplay from Seeking Justice is simultaneously its main pro and its main obstacle, because it starts with an interesting idea, it develops it well for a while, but it looses the course and the narrative focus during the second half, until leading to an excessively convenient ending.<br><br>Anyway, I had a good time while watching Seeking Justice, and I consider it worthy of a moderate recommendation. However, if you wanna watch better movies about revenge, I recommend you Oldboy, both versions of I Spit on Your Grave or Death Wish. Nevertheless, I liked Seeking Justice despite its fails, and it was better than I expected.","user":"Argemaluco","rank":[78,100]},{"title":"Better than any of Cage's other recent films","rating":6,"date":"25 February 2012","review":"Nicolas Cage has recently been on a bad streak of movies such as Season of The Witch, Trespass, and recently Ghost Rider 2. I watched this with no expectations and to my surprise thought it was actually pretty decent suspense thriller. No, it's not a great movie, but it's a perfect Rental that will keep you entertained. The acting is actually pretty good. Cage and Jones do an alright job, but Pearce really did a good job as the villain in the film. I thought a movie like this would be predictable, but the film actually goes in a bit of a different direction than you would expect it to. However, the movie fell flat in it's third act when it substituted all of it's suspense for action and a somewhat disappointing ending. Still, even though it's not a great movie and has it's flaws, Seeking Justice is still a decent thriller perfect for a rental that is better than you would probably expect. Even if you don't care for it, you still can easily admit that it's better than any of Cage's other recent films.","user":"DoctorRabbit","rank":[27,34]},{"title":"Interesting subject, thrillingly performed","rating":7,"date":"22 October 2012","review":"Nicholas Cage has participated in ambivalent movies, but this one is definitely among the better ones. And he is pleasantly complemented by Guy Pearce whose character is controversial to the end. Development of events and characters is logical, and viewers have - similar to various characters - constant dilemmas what kind of standpoint to take up with, as the background issue is serious, and good intentions get out of control quite fast. I felt that it must be horrible if you can trust nobody during peacetime.<br><br>Recommended to all desiring to spend a thrilling time in front of TV or at the cinema.","user":"BeneCumb","rank":[20,25]}]
