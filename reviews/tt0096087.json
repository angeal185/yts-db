[{"title":"Action packed tale benefits from the three dimensional characters.","rating":26,"date":"26 December 1998","review":"Director James Glickenhaus (The Soldiers, The Exterminator, McBain) has composed a reasonably well constructed thriller with the usual spectacular action sequences and an interesting plot.  This time though, the strong performances from the lead stars help propel Shakedown above the usual mundane low budget films. Peter Weller (Robocop, Screamers) is excellent as Roland Dalton, a frustrated attorney who must help defend a troubled youth who has been accused of murdering a police officer.  However, there is more to the scene of the crime than meets the eye...<br><br>Sam Elliot (Road House) is grand as Richie Marks, a rogue police officer who is always at the wrong place at the right time.  Marks and Dalton happen to form a \"buddy-buddy\" type bonding, and their investigation eventually leads knee deep into a conspiracy of corruption, deceit, and murder...<br><br>Shakedown is a decent action flick with an intriguing plot with enthralling plot twists and top notch action sequences.  The fist fight aboard a moving roller coaster is a highlight and the extended vehicle chase through the streets of Manhattan is another highlight.<br><br>What makes Shakedown an exceptional thriller though, is the three dimensional performances.  Peter Weller is definitely the performer worth watching in Shakedown.  His convincing portrayal as a tough lawyer adds an extra depth of integrity to an otherwise standard \"kill or be killed\" actioner.  Sam Elliot has his moments too as a cynical renegade cop who helps Weller expose corruption in the police department.<br><br>Shakedown is worth watching just for the high caliber performances from both Weller and Elliot.  The action scenes are worthwhile as well.  The only setback though is these action sequences are used a little too sparesly. The lack of a breathtaking pace destroys an almost superior thriller. Otherwise, Shakedown is an adequate film.  This movie would benefit greatly with a faster pace, but the acting from stars Weller and Elliot make Shakedown a film worth a look.<br><br>RATING: **1/2 out of ****.","user":"ChoiBaby","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"Blue jean action, in a shakedown city, a must see","rating":8,"date":"27 May 2015","review":"Oh how I love a Glickenhaus flick, good or bad. He's like the Brian Trenchard Smith of America. Here, he excels again with another addictive flick. A black ex con, has been set up for the killing of a drug dealer, by a bad apple cop- a blue jean cop, though I really didn't stop to note it's meaning as I too wrapped up in the film, to really care. Slick lawyer (Weller) who's just such a watchable actor, teams up with a reckless aging cop (Elliott) who lives basically out of a cinema, to shut this bad cop down, where Elliott does his thing out there on the streets and Weller does his slick show in a courtroom, where these two contrasts blend well. Rebellious Elliott provides some of the electric thrills, if sending a roller coaster train, hurtling over the edge, or hanging off a lear jet forcing it back down, where it explodes immediately on landing. These are memorable moments, especially the jet one. Glickenhaus has a flair for action, and stunts, producing great addictive popcorn flicks, like Mark L Lester who indeed who's made his share. It's Weller's presence, that adds half the magic to the film, that came and went at the cinema, on about the same time as Elliott's other film, the Swayze, actioner, Roadhouse. Of course people will frown upon it, where others will find it forgettable. It's a pity, as this low key, 89 action pic, is one of those that deserves more attention, where Elliott's character should draw more attention to his hygiene.","user":"videorama-759-859391","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Violent film about police corruption and trials , being starred by two good actors","rating":5,"date":"11 January 2015","review":"In a town where everyone is for sale , they're the best that money can buy . A legal attorney (Peter Weller) and a renegade cop (Sam Elliot) join forces to stop corrupt cops and against street scum . The overworked lawyer and the undercover cop team up but find serious difficulties from other corrupt police inspectors (Thomas G Waites) , a drug lord (Antonio Fargas) , dope dealers , and various street scum . Dalton's life is further complicated by the fact that his girlfriend (Blanche Baker) is pregnant and the prosecuting attorney (Patricia Charbonneau) is a prior lover ; then taking place the classic triangular drama . <br><br>This thriller movie contains suspense , noisy action-packed with no much sense , intrigue, and thrills galore . It's a brutal and controversial urban film plenty of car crashes , pursuits , trials , police corruption and many other things . Sam Elliot with his usual stoic acting displays efficiently his weapon , Magnum 44 , such as ¨Harry the Dirty¨ and killing mercilessly nasties . It's certainly exciting , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Sam Elliott side . The movie provides fast and furious entertainment and action with no sense developing with agility , fast paced and movement . This thrilling story looks increasingly passionless and mechanical , though violence sometimes seems to be considered excessive . Nice acting by Sam Elliot as a renegade loner NYPD narcotics agent and Peter Weller as an obstinate advocate at law . Furthermore, it appears a great secondary cast full of known faces with brief interventions , such as Thomas G Waites , Paul Bartel as Night Court Judge , James Eckhouse , Holt McCallany , Kelly Rutherford , David Proval ,John Finn , William Prince , Harold Perrineau ,Shirley Stoler and John C. McGinley . Mediocre cinematography by John Lindley , though he subsequently photographed Field of dreams , You've a e-m@il (1998) , Pleasantville , Mr Brooks and other hits . Screeching and pulsing musical score by Jonathan Elias . <br><br>This moving motion picture in low budget was middlingly directed by James Glickenhaus , being born in New York City where he usually shoots his movies . Glickenhaus served as the chairman for the film company SGE Entertainment from 1987 to 1995; this company specialized in both making and distributing low-budget independent straight-to-video fare. He's an expert on violent action movies and so-so films as proved in ¨McBain¨, ¨The soldier¨ and this ¨Shakedown¨ . He's also directed a Jacke Chan vehicle titled ¨The protector¨ , the eerie thriller \"Slaughter of the Innocents,\" and the attractive sci-fi romp \"Timemaster¨ and of course the extremely violent , low-budgeted and successful 1980 movie , ¨The exterminator¨ , a cruel Vigilante drama . And James was the executive producer for the movies \"Maniac Cop,\" \"Frankenhooker,\" both \"Basket Case\" sequels, \"Ring of Steel,\" and \"Tough and Deadly\" . Rating : Average , 5,5/10 but entertaining .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[7,9]}]
