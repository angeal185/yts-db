[{"title":"Mark is back, let the killing begin","rating":5,"date":"19 February 2014","review":"Nothing subtle occurs in this movie. It starts in a rush, resets for the opening credits, and then the killing spree begins (with a little pro forma explanation from Seth along the way). Seth and Jen don't remember what happened the night Mark disappeared, but they know it feels really weird, and now two years later they're feeling weird again. While they're feeling weird, Mark is back and killing everyone he runs across.<br><br>The story is quite linear, without an ounce of nuance: Mark disappears, he's back, and Seth and Jen are on a collision course with Mark. There's lots of bloody gunshots, stabbings, and other gruesome action. The action is good, more brutal than scary, though the director certainly wanted a bigger special effects budget to show the violence more explicitly. When Mark attacks Jen, there's a jump-the-shark development where the attack gets especially weird. There's not much character development, the acting is pretty wooden, no grander themes or allegory, no subplots or side characters--just a straightforward story with lots of brutal action. (And one rather comical scene: How long does it take to load a rifle?!) The movie is as entertaining as a car crash, just don't expect any deeper meaning.","user":"moviefansme","rank":[20,30]},{"title":"Could be better","rating":3,"date":"7 September 2014","review":"First of all, the beginning off the movie captured my attention but sadly the interest started to dwindle and found myself wanting the film to finish.<br><br>Flaws, quite a few of them and the continuity? looked as though the crew couldn't care much about it!<br><br>As for the acting; I do say it wasn't bad at all but there were times when I thought \"how stupid can people be\". You can tell they did this to either get the audience a little angry or tensed. I personally kept shaking my head and repeated the word \"stupid\"<br><br>Finally, it reminded me more of slasher movies. Lots of blood and murders. There didn't seem to be a real story behind it all. The why's and how's were missing and what's going to happen next, most of you may figure it out half way through the film.<br><br>Nothing exciting here to watch.","user":"panther_husky","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Stupid but amazing, not gory as I expected it to be","rating":7,"date":"3 July 2015","review":"This movie was decent and like all movies that have a low budget they try to make up for that with blood. In this case it kinda worked. The story is basically about a guy named mark who gets abducted and comes back a couple years later as a alien.<br><br>It's one of the movies that include many type of thing like a combination of the body snatchers and splinter. I admit that the story line wasn't that bad and even though I expected more gore ( even though it's pretty gory) it was an okay movie. Some people would rate it lower them only reason why I didn't rate it lower was because I expected a stupid movie. It's one of those movies that tries every way to be as gory as possible to entertain the viewer. The affects were okay the blood was good the alien tongue that mark has looks really fake but it's okay. And of course many people die and the movie ends like most movie ends with something else that might happen. All and all its an okay movie to watch if you like those type of things that I listed above but it one of those movies that you could laugh while you watch with your friends.","user":"okg-11122","rank":[3,3]}]
