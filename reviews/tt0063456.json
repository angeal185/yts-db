[{"title":"A great film! Unbelievably neglected over the years","rating":8,"date":"19 November 2006","review":"This criminally neglected film has a lot going for it, and is certainly well worth tracking down! The comparisons to the Alfred Hitchcock classic 'Psycho' are obvious due to the fact that the film stars Norman Bates actor Anthony Perkins in another off-centre performance, but other than that; Pretty Poison is a law unto itself, and not quite like any other film that I've seen. The first thing that struck me about this film was the cinematography; the film somehow manages to look old and dated, yet beautiful at the same time. The fact that it's set in a serene little town does it some favours also, but it's the plot that is the biggest standout here. Anthony Perkins is Dennis Pitt; a mentally disturbed man who is given a job in a lumber yard. He soon bumps into the beautiful Sue Ann Stepanek, and she learns that he is a CIA operative, working undercover and has chosen her to be his 'partner'. However, that is not really the case at all as Pitt lives in his own little fantasy world, and after the pair slip up with a murder, they find themselves under suspicion.<br><br>Anthony Perkins may not be the most diverse actor ever to grace the silver screen; but he certainly plays the disturbed young man well! Here, he has the beautiful Tuesday Weld as his co-star, and the two performances compliment each other excellently, as the pair have a great on-screen chemistry, and the plot is always interesting enough to ensure that the film succeeds. It has to be said that Pretty Poison has something of a low scope where plot and plotting are concerned; but this isn't a problem as the modest way that the film pans out is good in that it's interesting and also rather intimate, so the film feels more realistic. The film is excellently paced, and there aren't any moments where nothing is really happening. At just eighty five minutes, Pretty Poison still manages to get its story and character profiles across in a way that is interesting and exciting. The conclusion to the main plot line is good and something of a shock, while the ending itself is predictable, but still works well. Overall, Pretty Poison gets my HIGHEST recommendations and I hope this one doesn't stay buried for too much longer!","user":"The_Void","rank":[39,46]},{"title":"Unnerving crime drama with psychological overtones","rating":6,"date":"15 July 2007","review":"Eight years after \"Psycho\", Anthony Perkins, who seemed to quickly lose his way in ill-suited romantic dramas of the mid-'60s, finally gets a role here well-tailored to his wild-eyed personality, that of an introvert with simmering disorders forced by circumstance into playing \"normal\". A former teen arsonist in Massachusettes is released from the institution as a young man and is given a job at the lumber mill; he's perpetually wrapped up in CIA fantasies and conspiracy theories, and is thrilled when he meets up with a 17-year-old beauty from the local high school who is happy to play along with his games. Adapted from Stephen Geller's book \"She Let Him Continue\", this is a peculiar, well-made and written cult movie which works itself under your skin. Perkins lets himself relax a bit on-camera and gives one of his most notable performances, and Tuesday Weld (despite being a few years too old for her role) rarely strikes a false note as his new girlfriend with a somewhat sordid past herself (one that mirrors her mother's, whom she hates). The concluding events aren't really satisfying (with echoes of \"Psycho\" besides), and the circular plot-device posed at the tag doesn't work at all, but the performances really drive this thing, making it an engrossing and memorable sleeper. **1/2 from ****","user":"moonspinner55","rank":[29,34]},{"title":"Interesting Characters In This Unfairly-Ignored Film","rating":8,"date":"20 July 2007","review":"It was great to see Tuesday Weld again, and in her prime, physically. She was a real \"looker,\" to use an old phrase. Just seeing her was worth the price of the rental. <br><br>Usually I point out the photography or the riveting story as the facet (s) of the movie I enjoyed best, but in this case it's the actors and characters they played. <br><br>It was also fun to see Tony Perkins (\"Dennis Pitt\") play his Norman Bates-type \"Pyscho\" character again, although I prefer \"Bates\" over \"Pitt.\" At least Bates wasn't all talk like Pitt was in this story. \"Norman\" delivered the goods, when needed! Here, Weld's \"Sue Ann Stepanek\" walks the talk. <br><br>Tuesday Weld, by the way, proves in this film she's a lot more than a pretty face. (She also looked her age when she shot this film. That was 25, and here her role is that of a 17-year-old, which is stretching it a bit...but who's counting?)<br><br>The most interesting character might have been \"Mrs. Stepanek,\" played by Beverly Garland, but she really had too small a role, just a couple of speaking scenes. I think this film would have been better had Garland's character been expanded regarding the exposing of Pitt as a fraud. She was just getting into that, but it was never followed up. Before you know it - poof! - she's gone.<br><br>The two other main supporting actors in here also played intriguing characters: John Randolph as the parole officer, \"Morton Azenhauer,\" and Dick O'Neil as employer \"Bud Munsch.\" Randolph and O'Neill were excellent character actors for many years.<br><br>For those watching for the first time, I would advise being patient with the first half of this film. The story doesn't really have much spark to it until \"Sue Ann\" begins to reveal her true inner self. which is not \"pretty.\" Until then, we just get Perkins' nutcase character going on and on to Weld about his supposed CIA connections. Fortunately, as soon as this becomes tiresome, \"Sue Ann\" saves the film by springing into action.<br><br>Some reviewers thought the ending was unsatisfying but I had no problems with it since you know, thanks to movie's final shot, that justice will be served. Sometimes it just takes longer.<br><br>Overall, as most people observe, this a good movie that has been largely ignored over the years. This recent DVD release will help but, at this point, I doubt it will ever been a \"known\" film except to fans of either Weld or Perkins, or by word of mouth on websites like this. Sadly, you won't find this DVD at the big rental stores. You'll just have to take the word of reviewers here, beginning with J-Slack - who gives more of an in-depth account of the film's characters - that this film is worth renting or buying, sight-unseen.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[23,27]}]
