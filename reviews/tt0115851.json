If you are a Die Hard Sports fan, like myself, you will love this movie, I could relate to the dedication Daniel Stern and Dan Akyrod's character show.<br><br>For this movie to get a 5.2 makes me question the reviewers on IMDb, This is a movie that will put a smile on your face, and is very Underrated.","user":"chlupgfx","rank":[4,6]}]
