[{"title":"\"You Are About To See The Best!\"","rating":12,"date":"12 February 2000","review":"Well, not 'the best', perhaps, but an interesting and stylish western starring Kirk Douglas, who also produced and directed it.  Bruce Dern is great as Strawhorn, the bad guy who ends up stealing the show.<br><br>    Howard Nightingale is running for a seat in the US Senate.  He is a man of great complexity, and one trait very much to the fore in his personality is a ruthless desire to impress the voters.  He has assembled a posse of rangers, his own personal uniformed army of crimebusters.  Nightingale (played by Douglas) has calculated that he can win the election on a clear-the-territory-of-lowlifes ticket.  He and his posse are hunting down Strawhorn, and have fitted out a crusade train for the purpose of capturing their prey.  The plan is to grab Strawhorn and hang him just in time for the election.<br><br>    Nightingale is in the pocket of the railroad owners.  The local newspaper is the Tesota Sentinel, and one of the film's themes is the valuable role played by the press in speaking truth to those in power. One-armed, one-legged journalist Harold Hellman (played by James Stacy, who had recently lost both limbs on a motor cycle accident) is the equal of the photogenic wannabe Senator.  Nightingale works the crowd with glib words, but his position is being eroded by a different formula of words - that used by The Sentinel.  <br><br>    One of the film's elegant touches is the photography motif.  At various points in the story, the participants pose to have their picture taken, and the resulting stills form a freeze-frame chronicle of the action.  A lot of post-production work went into dubbing extraneous voices onto the soundtrack, so that the crowd scenes are laced with apposite little remarks.<br><br>    A violently-burning train provides terrific visuals, as well as offering acerbic comment on Nightingale's political aspirations.  The film's concluding message, that by its nature a standing army is a threat to democracy, is well made - as is the point about the fickleness of public opinion.<br><br>    Verdict - A clever, enjoyable little western.","user":"stryker-5","rank":[29,29]},{"title":"Definitely unique among Westerns","rating":8,"date":"8 June 2011","review":"On screen I find Kirk Douglas to be without peer, but I have come to admire him as much if not more for his real-life advocacy of some highly unorthodox, yet worthy projects.<br><br>If this movie doesn't rank among his very best, it is still remarkable for how unapologetically it goes against the grain and makes a very bold personal statement (one that was not so popular at the time but resonates to this day). All the while he is producing and directing himself in what proves to be a rather unflattering role. I can't think of anyone else who would have the real-life grit to do such a thing - Kirk Douglas has done so repeatedly with aplomb.","user":"addicott","rank":[14,14]},{"title":"The Ambitious Marshal","rating":9,"date":"11 July 2005","review":"One thing about Kirk Douglas is that he's never been afraid to let the public see him as a bad guy. It's a great tribute to his ability as an actor to develop such a wide range of characters from the heroic Spartacus to the villainous George Brougham in The List of Adrian Messenger.<br><br>Posse falls somewhere in the middle of those two films in terms of the good versus evil scale for Kirk Douglas. Politicians running on \"law and order\" platforms were just coming into vogue at the time and this western is spot on about those kind of politicians and the motivations behind them.<br><br>Kirk Douglas is a U.S. Marshal with political ambitions to be a United States Senator. He's got his photographer with him to record his exploits and travels on a private railroad car provided by the railroad. <br><br>He's on the trail of outlaw Jack Strawhorn, played by Bruce Dern. Before capturing Strawhorn, Douglas and his posse burn alive Dern's gang in a barn fire and then butcher another group of misfits he's put together even as they want to surrender.<br><br>What I like most about Posse is that it doesn't try to make Dern out any kind of a hero. He's an outlaw the way some people are grocers, bakers, shoemakers, etc. This may very well have been Bruce Dern's best screen role.<br><br>It turns out that Dern is a far better judge of human nature than the fatuous Douglas is. The town of Tesota, Texas where most of the action takes place is very much sadder and wiser when the film concludes.<br><br>A lot of the same themes are covered in the more acclaimed The Unforgiven with Clint Eastwood who also starred and directed himself. But I think Kirk Douglas got there first.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[19,21]}]
