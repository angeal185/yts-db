[{"title":"Team America Checklist","rating":10,"date":"25 October 2004","review":"The one thing I noticed while attempting to breathe during this movie was that people were walking out in between bursts of hysterical laughter.<br><br>Unfortunately, this movie is not for everyone. I wish it didn't offend some but it does. So, if you want to know whether you will enjoy this film or not, you must answer \"yes\" to the following:<br><br>1. I am not offended by the \"F\" word. Being repeated 300 times.<br><br>2. I am not offended by intense marionette sex.<br><br>3. I am not offended by racial satire.<br><br>4. I am not offended by ridiculous political satire.<br><br>5. I am not a member of the Film Actor's Guild.<br><br>If you're like me and have answered \"yes\" to the above five questions, go see this film. You will laugh so hard it will hurt and you will giggle about it for the next week thereafter.<br><br>I have to say that I am very desensitized when it comes these kinds of films, and I'd say that Team America has raised the bar in derogatory humor. But that only made it more hilarious. I give it 5 stars, two thumbs up, 10 out of 10; it was flawless. But...<br><br>On the other hand, if you're not like me, you might find yourself walking out by the third time you hear the song, \"America, F*** Yeah!\"","user":"stargunner","rank":[262,317]},{"title":"Wonderfully poignant satire at a much needed time","rating":10,"date":"10 October 2004","review":"No Spoilers.<br><br>First off, I'd like to say that this film is everything a South Park/Trey Parker devotee could hope for. It's sly, it's vulgar, it's full of gore/profanity/violence/nudity, and it is made entirely with marionettes.<br><br>The sheer amount of wit and subversive humor packed into this film is mind boggling, but yet it doesn't bog you down with vague references and really confusing in-jokes. And goddamn, puppets swearing/having sex/killing people/dancing never gets old. NEVER.<br><br>The film is actually almost 2 hours long, but as expected, is one which time takes on less relevance. Of course, some people are going to see just how limited Trey Parkers voice talents are, but having 4 different minor character sound exactly the same is always a surefire treat. Take note that a grand total of zero big name actors lend their voice to this film, though Little B**ch(Dian Bachar) does give a little appearance here and there.<br><br>The whole film is real. You heard me. Absolutely nothing in this movie (with the exception of the title credits and I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E.) was done with computers. While this may sound impressive on paper, on film it's actually a masterful achievement. While Parker sometimes plays into the film's self-conscious aura and indulges the audience a bit, most scenes are played out to their full puppet potential. I'm sure this film will be a benchmark in the world of puppeteering for years to come, despite it's content.<br><br>All in all, it was exactly what I expected (and I have high standards for Parker) and I could not have been happier with the result. A second viewing will be needed, just to take in all the detail of the film, as the sets are lush, elaborate and breathtaking scale models of cities all over the world.<br><br>For those who want to bother comparing it to Parkers earlier forays, yes, it is better than Cannibal! and Orgazmo, but does not quite stand up to SP:BLU, but only because BLU had the background and the familiarity factor. After a second viewing, this opinion could very likely change.<br><br>In other words, if you like this sort of stuff, you'll love it. If you are iffy on Parker/South Park/libertarian humor, then you will most likely hate it. But what else is new.","user":"shootfromthehip","rank":[280,357]},{"title":"Funny!","rating":12,"date":"12 December 2004","review":"As much as I hate to admit it, Trey Parker and Matt Stone are actually quite talented in a sick twisted, strange, little way. After laughing my butt off during South Park Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut, I couldn't wait to see this movie. I was not disappointed.<br><br>This could be by far the funniest film this year. The plot is easy to follow, as it borrows from most action flicks you see these days, but the way in which it is made is incredible. The fact that these are puppets is enough to make you laugh throughout the entire film. The jokes are funny and don't fall flat. As I was watching the opening, I thought it might run out of steam as it went on. My ticket said it went for almost 2 hours, and I wondered how it would sustain the entire time. It flew. The film is a guilty pleasure.<br><br>And parents, before you take your kids to see this, then complain it was disgusting, please read the R Rating! Sit back, relax and watch, but not with coke in your mouth. It will get spit everywhere.","user":"the_insainiak","rank":[195,258]}]
