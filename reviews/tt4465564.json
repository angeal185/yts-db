Now I want to be hurt... just not emotionally.\" <br><br>Him: \"I always hurt people, but I would never hurt you... unless you wanted me to.\" <br><br>Her: \"Ouch, you hurt me.

I really can't imagine why there are so many people that are willing to go and see in in the cinemas. This movie is not bad, because of the idea for an affair between a rich businessman and a normal girl. It is bad because the dialogues are flat, the characters are terrible and without any depth, there is no actual acting in it, and for the final the story is badly written.<br><br>It is really sad, that such a badly made movies are so popular. They destroy the idea for good movie with acting, script and everything else. And if you expect to see at least a lot of erotic in it, you may fell a bit disappointed at the end. The movie is far from that it promises to its viewers.","user":"draid","rank":[91,120]}]
