[{"title":"What a nightmare, and not in a good way.","rating":1,"date":"30 September 2017","review":"If Tina Fey had have been brutally dropped on her head as a baby and decided to write a horror film, having never seen one before in her drooling, cabbaged life; it might look something like this. Who on earth is this movie aimed at? Is it supposed to be a spooky morality tale, or a dark high school comedy for girls? Oddly enough, in trying to be both, it succeeds in neither. The writer's conceit reeks through this whole effort, they obviously thought they were being exceptionally clever with little references to the multiverse and having Jerry O'Connell (from Sliders) making a cameo; but the whole thing just screams 'amateurish overindulgence'. The tone of the movie is all over the place and the protagonist is an absolute psycho, even before she starts murdering people with a Chinese box; just so she can be popular. She's also perhaps the densest person known to man, singularly failing to realise what's happening as everything she wishes for comes true; and bizarrely, not taking advantage of the situation when it does. We're supposed to believe that a box has sat in a bin on the street untouched for ten, or more years, in a town where her father scavenges the same bins seemingly several times a week? Instead of prattling on about physics she doesn't understand, perhaps the writer could have spent some of that excessive brainpower on filling this egregious plot hole, and all the others besides. The soundtrack is without a doubt the most inappropriate, awful racket that has ever graced a so-called horror movie; it's like Sofia Coppola was ingested by Lena Dunham in some bizarre satanic union, and this music was the accidental result. I am very skeptical that this film has gotten so many nine and ten star reviews on this site - something is very rotten in the state of Denmark. I expect with Halloween coming up, we'll see a truer picture of how this movie is received as more and more people have the misfortune to actually watch it.<br><br>Plus points: Barb.","user":"edithp-37476","rank":[22,29]},{"title":"Mixed feelings, but still worth seeing","rating":7,"date":"29 July 2017","review":"This movie has it's ups and it's downs. There were some really great suspense scenes, while others where painfully obvious. I feel like they should've spend just a little bit more time on it, to work out the kinks.<br><br>Overall I would still recommend you to see it and don't give up on it too soon. There is some really great stuff in there. It's been a while since a movie genuinely had me on the edge of my seat, which completely made up for the bad parts.","user":"benimations","rank":[31,46]},{"title":"\"Final Destination\" meets \"Wishmaster\" via \"The Monkey's Paw\", but not as gory or inventive.","rating":7,"date":"27 July 2017","review":"WISH UPON (2017) ** Joey King, Ryan Phillippe, Ki Hong Lee, Mitchell Slaggert, Shannon Purser, Sydney Park, Elisabeth Rohm, Josephine Lanford, Sherilynn Fenn, Jerry O'Connell.
