[{"title":"A major \"hoot\"!","rating":7,"date":"10 April 2015","review":"Batman vs Robin, directed by Jay Oliva and written by J.M. DeMatteis, was an action packed, whirlwind of a ride and a significant improvement to Ethan Spaulding's \"Son of Batman\". In addition to choosing a life with his father, Bruce Wayne (Batman), Damian (Robin) assists his father's continued fight at night for Gotham's soul as the next Robin. However, Damian finds himself struggling to cope with his father's \"no- killing\" policy due to the philosophical form of combat training he received under Ra's al Ghul. As a result of this philosophical conflict between Damian, and Bruce Wayne, Damian is forced into a lifestyle of isolation. As Bruce Wayne tightens the noose around Damian's freedom, Damian is sought out by a member of the Court of Owls. While struggling with his own identity, Damian must decide whether he will adhere to his father's morals, or become a member of the Court of Owls. <br><br>First I would like to say that this DC animated film was spectacular! The animation was fluid, flawless, and the voice acting was superb. Though I wasn't initially a fan of Jason O'Mara, I have definitely come to appreciate him as the new Dark Knight. With the level of graphic realism as well as the psychopathic trills currently shown in the recent DC animated Batman series, I believe Jay Oliva has perfectly presented us with an accurate portrayal of Gotham's twisted atmosphere. However, the title was slightly misleading as Batman and Robin only fought against each other for a short time. If anything, it should have been called \"Batman: The Court of Owls\". In the end, Batman vs Robin is an excellent addition to the DC animated series as well as is something every Batman fan will appreciate.<br><br>7 Stars.","user":"crimson_knight_7","rank":[40,52]},{"title":"JUSTICE, NOT VENGEANCE","rating":8,"date":"17 April 2018","review":"This film follows \"Son of Batman.\" If you haven't seen that film, you will gather the gist of it in this one. Damian, as Robin opts to venture out on his own to the dismay of Batman. Damian gets mixed up with a powerful group of vigilantes, like Batman known as Owls. The only real difference is that Owls like to kill their prey while Batman does not. Damian must choose between being the assassin he was trained to be or becoming Batman's son.<br><br>The cartoon was 79 minutes long. There was a lot of fighting as expected. I still miss the \"Pows\" but concede its time has past. This film included a lot of Batman flashbacks and questions vigilante justice as being no better than the criminals, but not too hard.<br><br>If you didn't like the first one, don't bother.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Batman, Robin and the Court of Owls","rating":7,"date":"9 January 2018","review":"Love animation and have really enjoyed to loved many superhero films, animated and live-action. Of the DC animated films, there are some good ones out there as well as some disappointments and ones that fall in between. <br><br>'Batman vs. Robin' is neither among the best or worst of the DC animated films. To me it's somewhere around high middle. Despite the somewhat misleading misnomer that is the film's title, the versus being more of the conflict between father and son over what Robin's path should be rather than some kind of action showdown, 'Batman vs. Robin' is vastly improved over 'Son of Batman' (good idea, weakly executed).<br><br>It is not perfect by all means. It has the same faults that quite a number of the DC animated films have, that it needed to be about 10 minutes longer in order for the many characters and the many things going on in the story to be effective. What 'Batman vs. Robin' has over a lot of them is that the story is always compelling and surprisingly dark, darker than usual, and the characters aren't one dimensional, with for example a far more conflicted Damian than portrayed in the other films he's featured in. Talon and the Dollmaker are two of the series' better villains for instance. <br><br>Sure, 'Batman vs. Robin' is a little rushed in places, complicated occasionally and Talon's real motivation is anti-climactically handled. On the other hand, the father and son relationship is handled much better here. It's not neglected, while not taking over too much of the story that it neglects the conflict, and has the heart, emotion and tension that 'Son of Batman' did not have so it was easier to invest in it. Batman is more interesting here while Damian is nowhere near as annoying and is more a realistic depiction of a conflicted teenager.<br><br>The animation is very good, often great. There are some very nice detailed backgrounds, the characters are designed well and the colours are dynamic and atmospheric. The music is both haunting and rousing, a good fit for the film's mood. <br><br>Writing is far from simplistic or childish, quite the opposite, while the story has a few issues but is compelling with some exciting and thrilling action. Saying that the villains are among the best of the DC animated superhero films is saying a good deal, DC have had a very hit and miss track record with their villains (an example of a hit being Joker in 'Assault on Arkham' and a miss being Deathstroke in 'Son of Batman'). The Court of Owls provides very believable, sometimes creepy conflict.<br><br>Voice acting is very well done. Not just Jason O'Mara, Stuart Allan and Sean Maher but particularly Weird Al Yankovic and Jeremy Sisto.<br><br>In conclusion, doesn't blow the mind but not bad at all. 7/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[6,8]}]
