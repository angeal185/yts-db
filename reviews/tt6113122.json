[{"title":"The Rex Character","rating":2,"date":"2 August 2018","review":"Never have I wanted a sequel so bad and get so disappointed because of it. The thing is, it's not Bianca's fault, it's not any of the stars faults...except one person. The character of Rex, played by... someone who needed the money, was a stale, unnecessary addition that lacked any sort of comedic flavor to an already b-rated flick. I am usually very open minded about characters but this was UNBEARABLE.","user":"hunteracechaney","rank":[38,42]},{"title":"Not so much a hurricane, more like a wimpier.","rating":2,"date":"22 May 2018","review":"While it feels like every fan of Bianca is gushing over this film, I cannot. It was enjoyable at some base level, but it lacked the self awareness and comedy of the first while somehow feeling cheaper. The script is just bad. Plot, dialog, jokes, nothing lands or works with these characters. Nothing in the plot made sense, the situations were completely unbelievable and resolution was lazy and pointless. I mean a plot isn't everything if you enjoy the characters and journey... but no one was relatable, just wooden stereotypes beaten to within an inch of their lives.","user":"michaelblasdel","rank":[27,30]},{"title":"We need to talk about Rex","rating":5,"date":"18 August 2018","review":"Loved Katya, enjoyed Bianca and Rachel Dratch, but that Rex character made me feel severe... discomfort. He didn't come off so much stupid as he desperately needed a state-appointed guardian. I had a small respite when they were imprisoned, he dropped the baby talk and the writing improved... his jokes took the forefront for far too long of the movie.<br><br>I'll check out the next Bianca flick, but please no more of this chicanery.","user":"firemote-793-263138","rank":[18,20]}]
