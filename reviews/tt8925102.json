[{"title":"Poor Animation","rating":2,"date":"5 December 2018","review":"Voice acting was basic plain monotonous and uninspiring. CGI was plastic cheap looking both for actionable figures, and background which was also very static 2-D. Storyline was non-creative predictable redux of little bug saves the day becomes insect hero.","user":"westsideschl","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"This movie is bad","rating":2,"date":"20 December 2019","review":"It reminds me of an 11 year old trying to make a story. The plot isn't decided until most of the way through and nothing makes sense.","user":"benkw-17727","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"DO not Let Your Hopes High","rating":5,"date":"6 August 2019","review":"This film is not so great. With kinda cheap quality animation voices and story. May be kids can enjoy a little.Dialogues are not good, animation is not eye catching It have good action though. So watch if you have nothing else to do.","user":"Umair_Ahmad_chaudhry","rank":[0,0]}]
