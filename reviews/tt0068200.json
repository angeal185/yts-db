[{"title":"Proto Others","rating":14,"date":"14 February 2003","review":"The very first time I saw The Others my mind rushed immediately back to this gem...very much a similar premise, people from different periods of time appear to each other as ghosts. It's a nice little film. It's long been my wife's favourite, and its available on DVD from Feb 24, 2003 in the UK which is ooh so cool :)","user":"Paul Sands","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"Excellent Family Feel-Good Movie!","rating":10,"date":"20 August 2005","review":"This movie worried me at first with a bit of a slow start, but it quickly changed into a wonderfully imaginative fairy tale. The characters are very good and the acting feels the period. Grahm Crowden from the British Sitcom \"Waiting for God\" does a very good job as well.<br><br>Everyone should give this one a try.<br><br>The concept is very intriguing and holds your interest well. I really loved the idea surrounding the ghosts and how they got where they were. The story is really one that I would love to share with my whole family.<br><br>This one feels like a Dickens Narrative due to the time period it is set in, which adds to the overall feel and believability.","user":"brickmeyer","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"GREW UP ON","rating":10,"date":"4 February 2002","review":"Saw this film when I was a child, and it still gives me the same lil shudders and I STILL giggle in the right places... its a good old story with the sweetest ending EVER.<br><br>It really encapsulates the film genre of the 1970's and the old way of telling ghost stories which seems to have been lost in modern films.<br><br>This film is good for the whole family and actually deals with death and the afterlife in a manner that makes you talk about it afterwards","user":"darwiniantheory","rank":[25,27]}]
