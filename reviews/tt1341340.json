[{"title":"Starts and end well, gets boring in the middle","rating":4,"date":"16 April 2012","review":"A Warrior's Heart – CATCH(Beginning)TRASH(Middle)CATCH(Ending) (C+) I personally love sports movies and I have never seen a movie about Lacrosse. A Warrior's Heart is about a hotheaded boy Conner who loses his temper when his father dies in war. The movie starts well and ends well but it gets tedious in the middle. Especially all the lectures and scenes in the woods are extremely boring.<br><br>Kellan Lutz is charming and acted pretty well compare to his few lines in every Twilight movie. Ashley Green is cute and does a decent job of a girlfriend. Chord Overstreet is fine along with rest of the Lacrosse team players. <br><br>Overall, it's a teenage pastime movie and whoever has hearts for Lacrosse can enjoy.","user":"saadgkhan","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"yeeeesh","rating":2,"date":"17 April 2012","review":"Hmmmm. Well I love Lacrosse so that was my only reason for not turning it off after 10mins. And this is the only lax film out at the moment unfortunately.<br><br>Just very cliché and unfortunate plot. hard to tell how bad the acting is due to the terrible screenplay. This film has almost no worth. The depiction of lacrosse was way off. I don't even think that adaptive purposes for film could pass as an excuse. They're all scrubs. there is hitting/checking in lacrosse but its far more skilled and brutal than the bs in this. <br><br>I don't really know what else to say. This is basically a film designed for twilight fans with a bit of lacrosse riding on the side, and I struggle to even call it lacrosse. This movie feels like it was made by a bunch of high school kids with some fancy equipment. Its not even <br><br>really funny bad... just bad<br><br>I'll be waiting for crooked arrows, can't be worse than this.","user":"nzstalion","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"A very un-original and predictable movie about a high school sports star. Could have been worse though. I say B-.","rating":5,"date":"27 December 2011","review":"\"It's funny what you notice the first time you see someone, confidence, a nice smile, a little connection. What you don't see, what's impossible to know at first glance is everything else. At least everything that counts.\" Conor Sullivan (Lutz) is the best Lacross player on his team. The only problem is he is cocky and not a team player. When his dad is transfered across the country Conor has to start all over to make the team and prove that he is a team player. This movie is not terrible, but very cheesy and extremely predictable. Much like the recent faith-based movies all the problems in this movie seemed to be solved way to easy. To me a movie without a real push back against the lead actor seems boring and too cookie cutter like. While I can't really say anything bad about this movie because I did like it, I can't really say anything really good about it either because ten minutes in I could tell how it would end. That makes a movie boring to me. Overall, not a bad movie and if you like this kind of thing you will really enjoy it. I give it a B-.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[14,21]}]
