[{"title":"Could have done more with this","rating":6,"date":"9 May 2019","review":"Whilst an interesting subject and done reasonably well for a TV Movie, Torvill and Dean's story deserves bigger treatment really.\nIt did hold one's attention and there were some things one didn't know before.\nThe cast did a pretty good job all in all.\nOne big pity is the lack of credits for the skaters who did all the work in this film.\nGiven the subject matter they deserve some recognition.","user":"robinmcg","rank":[5,5]}]
