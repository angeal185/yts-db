[{"title":"atrocious","rating":1,"date":"17 January 2018","review":"A bickering couple take a trip to a weekend trip to a cabin in the woods in a vain attempt to save their crumbling marriage.unaware that someone is out there with malicious intent<br><br>I wouldn't want to spend 3 minutes with these two characters much less almost an hour and a half. It's grueling and moves at a snail's pace. And the 'action' or what passes for it, when it does come, it's not even worth it. A poor film on all fronts. Avoid it","user":"movieman_kev","rank":[13,20]},{"title":"WTF have I just watched???????","rating":30,"date":"30 December 2017","review":"I cannot believe that I actually sat through this! The writing, direction and acting was abysmal; I don't even know if it was trying to be funny but it failed here as well as every other level.<br><br>I suppose the fact that it was filmed in 10 days should tell a story; to be fair it would be a better story that was portrayed in the film!<br><br>Just avoid this pathetic attempt of a horror at all costs, unless you want to relive the makeup from The Evil Dead; yes the first lot of makeup that they threw in the bin!","user":"waynehackett6","rank":[10,17]},{"title":"Totally different and outside of the box movie. I loved it.","rating":10,"date":"17 February 2018","review":"Ok so I'm not going to lie it started out slow. The sound is not great and some of the color matching between scenes is bad. However for some reason this film hooked me just enough to make it to the end and I'm SO glad it did! The dialog between the couple is funny and different. At first I was expecting this to be a run of the mill story that has been done over and over again. ITS NOT! It ends up being a great movie by the end. This movie really does try to break the mold and do something different and it does! The story was great and I loved the ending. Totally worth the watch and I would love to see more by Kamal Moo.","user":"pxf446","rank":[3,13]}]
