[{"title":"Candid yet unilluminating doc about the Manics","rating":6,"date":"25 March 2018","review":"A thoroughly entertaining, low-budget, doc on the Manics. Nice to see on clearer footage of archive interviews in the first act. <br><br>Interview with fans and some overly candid footage of the trio eating wimpy burgers and wiping off sweat backstage, was more of a curiosity than a revelation. <br><br>My main gripe was how Richey was mentioned almost in passing during the film; and any insight into how band dynamics had changed over time - from Richey's position of (essentially being) band leader from Generation Terrorists to post-Holy Bible transition - was skipped over. This issue of a possible communication break-down and creative fall out was only hinted at briefly by Sean and left unexplored by the filmmakers. At the request of the band, I suppose.<br><br>Hopefully Withdrawn Traces will give fans a better insight into Richey's departure; when it's released next year.","user":"travisbickle86","rank":[2,2]}]
