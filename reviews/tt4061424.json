[{"title":"...this movie deserves to be seen","rating":9,"date":"27 July 2017","review":"Brilliant writing (once again) from Kris Elgstrand. Jon Weinberg left us gobsmacked at his performance on both sides of the camera. As fans of Ty Labine since 'Reaper', we thought this is some of his best work ever. Beautifully shot, great music, solid performances from everyone in the cast...this movie deserves to be seen.","user":"handsofdave","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Love this movie lots of fun!!","rating":10,"date":"19 November 2019","review":"I was pleasantly surprised on this film. Left me laughing and has become one of my favorite movies.","user":"mnhomefinders","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Indie film, fun characters","rating":9,"date":"31 January 2020","review":"Loved it as someone who enjoys quirky comedies and characters! Just look at the actors - Tyler Labine, Jed Rees (Deadpool AND Galaxy Quest), Rahnuma Panthaky.\nWhat makes it especially fun is that it's one of those films you can tell the actors enjoyed making. And yes, unpredictable would be a good way to describe what happens when the main guy runs into them. Fun music too.","user":"IMDB_dir","rank":[0,0]}]
