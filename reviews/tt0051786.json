[{"title":"THis movie scared the hell out of me in 1960","rating":23,"date":"23 September 2006","review":"I haven't seen this movie in 46 years, but the thing I remember about it is the fact that I was so terrified watching it, at nine years of age at the Lincoln Theatre in Kearny, NJ, that I had to leave before it ended. I didn't sleep well for many nights after that.<br><br>There was a scene I remember where a crew member opened an air duct access hatch (or what, as I recall now, looked like one), and a hand fell down in front of him, obviously belonging to a dead colleague of his. The creature had stuffed the body in the ductwork. That was all I could take. I threw my comic book (I always bought one for 10 cents on my way to the movies on Saturday afternoons. My mom would give me 35 cents, 10 for the comic and a quarter for the double feature with cartoons in between) up in front of my face so I couldn't see, and ran up the center aisle, out the doors, and away from that horror. I saw just about every monster/horror/sci-fi movie made in the 1950's on one or another of those wonderful Saturdays at the Lincoln Theatre, and the only other one that made me run out was House on Haunted Hill.<br><br>What I wouldn't give for another chance to see two movies and three cartoons for a quarter, through the unjaded eyes of a nine-year old boy, still able to be scared out of my wits by a guy in a rubber suit.","user":"jmcd7910","rank":[102,109]},{"title":"20 years before Ripley told everyone to shut-up","rating":8,"date":"7 September 2008","review":"I dug this one out of the dust bin and was quietly amazed at the simple, yet straight on-target focus of this movie. Yes-- Alien borrowed the basic setup from this 1958 setup. And yes-- Alien did it BETTER, ICKIER, and SCARIER. But hey, this was 1958!<br><br>The script is actually very down to earth and intelligent. The snippets of Sci-Fi Factoids actually made sense for what people popularly knew about Mars back then. The women were still women of that era, but they were intelligent and level headed. No Screaming. No fainting. No Falling down and spraining of slim ankles because of fashionable stiletto heels. <br><br>The fact that the movie is B&amp;W is a plus in terms of the monster and the make-up. Let's face it-- in most scary movies, the scariest moment is when the camera is DARK and there is almost no color. Here, the shadows hide that fact that the monster is a guy in a heavy rubber suit. And in 1966, this movie frightened me enough to keep me awake all night.<br><br>Fun spots:<br><br>1-- Guns, LOTS of handguns, Rifles, grenades, crates of 'em-- gods, they even got a BAZOOKA! And they're shooting them all off inside a tin can in Outer Space. Man, they built them thar spaceships like battleships! And they're ALL good shots because not one single bullet ever sets fire to a VITAL control panel. Wow!<br><br>2-- The women pour coffee and make sandwiches for the men. Ah. . .Heaven!<br><br>If you and your friends are Sci-Fi buff, despite being dated, this 'B' Classic is worth a Saturday Night Oldies Flick.<br><br>Just ask POLITELY: Girls, can we have some sandwiches?","user":"Rabh17","rank":[27,29]},{"title":"THE ORIGINAL ALIEN","rating":19,"date":"19 January 2000","review":"Out of the fifties 'B' Science-Fiction monster movies, this easily ranks as the best.  It's most notable as the film that ALIEN is an unaccredited remake of, thus giving it a certain historical significance.<br><br>The intriguing plot is about the rescue of the only marooned survivor (Col. Carruthers) of an ill-fated expedition to Mars.  The authorities, pig-headed as usual, falsely assume that he murdered his fellow crew members, so that he'd have more provisions to survive;  hence he is being brought back to Earth to face court-martial for murder. (There is also a somewhat interesting plot reversal here:  Most movies of this nature usually begin with the ship leaving Earth, enroute to its otherworld destination, while, in this case, the \"story\" is believed finished, and begins as the characters take-off from the other planet, returning to Earth).  As the rescue ship is leaving Mars, a lurking, ominous shadow is seen in the lower compartment. (A frightening, atmospheric moment, accomplished through sheer economy and simplicity).<br><br>Carruthers insists of his innocence to his fellow captors, claiming that his original crew mates were slaughtered by a hostile, unseen presence on the desolute red planet, but three-guesses as to their reaction to his unusual plea.  Naturally, he can't prove it, and 50's space authorities were not very alien conscience at the time.  (As a side-thought, \"unseen menace\" may remind you of that highly \"original\" BLAIR WITCH).<br><br>As everyone sacks out, a hapless supporting charactor whose name is at the bottom of the casting list (guess what will happen to him?) hears something in the lower compartment.  Despite your futile \"don't go down there, you jerk!\" pleas, he does just that, and is appropriately killed (more like thoroughly obliterated) by the shadowy figure with insatiable blood lust on its mind.  In the victim's case, dereliction of duty and sheer cowardliness would have been the wise decision.  The scene is actually well-directed (for a change) and develops much suspense, as the entire film surprisingly does.<br><br>The crew finally catches on that they have an unwanted ship crasher on board, and try every possible means at their disposal to eliminate it, but the unknown creature seems to copping an anti-death attitude.  Proving to be an even more clever, worthy adversary, 'IT!' also hides out in the ventilation shafts of the ship (now that should ring a bell).  Cahn's forceful direction generates considerable tension as the malevolent stowaway works its way up from one level of the confined ship to the next, eventually leaving the remaining characters trapped at the top.  The movie's suspense is blunt and right to the point:  \"IT!' has to kill them or starve, hence they have to kill \"IT!\" or die.  Nothing like those \"no two ways about it\" choices.  Rent it, or check for it on cable if you wish to know the outcome.<br><br>For a low-budget quickie, IT! is quite impressive and memorable.  The dreaded sense of claustrophobic tension, rendering the characters' helpless entrapment, is highly effective.  This is a production in which the limited budget and small sets actually work in favor of the plot's scary ambience. The black &amp; white photography (Yes, it's one of those!) helps to enhance its dark, creepy mood, and the sense of apprehension is quite high.  (Modern day color freaks never seem to take that into consideration).  The plot is also somewhat cynically ironic: If the creature hadn't stowed away on the ship, Carruthers would have most likely been found guilty of the charges against him.<br><br>The intelligent script  (see what I mean about \"rareity\") was penned by noted Science-Fiction author Jerome Bixby (remember Twilight Zone's \"It's a Good Life\")?  The picture's taut editing eliminates any extraneous dross. (ALIEN tended to drag in its first hour with its sophomoric dialogue, and why did it have to include that stupid and ultimately counter-productive sub-plot of Ash being a robot, and further dragging the story down to another big bad conspiracy cliche?   UNNECESSARY!!!)<br><br>Director Cahn astutely keeps the rubber-suited monster off-screen and in the shadows through-out most of the proceedings, keeping your paranoid imagination on constant alert.  Unfortunately, perhaps at the studio's commercial insistance, it is a little over-revealed at the climax, but I haven't claimed this to be the perfect masterpiece.  The performances, though nothing award-winning, are nevertheless cool enough so that one becomes sincerely concerned as to their fates.  Not many movies in recent times ever come close to achieving that.  They can be over-produced from here to eternity, and usually only succeed in being gloriously annoying.<br><br>This film's story is not really totally original (what is?), for it is based on A.E. Van Vogt's \"VOYAGE OF THE SPACE BEAGLE.\"  All ALIEN fanatics should track down an old used copy to see where the initial influence came from.<br><br>As long as you're not craving another CGI wind-ding, you may find it worthwhile.  Just don't expect the women to be Ripley precursors.  This was still the sock-knitting fifties, sad to say.","user":"danr51","rank":[50,61]}]
