[{"title":"Top Candidate for Mystery 3000 Revival","rating":1,"date":"16 January 2015","review":"Porno quality acting, porno quality actresses, porno quality dialog. gigantic plot holes, zero internal logic, ridiculous overuse of automatic weapons, bad science and disrespect for the laws of physics, poor CGI, rotten set design, bad lighting, yada, yada.<br><br>Oddly enough, the sound,editing,and cinematography were professionally acceptable.<br><br>The makers of this film have no respect for science fiction and were just attempting to make a cheap comic book movie. Unfortunately, they didn't have the funds or imagination. The result compares unfavorably with the average movie made for the syfi channel.<br><br>Thomas Jayne was obviously embarrassed to be in this since he obscured his looks in shambling meth addict wardrobe and makeup. Bruce Willis didn't have that luxury so he was forced to show his disdain by delivering his lines deadpan like a first table reading of the script.","user":"jackbaumel","rank":[110,145]},{"title":"A very bad B movie","rating":2,"date":"16 January 2015","review":"When I watched this movie it had a 4.7 rating. I thought it couldn't be that bad - it starred Bruce Willis after all. Turns out Willis must have owed someone a big favor, because this movie is really terrible. Poor acting, poor script and poor directing. <br><br>And what's up with the artificial smoke? It's everywhere. This movie is everything Blade Runner wasn't and I mean that in the worst possible way.<br><br>I rate it 2 because Willis doesn't act quite as bad as the rest of the lead cast.<br><br>In short, this movie was a major disappointment and I wonder what it was that made Willis say yes to play a part in it.","user":"trikztar","rank":[111,150]},{"title":"Someone owes me my money back!","rating":1,"date":"24 January 2015","review":"I've been around a long time and have seen A lot of movies. I would have to say that this \"movie\" is easily in my top 5 of Worst Movies EVER. All the negative reviews are spot on. I would imagine that anyone rating this over 5 is either fake or is possibly listed somewhere on the credits...which, by the way, were more enjoyable to watch than the movie itself. <br><br>I watched this movie for free but for the first time in my life I feel compelled to ask someone for my money back. Yes, it's THAT BAD!<br><br>PS. I have never posted a movie review before so it took forever for me to find a way to post one on IMDb. I was first using my iPhone. Spent 15 minutes and couldn't find it so I fired up my laptop, spent 4 minutes locating the right link to push. I mention this because I needed to add more lines of text for my review to be posted AND I wanted you to understand how serious I was about finding a way to post this review. It is that bad of a movie!","user":"bcoday","rank":[86,119]}]
