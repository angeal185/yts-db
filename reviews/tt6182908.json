The truth sets you free, tolerance, don't let others tell you what to believe in, accept and embrace differences etc etc etc. Enjoyable, warm and fun","user":"baz-61990","rank":[187,230]},{"title":"Beautiful family movie","rating":9,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"We thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

The message is so heartwarming, and there were lots of funny moments too.","user":"gabbymoulton","rank":[108,135]},{"title":"What lies beneath? An upside surprise","rating":8,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"You never know what you're going to get with non-Disney/Pixar animation. It might be an Illumination Entertainment-style effort -- lacking in substance but lots of wise cracks and kid-friendly touches (think \"Minions\" or \"Sing\") -- or a Laika-style affair, with depth and darkness to boot (\"Kubo and The Two Strings\"). <br><br>Warner Animation Group has form, of course, with \"The Lego Movie\" combining laugh-out-loud humour for the kids with a knowing, subversive quality to keep the Mums and Dads entertained. It also produced \"Storks\", a much more pedestrian effort. Thankfully, \"Smallfoot\" belongs in the former camp. <br><br>Boasting impressive CG animation courtesy of Sony Imageworks, \"Smallfoot\" takes a tale reminiscent of \"Monsters Inc.\" -- two groups ignorant and fearful of the other, in this case yetis and humans -- and twists it with a clever, topical message about the perils of putting dogma and self-interest ahead of critical thinking and the greater good. Ignorance really isn't bliss. This adult-friendly message may elude kids too busy laughing at the many visual gags, including a fantastic sequence involving fraying rope that brings to mind classic Warner animations of yesteryear, but it elevates the movie above most of its peers and ensures that not-so-young audience members are entertained too.<br><br>The film isn't quite Disney/Pixar level -- the yeti character designs are a little odd, as though the animators were trying to avoid too close a resemblance to Pixar's Sully, and the featured songs are catchy rather than great (Zendaya's \"Wonderful Life\" being the stand-out). <br><br>Still, \"Smallfoot\" is a thoroughly entertaining family film that aspires to be different, backed by appealing protagonists, well-judged comic moments, a thought-provoking message, and a rewarding resolution that steers clear of being saccharine. Recommended.","user":"BrodyMarcusMacey","rank":[85,106]}]
