[{"title":"A FUN FILLED ADVENTURE FOR ALL AGES!!","rating":30,"date":"30 July 2001","review":"This was the first film that I saw in the theater as a kid, and I have never forgotten it. David Hartman instantly became my favorite actor, and I was hooked on movies forever! This is the kind of movie that fills our dreams and satisfies the wanderlusterer in all of us. The high adventure, and colorful cinematography in this movie is what makes a great film. I've purchased the movie recently and am able to relive the wonder of Arctic travel once more. Its truly a trip back to my childhood when all things were simpler and adventure waited around every turn.","user":"spencerthetracy","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"A good family adventure...","rating":7,"date":"3 February 2005","review":"As with several other reviewers, I also have fond memories of the theatrical release of this film from my youth, and this fantastic Jules Vernesque tale of a airship journey into the unknown arctic still holds up pretty well after all this time. There is some decent acting, a great score, a zeppelin,vikings in real viking longboats, real Scandinavian dialog, exploding volcanoes and vicious killer whales, what more do you want?<br><br>Some things are dated, such as the Eskimo vs. Inuit thing, the portrayal of Orca as man-eaters, etc. and the special effects have seen better days..but there are some surprisingly good sets with amazing matte paintings that are as good as anything you see on modern films (note the amazing viking hall on a hill top), great aerial footage, and a pretty decent story with good pace.<br><br>Break out the popcorn and enjoy it with your kids.","user":"umlaut-3","rank":[22,24]},{"title":"A spectacular fun filled journey for the whole family","rating":8,"date":"18 February 2005","review":"For a low budget Disney movie that's 30 years old this ripping yarn is a lot of fun. It has everything from killer whales, volcanoes, an experimental airship, a lost civilization of Vikings and even Mako in the role of an Eskimo who 'fights like a bear'!<br><br>When Sir Anthony discovers that his son has gone missing in the frozen north, this upper class Brit wastes no time in putting together a team of explorers (an American archaeologist, a French aviator and an Eskimo) to get him back. Using an experimental French airship they head past Greenland into the vast unknown of the frozen north. Using a map made of bone and ancient myths they find their way to a lost island oasis hidden deep in the ice.<br><br>I won't ruin anymore of the plot, as it gets even better from there. The set pieces and costumes are amazing for their time (and the low budget). The special effects in some parts look slightly dated but add to the charm of the film. If you don't think so then I am sure that the attack by the killer whales towards the end makes up for it! This film is a lot of fun and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good adventure story. The movie is PG enough for the kiddies, but the neat story and the clever locations will keep the adults interested.","user":"pozdena","rank":[13,14]}]
