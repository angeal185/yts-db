[{"title":"Holmes and Watson are called to save Sir Baskerville from a curse that has plagued his family for centuries","rating":7,"date":"8 June 2011","review":"Correct rendition of the most famous mystery novel written by Arthur Conan Doyle with an awesome Peter Cushing as Sherlock and fairly faithful to the source material. Holmes (Peter Cushing )and Watson(Andre Morell) are contracted by Doctor Mortimer (Francis De Wolff) for the investigation of killing Sr. Baskerville who is now inherited by his niece Sir Henry . Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to help protect Sir Henry Baskerville (Christopher Lee), who has returned to England to take his place at the family seat following the death of his uncle, Sir Charles Baskerville. Sir Charles died of cardiac exhaustion and Dr. Mortimer believes he was frightened to death. There appears to be a curse on the family dating back nearly 200 years to when Sir Hugo Baskerville was supposedly killed on the moor by a huge hound. Holmes dismisses the supernatural elements of the case but there are a sufficient number of odd events to pique his interest. Holmes soon realizes that someone is making sure the legend becomes real . Watson goes to the mansion ,there are the servants(John Le Mesurier) and he meets Stapleton and his daughter (Marla Landi). Meanwhile an inmate has escaped and on the moor sound the barking of a savage beast.<br><br>This is an excellent and thrilling film with horror elements in Hammer style based on the splendid novel by Arthur Conan Doyle .It's a genuine ripping yarn with much suspense and moody intrigue . The film gets mystery, tension, thrills , detective action and packs an exciting deal of outstanding surprises with great lots of fun despite to be a known story . Magnificent Peter Cushing's interpretation although the best Sherlock is forever Basil Rathbone. Cushing plays as Holmes as an intelligent, obstinate, broody, pipesmoking sleuth , his acting is similar to Jeremy Brett for TV or Nicol Williamson(Seven-per-cent-solution) or Christopher Plummer(Murder by decree). Here Dr. Watson isn't a botcher, bungler or clumsy partner incarnated by Nigel Bruce but a cunning and astute pal well represented by Andre' Morell .The movie has a creepy atmosphere specially when is developed on the moor where lives the fearful giant beast ; besides the 223 Baker Street's house is well designed. Spooky and murky cinematography by Jack Asher . Eerie and creepy musical score by James Bernard . This atmospheric motion picture is accurately directed by the ¨Hammer House of Horror¨ master , the great Terence Fisher . Other version about this story are the following : the best version that still can be called a classic filmed in 1939 by Sidney Landfield with Basil Rathbone , Nigel Bruce y Richard Greene ; English adaptation (1983) by Douglas Hickox with Ian Richardson as Holmes and Donald Churchill as Watson and TV rendition with Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke . directed by Peter Hammond .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[23,23]},{"title":"Hammer, Holmes, and the Hound","rating":16,"date":"16 October 2001","review":"Director Terence Fisher, actors Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and Andre Morrell, and the Hammer production crew bring Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous story of the legendary hound of the Baskervilles into colour for the first time.  In point of fact, this is the first Sherlock Holmes story filmed in glorious colour, and it does the story proud with its phospherescent glow on the dog, its swirling mists, and the natural tweed colours of Holmes and Watson.  Though some argue that Cushing was miscast as Holmes, I argue most vehemently THAT he is perfectly cast as the great detective.  His features cry out Doyle's character, and his obvious inner quest for perfection resonates strongly through the character as well. Cushing lends his class to the role and, in my opinion, gives us a fine Holmes, perhaps one of the screen's best.  I always enjoy watching a Cushing performance as he was an actor that loved to play with props, and as Christopher Lee states in his autobiography, a man who could play with the prop and act to perfection, often making it look so very elementary. Watch his Holmes.  Very few scenes go by where he isn't playing with something. Lee is good in his role, though the part is rather lacklustre.  Andre Morrell is a fine Watson.  He does not do the Nigel Bruce buffoon act, but rather he plays a man capable of having graduated from medical school.  The rest of the cast is good with Francis DeWolff standing out as a doctor in love with himself and the sound of his voice and the ever affable Miles Malleson adding comic relief as a befuddled bishop.  The story stays pretty close to the word according to Doyle.  Fisher gives what you would expect: tight direction, lush cinematography, and loads of beautiful shots of the fog-ridden moors.  The film has a clever prologue about the curse of the Baskervilles as an introduction, and it is wonderfully executed.","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[34,37]},{"title":"The Definitive Holmes and Watson.","rating":10,"date":"24 March 2005","review":"Although this version of the story differs from the original novel, there is much to recommend it for. The film is well paced and atmospheric but it's greatest strength is the excellent cast, particularly the three leads. It's nice to see Christopher Lee playing the romantic role as a change to his usual monsters and Peter Cushing is brilliant as Holmes, his performance being the definitive as he makes the character believable and interesting. This film also features the best ever casting of Dr Watson. Andre Morell moves away from the bumbling fool of other Holmes films and makes Watson intelligent, capable and even dashing. Morell's charismatic performance is all the more welcome as 'Hounds' is the story which puts Watson centre stage for most of the plot. It's a shame he never played the part again as he and Cushing make the perfect Holmes and Watson. If only Hammer had made a series of Holmes films.","user":"rgaretho","rank":[50,56]}]
