[{"title":"A brilliant example of using narrative to bring abstract ideas alive","rating":10,"date":"14 March 1999","review":"This film was made with the cooperation of psychologist Henri Laborit. It's broken down, like a greek drama, into narrative episodes and odes where the chorus, in this case psychologist Laborit, explains the meaning of the episodes. I love this movie because it makes clear the pretenance to everyday life of a discourse which is very rich as an interpretation of life, in exactly Matthew Arnold's sense, but at the same time so abstract that most people just, for example, reading Laborit's \"Decoding the human message\" would not see the immediate relevance of what was being said to their own daily concerns. I use this film to teach psychology. I open my intro class with it every term. Learning to read this film is learning to think like a psychologist. In the film, we cut from scenes of the human characters involved in various relationships to Laborit showing how lab rats react to stress under various conditions. The result is not dry or pedantic but funny as hell. It comes off as the rats doing a low burlesque of the human comedy. We also see the characters as children and as adults and scenes from various formative episodes along the way. When Laborit says \"a person is a memory which acts\" it seems a powerful commentary on what we are seeing on screen. We see one character as a tiny girl interacting with her factory worker father. He is a communist and he is teaching his newly articualte baby girl to repeat after him \"USA go home\". Watching this, I remember being taught to sing \"Jeusus loves me\" shortly after I started talking. This film is funny and wonderful dealing with the thing which matters most of all, the question of what it means to be a person.","user":"solace-3","rank":[36,41]},{"title":"Intelligent, thought-provoking, mesmerizing","rating":11,"date":"11 October 2000","review":"I've seen this film twice.  The first time, it told me how to view the world.  The second time, it represented my view of the world.  Everyone's actions are determined by a small number of forces, it says.  Everyone's behavior fits into only four categories, it says.  And yet, it presents such a wide range of emotions, actions, and thoughts that it seems to contradict its very hypothesis.  And yet, it doesn't.  Turn your brain on and watch this; give it time to sink in, then watch it again.  I guarantee it will change your way of looking at the world.  The editing is top-notch, and Resnais is at the top of his form, as he was 20 years earlier with Hiroshima Mon Amour.  The ending is a stunner, and it encapsulates the film while at the same time extending its meaning.  The cinematography and message will remind you of Resnais' Night and Fog.  Brilliant performances from all three leads and Laborit.  Give it time, use your brain, and view it multiple times.  You will be rewarded.","user":"Catch-52","rank":[24,28]},{"title":"MON ONCLE D' AMERIQUE IS FANTASTIQUE","rating":18,"date":"18 March 2002","review":"This film will only appeal to two types of people 1. Resnais die-hard fans (including me) and intellectuals. This film is extremely odd and infuriating if your an average cinema goer. The film is a cinematic science lesson. But it is absolutley amazing. Resnais uses documentary techniques and surrealism and a narrator (a world renowned expert on human behaviour) who discusses the characters through out the film. It follows three people who are all loosely connected. What makes the film so superb is the fact that it is am intellectual avante garde arthouse film, that instead of isolating the viewer like they usually do. Resnais creates a wonderfully warm film. You end up really liking the characters. Who grow up before your eyes over the years. Resnais doesn't put a foot wrong.Gerard Depiedieu is great as the frustrated office worker who struggles raising a family and hassles at work.<br><br>ten out of ten","user":"Martyn Brown","rank":[31,39]}]
