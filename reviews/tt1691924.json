[{"title":"No Budget But Enjoyable Film","rating":7,"date":"26 January 2016","review":"This is not a big Hollywood production with all of the shiny bells and whistles. It's a no budget, horror flick complete with crappy picture quality. It does, however, have a rather original and interesting story line, which is not common in Hollywood big budgets these days. If you are into the old B horror films like \"The Blob\" you may get a kick out of this, but if you are looking for a Star Wars type you will be sorely disappointed. I actually thought the acting was quite good for a B horror flick, especially the lead actress, Stephanie Hullar, who plays Lauren Redd. A no/low budget film makes it hard for an actor to look good, but she pulls it off. It has some nice special effects for a low budget. It also has an interesting twist on the idea of werewolves. I think it's a great film for those who are into the old horror films. It's the kind I would expect to see on the old Friday Fright Night shows.","user":"bunnyrunusa","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"An obvious B-horror movie.","rating":1,"date":"7 December 2015","review":"First few scenes it becomes clear that this is a very low budget flick.Some of the make up is decent but nothing more than that.The werewolf are more shadow shots and it looked very weak.<br><br>Acting was very wooden and was more of bad T.V movie level.Basic camera-work makes it all look bland and is therefor not convincing.The opening credits were in German but the language was English so that was a bit strange.<br><br>Nothing is really added to the genre so it is not worth it to spend time or money on this. It's a straight to video,dime in a dozen flick and if you miss this it won't be anything of a loss.<br><br>I don't recommend it.<br><br>There are a lot of movies out there much better than this.<br><br>This is no good.<br><br>It's bad!.","user":"djangozelf-12351","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Horrible C-level production. One of the worst films I have seen this year","rating":2,"date":"9 December 2015","review":"This is one of those embarrassments that makes you feel sorry for everyone involved. Horrid camera work makes it look like a cheap daytime soap opera, what passes as cinematography is a joke, and the acting is ham-fisted and laughable. The worst offender is the director, as he obviously lacks any real talent in the use of camera work to tell a decent visual story. The only saving grace in this abomination was the special effects work, but that's like saying that one piece of a turd does not smell as bad as the rest of it. Just an overall shoddy production that does not deserve anyone's time or patience. A third rate production in ever sense of the word, hopefully this \"movie\" will be as quickly forgotten as it deserves to be.","user":"datflybody","rank":[4,5]}]
