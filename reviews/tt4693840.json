The acting was almost comical it was so dreadful and the script and story line had more holes than swiss cheese. I actually sat through the whole movie hoping for some redeeming value to it but feel like I just wasted an hour and 15 minutes of my life for a dreadful and depressing ending.","user":"DarianFisher","rank":[0,0]}]
