[{"title":"Beautiful and strong message","rating":9,"date":"15 October 2018","review":"This is a great film so worth being watched. However, the poster doesn't do the film justice. It suggests it's a funny film and it isn't. It's about sadness, sorrow, grief and everything I between for a family.","user":"suzhugoson","rank":[10,12]}]
