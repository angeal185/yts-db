[{"title":"i love this movie","rating":8,"date":"11 April 2012","review":"Where the Red Fern grows is a heart warming movie, this movie reminds me of my childhood. I miss the days when i ran wild and free and kept in touch with nature, i didn't need a cell phone, TV or internet to be entertained. Billy had a innocent up bringing he is persistent and a hard worker. The Coleman family were respectful and had good morals. Billy got a pair of dogs which he loved and also teaching him responsibility, he spent most of his time with his dogs hunting racoon's, keeping him busy and out of trouble. This movie taught me material things don't always make u happy and also to be grateful for my family and for the things I have","user":"j-pompa1","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Very good adaptation","rating":7,"date":"7 February 2005","review":"This movie was a very good adaptation of the book, and this coming from someone who is very critical. I have, like most, read the book many times, which I think makes it harder to like any film adaptation. However, the movie follows the book very well, omitting small things that really didn't have a lot to do with the plot-line. I would say the movie had a little more of a religious slant than the book did. The acting was nice. I would say the major criticism would be they didn't really get into the dog's personalities much. The book did a great job of showing Dan as a clutz with a big heart and Ann as the smart one. However, I would recommend this and it was a million times better than the original movie adaptation.","user":"tampaman24","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"If it ain't broke...","rating":23,"date":"23 April 2005","review":"The problem with this movie is the pacing. I was, perhaps foolishly, anticipating something grand when I rented the DVD, since I love the book and quite liked the original 1974 film. I had been told that the 2003 remake was accurate to Wilson Rawls' novel. Strictly speaking, this is true, but therein lies it's downfall.<br><br>Movies adapted from books often have to have sections removed or characters cut because, unlike films, no book is designed to be enjoyed in a single sitting. In this movie the acting is beyond hurried as people race through their lines, desperate to include every utterance of the novel in less than two hours. The results are dismal. The only time I've seen worse butchery of a good novel was the atrocious movie version of \"The Hotel New Hampshire\" by John Irving.<br><br>If you love the book, read the book; or maybe get nostalgic and rent the original. Don't rent this version unless you just need something, anything, to sit some kids in front of for an afternoon while you balance your checkbook.","user":"english66","rank":[15,26]}]
