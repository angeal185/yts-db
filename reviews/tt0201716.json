[{"title":"Just...Wow...","rating":7,"date":"16 April 2020","review":"One might think it's hard to be surprised by a movie called Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wastelands (1967) (aka Dutch Wife in the Desert, or more accurately, KÃ´ya no Dacchi waifu), but then you actually see it and your jaw is pretty much planted on the floor. Directed by Branded to Kill writer, Atsushi Yamatoya, in that quintessentially Japanese '60s Yakuza film style, but taken to an exponential degree on the weirdness meter.<br><br>Telling the story of a hitman who has an appointment with the murderer of his girlfriend, it feels like if David Lynch had made a New York City roughie inhabited by Japanese nouvelle vague gangsters it would be this film. It truly has to be seen to be believed. While the story does drag in places, I never lost interest. Camera work is strictly bargain basement with the 'creative' use of out-of-focus shots that seem to indicate there was, in the best tradition of ultra-low budget cinema, not a lot of footage that remained unused.","user":"petersmovieposters-36377","rank":[0,0]}]
