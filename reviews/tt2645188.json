[{"title":"Dull, Trite and Plot less","rating":3,"date":"2 November 2015","review":"Visually, this low budget drama is nicely done with atmospheric location and lighting.<br><br>The performances aren't bad. The main problem is that the actors really had very little to work with, and I feel for them.<br><br>There is no real plot beyond a very shallow rehash of the besieged-by-nutters theme. The SF/alien aspect is completely superfluous and is in no way required by the travesty that masquerades as a storyline. The dialogue is dreadful, with thin chunks of cliché exposition and old-hat speculations about aliens who the budget will not allow us to see.<br><br>As is so often the case, the first reviews of this movie are implausibly glowing... and similar. Draw your own conclusions.","user":"rickcadger-67635","rank":[37,46]},{"title":"Moody piece on the psychology of survival","rating":7,"date":"14 April 2016","review":"As often, reviews and ratings on IMDb are completely wrong, as I found The Quiet Hour vastly underrated.<br><br>In gloom and at slow pace, accompanied by a very rich and touching score by Carlos José Alvarez, following Sarah and Tom through the hardships of survival is an intimate journey.<br><br>By avoiding an excess of action-driven plot points, as you would expect from your average alien invasion film, this one comes across far more evocative and tense.<br><br>It reminded me a bit of Testament by Lynne Littman, but The Quiet Hour is the better cinematic experience of the two, and I guess somewhat more positive. (Not that any of them could really be called cheerful to the slightest.)","user":"peppersghost","rank":[22,31]},{"title":"Not even B class movie","rating":1,"date":"27 October 2016","review":"OK, a blind guy that looks at everything, A smoking chimney when no one stokes a fire, a fish that burns as there is no oil ???? hello, fish are full of oil and what was wrong with steaming it ?, food in short supply yet carrots and spud were peeled instead of being scrubbed, lock all the downstairs windows and leave the upstairs ones open,, no one heard the vehicle drive up outside, search for an intruder with a gun pointing at the floor, a cut on Sarahs face that got worse and then better and then worse again.....who the hell did the continuation ?? lousy computer graphics where alien craft go behind the mother ship, wooden actors, terrible story line and a director that needs to go back to school to learn his profession....Simply awful. I had to watch it all just to see how bad it really was","user":"lamtara-93763","rank":[14,26]}]
