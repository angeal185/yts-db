[{"title":"Maybe.............\"The Grand Gesture\"","rating":21,"date":"21 September 2005","review":"C'mon, World, wake up and REdiscover this little gay gem of a movie. There are so many out there that easily deserve their 0- or 1-Star; surely this little pearl deserves more. Yes, 1997's \"Broadway Damage\" is probably one of the most underrated and least known \"gems\" of gay filmdom........why not discover its delights yourself? So, just what is it about this production? Well, hey, there's no weird, dreary storyline; it's lite and fun......with guys who are not afraid to kiss. Yes, Michael Shawn Lucas (as Marc) has a body \"to die for\" and, c'mon, when he's also as earnestly sincere and sweet as he is, who wouldn't wanna wind up with him. And it would be very hard to forget Aaron Williams (as Robert), playing an endearing \"little puppy\" of a guy, who'll bring down Marc in the end. In fact, both male leads wear their sincerity on their sleeves----kinda refreshing to think there might still be guys like this out there.<br><br>Above all, if you can't stand the sunny sincerity of a Broadway musical (but without all the singing), then stay away from this cuz it definitely tries to be sincere.......and succeeds at that in spades. Along with this there's really great cinematography: brite and colorful (how'd they do it with what must have been a piddl'in budget?). Hey, and there's that soundtrack to fall in love with, too. How Director Victor Mignatti put all this together, with no more money than he likely had, is anybody's guess and is a minor (scratch that), major miracle. How does a guy like this then just disappear from directing for the next 8, 9 years? Sad, sad, sad.<br><br>In closing, one thing to possibly question is if maybe, just maybe, Director Mignatti should'a rethought the title. \"BD\" might resonate more with NY City-ers, but his own within-the-movie phrase: \"The Grand Gesture\" might have had more meaning to audiences at large (would the latter, as a title, have drawn in more viewers/buyers who'd fondly remember this film?). Ah, well, Monday morning \"after-thought-ing\" is always easier, isn't it? Besides, any way you look at it, Marc and Robert are gonna wind up being one of the favorite couples you'll meet in your home film library from time to time.....I betcha.<br><br>PS: You know what? I'll even betcha this movie is one that other favorite film couples, such as Aaron &amp; Christian (see Title 1, below) and Cedric &amp; Laurent (see Title 2, below) would wanna have in their home video collections.<br><br>(1) \"Latter Days\" / (2) \"Just A Question Of Love\"","user":"arizona-philm-phan","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"A perfect jewel of a film","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2000","review":"This film is a most delightful example of what filmmaking can do without a ton of money.   The talent displayed in this film is extraordinary, from the music writing to the acting to the manner in which it is filmed.  Start to finish it is a pure delight.  I rented it for a week and have watched it 5 times so far!<br><br>We need more films like this which provide us with real stories but an optimistic and loving view of the world.  The romance in this film is the best I can recall ever seeing.  BRAVO to all involved in making this magnificent film!","user":"pyotr-3","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"A fun and sweet little movie","rating":1,"date":"1 January 1999","review":"Two friends, a young gay man and his straight girl friend share an apartment in Manhattan and try to deal with life in the big city.   Mara Hobel is very funny as the fag hag friend and the movie is light and comical as it explores the characters lives and loves.  Seeing the film in a packed house of gay men in Manhattan made it clear that the filmmaker was pretty on target as the audience laughed  with recognition through most of the film. A very fun movie!","user":"ML368","rank":[12,14]}]
