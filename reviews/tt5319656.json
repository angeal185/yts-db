[{"title":"Diane is not a likeable character.","rating":2,"date":"24 November 2018","review":"I love Paul Greene and he plays his part well but the main character, Diane, just isn't likeable or relatable. She isn't the most caring parent and she is incredibly selfish.","user":"dianalyn79","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Giddy rubbish","rating":3,"date":"2 September 2017","review":"I have been watching romantic movies on the Hallmark channel now for a couple of years. But unfortunately they have been getting worse and worse and this one is pretty awful. It could have been so much better. There was no on screen spark between the couple, it just seemed all too giddy.","user":"wildcapturedangel","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Nice Message","rating":7,"date":"16 June 2017","review":"In a time and space where movies are so saturated with over produced and completely CGI offerings, it is a nice break to get back to the basics of film making (story telling). This message is a good one, and even though the themes have been seen before, you will not go away feeling worse than when you started watching. Even though it is kind of my thing...I was not dissatisfied with this film.","user":"mrdissatisfied","rank":[9,16]}]
