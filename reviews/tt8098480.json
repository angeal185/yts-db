[{"title":"A Bore","rating":1,"date":"23 October 2019","review":"I'd like to point something out. This film, as I write this, has a 8.7 rating from a supposed 1,196 viewers yet not one user review. I'm the first and I'm here to warn you, watch the trailer first. If you think the trailer looks slow and boring , with wooden acting , you will not enjoy this film. Another production where some guy wrote it, directed it and stars in it and has talent in none of those fields.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[121,131]},{"title":"8.7 is Joke","rating":1,"date":"23 October 2019","review":"When i see 1000+ person voted 8.7 i knew this movie should be bad. If you like amateur student movies you may like it. In first scenes i notice color correction mistakes (cause of lighting mistakes) and unnecessary extended scenes that time i understood its waste of time.","user":"poko-49656","rank":[78,86]},{"title":"Absolutely terrible","rating":1,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"I also read it had good reviews.
