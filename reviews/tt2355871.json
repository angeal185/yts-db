[{"title":"Informative and a complete dissection of a Giant snake","rating":8,"date":"30 October 2017","review":"Curious after seeing the trailer of this documentary, I decided to take a full look. The documentary started with the accidental discovery of the fossil of the giant snake and explained all the minute details of the snakes anatomy and lifestyle. lots of interesting computer graphics at regular intervals keeps the viewer hooked. comparisons with the Modern day Anaconda was also really helpful to imagine how the creature behaved. The screenplay and the story does justice to the audience who were watching out of sheer curiosity. The length of the film could have been slightly reduced to 60 or 70 minutes by reducing some repetitions.","user":"BrutusRider","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"great movie for students","rating":28,"date":"28 January 2018","review":"Where can I get a hold of a hard copy of this movie?","user":"swhiting-33719","rank":[0,0]}]
