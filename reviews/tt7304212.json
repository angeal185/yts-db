[{"title":"Witty and feel-good (yet very real) rom-com. A must see!","rating":10,"date":"16 April 2019","review":"This movie had my cracking up from start to finish. It's talks about the realities (the good, the bad, and the, ugly) of on-line dating and dating in general. If you're a lover of comedy and/or romance, you have to watch this. It's fantastic!","user":"jessicabibby11","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Swipe right!","rating":9,"date":"17 April 2019","review":"Dating online can be heaven or hell and leave us feeling dejected or elated. This film wrestles with the unique qualms of app based dating and does it with a cutting cometic style.<br><br>Those who have swiped right will find this film funny and relatable. Those who haven't stand to learn about the conundrums of modern love and will get a good laugh out of what all those single millennials are dealing with.","user":"gladstone-d","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"Very sweet","rating":10,"date":"16 April 2019","review":"This is a cool story :) loved the ending and the main character.
