[{"title":"Supporting Cast shines","rating":7,"date":"8 September 2018","review":"The critics may be right that much of the story is unrealistic, and I agree the protagonist never would have survived any part of the trek she's on. But still it is well acted with some enjoyable supportive actors, especially the actor who plays the woman who saves her life and the young man who plays Jamir-who's actually the best thing about the whole film.","user":"AJ_McAninch","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Excellent","rating":9,"date":"5 June 2018","review":"For someone who has lived in the Congo, this story is as real as it gets. Some reviews find certain events unrealistic and far fetched but they have probably never been in a jungle in Africa","user":"al_tejani","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"Savior (or not)","rating":7,"date":"18 October 2018","review":"I read another review, where the reviewer made a good point. It seems like the Western world needs someone the audience can root for. Someone they see and can feel and relate to. That person is our female protagonist in this case. And while that is more than a fair point, try not to let this get your focus of the main issues of the movie.<br><br>Genocide, hunger, murder, rape and a general abuse of power. But this does not give us a look into the higher powers who \"control\" this. We get to the ground, down and dirty and go on the look for our sister. Well the sister of the main actress that is. She was missing and now it seems like there is a glimmer of hope. Hope they can reunite and go back \"home\". But on her way, she finds a new friend. A friend that is troubled, but a friend is useful to her. Someone you should not judge prematurely or even with other moral standards than the ones he has to obey and live by. This may sound weird, but once you've seen it, you'll get it. A really well thought of movie, that takes its time (maybe a bit too long at times), but is really worth your time, if you have the faintest interest in the subject","user":"kosmasp","rank":[3,3]}]
