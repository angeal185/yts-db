[{"title":"One of Murphy's most underrated films","rating":7,"date":"27 May 2002","review":"Sure,Eddie Murphy has gotten credit over the years for being the comic genius that he is,but he does not always get proper credit for his movie work.1999's Life is a good example of Murphy getting overlooked.He does great work here,along with Martin Lawrence(whom I am not a huge fan of, but I must give him due credit here)as two men wrongly sentenced to life imprisonment.This is an excellent story,and casting Murphy and Lawrence in the lead roles is nothing short of a perfect idea.I never would have thought of them as a great team,but I was pleasantly surprised here.A must see for any die hard Eddie Murphy fan.","user":"SmileysWorld","rank":[67,74]},{"title":"One of Eddie Murphy's best films.","rating":22,"date":"22 March 2000","review":"If you're not a fan of Eddie Murphy's humor, then skip this one.<br><br>The movie begins in modern times, 1997, with the main characters' funerals. The movie then flashes back to 1932 to begin telling their story, and continues as they age in prison in Mississippi.<br><br>They were \"petty criminals\" but were sentenced to life in prison for a murder they did not commit.  However, being black in 1930s Mississippi did them no favors.  The story that unfolds is irreverent and funny and has enough twists along the way to keep things very interesting.<br><br>\nI can't understand why the average rating of this movie is below \"6\".  I give it \"8\" of \"10\" for its overall entertainment value, plus a few \"life's little lessons\" thrown in. I think it is one of Eddie Murphy's best movies.","user":"TxMike","rank":[65,73]},{"title":"Finally, an Eddie Murphy worth watching!","rating":10,"date":"12 July 1999","review":"I found this film funny and inventive. Two adjectives that I have not been able to use for an Eddie Murphy film for a long time.<br><br>With a story line as good as this one, it was up to Eddie to see how he could develop it. If this film had a flaw, I think this was it. I believe had Mr Murphy decided to look really deeply into the role of Rayford Gibson, it could have been a possible \"Oscar\" role for him.<br><br>There are no doubts regarding Eddie Murphy's acting ability, yet sometimes I think he sacrifices the script and his role for a cheap laugh when it's not really necessary. It is possible that he is caught up in his own 'identity creation' of \"Eddie Murphy: Comedy first, drama...maybe not!\"<br><br>That said, Eddie Murphy and his worthy partner, Martin Lawrence successfully produce a comedy worth watching. I just hope that Eddie Murphy continues in this same vein. Please no more films like Beverly Hills Flop 3 and Holy Man!<br><br>Finally, a general point, which needs to be addressed, is that it is so strange how comedy films with far more substance, fail to do well financially. Moreover, there are films which fall short in quality, that can generate $100M+ for substandard, regurgitated, \"comedy\". \"Life\" which is struggling to reach the $65M mark falls into the former category. \"Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me\" and \"Big Daddy\" definitely fall in the latter. The mind boggles!<br><br>Anyway, for those who have not seen \"Life\", go and see, you won't regret watching it.","user":"maverick-86","rank":[53,63]}]
