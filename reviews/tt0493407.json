[{"title":"If you watch this you'll know why it sat unreleased since 2007.","rating":1,"date":"20 November 2017","review":"It is honestly one of the worst/boring/1 laugh movie I have ever seen. Trust me when I say I'd rather watch paint dry. You've been warned!! Melissa has about 10 minutes worth of screen time and that's pushing it. Most of the named actors must have been at the end of their careers because if they weren't then this movie surely sank their careers!","user":"skyewasblue","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Watch with an open mind!","rating":8,"date":"19 August 2018","review":"A lot of users haven given this movie a very poor rating, which I think is completely unfair. Credit is not given to the actors for their performances, which are quite outstanding. I am a big Reno 911 fan, and this movie has a very Reno 911 feel to it, which is why I think I am more receptive to the type of humor presented in this movie. There are also very touching moments and when the person who won won, I did tear up. I just suggest to watch with an open mind.","user":"sareed-98538","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Listen....To the commentary with an open mind","rating":7,"date":"19 February 2018","review":"Completely disagree with the dismemberment of this title.....Being watched all so wrong.....The intended projection is perfectly performed. \nLet your allegiance of logic disperse.\nExcellent loved it....Would give it a 7.6 but trolls trash it so a 10 to realize reality and balance the poor ratings.","user":"stangpt-72073","rank":[6,13]}]
