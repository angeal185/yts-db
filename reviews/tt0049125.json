[{"title":"A Great Family Adventure","rating":1,"date":"1 February 2000","review":"\"Davy Crockett And The River Pirates\" was originally produced for television and was broadcast on ABC as two episodes of the \"Disneyland\" series in 1955.<br><br>It is very easy to see why there was a Crockett phenomenon at the time. Fess Parker is perfect as Davy, and his sidekick, Georgie Russel, is played by Buddy Ebson, a few years before \"Beverly Hillbillies\". They play off of each other like a perfectly matched pair of shoes.<br><br>This film is wonderful and makes me wish that Disney had made more of them back in the 1950's. Unfortunately, however, the interest in Crockett was winding down by the time this one played in the theaters, and Disney used Fess Parker in other movies, like \"Old Yeller\" and \"Westward Ho! The Wagons\"<br><br>Still, this is a great film that is a lot of fun. The boats were later taken to Disneyland and utilized as the Mike Fink Keelboats ride.<br><br>-- One sidenote here: the keelboats were removed from Disneyland in 1996 following an accident that dumped a load of passengers into the water! --<br><br>As with most of the old Disney titles, I greatly recommend this film.","user":"GEM-20","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Lots of fun","rating":10,"date":"27 January 1999","review":"This film is a lot of fun.  It originally played on the Disney TV show as a two parter.  Fess Parker plays Davy, and Buddy Ebsen plays George Russell, his friend and traveling partner.  They run afoul of Mike Fink and his crew; Mike is played by the wonderful and boastful Jeff York. George mistakenly bets all their winter's fur inventory that Davy and he can beat Mike to New Orleans.  Mike tries all kinds of devious and underhanded ways to win, but in the end Davy manages to beat him.  Mike is contrite, and he and Davy become friends.  In the second part, Mike and Davy take on the river pirates from the title, who've been posing as hostile indians and killing settlers coming downstream.  Of course, they win.<br><br>Mike's crew is played by veteran Hollywood actors; Kenneth Tobey plays Mike's right hand man, and believe me, if you've seen Ken as the staunch commander in the original \"The Thing\", you won't recognize him in this. He's a natural comedian, and with his expressive face he's a source of constant amazement.<br><br>Don't miss this movie; kids will love it.  It's fast paced, and filled with lots of stunts and explosions.  And Mike Fink's song is catchy and memorable.  In all, a great family film.  I still watch it and love it.","user":"Marta","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"davy crockett takes on Mike fink, then they both go after river pirates.","rating":8,"date":"14 March 2006","review":"This was the second of two Disney Crockett theatrical features, edited from a pair of Disneyland TV episodes during that show's second season. The first three Crockett stories, run during the first season and then later released theatrically as a mini-epic, were all at least in part based on Crockett's life, as the opening image - his journal allowing us to slip inside - makes clear. The follow-ups were based on the famed Almanacks that appeared after Crockett's death in 1836, and so are right filmed in a much broader style, visually suggesting a tall tale rather than a fact based adventure. In the first half, Davy (Fess Parker) and pal Georgie (Buddy Ebsen) engage in a legendary keel boat race with Mike Fink (Jeff York). Lots of good natured action-fun. In the second part, they join forces to eradicate the wicked river pirates who not only prey on innocent passersby but blame their wicked deeds on the innocent Indians. That allows for a highly effective message, much like that in the first film, whereby Crockett becomes a spokesman for Indians' rights. As always in Disney, the entertainment qualities are balanced with an attempt to educate the audience on the greatness of ethnic diversity. Some fifty years after its release, this is still a delight.","user":"dougbrode","rank":[9,10]}]
