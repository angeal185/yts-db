[{"title":"Attack of the Nerds","rating":6,"date":"2 March 2013","review":"I am familiar with Chris Hardwick from watching THE NERDIST on BBC America. Watching his stand-up act in this Comedy Central special, what you see in one is what you get in the other. His concerns are those of the geeky individual who has grown up to discover there are several million others like him and this establishes some sort of coolness in a world run by computers.<br><br>Humor has always been the defense of the weak against the strong and the class clown was beat up slightly less frequently than other smart kids when I was growing up. Hardwick's comedy act is an outgrowth of that phenomenon.<br><br>Hardwick's shticks are not very deep, but they are well written and his energy is very good onstage. If you were the sort of kid whom the bullies made fun of, you should enjoy this.","user":"boblipton","rank":[2,4]}]
