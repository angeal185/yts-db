[{"title":"Where Birds Don't Fly: Potential squandered","rating":3,"date":"4 August 2018","review":"Where Birds Don't Fly has a fantastic opening, beautifully scored and well written. I immediatly thought this ultra low budget crime film would be good based on this, I was sorely mistaken.<br><br>It tells the generic story of the police after a brutal serial killer, sadly it tells a very very boring story.<br><br>Within 10-15 minutes of that fantastic opening sequence it becomes apparent that the film isn't going to retain the same level of quality. Considering it was made for a budget of 5k it looks adequate but the writing doesn't make for very engrossing viewing.<br><br>Bizzarely tame considering the severity of the killers actions and frustratingly boring this is one crime thriller that isn't all that thrilling.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Some good writing<br><br>Well scored<br><br>Fantastic opening scene<br><br>Love the title<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Gets real boring real fast<br><br>Seen it all a thousand times<br><br>Far tamer than it should have been<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>When a person doesn't want to actually make any sort of effort they'll just pray<br><br>The Auschwitz story regarding this birds is fiction","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"These hardened detectives are neither hardened nor detectives","rating":2,"date":"11 April 2018","review":"This movie is brutal. Why don't these guys do some investigative work instead of driving around the city waxing philosophical? Move the plot along, pull the camera back, and maybe find a setting other than the front seat of s car for huge swaths of your movie.","user":"m-s-dwyer","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Pull the trigger and shoot yourself before watching this","rating":2,"date":"18 December 2018","review":"Just horrendous. Horrible. Terrible. Pathetic. They found the killer by riding around in the car and seeing someone buy bleach. OMG.","user":"wamebrpics","rank":[4,5]}]
