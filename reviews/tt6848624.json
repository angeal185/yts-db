[{"title":"Interesting home-made style doc","rating":7,"date":"19 December 2018","review":"Not what I was expecting, but still an interesting, brief look into a year (or 2) of the life of a great artist. I thought the home-video, camcorder effect would be temporary to kind of set up the intimate nature of the film, but, no, that's the whole movie.","user":"paulhenryb","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Great material, not the greatest production.","rating":7,"date":"19 December 2018","review":"If your a fan of Miyazaki, see this movie. If your someone who's going to go into the movie valuing production design, this isn't the movie for you.","user":"grabeeleverett","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"Most intimate and human documentary of Mr. Miyazaki","rating":10,"date":"20 December 2019","review":"Most intimate and human documentary of Mr. Miyazaki so far. Glimpses into his life as a director, a father and above all a human, with deep and conflicted feelings about the value of ones life and work, and of humanity.<br><br>Kaku Arakawa bravely captures the struggling human behind the living legend.","user":"achigi","rank":[0,1]}]
