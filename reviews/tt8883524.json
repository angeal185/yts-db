[{"title":"Stiffler is now Dexter","rating":7,"date":"20 September 2019","review":"I really enjoyed this one. If you like series like Dexter or movies like American psycho, you'll enjoy this one. I discovered Seann on his role in American Pie, so I have watched all his movies. I think he is an underrated actor. He is great here on his role as a killer. I think he is simply amazing. Also, Stiffler's mom here is not funny or attractive.\nNow serious, great step up from Seann and his mum.","user":"dr_bonone","rank":[47,67]},{"title":"A bold and bloody release from Blumhouse","rating":8,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"Bloodline contains some scenes which, even as a hardened horror fan, are somewhat shocking. If you've seen Maniac (2012), then be prepared for another mainstream actor to surprise you with his dark choice of movie.<br><br>Seann William \"Stiffmeister\" Scott plays a cold and brooding father whose recently new born baby, and the reptitive sleepless nights, awakens his need to kill. But how long can his nocturnal activities go un-noticed by his family ... ?<br><br>The movie has strong performances throughout and a twist or two to spice up a simple plot. An exceedingly dry undercurrent of dark humour complements the violent kill sequences, not entirely unlike TV's Dexter, but never interferes with the edgy mood in this slick, dark gem.<br><br>I saw the NC-17 version at FrightFest and have heard that this version is not the one going to be screened in US theatres.","user":"mungflesh","rank":[54,84]},{"title":"Amazing movie!","rating":9,"date":"22 September 2019","review":"I've been waiting over a year to watch this, ever since I read a review about it from a film festival. I was not disappointed. Well worth the wait. Sean William Scott is a really good actor. He deserves to be more famous than he is. He can do so much more than comedy.","user":"brokenmind1986","rank":[32,55]}]
