[{"title":"Terrible.","rating":1,"date":"24 July 2018","review":"Simply put, one of the worst films I have ever seen. Marty's expression does not change regardless of what is going on, hamfisted monologueing backstory during an arguement, terrible 60s quality monster costume, and an awful/abrupt ending. Out of the 10 people in my audience, the entire group said \"thats it?\" when it ended, then waited until after the credits to make sure it wasnt a joke. On top of all that, for an hour and a half runtime it took nearly an hour just to get to anything resembling \"action.\" I cant imagine anyone giving this film good reviews other than the cast.","user":"upland-46517","rank":[31,40]},{"title":"Not the worst movie I've seen, but it's close.","rating":1,"date":"25 July 2018","review":"The story line is disjointed and seems to have minimal relation to the action. Plot was from a bad '50s D movie. Some of the actors sounded like they were reading from the script for the first time. As a scary movie it was mostly boring.","user":"khorton-55407","rank":[30,40]},{"title":"Just plain horrible.","rating":18,"date":"18 August 2018","review":"Worst mistake you can make. Go with another movie!! Horrible music and bad acting.","user":"shantdavoudian","rank":[14,19]}]
