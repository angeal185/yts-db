[{"title":"Unbelievably creepy spook-fest","rating":8,"date":"14 April 2008","review":"I saw this when I was a kid and it scared the bejesus out of me. I saw black hooded figures for months after wards.<br><br>Fast forward some twenty odd years, no matter how hard I try, I still cannot watch this film in the dark.<br><br>Mirrors and glass are used to great effect, the California locations make a decidedly original change from the backwoods of nowhere, as was so popular at the time, but are so brilliantly used (where oh where is that magnificent house?), one particularly brutal killing, sleepwalking and the stunning Lynda Day George.<br><br>This isn't your paint by numbers slasher, which has probably led to its low IMDb rating and you really must watch it alone as the sight of Bill Paxton in his early career may force your viewing companion to make comment about it and lose all perspective, but this vastly underrated little chiller is well worth it.","user":"startide77","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Bill Paxton is HILARIOUS!!!","rating":5,"date":"3 July 1999","review":"Okay so this isn't the greatest film in the world.  It's not even the greatest horror film, but fans of Bill Paxton have got to check out this movie.  Paxton puts his all into making every one of his characters entertaining and this film is no different.  Bill really goes overboard with this character and it's a good thing because otherwise the movie would be pretty boring.  My friends and I had to rewind one scene several times we were laughing so hard at Paxton antics.  The film does contain a fair amount of suspense but it is \"the great\" Bill Paxton that makes the movie worth while.","user":"Zod-2","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Fine 80's slasher about crazed embalmer.","rating":7,"date":"8 January 2008","review":"After her father's mysterious death Christy suffers from sleepwalking and night terrors.Making things worse,no one beliefs her claims of a ghoul faced killer lurking in the shadows.When she learns her mother is in a coven of witches,Christy begins to distrust everyone in her life.It's up to Christy's boyfriend to save her from the hands of crazed embalmer played by Bill Paxton,who looks like black metal musician.Fairly decent slasher flick with several jolts of suspense and gruesome deaths.Not a lot of blood and gore,but plenty of breasts both living and cadaver to enjoy.The ending is kind of quick after all the build up,but it is also pretty surprising.Fans of early 80's slasher flicks should give this one a try.","user":"HumanoidOfFlesh","rank":[7,8]}]
