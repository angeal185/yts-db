[{"title":"The setting of this movie is a mental institution called \"High Hopes\". But don't get yours up.","rating":2,"date":"22 August 2013","review":"Low-budget, claustrophobic (shot indoors and confined spaces), chat-fest about a young woman who gets a cleaning job at a mental institution where she contends with intimidating and creepy staff (one guy, actually), seeing people that aren't there, and \"ward X\" for the criminally insane who talk to her while she's down there cleaning the hallway.<br><br>The premise of this would-be or can't-be horror movie is that the asylum is built on the same spot as the famous Amityville house of the 70's (ergo the title of the movie) and before that, earlier on in the 18th century, where witchcraft practicing native-Americans were murdered by Christians.<br><br>I did not have high hopes (ha, ha) going into this thing, but it struck me in the early go that the acting was actually quite good and the performers serious and convincing. So that kind of hooked me, got my hopes up a bit (ha, ha, again). About mid-way, after seeing a poorly executed mirror scene (a tradition in many horror movies) that was supposed to spook me, my hopes suddenly plummeted. I had found the weakness of this movie: The scenes that were supposed to scare you, horrify you, and gross you out (what little there was) were very amateurish and lame (weak). Reader, you're better off if you grab a chair, go to a window of your house and look out. I assure you that whatever you see will be as interesting as this movie. So why bother? Love, Boloxxxi.","user":"Boloxxxi","rank":[19,25]},{"title":"How not to make a film","rating":3,"date":"28 September 2013","review":"B Movies seem to be making a big come back this year and this one fits right in there with other legends of the genre ticking every box to ensure that it'll mark low and leave you wondering why you bothered. <br><br>Woeful script? Score. Actually the script wasn't so bad although more than a little clich√©d. If only the delivery wasn't so abysmal. Acting? Hackneyed characters with poor back-stories. Brought to \"life\" through the art of people pretending to be someone they're not. Or maybe they were good characters, hackneyed in to existence through bad acting. Scares? You'd think that borrowing the Amityville legend would lend some worthwhile thrills, but you'd be wrong. <br><br>The best thing I can say about this movie is that it was only 86 minutes long. Which was plenty.","user":"Quotius","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"The scariest thing about this is that I attempted to watch it","rating":1,"date":"27 August 2013","review":"As I am currently on a trek trying to find some decent horror/thrillers I have been scouring the web high and low for movies that fit into that genre and after a quick read of the synopsis of this I thought I would give it a try. I actually lasted 47 minutes, after wanting to turn it off after 8 minutes then again at the 14, 23 and 31 minute marks I could not harm my television or my eyes anymore as to be brutally honest this is just plain bad. I have shown a lot of patience in my quest to find some decent horror movies but I could not bring myself to watch anymore as the acting was atrocious although I did learn more about cleaning products than what the actual movie was supposed to be about so I guess that is a plus. So my recommendation?? don't even consider watching this as the 1/10 I gave it is more than I wanted to give it.","user":"damoeel","rank":[11,15]}]
