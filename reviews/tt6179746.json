You should have seen what we had back in the day. This is a very enjoyable film for its production budget. I thought the ending left an opening for a sequel or two, or even a miniseries. Hope they get some budget backing to make it happen.","user":"CarolinaNorth","rank":[33,42]},{"title":"Solid 7, Acting wasn't the greatest but....","rating":7,"date":"16 February 2018","review":"This had a great story and plot line. There is more that could easily be explored with this plot line. As far as low budget Sci-Fi goes, this was one of the better ones. The acting could have been a bit better, but it really wasn't that bad. I have seen much worse from far more movies. Worth the time to watch it.","user":"walleye-42537","rank":[50,70]}]
