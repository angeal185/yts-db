[{"title":"A cult classic prototypical brilliant sci-fi flick","rating":8,"date":"22 April 2017","review":"The Arrival (1996) is a cult classic science fiction about a radio astronomer Zane Zaminsky (Charlie Sheen) who discovers evidence of intelligent alien life and quickly gets thrown into the middle of a conspiracy that turns his life upside down. It was written and directed by David Twohy who also written and directed Riddick trilogy with Vin Diesel (Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick &amp; Riddick) who I wasn't fan off and I never cared about but Pitch Black was an okay film. The Arrival is my favorite David Twohy film and the best of Charlie Sheen movie ever. It come out the same year as Independence Day (1996)and The X-Files Season 3 was completed. <br><br>It is a brilliant science fiction thriller film about a extraterrestrial intelligence and a global conspiracy. The acting in this film from Charlie Sheen and Ron Silver is brilliant I love this movie to death I love it! <br><br>to me this this movie is an easy 8 and it is a prototypical \"good\" science fiction thriller movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original plot no copycat, shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.<br><br>Plot: Radio astronomer Zane Zaminsky (Charlie Sheen) believes he's picked up a cosmic noise that signals extraterrestrial intelligence. But after turning over the tape to his boss Phil Gordian (Ron Silver), Zane's fired, his girlfriend (Teri Polo) get's transferred and his partner is found dead from a supposed suicide. Zane's desperate search for answers leads him to Mexico and a mysterious power plant that is generating more than electricity and is run by people who are not what to appear to be. Arrested for the murder of a scientist (Lindsay Crouse) investigating and impending ecological disaster, Zane's escape custody carrying proof of a world-shattering alien invasion in this intense sci-fi thriller.<br><br>I first saw this movie on a cable when I was in high school. I did not recognize Charlie Sheen with a beard watching this movie it quickly become my favorite Alien film. To me Independence Day, Alien and Aliens alongside The Arrival are my top 4 favorite extraterrestrial intelligence films. The story is solid and acting is solid.<br><br>Also to me this movie is disturbing and terrifying on the end when Zane try to expose Aliens secret with the satellite dish Zane and Char are trapped in that station and first I thought Char betrayed Zane but it turned out it was Kiki (Tony T. Johnson) who betrayed Zane. Charlie Sheen makes such a terrifying face when Char asks him what will they do. The scene was terrifying when Ron Silver was preparing to kill them both so they hit with the van in the station and Zane froze them all.<br><br>The aliens are raising temperatures so that the weathers are hot they are feeding with our energy. I also watched the sequel Arrival II (1998) with Patrick Muldoon in which Zane character is dead in which to me is pretty stupid! I love this movie to death I can't give this movie a 10 it is not a perfect movie the greatest or the best one but it is a good movie my favorite Charlie Sheen movie I got today on Blu-ray and I just finished watching it and i was blown away I love it. 8/10.<br><br>The Arrival is a 1996 science fiction horror film directed by David Twohy and starring Charlie Sheen, and co-starring Lindsay Crouse, Ron Silver, Teri Polo, and Richard Schiff.<br><br>8/10 Grade: B+ Studio: Orion Pictures Starring: Charlie Sheen, Lindsay Crouse, Teri Polo, Ron Silver, Leon Rippy, Richard Schiff Director: David Twohy Producers: Robert W.

He discovers a strange signal from outer space, but is fired when he tries to make it public. Deciding to take matters into his own hands, he stumbles upon the existence of aliens that have already invaded the Earth and are using a sophisticated technological scheme to try and take it over. Brainy thriller abandons guns, explosions, and car chases in favor of actual science and clever plotting. Starts off slow, but only gets more and more interesting as it goes along, with an effectively edgy performance from Sheen that's right on target. ***","user":"Special-K88","rank":[77,89]},{"title":"A smart, well done Alien movie.","rating":29,"date":"29 October 2003","review":"I had the pleasure of watching this film in the theater and to be quite honest that is the way it should be seen.  Its a well done movie about aliens visiting earth, overall the story is nothing original (but it does have more then a few tricks up its sleeve) and is your typical Alien invader movie.<br><br>Watching this on television years later its hard to appreciate just how well this film was shot.  One scene in particular involving a large dish and someone almost falling off the side of it almost caused me to make a mess in my pants when first watching the film on the big screen.<br><br>When I saw it the theater was mostly empty (not good for the movie, but it probably allowed us to enjoy it some more) and it was its first run (did it have a second?).  Its sad the film didn't do as well as it should have, at the time it was the best alien related movie in theaters (I seem to remember independence day being out at the same time).<br><br>My one gripe is a somewhat weak ending (especially considering the strength of the rest of the movie).  Overall it is an entertaining and somewhat thought provoking film that you won't regret watching unless you don't like movies that emphasize suspense instead of action.  And there is a LOT of suspense in this film.  It doesn't skimp on action either but it saves it for the end of the movie where it belongs and makes some sense.<br><br>Some people may not like its message either but I didn't have a problem with it and it certainly didn't get overly preachy.  People voice their opinions on screen just as someone would do in real life, and I don't have a problem with that.  The real focus of the movie is aliens, not the environment. If you fixate on the environmental message in the movie then you probably have some issues or just don't get this type of movie.  Global warming is more of a subplot that leads Mr Sheen in a certain direction and nothing more.<br><br>The special effects are fairly spartan but effective and nicely creepy when they are used.<br><br>Some of the characters are kind of annoying but are necessary, and don't detract from the film overall.<br><br>A worthwhile rental, especially if you have a large TV to watch it on.","user":"R_Ethier","rank":[49,57]}]
