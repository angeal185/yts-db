[{"title":"Feel-good Biopic","rating":8,"date":"27 January 2016","review":"First of all, I have to say that I'm generally not a fan of biopics, they just aren't the type of movie I seek out. I got tickets to the sneak preview and my wife really wanted to go. Anyway, that preamble out of the way, I really did enjoy the movie.<br><br>Eddie the Eagle is a story about an underdog in every sense of the word. One theme that is repeated throughout the movie, is the quote from Pierre de Coubertin (father of the modern Olympics), \"The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part; the important thing in Life is not triumph, but the struggle; the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.\" The story follows Eddie from the time he's a little kid with dreams of going to the Olympics. It follows him through his many assorted set-backs, and all the people around him who saw only failure in his future. It also shows the moments when he got helping hands when he most needed it. This movie is about his struggle.<br><br>The casting in the movie was quite good. I remember Eddie the Eagle from TV when I was young, and Taron Egerton does an excellent job in the role of Eddie. Hugh Jackman puts in a good performance as the coach Bronson Peary, and manages not to overpower Eddie's character. But while Taron Egerton really assumes the part of Eddie, a lot of Hugh Jackman leaks into his role as coach Peary.<br><br>The roles of Eddie's parents are also well played, and the actress playing his mother, Jo Hartley, gives a particularly poignant portrayal. The father, played by Keith Allen (currently uncredited on IMDb) is a bit of a caricature, but well acted. Actually, a lot of the supporting cast of characters are caricatures, especially the other ski-jumpers/coaches and the British Olympians/Olympic Committee. But to an extent that serves to emphasize the struggle for Eddie. Also, for those intent on seeing this film for Christopher Walked, he has a very small role.<br><br>While, I have emphasized the struggle aspect of the story, there is a lot of comedy thrown into the mix as well. The tone is upbeat throughout, even when Eddie has setbacks. While some of the failures are played for laughs (mostly early in the film), it's mostly Eddie's perseverance that makes this film endearing. It also feels like we're laughing with Eddie rather than at him, since it seems Eddie's in on the joke.<br><br>If you're on the fence about seeing this movie, I say give it a shot.","user":"BigGuy","rank":[102,109]},{"title":"Not an Oscar Winner - But a Satisfying Film","rating":8,"date":"27 February 2016","review":"Some films are merely created for entertainment and to tell a story. This is one of those films that you're not going to hear about during award season but it was certainly satisfying and worth the time.<br><br>Egerton was a perfect choice to play Eddie, from his off beat humor to his on spot facial expressions, and Hugh Jackman is a great compliment as the supporting role. Both characters are total opposites, each flawed in their own way, but really mesh together on screen.<br><br>The movie is fun and the story, based on the Eddie the Eagles dream of going to the Olympics, was nicely told with clean comedy paced throughout. <br><br>Not knowing the outcome of the true story, I was on edge rooting for Eddie throughout - just like the crowds in the stands on film. <br><br>Really glad they made this film, it's such a fun story and Eddie The Eagle is so deserving for a film that honors his hard work dedicated to his Olympic dream.<br><br>Have fun with this one!","user":"joshh83-283-171837","rank":[59,64]},{"title":"A Great Movie that left my Wife and I satisfied, inspired and smiling","rating":9,"date":"11 February 2016","review":"A very funny, enjoyable and inspiring movie for the whole family.<br><br>A human interest film that are rare these days with so many movies that rely on bravado and special effects.<br><br>Based on a true story, which proves if you have dreams from a young age that persist you should follow them no matter what the odds are against them and ignore all the doubters that tell you you cannot achieve them.<br><br>The human spirit and believing in one's self are very powerful forces.<br><br>Eddie is a character that you cannot dislike. <br><br>Hugh Jackman's character helps Eddie achieve his dream since Eddie would not be deterred.<br><br>Eddie unknowingly helps Hugh Jackman's character out of his funk and he is re-born again.<br><br>We highly recommend this film.","user":"rbeardslee-97817","rank":[72,82]}]
