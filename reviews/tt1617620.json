[{"title":"Dark, Flawed Jewel","rating":11,"date":"11 September 2011","review":"This film deserves high marks for the all-important mood making. The integration of music and sound, infernal or merely funereal, and sometimes reaching up into the natural (police sirens) makes the presence of evil constantly there even when just driving along an empty road.<br><br>The dementia in this film is not merely the efforts of a single mad man but the hellish world where abductions, torture, rape and murder are accepted. And it does this realistically.<br><br>In this type of film there are always the moments of normalcy contrasted with the evil. But here, the only normalcy is in AA meetings which are themself like the reflective upward facing surface of Hell. This fills the whole film with a feeling of pity and despair.<br><br>But the film has a fatal flaw. The plot is unfollowable. Also, owing to the dark nature of the exposure, it was not always easy to identify characters. This is further exasperated by the awkward use of flash back. So that while I saw the beautiful naked woman dead in the tub--and it was a disturbing image--I could not say whether it was the same woman in later scenes clothed and still alive--or whether it was a serial killing. I certainly had no bearings at all. The film shows promise but results are defective.","user":"Richard_vmt","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"Your Boyfriend's a WHAT?!!","rating":6,"date":"29 August 2012","review":"Well, the title ain't lying. Lots of people die in this movie, either on screen or off, and one person comes very close to dying, and all of the methods used are pretty horrible.<br><br>\"A Horrible Way to Die\" brings an admittedly unique spin to the serial killer movie. It uses mixed up chronology to tell the story of a woman whose boyfriend, a convicted serial killer, escapes from prison and comes back to find her, and the efforts of a new love interest to help her and keep her safe. The wacky order in which the story is told makes it feel richer than it probably is, and there are some major plot twists toward the end (up there with some of the biggest) that are handled less than delicately (you can practically hear the gears grinding at one point as the movie shifts into an entirely new direction). And stylistically it feels like a film made by a film student who's been itching to get his hands on a camera and can't control himself once he has -- the camera is always, I mean ALWAYS, moving, randomly zooming, drifting off to the edges of the frame, going out of focus. It's exceedingly annoying.<br><br>But the film does have a morbidly grim appeal to it. I can't say I necessarily enjoyed watching it, but I can say that it was memorable.<br><br>Grade: B-","user":"evanston_dad","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"A good independent film despite the camera work","rating":16,"date":"16 September 2010","review":"Garrick Turrell (AJ Bowen) is one mean ass mother. As A Horrible Way to  Die opens, we see Garrick opening his truck and pulling out a scared  and bound young girl. He then takes her to the woods and strangles her  to death.  We are reintroduced to Garrick in prison and we learn that he is a  prolific serial killer with a fan base unrivaled in the prison system.  But when Garrick escapes in transport, his murderous trail begins again  and his impulsive homicidal behavior will be the focus of state-wide  searches.  We also meet Sarah (Amy Seimetz). Sarah is a soft spoken and somewhat  timid girl we meet first at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting where she  testifies to being four months sober. Here, she meets Kevin (Joe  Swanberg), another recovering alcoholic that befriends Sarah and the  two are soon dating.  As the film switches between both the past and present, we learn that  Sarah and Garrick used to be a couple. Garrick would consistently leave  the house in the middle of the night for his killing sprees and Sarah's  drinking obstructed her from revealing exactly who Garrick was. That  is, until one night she follows Garrick to a storage garage where his  murderous secret is revealed.  Sarah immediately calls the police so we can assume that now that  Garrick has freed himself from incarceration, revenge for Sarah turning  him in would be first on his mind.  A Horrible Way to Die follows both Sarah's and Garrick's stories both  in the past together and separately as the two begin a path that will  surely have them reunite. Director Adam Wingard (Pop Skull, 2007) uses  a single camera that constantly zooms in and out of focus as his  shooting style to bring their story to the screen. The effect can be at  times brilliant and at other times annoying and headache inducing.  Both stories are equally interesting in their respective paths. Sarah's  budding relationship with Kevin is honest and genuine in its portrayal  thanks largely to the great acting performance by Seimetz. Garrick's  story is more gruesome. He continues to impulsively murder countless  individuals on his search for Sarah with a kitchen and dinner knife  being his weapon of choice.  The wild card in the story is Kevin. We will not reveal any further  details other than the final 20 minutes will have you wondering which  if any of the three major characters will survive.  There are a lot of holes in the film. And Garrick has no serial killer  M.O. He uses knives, strangles, leaves bodies, keeps others n freezersÂ…  Guess that is why the guys from Criminal Minds didn't find him.  But for an independent and low budget film, A Horrible Way to Die is  above average. It was a real and interesting sit through even if the  style can be abusive to watch.","user":"gregsrants","rank":[26,37]}]
