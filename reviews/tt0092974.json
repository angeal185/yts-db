[{"title":"Ernest is my hero","rating":7,"date":"22 May 2002","review":"While many have put down the Ernest series, I have always held a special place in my movie collection for this particular film. Sure, it wasn't an Oscar worthy film and it didn't have much of a script, but it quickly introduced us to an icon which I will consider one of my favorite movie characters of all time. Ernest P. Worrel embodied so many simplicities, yet he was sensible and likable simply because of his down-home nature. Also, this film embodied the old story line of the loser teaching the bully a lesson, which is a story paradigm I have always levitated toward. A good heart warming story that was cool and fun to watch.","user":"Agent10","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"The one that started it all.","rating":7,"date":"7 October 2002","review":"This was the first \"Ernest\" film, and I've been reading a lot of people's comments, how they're bashing this movie, and saying it wasn't good. I disagree. \"Ernest Goes To Camp\" is a great \"Ernest\" film. The plot is very solid, and Jim Varney's first theatrical movie as the dim witted Ernest P. Worrell was a LAUGH RIOT!!!! Varney did a great job in this film, and this was the movie that got me hooked into \"Ernest\" films in the first place.<br><br>Jim Varney Rules (I miss you!!)!","user":"dootuss","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Jim Varney Kicks Ass","rating":10,"date":"28 March 2003","review":"Jim Varney was a good man and his movies are always funny and entertaining. Jim knew what the people wanted and put his soul into his movies. They are emotional, funny, and entertaining all at the same time. Jim was a movie god and his movies deserve nothing less than a 10 rating because they were more than excellent. R.I.P. Jim \"Ernest\" Varney","user":"noahgronniger","rank":[14,16]}]
