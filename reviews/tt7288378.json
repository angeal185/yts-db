[{"title":"Overcoming all odds.","rating":9,"date":"19 March 2020","review":"I really enjoyed watching Lion Killer. I learned alot about the sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Director Derrick Fury did an exceptional job bringing this subject matter to life. All of the lead actors did really well. One couldn't help but pull for the underdog. The music &amp; editing were all on point. A film that demonstrates, with major obstacles in life, that it's truly possible to overcome all odds.","user":"harriscalvin-1","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"A closer look...","rating":9,"date":"13 March 2020","review":"This movie is ultra-relatable. We all have traumas from our past that we are recovering from, that have shaped us. Watching the two leads combat their demons through love reminds us how healing human connection can be, especially for those who tend to retreat into themselves. This was beautifully written and acted. Highly recommend!","user":"alanakmd","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Martial Arts and Inner Journey","rating":9,"date":"4 April 2020","review":"Lion Killer isn't what I expected at all. Much better, actually. Beautifully-filmed, well-acted by a good-looking cast, and with a very interesting story about battling inner demons through martial arts. An adult version of The Karate Kid, one might say, although that doesn't do it justice.","user":"gregwolk","rank":[3,4]}]
