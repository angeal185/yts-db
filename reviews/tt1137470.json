[{"title":"A shot to the head of political insensibility","rating":7,"date":"25 November 2015","review":"Accidental Love - It's not really a \"straight\" comedy, a \"black\" comedy a \"rom-com\", a political satire it's more an \"off kilter\" comedy. A roller skating drive in restaurant waitress in a small Indiana town has the rest of her life planned and laid out for her, mainly due to her parents her policeman boyfriend/fiancé (shortest engagement in history here!) and basically the whole town. It's to be lived in the town of birth with the standard 2.5 children happily married to the hottest guy in town. That is until a wayward carpenter working through service at the \"best restaurant in town\" uses her head as a nail gun target during the longed for engagement dinner. This brings in the surgeons and nurses of the local medical company whom interrupt the \"lifesaving\" surgery when it's revealed that she has no health insurance. The nail to the brain creates all sorts of behavioral changes in the saintly Jessica Biel such as wildly aggressive mood swings, speaking in Portuguese at any time and, random nymphomania (which is the most interesting personality change to the fiancé). After an attempt by her vet qualified Aunt Rita (a smoking, drinking rough edged Kirstie Alley cameo) to remove the nail it's off to Washington to try and change the law so that ALL citizens can benefit from free emergency surgery. Backed up by a duo of an \"unceasing hard onned\" Reverend and his \"anally challenged\" sidekick it's off to the Capitol we go. An inexperienced senator (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the person to make it all happen but his boss seems to think that a \"moon base\" is more important than free surgery for her constituents. A series of mishaps involving (the aforementioned) nymphomania, a nail gun taken into the senator's offices, the \"lesbianisation\" of girl scouts and the non-appearance of Shakira set the wheels in motion for a rom-com/political satirical farce that is as far-fetched as could be but rather pleasing with its almost plausible review of those voted into the power positions and then ignoring those that put them there. Fairly predictable (the goodies win in the end as usual) but branching off into some random paths that are introduced just to take us in an unknown and seemingly unimportant direction it's just a bit o' fun. Humorous but not hilarious. Irreverent but not stupid. Far-fetched but not implausible. Accidental Love is a little movie with a lot of BIG stars in cameo roles. Enjoyable and fun. 7+/10","user":"MooveeVu","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Very funny political satire","rating":8,"date":"2 August 2015","review":"This movie will pass a lot of people by because it requires political awareness and being smart enough to understand the themes behind the simple characters of the movie. I don't often write reviews but I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be an intelligent comedy with a particular focus on the US health care system. There is an array of talented actors on display playing some wacky characters. It's a disappointment to see the review scores so low but unfortunately the mainstream cinema goer and critics would much rather see a new brainless action movie. I've heard the film had some issues getting funded but I'm glad it got released. I highly recommend it - 8/10.","user":"s-hanson","rank":[29,44]},{"title":"Congress Parody","rating":8,"date":"21 April 2016","review":"This movie is between parody and satire. It is showing politicians as shallow turncoats that are after their needs and caprices.<br><br>I guess bunch of people did not like representation of congress in this way but it is almost correct.<br><br>Nice bunch of actors. Jessica Biel beautiful as ever. Kids were great with viral in the movie.<br><br>Movie is better critic on Health care that Michael Moore's \"Sicko\".<br><br>Nice movie for relaxing and fun, even better if you are tired of politicians. This is one great comedy with serious message.<br><br>People will be people.","user":"kizapet","rank":[13,18]}]
