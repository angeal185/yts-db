[{"title":"Sure, it's by the numbers, but, all in all, a great genre movie","rating":7,"date":"1 February 2015","review":"Great movie. Admittedly, I'm a big Jason Statham fan, since he's about the only action star worth watching anymore, but what makes this work is the director doesn't ask too much of him. No big demands on his acting, just let him be himself and show off his martial arts skills -- which, after all, is what we watch him for.<br><br>Statham plays a compulsive gambler who earns his living in Las Vegas by providing his unique services to people who need help. When a prostitute gets beat up by a \"made\" man, he sets out to act as a go-between in order to seek compensation. Complications ensue and he has to fight his way out of trouble.<br><br>You might complain that the action doesn't really rev up until the last thirty minutes or so and the ending is kind of a cop out, but what does it matter? It's great to see Statham doing what he does best. Jason, take some advice: you're not much of an actor. Accept it and stick to scripts like this that recognize your limitations and work around them.","user":"jvache","rank":[47,60]},{"title":"I now know why the movie got a low rating, despite being enjoyable","rating":6,"date":"4 February 2015","review":"When i saw the users review i lost my interest in the movie. But because of the fact that Jason Statham plays in it, i gave the movie a chance.<br><br>In all honesty this movie has no story whatsoever. It's just a multiple occurrences of different things happening, following Jason Statham's character. It's like the writers managed to create the script for this movie in a couple hours. And that's why it got a lower rating...<br><br>The movie is enjoyable because of the fight scenes portrait in it. Jason Statham shows some real lethal skills and that's why i loved the movie.<br><br>Watch this movie without any expectation. But do expect some sick skills from Jason Statham, when fighting.<br><br>It's sad that someone like Jason Statham, so talented accepts roles in movies like this. A star like him should be doing something bigger than this. Even seeing Jason in a movie like The raid, would be better than movies like this (wild card).<br><br>I gave it a 6/10 because i enjoyed it, only because of the fight scenes.","user":"Alan_H4","rank":[82,110]},{"title":"Story 5/10 Fights 11/10","rating":6,"date":"4 March 2015","review":"What works : 1. Jason Statham : Intense Performance 2. Good...no excellent and innovative fights, great action<br><br>What doesn't : 1. Plot - They seem to have lost focus on the plot. Could have been so much better, intense, interesting. 2. Unrealistic - The movement of cash, comes goes comes again and how! You have to watch to and even then you wont believe it. 3. Not enough development/space for any other character. 4. Sophia Vergara had a guest appearance.Barely 5 minutes. Seriously guys! How could you?<br><br>Overall, for Statham fan or action move fans. Decide what you are looking for before you decide to go.","user":"jordansteel","rank":[27,33]}]
