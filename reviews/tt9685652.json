[{"title":"Stage play on film?","rating":1,"date":"2 April 2019","review":"One of the most awkward movies(?) I saw in the last 25 years must be Greyhound Attack.<br><br>This \"movie\" is is actually more a stage play which the director tried to get on film on an absolutely shoestring budget!\nAnd I am not exaggerating: the movie budget must have been absolutely TINY.<br><br>The budget must have been so ridiculously low that they could not even afford any real or convincing actors, props, costumes or anything else a serious movie requires.<br><br>95% of the acting and actions scenes are actually shot against a green screen and are SO obviously fake and off set that it gets totally ridiculous to be honest!<br><br>The actual script and dialogs are also beyond anything I've ever seen or heard before.<br><br>Skip all the problems related to the budget and you end up with an unbelievably bad attempt in every creative, commercial or technical way possible to create a movie or stage play.<br><br>Perhaps somebody else can tell me what this movie actually is: an April' fools joke?","user":"koningszoon","rank":[19,19]},{"title":"Absolutely Horrible","rating":1,"date":"1 April 2019","review":"I was hoping to read a review before I watched Greyhound Attack. No reviews. If I am the first to review, I recommend that you avoid wasting a second of your life watching any part of this movie. It is horrible from every aspect. I cannot believe that 1.5M was spent/wasted.","user":"bobsarsfield","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"Such a shame that '-' stars cannot be given!","rating":1,"date":"3 April 2019","review":"Absolute dross!
