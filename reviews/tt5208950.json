[{"title":"Know What Kind Of Movie You Are Watching","rating":6,"date":"11 January 2019","review":"First off, why in the world do people still think acting and story are relevant in these movies? These kinds of movies aren't released in theaters. They don't have a 100-200 million dollar budget. They simply are made for the fighting and action. Know what kind of movie you are about to watch. If you don't like these kinds of movies, what are you doing? Go watch a lifetime movie if you want story. This movie is like stepping back into the 80s and 90s of action. Mindless fun, and thrilling fight scenes. Those who enjoy these types of movies will have fun.","user":"mbeck-64384","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"This should stop","rating":2,"date":"9 February 2018","review":"I absolutely love JCVD. He's one of my movie heroes and I'll pay to watch anything he's in... But this one is quite bad. Horrible script with even worse dialogues. You can't help but laugh at some parts. Not even JCVD's charisma, and Tyson's guest appearance can make the almost 2 hours of the movie any less painful.<br><br>I watched the first Kickboxer when I was a kid and it was one of my favorite movies, so it is quite sad to see the state the franchise is in nowadays. \nI mean, seriously, the final fight scene?? It is as grotesque as it is unreal haha <br><br>To sum things up:<br><br>---- Spoilers ahead ----<br><br>Kurt is trying to make a name for himself on MMA, gets kidnapped by Plummer's character (horrible acting, by the way), and is forced to fight a Mongkut (\"The Mountain\" from Game of Thrones) after he punches Kurt's wife into a coma with a punch to the stomach (wtf?!?!? hahaha). Like, absolutely no story, no motive, and oh, Mongkut is supposed to revenge Tong Po for also absolutely no reason! No connection to him what-so-ever. And his \"trainer\" is a nerdy \"scientist\" that keeps injecting him with adrenaline shots. Oh lord, what a mess. Please don't waste your time unless you're JCVD huge fan like I am.","user":"edwindare","rank":[21,32]},{"title":"Great Finale","rating":8,"date":"21 May 2018","review":"So I'm sure if you sat through the whole movie you probably won't be as entertained as I was. I fell asleep early in the movie but woke up for one of the best fights I've ever seen in a movie had a rocky feeling to it except the fight was to the death so made it even better so it's at least worth watching the final fight you don't even have to know what is going on or what the movie is about to get entertainment from the final fight, I mean 400 lbs of Muscle.","user":"schizoshua","rank":[9,13]}]
