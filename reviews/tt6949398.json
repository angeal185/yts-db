[{"title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!","rating":1,"date":"22 May 2019","review":"I tried really hard to watch this because I paid $5 to rent it. It was torture for the 1st 10 minutes so I actually fast forwarded it (something I never do) I could only endure 15 more minutes of it! Probably the biggest joke of a movie I've ever seen. So frustrated, don't waste your time or money!!!","user":"frenchvanillagirl","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"unconvincing","rating":3,"date":"14 November 2019","review":"If you're going to do a documentary / reality style type of movie, make sure it's really convincing and your character, in this case, a serial killer, make sure he has personality, the guy who plays the serial killer isn't believable for me, his actions are not genuine in my opinion, and so it's flat.<br><br>I am sorry because I did not even bother to watch the ending, that's how it sucked for me. I agree with the one reviewer who gave it a 1/10.<br><br>I gave it a 3 because the idea is fascinating +2 for that actually","user":"lifelinespublishing","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Overwritten robotic dialogue","rating":5,"date":"16 November 2019","review":"It was at the point where one character responds to another,<br><br>\"Reciprocally allow me to point out that...\"<br><br>People simply don't don't talk this way. The entire film is laden with dialogue like this, it's very distracting.<br><br>Noel, the killer, claims to be a fan of post world war II era movies, so his out of place manner of speaking makes sense, but when every character speaks like this it just comes off as overwritten and as such very unnatural, it totally broke the immersion of the movie for me.","user":"photonman_who_likes_burgers","rank":[2,3]}]
