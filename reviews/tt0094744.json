[{"title":"Painful PeeWee","rating":6,"date":"6 April 2002","review":"I've tried watching this movie three times, and can never get all the way through it.  Big Top Pee Wee is as bad as Pee Wee's Big Adventure was good.  Other than some imaginative effects, Pee Wee looks like he fell out of the sky and landed in this movie.   I think Bill Murray would have been better cast in a movie with this plotline, especially in the scenes where Pee Wee is acting like a dog in heat.  Murray would make a convicing \"hayseed\" and slob on a farm.  Reubens seems to strain in his attempt to make something of the unfunny material he's given...the characters around him are generally unfunny as well.  How anyone came up with this farm, then circus plotline is beyond me.  The film is generally devoid of laughs.   An overall waste of the Pee Wee Herman character and one of the worst \"comedies\" I've ever seen.","user":"wsureck","rank":[17,26]},{"title":"Underrated sequel deserves a second chance from fans","rating":6,"date":"4 October 2002","review":"Sequel falls short largely because of stasis -- even though its's a circus theme, the writers/producers kept ALL the action on Pee Wee's farm, unlike the original which was a road trip film.  Like the original, many bizarre touches are present and Reuben's portrayal is amusing.  Here he's a bit more seedy, including a very funny hair fetish.  The romance is unbelievable, though, because unlike the original, here Pee Wee is coupled with two supermodel class ladies.  Fine direction, decent acting, lots of freaks. Kristofferson is funny as the perpetual man who knows where everybody should go (he plays that one a lot) in this case with a midget wife who's very very small.  Pleasing otherworldly atmosphere enhanced by the circus theme -- if only the producers had sprung for a TRAVELLING circus!  Still, this one didn't deserve the acid reviews and fan neglect it received on initial release, and should be given a fair look by fans of Reubens' neo-vaudeville comedy.","user":"funkyfry","rank":[13,19]},{"title":"Unique and bizarre experience","rating":22,"date":"22 October 2013","review":"This is a very difficult movie to appreciate. Or it may be a very simple movie to appreciate, depending on who you are.<br><br>Have a look at the following movies, and if you see at least 1 that you really like from EACH category, then you'll probably enjoy \"Big Top Pee-Wee\".<br><br>CATEGORY A ----------------------------<br><br>Pee-wee's Big Adventure<br><br>Edward Scissorhands<br><br>The Fall<br><br>Labyrinth<br><br>CATEGORY B ----------------------------<br><br>Free Willy<br><br>E.T.<br><br>Anything by Walt Disney<br><br>The Muppet Movie<br><br>Category A movies are fairy tales for adults. Category B movies are straightforward kid's movies. In order to appreciate \"Big Top Pee-wee\" you have to be ready for either. You have to expect some jokes &amp; gags that only adults will recognize (mildly sexual, cynical or taboo: such as the cranky old lady's hilarious reference to bulimia), but overall the film takes the format of a kid's movie, with lots of cute animals, predictable slapstick and a cheerful approach, right down to the cheezy sing-song finale.<br><br>I think it's the latter--the category B \"kid\" content--that threw off a lot of fans. The original \"Pee-wee\" was an adult film packaged in a kid's presentation. But this is the opposite: a kid's film in adult clothing.<br><br>As such, the gags aren't as subtle &amp; witty as adult comedies usually are. Like a Saturday morning kids show, \"Big Top Pee-wee\" comes on strong with exaggerated and hyper-enthusiastic dialogue, overt sight gags &amp; corny action. This may turn off a lot of adults expecting the more biting, tongue-in-cheek comedy of the original Pee-wee.<br><br>All the same, there are some classic comedic moments that adults &amp; kids alike will enjoy. The whole \"I just wanted a cheese sandwich!\" scene had me rolling. I also liked the 1st picnic with Winnie which could easily have been a deleted scene in the original Pee-wee. The creepy townsfolk in general, contrasted against Pee-wee's oblivious optimism, provided great entertainment. But be forewarned, these acidic gags are sparsely presented. Most of the film is straightforward silliness, suitable for kids &amp; young minds.<br><br>Being a die-hard fan of the original film, and being a fan of adult fairy tales in general, I have a love-hate relationship with this movie and that's why I can't rate it. But I've seen it 4 times if that's any indication of how compelling it is. My gut says I shouldn't recommend it to everyone, but all the same, there will be a few of you out there who will really enjoy this flick. If you're a kid at heart, don't hesitate.","user":"rooprect","rank":[7,9]}]
