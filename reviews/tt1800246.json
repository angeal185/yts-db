[{"title":"Three capable leads competing with a ridiculous script and horrendous plot.","rating":5,"date":"16 February 2016","review":"Zac Efron, Miles Teller, and Michael B. Jordan are very capable actors. They've proved it time and time again, and That Awkward Moment is held afloat because of the chemistry between these three actors. Their bromance is electric. I would watch an Entourage-style show between the three of them and their antics, it's that believable. Unfortunately, the material they have to work with here is artificial and stupid. There are some lines in this movie that no one would ever say. And I know that's usually the case with romantic comedies, but this movie takes it a step further and totally demeans women every chance it gets, and I'm not one to point out misogyny in movies, but it just gets stupid after a while. \"Let's all make a pact to not get into a relationship! Let's keep having sex with random girls and never fall in love! High-five!\" It's such a dumb premise, and it's like the script keeps wanting you to hate these characters until they \"redeem\" themselves by the end but again, it's so artificial that you don't buy a second of it.<br><br>It's certainly watchable due to the three leads, but ultimately you're left wishing the movie was good enough to accommodate for the acting talent. There are a couple chuckle-worthy moments, and some clever banter between the three guys, but most of the comedy falls flat and the romance is absolutely insane from beginning to end. You don't believe these relationships for a second. The dialogue for the most part is asinine. It turns the characters into caricatures at times because of how fake it is. No one in their right mind would say these things, and no woman in their right mind would react positively to these things. It's so forced from beginning to end.<br><br>That Awkward Moment isn't a bad movie. It would've been terrible if they cast average actors, but thankfully the stellar cast keeps the movie watchable and mildly entertaining until the end. As a romcom it's insane, but then again, most of them are so you should know what you're getting into with That Awkward Moment.","user":"lnvicta","rank":[37,47]},{"title":"Personally, I loved it!","rating":10,"date":"23 September 2014","review":"OK, so there were some parts when their morals were completely off but I still loved this movie! I loved that it was a comedy but at the same time it had its completely serious moments. And Zac Efron and Miles Teller shined in this movie. Especially Miles. He rocked in this movie. I love it when Miles does a comedy but has his serious moments like in The Spectacular Now. And Zac Efron. wow, Zac Efron. He really showed you that High School Musical is over. He really stepped up his game in this movie. And Micheal B. Jordan, wow he was awesome. I've never seen him before but I really liked him in this movie. So, if you are looking for a funny, a little heartfelt, sometimes serious movie, this is the one for you. I would watch this movie again.","user":"tiff-fowler","rank":[36,48]},{"title":"Enjoyable","rating":7,"date":"20 July 2014","review":"I was discouraged when I saw the low ratings for this film, but thankfully I had already started watching it. It is definitely not comparable laughter-wise to movies such as This Is The End or 21 &amp; 22 Jump Street, but it is very good. The type of humor may not be for everyone, but I found it to be very relatable. The way the jokes were delivered is how my friends and I joke most often. The actors in it were great and the story moved at a nice pace. Miles Teller was great and I now look forward to his work in the future, Imogen Poots was lovely and Zac Efron was great as always. I don't think Efron gets as much credit as he deserves. It portrays a few different likely dating situations that people could find themselves In these days. I would say it's more for twenty-something's than any other age group. If you are at all curious about this movie I say you should give it a shot!","user":"ck228","rank":[35,48]}]
