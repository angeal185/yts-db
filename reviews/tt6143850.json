[{"title":"Hmmm","rating":5,"date":"23 June 2018","review":"If there is a movie that is not convincing, this is one of them. I am a little surprised at Ricci being in this, and not surprised that Cusack is. What ever happened to Cusack, are these the only parts on offer to him these days? \nThe movie starts off OK, then folds beneath your eyes. In fact, I was laughing from when Cusack entered the scene. I am blaming the director and editing on this. He is just terrible. The scenes with him are trying to empasise intrigue and mystery and ended up a shambles. \nReally, I can't say much more, becasue in reality, the movie dosen't deserve it.\nI'm giving 5 stars for Ricci's sake.","user":"brockleyavenue","rank":[52,61]},{"title":"Completely unwatchable","rating":4,"date":"29 June 2018","review":"Tacky, cheap, complete let down. Badly rendered CGI, horrible sets, the first half an hour is enough to let you know you've picked a dud. How this is above a 5 on imdb is beyond me","user":"iamlegionwermany","rank":[51,61]},{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"13 July 2018","review":"Nothing positive I can say, truly awful. Bad acting, poor plot and I literally didn't care what happened in the end! Don't waste your time","user":"charlottefoy-07578","rank":[40,48]}]
