[{"title":"Maybe it's just me but the little dragon makes this movie","rating":4,"date":"23 July 2019","review":"Maybe it's just me I know it's bad acting in a bad storyline but I found it somewhat entertaining I had nothing else to do in an hour to kill. The little dragon was my favorite.","user":"lostom66","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Boobs, dwarfs, flatulence and dismemberment?","rating":23,"date":"23 July 2019","review":"Purge of Kingdoms like most gag-driven farces, it's a hit or miss affair. If you're amused by jokes involving boobs, dwarfs, flatulence and dismemberment, it should be a big hit. If you're not, and you haven't seen the blockbuster TV series it alludes to \"Game of Thrones\" then by all means miss it.","user":"FilmJunkie1980","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Mad as a bag of snakes!","rating":24,"date":"24 July 2019","review":"Purge of Kingdoms is a very politically incorrect film with a strong anti Trump message. It's funny and isn't meant to be a cleverly written movie. It's just one of those spoof movies not to be taken seriously. If your looking for a critically acclaimed movie go elsewhere as this film is as mad as a bag of snakes. A bottle of tequila may also help. Great fun.","user":"j-11770","rank":[11,12]}]
