[{"title":"\"Take home pay\"","rating":2,"date":"28 October 2019","review":"What the f$#* is this ?!<br><br>These are my notes<br><br>Characters have no development, the whole movie is completely pointless with meaningless cameos and a repetitive objective. And every 5 seconds there are stupid jokes about a person being fat or telling someone to get out of here. This movie is a complete waste of time and talent and I would not recommend it to anybody unless I hate them.","user":"tylerallan-29252","rank":[17,28]},{"title":"Island life","rating":7,"date":"6 November 2019","review":"Awesome, refreshing to see polynesian people and especially samoan actors and actresses doing their thing. My kids when do not speak samoan know the man name Tofiga. They could not stop laughing through the movie. I dont except a lot of people to understand this type of comedy. As David Tua put it O for Owesome lol. Faafetai lava.","user":"davidplevu","rank":[9,17]},{"title":"Takin it Home","rating":10,"date":"29 December 2019","review":"As a Samoan woman who attended the Premiere with my 10 year old - we thoroughly enjoyed the ride through a story that 3 generations can relate to. Humour is cleverley weaved throughout a familiar story of opportunity in NZ for seasonal work with an outcome to support families back home or to move into independence away from the island life.<br><br>Tofiga adds an extra edge through his role as Bob Titilo and in typical 'Tofiga' style - his mastery at making people laugh doesnt dissapoint. Both Alama (Vito) and Popo(Taulafo) provide strong performances with a subtle message through their connection as contrasting brothers and both bring a fresh perspective to the migration story.\nI laughed, I cried, I remembered - the laughter allows you to reflect on nostalgic moments that you will remember as a kid about Samoa, about parents sacrifice and the pros and cons of the land of milk and honey. Malo le taumafai - malo le tauivi. #IFYKYK","user":"mariauluilelata","rank":[3,7]}]
