[{"title":"Is it just me or does this film seem grotesquely overrated?","rating":5,"date":"10 April 2018","review":"Blockers is a film that I personally looking forward to a bunch. The trailers completely sold me on this idea of a hard R, raunchy comedy that was original, heartfelt, and delivered some dang good laughs too!<br><br>Unfortunately, all the stuff you heard that was funny in the trailer is either not funny because you've heard it all before or it's cut out of the movie entirely.<br><br>So don't see Blockers. It's a painfully unfunny crude-fest that delivers crap humor, no emotion, disney-channel acting, and a worthless story. The only good things about it are the three daughters and one of their dates.<br><br>Giving this one a generous C- or on Imdb, a 5/10","user":"jackwarchibald","rank":[158,256]},{"title":"Speechless","rating":1,"date":"8 April 2018","review":"Blockers takes every possible annoying aspect in American comedy and amplify's it to the point of maximum uncomfortably, resulting in an almost 2 hour sluggish, unfunny, disappointing comedy that completely misses it's mark in both humor and heart.","user":"johngifford-01940","rank":[200,342]},{"title":"They would've done better without advertising this","rating":7,"date":"9 April 2018","review":"I'll be honest, I knew about this movie months in advance, and the preview made it look terrible. Then, on top of this, whenever I watched tv, ads for this movie would run during the commercials, and they were insufferable. I thought this movie was going to be absolute garbage(because that's what the previews made it out to be) and was kind of annoyed when my friends picked this of all movies to see.\nThe theatre was almost empty, even though it was only day 2 of it being out. I'm guessing everyone else saw the ads and decided not to see it.<br><br>Anyway, to my utmost surprise, the movie actually turned out to be quite decent. I laughed throughout the movie. And it actually did have somewhat of a plot, and it was original humour, as opposed to the cheap sex and weed jokes that I expected it to be from watching the previews.<br><br>It's a shame. I feel that because they ran so many terrible ads for this movie that a lot of people will never get to experience this movie.","user":"maruugaa","rank":[74,124]}]
