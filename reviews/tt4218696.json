[{"title":"Not bad","rating":6,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"A strange mixture of positive reviews from the critics and low ratings from the audience. It's true that this movie does have its plusses and minuses. It's not an impressive war movie and could have benefited more from a POV perspective. There is some character revelation as it goes on which gradually makes a slow pace movie more palatable. I had to take lots of little breaks to get through it myself but I feel the twist ending makes it worthwhile.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[39,42]},{"title":"The Perfect One-Man movie .. One of the Best Thriller movies before being A War Movie of the year by far","rating":9,"date":"24 August 2017","review":"This is what you can call The One-Man Movie , Way way underrated movie .. Aaron Taylor-Johnson ( Isaac ) makes a tremendous effort in this movie , Perfect performance and I really give him most of the credit .. Laith Nakli ( The Sniper ) also does a great job in performing the mysterious man of the show even by only his voice !<br><br>The movie itself is intelligent thriller till the last moment of it . I liked the dialogues , the convincing acting , the way Isac's thinking was portrayed and his insiders were shown . I mean , I really could feel him and found myself in his position<br><br>The Location , The Shots , The Directing and The General Atmosphere were all perfectly carried out <br><br>The Absence of music nearly the whole movie gets you living it in a more focused way<br><br>Important point to consider is that this isn't mainly a war movie , It's a thriller one .. So Don't expect finding battles , fights , tanks and helicopters and so on<br><br>Such a low budget film , few cast and under 90 minutes is considered in my opinion as a very pleasant experience which I heavily recommend for any fan of thriller genre movies .. Just keep it running till the end , You won't regret it","user":"Abdo0079","rank":[54,88]},{"title":"Dumb and Dumber: in the desert","rating":1,"date":"3 November 2017","review":"So, it's about two brainless snipers. Except from being poorly equipped they also make bad choices. When one of them gets shot the other guy runs after him like a blind hen and - surprise - get's shot too. Theses two guys are supposed to be elites, but still a minimal amount of action makes them both totally lose it.<br><br>To seem extra macho every sentence consists of at least 5x\"fuck\". Too bad watching them acting like 50's housewives hosting a dinner party kind of ruins the alpha image.<br><br>Yeah... and then it just gets really boring.<br><br>It's so dumb and unrealistic I can't imagine anyone with ANY experience with the military was involved during the making of this film. If you're a fan of war movies like me, this isn't worse your time.","user":"alexac-07156","rank":[34,56]}]
