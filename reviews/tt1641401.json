[{"title":"A Story of Family Love","rating":10,"date":"3 July 2014","review":"Wow. I am certain the two people who submitted reviews did not even watch the film. If you did in fact watch the film, I cannot for the life of me fathom what prompted your reviews. The story is about love. It is about a family. It is about the untimely, devastating loss of a precious child and beloved sister. A beautiful, intelligent, spirited little girl who was loved by so many. It is the story of healing. It is the parents' compelling desire to fulfill the wish of their daughter \"to help all children\" by building a world-class children's hospital. The Maria Fareri Children's Hospital. The memory of Maria is kept in a special place, just for her, in my heart.","user":"susan1245","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"anti-vaccine review","rating":8,"date":"1 July 2014","review":"the movie was good. however, that is not why I am writing. apparently, jenny McCarthy has been writing reviews for this movie. please, there is no connection with vaccines and autism. this is dangerous and puts children's lives at risk.<br><br>there is a link between pesticides and autism but not with vaccines. Please disregard the review from Rene. it appears to be little more than anti-science, anti-vaccine propaganda.<br><br>the movie itself is a tender tribute to a family who helped shape the way children's hospitals are created. the child and the family should be the focus of this review. not the rantings of some mad women who would have people not have their children immunized against diseases that can cripple or kill.","user":"thorwilliams1","rank":[28,41]},{"title":"beware of internet reviewers","rating":6,"date":"11 August 2014","review":"This is mostly to set the record straight about this film. Jenny McCarthy wrote a book with the same title as this film. The book and the film have nothing to do with each other. Jenny McCarthy is someone who unfortunately has the power to promote her own ridiculous beliefs, which have ultimately caused a great deal of harm to children. This movie is about a family that did something that has helped thousands of children. Rene Ruiz either did not see the film, or is so delusional to think the movie was based on the book, and was disappointed there wasn't more about autism (there is nothing remotely related to autism in the film). The film is not the best made one in many respects, but it will trigger a strong emotional response as the dream becomes a reality. Most of the film is devoted to the events leading up to the idea to build a hospital and only the last third to the project itself. While in reality it took about 10 years from when Maria died until the hospital opened, the film makes it seems like no time at all. The persistence and I'm sure many problems that must have been encountered are not really captured by the film, which probably would have been much better focused on what it took to get it done. One final irony reflecting to the ignorant autism vaccine comments, if Maria in real life had been given a rabies vaccine, though there was really no reason she should have been, she would likely be alive today.","user":"folkie46","rank":[13,23]}]
