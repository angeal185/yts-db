[{"title":"Terrible Mockbuster","rating":1,"date":"21 September 2018","review":"This isn't a movie, it's just an hour of stolen CGI assets jiggling around the screen in the same animation loops as repetitive music plays. It looks like a rushed rehashing of it's \"prequel,\" which only came out two years before it and has the exact same format, premise, and even segments.","user":"cascadiarch","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Just... NO!","rating":1,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"Just watched the trailer, even the full (awful!) movie can be seen on YouTube (oh please, remove that movie please!)<br><br>Bad lipsync, bad animation, bad EVERYTHING!<br><br>Steer clear of this.... this... THING...","user":"debruin1975","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"over expected","rating":1,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"Just playing music, with ridiculous dancing. The dance is not match with the music, just loop and looping scene. \nAlso, the animation is very poor. I will give 0 star if I can.","user":"ariyanto-18808","rank":[5,6]}]
