[{"title":"Great build up, to nothing.","rating":5,"date":"20 April 2018","review":"The movie kept me in constant questioning about who the killer was. However, the end left me confused and felt rushed and blended in a way that couldn't be followed. It was an interesting concept, poorly executed. There were too many flashbacks and too much future and present footage that was blended in a way that was hard to be followed. There was a lot of questions unanswered. <br><br>This film isn't amazing, but it isn't terrible. It's just an average movie.","user":"hallbanks","rank":[87,99]},{"title":"Great acting, slow burner...","rating":6,"date":"7 April 2018","review":"I enjoyed the movie. In my opinion the writing was really good, and they tried to make it suspenseful but it wasn't very, in my opinion. <br><br>Guy Pearce plays a college Philosophy professor who just so happens to own the same looking car as the last person seen before a young woman went missing. Or was it him? Pierce Brosnan is going to figure it out, as he's playing the homicide detective. Along the way, Guy's wife is trying to figure out if her husband could have really had anything to do with this.<br><br>I don't have really anything bad to say about it, but it wasn't the best movie that Pearce or Pierce have ever been in, though they do act well together. I'd love to see them do another film together.<br><br>This movie is a slow burner, it REALLY gave me sort of a \"Memento\" vibe while watching it. They probably could have made it better though, there was plenty of room for improvement. But like I said, I enjoyed it. Decent flick to pass a couple hours.","user":"gamertaboo","rank":[44,52]},{"title":"Unfairly reviewed","rating":7,"date":"15 April 2018","review":"I will keep my summation brief as you will have either seen it already or read the synopsis. \nWhat lies beneath this entire film, is the question of memory. How accurate is it? How reliable is any single person's account, of anything! What is truth? It's reflected in the philosophical teachings and comes into play within the context of a mystery thriller. In addition, what is guilt really? If a large number of people say something is so, does that make it real? Does having a personal philosophy have to match up with one's own actions?<br><br>The film raises these and other fascinating questions. I would hope that one would walk away wanting to explore philosophy in more depth. However, for the average popcorn going movie goer wanting their 'thriller' spoon fed to them, they will of course be disappointed. <br><br>Those seeking a little more substance will find this satisfying, playing out, exactly as it should.","user":"anthonyjlangford","rank":[58,71]}]
