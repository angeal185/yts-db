[{"title":"The Truth always comes out!","rating":20,"date":"20 November 2012","review":"I consider myself a freelance historian in the WW2 discipline, and I had no idea the WERETH 11 existed. History looks back at the men of MALMEDY as the wrongfully executed soldiers of the Battle of the Bulge. However, there were several more accounts just like MALMEDY and this documentary brings one these travesties to life! <br><br>From a detailed background and explanation of what the Nazi's called THE ARDENNES OFFENSIVE, to a detailed analysis of the American Front lines. You as a viewer are easily brought back to December of 1944.<br><br>The film was very detailed by interviewing eye witnesses, veterans, and descendants of the fallen. Overall it is a very touching story that explains good will always prevail over evil. If you're a history lover, especially the WW2/Battle of the Bulge genre, this film is for you.","user":"markdel316","rank":[20,24]},{"title":"Sensationalistic Director wants to play soldier!","rating":5,"date":"4 August 2015","review":"This is an odd film. Actually, it's not even a film, it's a dramatic retelling of a tragic story that then becomes a documentary of a tragic story. More so the motivations of this film are quite suspicious. First off, let me say that I honor and respect all Americans who defend our great country  regardless of race or creed or color. This respect is what lead me to watch Wereth Eleven  but then as I watched I could not help but think \"is that all this is about?\"<br><br>Let's be honest, the film is about 11 African American soldiers who were executed by a Nazis Commander during the Battle of the Bulge. Meanwhile in the Malmedy Massacre (just up the road) there were 88 lives lost  and they never got a film (they did a nod Saints &amp; Soldiers). I mean 500,000 Americans died in WW2  and there were hundreds of instances where many more than 11 where massacred  so why make a movie about this one? Sensationalism. <br><br>Furthermore, as the film shifted over to documentary mode  suddenly we see the film's Director become one of its subjects (an interviewer)  dressed up in military garb! <br><br>Are you kidding! This guy is supposedly commemorating the lives of 11 fallen American soldiers and he thinks it is also a good time to dress up and play army ... and be the star of his very own movie? So ya I am suspicious of the Director. To me he appears to be opportunistic and unserious.<br><br>On a side note  it was great to learn that the locals had pooled their money and built a proper memorial to these eleven Americans. They are good folk!","user":"chrissso","rank":[13,20]},{"title":"Wereth Eleven Remembered","rating":10,"date":"19 September 2012","review":"I first came across a mention of The Wereth Eleven while seeking for further examples of films featuring actor Ken Arnold who had impressed me with his performance in 'The Haunting of Pearson Place'. In 'The Wereth Eleven', Ken convincingly plays the role of a SS Officer and demonstrates his versatility as an actor.<br><br>I was rather surprised that I had not previously read or viewed anything which related to an incident at Wereth during World War II which forms the basis for this film. I have been a keen reader of World War II material for many years especially that which relates to the period stretching from the Normandy landings to the end of the War. I immediately delved into my extensive reading and DVD libraries but could not find no mention of the Wereth incident. The impression that I got was that the pages of documentation relating to the Wereth events had been torn out of the history books etc. I even obtained a copy of a US Senate Report dated 1949 into the Malmedy Massacre which contained listings of massacres of prisoners and civilians in the area but there was no mention of what happened at Wereth. The question raised in my mind was a constant 'Why?' It was as if someone was saying Wereth or the men who died there must not be mentioned. Apparently, the people responsible for making this film experienced a similar degree of curiosity which prompted them to investigate the story of the eleven African-American soldiers who were brutally massacred by Nazi SS at a village called Wereth during the Battle of the Bulge. After an internet search for information had drawn a blank, I ordered a copy of the DVD in a quest for enlightenment. The effort was certainly justified after viewing this admirable, well made docu-drama which I would recommend as essential viewing for anyone interested in this period of history.<br><br>Full marks must be awarded to the experienced production team for the way in which they have seamlessly dovetailed archive footage with filmed reconstruction and relevant interviews. The film opens with an insightful, well researched background to the regiment and men involved in the incident at Wereth. The subsequent action sequences were particularly impressive and consequently the viewer could not fail to appreciate the fearsome, hostile environment experienced by men under heavy sustained fire and cold climatic conditions. The concluding scenes relating to the actual atrocities could have easily have generated into an outpouring of anger but the producers must be commended on the intelligent way in which they carried out this section with dignity and restraint concentrating on facts which proved to be a very effective method of presenting the case for recognition of the Wereth Eleven and condemnation of the persons responsible for the atrocities.<br><br>The overall impression created especially after viewing the additional material presented on the DVD edition that I viewed is that the film-makers were dedicated and devoted to the task of making people aware of the incident at Wereth and the eleven men who seemed to have been forgotten. The docu-drama together with the additional material provide a very informative package. Thanks to the team involved, the families of the men and the villagers of Wereth they will be remembered.","user":"regdyer-752-589598","rank":[10,15]}]
