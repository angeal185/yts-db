[{"title":"Not Bad","rating":26,"date":"26 March 2005","review":"I remember catching this film on UPN back in 2001, and it was surprisingly more scary than the original. Don't get me wrong, the original wasn't as scary or as a nightmare as this one; this time as the trailers said, \"He's Back!\" This time Leprechaun (Warwick Davis) is on the search for his bride after his latest 1000 birthday and wants to breed more leprechauns. Like the first movie, he wants his gold after it has been stolen or has been retrieved by the main hero of the film. Most of the death scenes are more violent than the last film, but than, again, its just a movie. On a lighter note, you get to see Clint Howard as a tourist; Sandy Baron (Seinfeld) as the hero's partner; and Michael McDonald (MadTV) as one of the Leprechaun's victims.","user":"departed07","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"So leprechauns can fall in love. Aww!","rating":8,"date":"24 November 2003","review":"Leprechaun 2, aka 4 funerals and a wedding, the leprechaun is back and he wants his bride for his 2000th birthday! I know it's silly, but I love the Leprechaun series so much, it's just so enjoyable and fun to watch. Especially if you love horror films as much as I do. Warwick Davis also reprises his famous role as the leprechaun, which is a major plus, since he's really the only one who can do it. You also notice some other \"little\" stars in the bar sequence that Warwick has made famous throughout the years. Yeah, the story is a little gross, but I think that's why I loved it.<br><br>Leprechaun is back to reclaim his bride, she sneezes once, she sneezes twice, she'll be his bride when she sneezes thrice! And he's gonna love her... to death! In today's world, her name is Bridget and she has a relationship with a cute young orphan, Cody, he is taken care of by his alcoholic con artist uncle. When Cody and Bridget get into a fight, Cody comes back to Bridget's house to apologize, little do they know that a friend of their's has just been splattered by a lawn mower, thanks to our friend, the leprechaun! He also makes Bridget sneeze three times and takes her to his haunting layer, but Cody has a piece of his gold! The leprechaun must have it back! <br><br>Leprechaun 2 has much more great humor, like the scene where he and Cody's uncle are drinking, and it was just so hilarious to see a leprechaun drunk. \"Drink all you want... drink all you can... you can't beat me... 'cause I'm a lepre-can! Mmmph! Chaun!\" LOL! I loved that line, please, watch this movie if you are in the correct mood or enjoy the series. Don't take it so seriously, otherwise, you're looking for the wrong kind of movie.<br><br>8/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[20,28]},{"title":"\"Kiss me, I'm Irish!\"","rating":5,"date":"17 March 2014","review":"It's truly amazing how much life that this \"Leprechaun\" series has had. It's endured for over 20 years; there's even a remake in the works. Then again, I suppose there's something to be said for this kind of dumb fun. And make no mistake, it *is* dumb. But it's also genuinely funny at times, and is not without a clever moment or two. The makers of these movies know that they're not making Shakespeare, and create agreeable horror comedies that may have some viewers groaning, shaking their heads, and struggling to get through them, and others having a fine old time. Making a difference is star Warwick Davis (it is nice to have seen him so gainfully employed), whose enthusiasm is hard to resist. He's obviously enjoying himself.<br><br>In his second performance as the gleefully sadistic Leprechaun, he attempts to snag himself a hot young wife. But his slave interferes (the girl that the Leprechaun selects is his daughter), and 1,000 years later the Leprechaun resurfaces to amorously pursue his slaves' descendant, a girl named Bridget (sexy blonde Shevonne Durkin). Naturally, Bridgets' boyfriend Cody (Charlie Heath) isn't going to sit idly by and watch a demented fairy take his lady away. So Cody teams up with his irrepressible drunken uncle Morty (veteran comedian Sandy Baron) to do battle.<br><br>Baron is a real scene stealer, and in addition to the attractiveness of co-star Durkin and the performance of Davis, does provide some justification for sitting down to watch this. The movie does get tiresome at times - and, for something running just under 85 minutes, it does drag a little - but it's amusing often enough to make for decent entertainment. At the very least, it does find the time to feature cameo appearances by the legendary Clint Howard and Kimmy Robertson of \"The Last American Virgin\" and 'Twin Peaks' as a pair of tourists. Also showing up are Al White (one of the jive talking dudes from \"Airplane!\"), Tony Cox (\"Bad Santa\"), and Billy Beck (\"The Blob\" '88). Production design, lighting, and visual effects are good, but there won't be enough gore for some tastes, especially considering the fate of one character. The music by Jonathan Elias is actually damn good.<br><br>This is about as enjoyable as any movie titled \"Leprechaun 2\" could be.<br><br>Five out of 10.","user":"Hey_Sweden","rank":[8,10]}]
