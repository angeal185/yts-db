[{"title":"Pretty great","rating":9,"date":"24 August 2018","review":"I'm taking into consideration that it's a lower budget and smaller production dance movie compared to step up etc, so it's pretty good. Also loved seeing Heather Morris dance again and playing such a different role compared to what she's mostly known for and being a mom suits her.","user":"disme-56368","rank":[1,1]}]
