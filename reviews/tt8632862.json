[{"title":"Astounding achievement","rating":10,"date":"20 May 2019","review":"Once again Mr. Moore bravely brings to light how the rot and slime of the politically ambitious rise to the top with the help of myopic corporations and organizations. Bravo to Mr. Moore!<br><br>There are no lies within this documentary.<br><br>And the events that took place in Flint Michigan should unhinge the very soul of every citizen of this nation. And just maybe the efforts of the West Virginia teachers can offer a glimmer of hope in the darkness and blight that currently shrouds this nation.<br><br>The denigrating reviews here on IMDB are the lies.","user":"cekadah","rank":[31,36]},{"title":"Don't Listen to Bad Reviews - They Haven't Even Seen It","rating":10,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"You may love or hate Michael Moore's politics, but one thing is clear and that is that he makes good, entertaining documentaries. I guarantee that the vast majority of one star reviewers have not seen this movie. If you are firmly in Trumps party and think he's doing a \"wonderful\" job, yeah you probably won't like it. If you're anyone else definitely check it out. <br><br>The beginning is a little painful reliving election night. From there the film disperses into all kinds of political events, all illustrating that it is up to the people to take control back. This movie is not at all focused on Trump though he does take him on. There is a particularly cringe inducing part where he focuses on his bizarre relationship with his daughter. Moore also disses the DNC and even Obama (who seems to have really deserved it in this case). This isn't really a spoiler..just putting it out there so you know that Moore is no Democratic stooge. He's for the people and I always find it amazing that there are tons of working class Republicans who HATE him and yet would benefit greatly if his ideas were implemented. <br><br>To sum up, the movie is entertaining, very informative and above all very motivating! Loved it.","user":"shiva777-9-153849","rank":[332,451]},{"title":"So many reviewers have obviously not seen the film and just came here to bash Michael Moore.","rating":8,"date":"21 September 2018","review":"First off, its so obvious that many of the reviewers haven't even seen the film. One called it liberal propaganda. The movie spends just as much time attacking democrats - including Barack Obama, as it does Donald Trump and the Republican party. The reviewer that said it was \"DNC Studios Biasedly Presents...\" Again, couldn't have possibly seen it. 11/6 or 11/9. To that reviewer, the date is not in reference to upcoming elections, or even the election date of 2016. Its a reference to the date they called the election in favor of Trump (because it was like 2:30am when the election was called in his favor, the date was 11/9) And he is comparing Trump being elected as being an event as devastating for this country as the attack on 9/11 for those who did not get the title, hope that helps. Now for the actual film. This film does start off being about the 2016 election and quickly shifts focus to the Water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the school shooting in Parkland, FL, The West Virginia Teachers strike and several other recent events that are relevant and responsible for the state this country is in. Its not all about Trump, Michael Moore knew better than to do that. This film is important, urgent and needs to be viewed by every American citizen, but since so many have already drank the Kool-Aid it would probably have no affect on them. But anyone with a brain it could spark some serious, important discussions that we need to be having.","user":"michaelscoughlin","rank":[550,858]}]
