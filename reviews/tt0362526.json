[{"title":"Con men","rating":8,"date":"18 September 2004","review":"One question that always pop in my mind whenever Hollywood tries to remake a foreign film that was successful is: Why? In most cases, the end result is disastrous; it never compares with the original movie and why spend money in something that has already been done, better.<br><br>The movie in question here is the Argentine surprise film of last year, \"9 Queens\". In it, Fabian Belinsky, its director, was able to give us an original story, a caper, that was well executed and brilliantly acted; it was a pleasure to watch.<br><br>Not to put this movie down, but it suffers in comparison. Gregory Jacobs, the director, has adapted the story to present day Los Angeles and the story hasn't changed at all. The memory of the other movie was still vivid in our minds, so there was no surprise with this one.<br><br>The acting is good in general. John C. Reilly makes the con man Richard Gaddis perfectly slimy. Diego Luna brings a nice balance to his role, and Maggie Gillenhaal is excellent as the long suffering sister.<br><br>If you haven't seen the original, this version works fine.","user":"jotix100","rank":[67,83]},{"title":"An OK Americanization Into a Contemporary \"The Sting\"","rating":21,"date":"21 September 2004","review":"\"Criminal\" is an adequate Americanization of one of my favorite films of 2002, the delightfully twisty \"Nine Queens (Nueve Reinas).\" <br><br>Adapter/debut director Gregory Jacobs doesn't quite make up for the extra tension that Argentina's financial chaos added as an urgent back drop. <br><br>Some of the twists are too smoothly straightened out by focusing more on the older con man, here played by John C. Reilly, and his sister, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal without the original's sensuality, despite her low cut blouse. <br><br>Diego Luna is a mite young, but he's cast to turn Reilly's character into more of a manipulative mentor and less an apparent partner.<br><br>On its own, without comparison to the original, it's an amusing and workmanlike update of \"The Sting\" crossed with \"The Grifters.\"","user":"noralee","rank":[43,56]},{"title":"A Gem: John C. Reilly, Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal were never better together.","rating":18,"date":"18 September 2004","review":"Lovers of the grifter genre - you will love this one most of all. It earns a 9 out of 10 from yours truly. Sincerely. Sure, I'm biased for the genre.<br><br>But this one has the style of a low budget 'Sting' with a story line on par with Steve Martin's 'The Spanish Prisoner'. <br><br>Grifter movies rely on competent, likable con men and women, gullible marks and a logical plot. The audience can be(come) the mark, as can the cons themselves. That's why this genre yanks me in Â… and why it entertains so well. I am (you are) the detective. Figure out what's going on before they tell you: That's the ame. I'm a cynic by nature and I'm always equal to the task.<br><br>Now this one - I couldn't figure it all out before they revealed it. What they reveal is worth the wait and meandering through the story. I doubt you'll piece it all together either. Therein lies how it earned its 9.<br><br>The plot works. Oh . . . and \"Cut to the chase' will never be the same after you see how \"Criminal\" cuts to it. It's brilliant and timed with perfection. It's something you'd expect from the likes of Spike Lee.<br><br>Sorry to be oblique here; but if I tell you any more, the ending would be exposed. The last two minutes tell all - and the first 85 are every bit as entertaining and important. John C. Reilly, Diego Luna and Maggie Gyllenhaal are worth the admission price. Superb, all! See it. Tonight!","user":"WCS02","rank":[49,72]}]
