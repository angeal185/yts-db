[{"title":"Hidden Gem of a Movie \"Regression\" Ethan Hawke","rating":8,"date":"11 April 2016","review":"I would have never watched this movie if I had seen the low ratings \"stars\" this movie received. I am glad that I saw it first. This movie may appeal more to people who grew up in the 1970's and 80's. In that time frame there was a underlying paranoia about satanism helped along by our Mothers and Media.We were told that there were hidden satanic messages in music and other forms of entertainment. There were many movies about satanic worshipers,Cults,anti-Christ and Demons.This movie does a good job of encapsulating that paranoia. I have to say the acting is good and the cinematography is really good. If you like mystery/Thriller movies and lived through the 70's and 80's I think you will like this Movie.The younger generation should also give it a try, you might enjoy it. I Give it 8 at 10 stars.","user":"cacjade","rank":[102,123]},{"title":"Well Acted with an Important message","rating":9,"date":"20 March 2017","review":"I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was very well acted and would commend in particular the actress who portrayed the grandmother. Both Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson gave strong performances, also. As a criminal defense lawyer, I was happy to see the credibility of psycho-therapy examined; very refreshing. I think the movie calls into question much more than Satanic Ritual Abuse and would hope viewers could make the connection with many other aspects of life. Would highly recommend despite some downright gory and scary scenes.","user":"trfromhawaii","rank":[28,35]},{"title":"Some flaws but an engaging film","rating":7,"date":"10 October 2015","review":"This film is not a conventional 7 - a score I would tend to give to a decent but not outstanding film. Regression was in some ways an 8, or dare I say it 9, but some of its flaws are just too bad g to ignore. <br><br>I will start by talking about its strong points. The story line and script were engaging, unpredictable and fresh. There were enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing, and without too much in fact happening, the film is disturbing and uncomfortable to watch. The twists as the film goes on are not outlandish - a careful viewer will be able to pick up on a number of subtle clues. The acting is good and the characters succeed of convincing us of their roles - mostly. <br><br>What then is wrong? First and foremost - whilst the female lead is a good actress, her American accent just isn't convincing enough for us to forget about Hermione. Secondly, whilst I am no expert of the American justice system, some of the practises and actions taken by the police seem questionable and unrealistic. The psychologist is clich√© and annoying - going round insulting strangers for having religious beliefs. The ending is an anti climax once the big revelation has occurred, and it seems like the writers tried to re kindle the atmosphere, which doesn't happen. The ending is also a bit hard to square in your mind logically. <br><br>Therefore, whilst this film is a very enjoyable watch, its flaws deprive it of the 8+ score in my eyes.","user":"james-xd","rank":[118,169]}]
