[{"title":"One of the worst films I've seen.","rating":1,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"First of all, the production of the film is very, very poor. Looks like a bad school project. The plot is unsubstantial and unjustified, the acting is lousy. Special effects makeup is unbelievable. Not only a terrible horror film, but one of the worst movies I have ever seen.","user":"okuri97","rank":[93,102]},{"title":"I have no words","rating":1,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. How on earth did this make its way into Netflix? It was probably some film-student project... Nope, not even going to try and justify it. Don't watch it. Just don't.","user":"dnljordaan","rank":[57,62]},{"title":"Not good enough","rating":1,"date":"20 July 2018","review":"There is absolutely no doubt that this film took inspiration from classic genre/horros films like Meir Zarchi's I Spit On Your Grave. Say what you will about those movies but they were pioneers of a genre that made us feel the real terror of the evils of humanity. This movie? Not so much.<br><br>The movie takes place on Crystal Lake, tho it is never explained if we are talking about THE Crystal Lake where Jason Voorhees call home. But it has a basic plot of a group of very annoying young adults going for a weekend getaway that would have gone smoothly until some of them decided to take advantage of a shy girl and stupidly think they would suffer no consequences.<br><br>The acting is bad, the movie is predictable, it re-hashes a genre that has been forgotten and instead of bringing it back it actually helps bury it a little more.<br><br>The direction is all over the place, and even some supposed surprises are moot at the end because the inept director fails to make us care about the characters.<br><br>This has to be one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen in my entire life.","user":"GomezAddams666","rank":[35,37]}]
