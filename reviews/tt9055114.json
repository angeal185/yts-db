[{"title":"Disappointed","rating":4,"date":"26 December 2018","review":"Seen all of the series and they haven't improved. Animation quality of central characters is like watching plastic dolls walk like robots i.e. not natural in any aspect. Background animation, always a sign of quality, is flat 2-D painted stillness. Storyline either through poor editing or just poor storytelling was an emotionless jumble, and stereotypically generic.","user":"westsideschl","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Great Idea Poorly Executed","rating":5,"date":"27 February 2020","review":"There's so much potential for the root concept here. The end result unfortunately is poorly rendered computer animation (think Pixar pre-95) and a lack of character","user":"hortha71","rank":[1,1]}]
