[{"title":"A complete waste of time","rating":1,"date":"12 March 2018","review":"Some teenagers play ouija and bring the spirit of Jonah back to life to take his revenge on his wife who poisoned him for money. A very boring story, nothing new to add to the ouija story only that if you play in 2 it's harmless and in 5 is dangerous...wow. Very bad lines, bad acting, bad script, annoying music, a very unscary villain with no reason to kill the kids that summoned him, not scary at all and just plain boring.","user":"claudiamelania","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"You're Moving it.","rating":4,"date":"19 August 2017","review":"\"The Ouija Possession\" and \"Jonah Lives\" are the same film. A group of bored kids playing games in the basement while adults are upstairs having a wild party. They end up raising Jonah from the dead, who was killed by his wife who was apparently Brinke Stevens the lone bright spot of the film and someone with a great agent. Now rather than avenge his death, he decides he must kill all the kids, and none too soon. Unfortunately it dragged out. The kids couldn't act. They had lousy lines. Jonah had irritating swagger music and looked like a rental costume. The horror effects bordered on cheesy.<br><br>When you re-release a film under a new title, general rule of thumb is that is was lousy. This was filmed in Fall River, Mass. and I believe the large looming cooling towers in the background at the end, are those of Brayton Point Power Station, a coal-fire plant.<br><br>The description is incorrect. The \"wicked cool\" Ouija board was not in the basement but upstairs and brought to the basement. Note the picture of Edgar Allan Poe on the wall in the upstairs living room. Why? I don't know.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Film has some sacrilegious moments.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"CAN'T HEAR IT!","rating":1,"date":"11 June 2018","review":"I didn't get very far with this movie as I just couldn't be bothered with the constant dropping out of the sound. I was constantly turning it up and down and just gave up. The writing that I saw was pretty awful, but not being able to hear it was more than I could be bothered with","user":"raven_guest","rank":[1,2]}]
