This is a fun exploration of a woman who had it all, but then realized she was still missing something big in her life. I like how this movie goes into detail about themes of sisterhood, self reliance, and ingenuity. But mostly I like that it doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some emotional moments intercut with some really clever and funny gags which keeps you entertained the whole way through. It's a feel good film that has a lot to offer everyone. The climactic sequence at the drag show was especially fun! Really good writing, directing, and acting by the whole team.","user":"svenjergensen","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"Fun for everyone","rating":10,"date":"12 July 2019","review":"Nice to walk away from a film and feel good! It deals with tough situations, yet you feel empowered by their journey. You can't help but cheer for them. Well done!","user":"cooper-deanna","rank":[5,8]}]
