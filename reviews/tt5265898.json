[{"title":"For this genre it wasn't bad.","rating":6,"date":"22 March 2019","review":"I can understand the reviewers that thought it was horrible. Those reviewers are looking for something of higher quality, a serious movie with a suspenseful plot and with great special effects. Those things are all absent in Dead Ant. It's all just a bit of fun and mockery for the horror genre. It's a cheap horror/comedy with some mildly gore moments. The special effects are lousy but it just adds the right ambiance to this movie, nothing taken too serious. But it was entertaining, or at least to me it was but that's maybe because of the wacky tabacky, something I would recommend to have some nice good laughs with stupid humor like in this movie. The acting wasn't bad, it was supposed to be funny and that's exactly what it was.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Super Fun","rating":9,"date":"3 May 2018","review":"This is a super fun monster movie! It has a retro 80s vibe and features gigantic killer ants that are terrorizing the members of a has-been rock band. Tom Arnold is hilarious and the entire cast does a great job. This is a fun movie, nothing serious just a really great time!","user":"jenirosester","rank":[23,36]},{"title":"Nicely Done","rating":6,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"Watched this with a friend and both we really enjoyed it - yes, Dead Ant is for certain no masterpiece but nevertheless entertaining - if you like horror + comedy + trash movie style. Alone the rock 'n' roll cliches are well played and here and there you get even a sip of gore. Not to forget the hot chicks provided, and last but not least, the acting and cam work are rock solid.<br><br>To sum it up: Dead Ant is a good one if you like trashy horror-comedies which you can watch \"braindead\" ;)","user":"Tweetienator","rank":[10,17]}]
