[{"title":"All Kinds of Claim Jumping","rating":9,"date":"21 May 2005","review":"Stewart Granger in his memoirs said he was very glad to receive the role of George Pratt when he did and was always grateful to John Wayne who got him cast in the part. He had just left MGM and offers were not piling up. Granger's career was in a transitional stage and he would soon take off for Europe and all kinds of spaghetti westerns. Right at that point he needed a paycheck.<br><br>Granger and Fabian play the brothers Pratt, George and Billy and John Wayne is their partner Sam McCord in a gold claim that's just hit it big. He's got to buy mining equipment in Seattle and Pratt's fianc√© Jennie is there too. Wayne's to bring back both the equipment and Jennie.<br><br>But Jennie has off and got herself married. So Wayne in a moment of alcoholic brilliance spots another girl with a French accent in a pleasure palace called the Birdcage and decided to take her back to Alaska for Granger. She's played by Capucine. But things don't quite work out.<br><br>Of course there's another kind of claim jumping going on led by no-good cynical gambler Ernie Kovacs. All kinds of problems for the McCord-Pratt partnership. <br><br>If you like your comedy broad and unsophisticated North to Alaska is your kind of film. The Duke has some of his funniest screen moments in this film. There's a whole routine with Granger and Capucine trying to make Wayne jealous and with Fabian serving as a straight man to Wayne, it's a pretty funny bit of business. Wayne's facial expressions are alone worth seeing the movie.<br><br>John Wayne was always shrewd in marketing his films and he sought to woo a younger audience by having current teenage idols in his films around that time. He had Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo and Frankie Avalon in The Alamo and now Fabian in North to Alaska.<br><br>I saw an interview with Fabian some years ago where he said Wayne was a formidable presence on the set of his film. He was great when you got to know him and he accepted you. But you did things his way or it was the highway, no questions asked.<br><br>Fabian has some moments too as a 17 year old whose hormones get going at the sight of Capucine. He sings a song in the film, If You Only Knew. But the real song hit is the title tune sung by Johnny Horton over the title. It was a big hit for Horton in his short and tragic career. Frankie Laine also sold a few platters with this song.<br><br>If your taste is sophisticated drawing room comedy, this ain't your film. But fans of the eternal Duke will love it.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[41,46]},{"title":"entertaining and historically correct movie","rating":9,"date":"7 February 2006","review":"North to Alaska is one of the most northerly western to be brought out, playing mostly in Nome. The movie is complete fiction, but the location and how it looked there during the gold rush are surprisingly correct. After Klondyke, Nome had a kind of second rush, but since most people searched for gold in/near the rivers - like Sam (Wayne) and his companions did - the real rush came to Nome after a local was chased away from his claim and as he started to wash at the beach(!) he found a real bonanza! Nome had no haven, which is shown in the movie: ships (mostly arriving from Seattle) had to anchor before the coast and freight and passengers had to be brought aland by smaller vessels. Also characters like Frankie are realistic, for crooks where indeed not hesitating to kill people or steal claims (as I mentioned above). How it looks in Nome is also realistic: however most of the year frozen, in the short period the ice melts, the streets were one ditch of thighhigh mud; Frankie is made aware of that fact very firsthand.<br><br>Humanity note: After Sam brought a girl from Seattle to Nome, which was an silly alcohol decision, he regrets it and leaves her in town so she could take the next boat back. Also in this movie there are people offering apologies, even Sam himself; try to find regret and apologies in other westerns!<br><br>Music: The title song by Johnnie Horton is a real C&amp;W hit.<br><br>Totally: The movie is very entertaining, funny, human and realistic in historical context. A good film for the whole family!","user":"martinbijkerk","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"My favorite movie of all time!","rating":5,"date":"5 May 2002","review":"\nThis movie is too funny! And too heartwarming! I can watch this movie over\nand over and still laugh! And it is not slapstick! Just good ole wholesome\nAmerican comedy! My favorite! Three men, (well, two men and a teen) and a\nFrench woman! What a combo!!\nJohn Wayne is his usual macho self. That is always fun to watch. And\nStewart\nGranger is soooo good here! I have seen him in many things, but I think he\nout-did himself here! He's too funny! And poor Fabian. He breaks my heart\nwith his love-sick adoration of Michelle! If you haven't seen this, you\nmust\nrent it. You will be glad you did. And you WILL end up watching it again.\nIt's that type of movie.","user":"Capucine","rank":[29,33]}]
