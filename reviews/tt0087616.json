[{"title":"Could Have Been a Good Movie","rating":9,"date":"27 December 2005","review":"I first saw this movie years ago back in 1987 and I remember this movie had an original feel to it and had some memorable atmosphere to the movie but seeing it again just recently has shifted my view on this movie. This movie stars Alice Cooper as a rock star (of course) going back to his families old house to film a music video. He brings his crew (who all seem mentally challenged) and expects to have a good time. What they don't realize is there is a pack of wild dogs slaughtering people along the country side and these dogs are led by the Monster Dog. The main problems with this movie is extremely bad acting, bad music, Alice Coopers voice is dubbed over, and very bad special effects (except a hilarious scene when a bald guy gets the top of his head blown to pieces). But you can over look this because the movie saves itself with some decent atmosphere. I can't place it but this flick can be creepy at times. Anyway, if you know before watching this movie that is it going to be bad than you will probably enjoy this.","user":"CMRKeyboadist","rank":[18,19]},{"title":"Cooper + Werewolves + Italian director + 80's = Orgasmic","rating":7,"date":"31 January 2008","review":"Gonna start with saying this: Yes, it IS sad that Alice Cooper's voice is dubbed over, BUT they chose a good voice and it actually fits pretty good.<br><br>I watched this movie yesterday and I was surprised, didn't expect it to be that good. Alice Cooper played the role good as hell, and the feel of the movie reminded me of movies I watched growing up. It's pretty easy to tell that it's an Italian director, but that's not bad, cause they can usually make a movie visual in a way that Americans can't.<br><br>The werewolf-look might not be the best around, but they did what they could with what they had. By showing it as little as possible, but still showing it, they made it seem like it looked cooler than it probably did.<br><br>I'm a huge werewolf fan, a 80's horror fan, Alice Cooper fan, gore fan, and a fan of a lot of other stuff in this film, and I wasn't let down. (Don't let the \"gore fan\" part trick you though, it's not a gory movie, but it has a couple of blood scenes) 7.5/10 (Giving it 8 on the vote above)","user":"filmbizarro","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Alice Cooper in Monster Dog","rating":13,"date":"13 April 2003","review":"Monster Dog is a great horror treat for anyone who is a true horror fan. Alice Cooper gives a great performance as Vince Raven. Victoria Vera stood tall, as well, playing the girlfriend of Vince. Monster Dog had a great story to it. It also has 2 previously unreleased songs by Alice entitled, \"Identity Crisises\" and \"See Me In The Mirror.\" This movie was only supposed to be seen in the Philippines, as was told to Alice, but it found its way into every video store from coast to coast. I'm sure glad it made it to the USA.  It is a real treat for fans of Alice everywhere. I spent 15 long years trying to find this movie. Only a best friend of mine and myself remembered it. I finally came across it at a newly opened local video store. I got lucky enough to be able to buy it off of them. This goes to show you that if you never give up hoping to find something you know exist, you'll one day find it.","user":"PhantasmRulz","rank":[13,20]}]
