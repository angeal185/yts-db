[{"title":"Alicia Silverstone shines in this teenage drama","rating":8,"date":"7 April 2000","review":"It's very hard to understand why this movie is rated so low. I really enjoyed watching this film, which was Silverstone's first major role. She plays a crazy teenager who has a crush on a guy who lives in a guesthouse. In her selfish pursuit of the object of her affection, she makes the guy's life a living hell. She also makes the life miserable for anyone who tries to \"steal\" the guy from her. I think Silverstone fit her role perfectly. The plot was very good as well, and I was always wondering what Silversone's character (Alicia) would do next. This movie gets a solid 8 from me.","user":"http://www.angelfire.com/ok3/MoneyNow","rank":[45,51]},{"title":"A Sexy Villain Sells this Movie","rating":9,"date":"12 March 2005","review":"In her film debut,the attractive Alicia Silverstone plays Darian Forrester,a mentally disturbed 14 year old girl who develops an unhealthy obsession with her neighbour,Nick Eliot (Cary Elwes)a baby faced blonde hair,blue eyed journalist who has no sexual interest in her.Silverstone shines in her role as the villain,making life hell for Nick,who wants nothing more than a friendship with the girl next door.Darian's desperate attempts to seduce the older man are unsuccessful,driving her deeper into her obsession and making her more psychotic.Silverstone's acting is superb,but her facial expressions are what is so convincing about her performance.Alicia superbly transforms herself from sweet and innocent into scary and psychotic giving new meaning to the phrase,'When she was good she was very very good,and when she was bad she was horrid'. The film has you on the edge of your seat as the plot unravels,and truths are discovered about sweet little Darian Forrester who is crazier than anyone thought.Her anger at Nick for leading her on goes to the extreme until she comes up with a plan she hopes will destroy his reputation.Nick is oblivious to Darian's feelings for him and believes its nothing more than a silly school girl crush that will pass until he discovers just how dangerous Darian really is.","user":"BettieTeese","rank":[49,59]},{"title":"sit back and enjoy","rating":7,"date":"11 July 2001","review":"This movie has its faults but you can sit back and have fun watching it. It's slow at first. It's not suspenseful but it efficiently uses the short time of action to punch you with thrills. My adrenaline was rushing when Amy got stung by wasps. The direction is so precise that a certain number of seconds can leave you hanging off the sofa. Be careful if you're eating popcorn(or potato chips). You might end up drooling your food on the floor. Nick isn't that smart but I like him because he's nobody's fool. Aside from Cary Elwes and Alicia Silverstone, Kurtwood Smith(That 70's Show) also plays his part very well. The reversal of traditional sexual harassment and discrimination was also interesting.","user":"starlet86","rank":[25,31]}]
