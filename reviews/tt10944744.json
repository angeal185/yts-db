Wooden acting. Poor characterisation. The Germans were totally unconvincing. An absolute disaster of a film from beginning to end. An insult to anyone who has created a film dedicated to the atrocities of Auschwitz","user":"michaelmcgarry","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Waste of time","rating":1,"date":"4 April 2020","review":"I used to watch quite lot of war and holocaust movies, some are very interesting movies that narrates the agony and sufferings of the innocent human life in the way it was happened . But this was just waste of rubbish. I am not sure how a person spend their money and time to create such balderdash.<br><br>It's a waste of all. DON'T waste your time.","user":"obiwankanobee","rank":[4,5]}]
