[{"title":"terribly done","rating":1,"date":"15 July 2019","review":"The whole film just feels like a rushed disaster, camera angles are bad and it's just so poorly done. AVOID!","user":"solovinscone","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Past Trash","rating":1,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"I respect Master P hustle, but this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I wouldn't actually call it a movie. More of a bunch of incoherent scenes put together called a movie. I can't believe P approved this video. Well at the very least I contributed to urban cinema and perhaps they can make actual movies in the future with a better budget.<br><br>Tyler Prarie read the script and went silent on P, I can't say I am mad at him for that. He should have stepped in and helped out with production and direction , alas to all that will endure this pain, good luck.","user":"kravendahunter","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"Not Worth the Time","rating":1,"date":"15 July 2019","review":"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. It made me not want to watch any movies for a while to recover from this bad experience. Having given this movie one star, was by far too generous. The story line seemed interesting, but unfortunately the movie itself didn't carry on that interest. I felt the acting was mediocre as if I was watching a just for fun video made on YouTube. This is solely my opinion, and in my opinion it is not worth the time.","user":"teagardensocial","rank":[14,19]}]
