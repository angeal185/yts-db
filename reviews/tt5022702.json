[{"title":"Hush","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2020","review":"Hush combines the familiarities of the home-invasion sub-genre with the unpredictability of its interesting premise. Kate Siegel plays deaf author Maddie with persisting conviction and aids in mining the story's nailbiting potential. It doesn't surpass every trope there is within its category, but it sprinkles plenty of \"oh, how will this turn out?\" questions across its short runtime to keep you on your toes.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[37,38]},{"title":"Just shows, you don't need a lot of screaming to make a slasher movie tense","rating":7,"date":"17 December 2016","review":"A chess game of suspense involving a deaf girl and a serial killer locked outside her home in the woods.<br><br>It sounds like a cliché with a twist, and it is, but it's a really good cliché with a twist.<br><br>For a start the premise that the lead character Maddie, the deaf writer, who is home alone after a relationship break up, opens up a box of plot twists and devices that are unfamiliar in their familiarity.<br><br>Second, Maddie, (Kate Siegel) dominates the movie, even though it's essentially a double hander, with a superbly sympathetic performance that never gets you shouting \"don't do that\", as is common in this genre.<br><br>The tension does not let up from start to finish (and it's only 82 minutes so doesn't outstay its welcome) as the masked invader tries to outwit Maddie and vice versa. <br><br>The temptation might have been to take Maddie's disability and, like with Audrey Hepburn's blindness in Wait Until Dark, use it to her advantage somehow; but that does not transpire. It's actually her skills as a writer (she is completing her latest crime novel when the would be assassin strikes) that gives her some traction in what should be a one-sided battle.<br><br>This is an intelligent, well paced and well shot, low budget slasher movie, but on a higher plane.","user":"markgorman","rank":[52,65]},{"title":"Silent chiller with great acting and an excellent premise.","rating":7,"date":"14 April 2016","review":"'Hush' is a lot like 'The Strangers', except instead of strangers plural it's only one man, and instead of a husband and wife being terrorized it's a deaf and mute recluse. It's very tense and cleverly written bar a few cliché tropes that come with this kind of movie. It also has a minimal synth score, something I notice more and more horror movies are utilizing - 'You're Next', 'It Follows' - to give it an '80s classic slasher atmosphere. It's hard to even call it horror though as it offers far more thrills than actual scares. I was thoroughly satisfied watching this movie. It's constantly engaging, and that has a lot to do with the terrific performances of both the man and Maggie, and there are a few scenes that are genuinely depraved and chilling. It doesn't break any new ground, but following 'The Babadook' and 'It Follows', 'Hush' continues to reinspire the subtle, quiet corner of the genre and bodes well for the future of psychological thrillers. Highly recommended.","user":"lnvicta","rank":[131,178]}]
