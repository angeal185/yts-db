[{"title":"Awesome Film","rating":10,"date":"29 August 2016","review":"I grew up in Harrison and I was so touched by this film. Growing up with the real Marty, I saw a soft spoken and gentle soul. I never knew the hardships of his family dynamics. I cried and laughed through the whole film and was moved that this family opened up to be transparent for the world to see. When leaving the theater, most were crying and saying that they loved it. From a retired high school counselor's view, this is a must see for our youth. The struggles they deal with need to be seen as motivation and not stumbling blocks. This is an encouraging message to all! Brandon not only worked hard academically and athletically, he stood firm in his values and morals. I hope this message resonates loud to the audience to not be afraid of going against what is popular for the greater good.","user":"sallyhennard","rank":[35,47]},{"title":"Loved it!","rating":10,"date":"26 August 2016","review":"The movie GREATER was better than I ever could've imagined. Chris Severio did an excellent job portraying Brandon, Leslie Easterbrook was amazing at playing Barbara, and Neal McDonough gave his best performance to date as Marty Burlsworth. Nick Searcy is the dark horse of the movie - trying to make Marty (Neal McDonough) doubt his faith in God - allowing this to happen to his brother. Even if you don't like football, this story is one that proves that hard work pays off. More importantly, it is about faith and why bad things happen to good people. You will cry, you will laugh, but most of all, you will leave wanting to be a better person yourself.","user":"hagoodphotography","rank":[32,44]},{"title":"Finally, a movie worth watching","rating":10,"date":"26 August 2016","review":"The movie flow, acting, story line, actors, and levels of inference are all spot on. Is it the \"perfect\" movie? Of course not, but in the middle of all the overwhelming garbage being spewed out in the last decade, this is a breath of fresh air.<br><br>Truly, in a time when the movies being made from the big studios seem to be ripe with blood, guts, sex, ghosts, demons, and mindless trash, this movie reminds us that the best stories are the real ones.<br><br>I don't intend to go line by line critiquing the movie, just to give this a simple recommendation to go see it. No heavy handed words needed.<br><br>Well done to all involved in this production, my wife and I really enjoyed it.","user":"pamyers-90771","rank":[33,50]}]
