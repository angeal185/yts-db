[{"title":"Long time since I saw something this bad.","rating":2,"date":"17 April 2015","review":"So I will start by saying: (crickets playing in the background)<br><br>Sadly, even tho I wanted to keep it as short as possible, I fear that I have to be explicit in order to properly warn people. Disciples is one of the worst movies I've laid my eyes upon, it tried a lot, has a lot of people involved, states pretty much only the obvious about hell, succubus, Lucifer and so on, mixing with drugs, rock music and all the rest resulting in something that could be compared with the work of a 12 years old frustrated little kid. It really is that bad, and trust me, after seeing the first 3 minutes you'll know what I'm talking about. And no, I'm not kidding, I looked carefully, 3 minutes is what it takes to completely ruin it for you!<br><br>But at least you'll know from start that it is truly, that bad! If you decide to watch some more, fine, but at least come back with an opinion, state it here, and let's play a game: name a movie that is worse than this! <br><br>I for one am shocked, I have seen my share of indie productions, extremely low budget horrors, a lot of bad gore, but this one sinks to a whole new level. Sorry to say so!<br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[21,27]},{"title":"What the Hell!","rating":1,"date":"18 April 2015","review":"Lately all I have been seeing within the film industry is very bad film making, bad acting and costumes you can find in any fancy dress store. <br><br>Disciples is just another bad movie with special effects that really doesn't make the film any better, the acting isn't convincing and as I mentioned, wardrobe must have hired a fancy dress shop to help them with the costumes. Something you would see during Halloween.<br><br>The \"creatures\" or \"demons\" walk around with mouths opened either screaming or just something they think will scare you. That once or twice over where they quickly turn to the camera to show you how scary they look. In fact it was a laugh! <br><br>Oh my, what a disaster. I think I will return to foreign films where at least I have seen some good horror and good acting and steer away from these American films which have started to annoy me.","user":"panther_husky","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"Meandering Cameo Fest","rating":3,"date":"6 December 2018","review":"The Watcher or Disciples is an incoherent, nudity sown cult star cameo fest that's so cheap and hopelessly overambitious, i was flawed by not seeing a David DeCoteau credit attached to it.<br><br>One one hand you have excessive sexualised gore and violence which gave the film some satanic majesty about it. On the other hand, Tony Todd is decapitated by CGI so bad, it exits his body in the form of a glowing stream of piss and colours the sky the most crimson red After Effects will allow.<br><br>What The Watcher gets right is it's intriguing concept and aforementioned practical effects. Everything else from the camerawork to the overwritten dialogue reeks of amateur hour. I feel like a lot of good will and commitment from both actors and special effects artists was wasted here. The scenes of torture are outstandingly plentiful and gratuitous and gave the film some flavour, but everything else feels like a boring afternoon in the director's house.<br><br>The Watcher is a clumsily assembled mess of a movie which makes Six Angels look like The Ninth Configuration. It has good work from a number of horror icons and the gore is impressive, but the film overall is too wordy, too interior heavy and has a very uneven pace that will try the patience of nearly everyone who will watch it.","user":"daniel-mannouch","rank":[0,2]}]
