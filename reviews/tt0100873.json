[{"title":"Excellent, underrated Altman","rating":19,"date":"19 September 2002","review":"Altman tells the oft-told story of Vincent Van Gogh and the much less told story of his art dealer brother.  The story deftly avoids tortured artist cliches and builds both characters as complex, contradictory individuals. The acting is beyond excellent.  Tim Roth shows considerable restraint as Van Gogh, a character that many actors would have chosen to overact.  And Rhys's Theo calm surface subtly betrays his inner torment. <br><br>\nAltman's camera is a star here as well, and few directors today understand the principle of movement as well as he does.  The photography ranges from good to excellent, and the whole films feels like a glimpse into Vincent's world.  Like most of Altman's better films, it's character rather than plot driven, so some will certainly say that it's 'boring'.  If you are prone to say things like this, it's probably not for you, but anyone who is a fan of Altman's earlier films will be pleased.","user":"philfromno","rank":[30,35]},{"title":"Altman uses Vincent's lighting","rating":14,"date":"14 March 2000","review":"This story is one of the most interesting I know. Unfortunately, the script misses the real drama of this important life. But never mind. The real art of the film is in two achievements:<br><br>--Altman frames and colors his shots through Vincent's eyes. This is the most sensitive use of the cinematic palette I've seen, and makes the experience singular. I saw it on a TV, which I hate to do. I would travel to see this properly projected.<br><br>--Time Roth gives interprets Vincent wonderfully. If you ignore the lines, which are vapid, and concentrate on his being, it's quite nuanced. He is meek in body, but passionate in expression. The teeth and pipe are great.","user":"tedg","rank":[23,29]},{"title":"Bravo!","rating":8,"date":"11 February 2002","review":"\"Vincent &amp; Theo\" tells of the later years of the too short lives of painter Vincent Van Gogh and his lesser known brother, Theo. I was surprised, after viewing a Tivo'd version of the film, at how little has been written about and made of this wonderfully crafted period film by Robert Altman. Roth (Vincent) and Ryhs (Theo) distinguish themselves with superb performances which make the spectacle of their work on screen as interesting, if not more so, than the lives of their humble characters. The entire cast turns in solid performances, something which must be attributed largely to Altman, and the film offers excellence in every aspect with the possible exception of sound. Running a tad long for a somewhat less than extraordinary biography, \"Vincent &amp; Theo\" is recommended for more mature viewers into period films or those with a special interest in Van Gogh and/or classical painting.","user":"=G=","rank":[25,33]}]
