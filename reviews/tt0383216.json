[{"title":"Not quite what I'd hoped for ...","rating":5,"date":"19 February 2006","review":"I'm rather surprised at the outpouring of positive commentary about this movie, especially by folks who are older than ten or so.<br><br>I saw this with my son in a crowded theatre, mostly children, and from the reaction, most of them thought it was hilarious. I'd been hoping for a bit more of a nod to adults - something along the lines of what there was in Bugs Bunny or, more recently, in a lot of the SpongeBob Squarepants episodes - something more than fart jokes and basic slapstick.<br><br>Unfortunately, that's pretty much all there was. I felt like I was sitting through Mr. Magoo again, except with Steve Martin instead of Leslie Nielsen. Sure, there were a couple of funny bits, but they were certainly not enough to carry the movie - a lot like MIB II in this regard, where it felt like they had a couple of jokes left over from the first that they tried to use to carry the movie.<br><br>The wonderful actors Kevin Kline and Jean Reno were wasted in their roles - though without them it would have been completely abysmal, and Beyonce does a good job as well.<br><br>In short, it wasn't bad enough that I felt I wasted my time, but I'm sure glad that I went on a free pass and didn't pay $17 for the experience. Then again, if you've got kids under the age of 12 or so, take them - they will love it, it's right up their alley - just don't expect much to be there for yourself.","user":"bonehead","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"A fun movie, and let's clear up a few things...","rating":8,"date":"16 February 2006","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I expected the worst because of many of the comments here, but that's why they play the game, so the saying goes...<br><br>There were plenty of laughs and a simple but serviceable plot that held together for the whole film. I personally don't think Martin was trying to BE Sellers, but to do his TAKE on a character created by Sellers. Think original Clouseau + The Jerk and you get the idea.<br><br>The key is that Marin captured the spirit of the character and the film captured the spirit of the original films as well. That's all one could ask.<br><br>Jean Reno was quite good, Kevin Cline not so good. He might have taken more time to make his own Dreyfuss.<br><br>Now to clear some things up:<br><br>First: For those who lament a crappy remake of the original film, I suggest you go watch the original film. You will be surprised at how unfunny it is. Sellers is good, but the movie itself is slow and obvious. I remember loving the movie as a kid, then I tried to watch it recently and realized I was remembering the sequel. The original was really weak and boring.<br><br>Second: For those who say Martin turned Clouseau into some kind of loser, I again suggest you watch the originals. He WAS a loser. He WAS pathetic. That was the point. He was a sexual repressed, pathetic loser who lucked into solving crimes while bumbling around and trying to get laid. Martin's Clouseau fits this mold.<br><br>Third: This is not a remake, but another in a series. To suggest that the original is so sacred that another film in a series can't be made many years later is the worst kind of snobbery. Why do people treat films with such reverence but not plays or musicals? If a great star creates a character on stage, does that mean no one else can ever play that character in the history of theater? Of course not. Sorry to say, Sellars is dead. He can't come back and do it again.<br><br>Now there are things about this movie that are different than the originals in terms of tone.<br><br>One is that the subject matter has been toned down a bit. Though there is the implication of sex in multiple places and a few murders (not violent and not seen), it isn't as risqu√© as the original, to fit a broader market one would suppose. Still not sure how they can get away with advertising it on Nickelodeon with links to NIck.com, but that's a typical Viacom/MTV problem.<br><br>But this film is a bit lighter than the original for that reason. It is still satirical, but less blatantly pop culture gag driven than a Shrek. Pink Panther takes subtle jabs at the French and their love of cycling, hatred of American food, etc. It also incorporates a very fun sequence with 006, creates gags out of Viagra, ring tones, the TSA, etc. Basically, it's current without being so tied to 2005/6 that it will feel dated later.<br><br>If you like to laugh, you'll like this movie. If you consider yourself a tough cookie for laughs, then you may not. But that's your fault, not the movie's... ;)","user":"iKramerica-1","rank":[346,532]},{"title":"even with an open mind, I came away deeply disappointed","rating":2,"date":"19 February 2006","review":"I saw a preview 2 weeks before and was extremely excited to see this movie. I had seen Sellers in the Return and Revenge movies as a youngster and thought Steve Martin could easily pull this roll off! I am a hugemongous fan of his old stuff (Jerk, ...Plaid, All of Me, Man with two.... etc.)!<br><br>Neither Steve Martin nor Kevin Kline were able to consistently portray his character from start to finish. Too difficult an accent to master? Maybe the story demanded a deep and developed character?? Yeah right! The movie was only 93 minutes long, what were their problems??<br><br>I demanded my money back after the show. I had been so excited before the show, especially since I had endured a heavily loaded week at work and school. I left the theater feeling seriously ripped off and sick, sick of attempting to giggle at the same old joke of a man getting kicked in the family jewels.<br><br>For many minutes following, I was afraid the movie was a big joke on us, as if these actors were attempting to get away with putting in as little as possible in return for our ticket monies.<br><br>Get your money back or save your money for renting this flop from video store. No reason to see it on the big screen for sure. No reason to ruin the spirit of the Pink Panther either (by renting).","user":"olehenry1","rank":[36,49]}]
