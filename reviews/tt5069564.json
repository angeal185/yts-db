[{"title":"Mister Funny Suit","rating":7,"date":"20 May 2018","review":"John Mulaney's special is worth the watch. He engages the audience and himself. Humor comes in all forms and style and he doesn't come short of it. As a viewer there are times you are reminded of uncles who are in their Sunday best suits and the next second he brings himself and the audience back to the ground with his bumbling about his humble beginnings and musings. Sometimes his tone sounds a bit of a ventriloquist's puppet , he being the oversized puppet and sometimes he just really lets it show, that he is just a kid at heart.","user":"NikkoFranco","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"PopCultureThoughts.Com","rating":8,"date":"9 January 2019","review":"Although his latest Netflix special \"Kid Gorgeous at Radio City Hall\" is incisive and amusing, this earlier routine by John Mulaney is stronger and much funnier. Here, there are a number of laugh-out-loud moments, in particular discussing the highs and lows of adulthood like mortgages and real estate, all delivered by Mulaney in a charming, boyish manner with effective timing. It all leads to an extended story involving his mother and Bill Clinton that gives the special its name, and ends the show on a terrific note. It's also particularly interesting how director Rhys Thomas manages to stamp the show with a visual identity and smooth calculated camerawork, using light touches and subtle flourishes without distracting from the main show.","user":"popculturethoughts","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Another great special","rating":8,"date":"20 January 2019","review":"Solid show by mulaney their were a couple of bits that were meh but most of it was solid and just straight laughs\nLots of quotable stories or punchlines\n2nd favorite of his specials","user":"ghostfiendghost","rank":[4,6]}]
