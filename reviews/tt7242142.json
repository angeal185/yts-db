[{"title":"Favorite film of 2018","rating":10,"date":"1 December 2018","review":"There are a lot of films that attempt different social issues but most seem forced and preaching. Blindspotting is organic and has such a real texture.<br><br>I've read some of the other reviews and none of them understand the characters in the film are very real. If you have ever lived in the bay, you know these people are real. Everything in the film comes from natural situations that happen without forcing it down your throat and show how one thing can lead to another. I've watched it multiple times and shown countless people and not a single person walked away from the film not blown away","user":"killertapehead-581-96203","rank":[62,81]},{"title":"Great film but the ending got lazy","rating":8,"date":"27 December 2018","review":"This film is as real as it gets on the streets. Excellent directing, outstanding acting, perfect score (although near the end I thought I was watching a rap video) and great writing, except for the ending that I felt was a little underwhelming. 8/10 from me","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[29,38]},{"title":"Blindspotting's vision is 20/20","rating":8,"date":"28 July 2018","review":"Though Blindspotting has its cliche moments, overall it's an important film tackling race relations and gentrification in America. The chemistry and genuine camaraderie between writers/stars Diggs and Casal is at the heart of this film.","user":"nordicsoul","rank":[48,73]}]
