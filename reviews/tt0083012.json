[{"title":"Handsome priest has huge moral dilemma....","rating":6,"date":"26 December 2018","review":"Set in a Polish rural village during WWII. Tells the tale of a priest who hears the confession of a would be assassin. Problem is.....the person to be killed seems to be innocent of any wrongdoing and might only be guilty of hiding and protecting Jewish refugees. Should the priest intervene? Film centers almost exclusively on following the priest as he wrestles with this moral question. The actor playing the priest is handsome and good at portraying someone who's vexed and anxious. After seeing the ending, the only redeeming traits of this movie are the \"handsome\" lead and the atmospheric cinematography. I was hoping the plot would lead somewhere else....was praying that the priest would turn out gay, but didn't happen.","user":"ohlabtechguy","rank":[3,11]}]
