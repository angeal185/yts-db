[{"title":"Surprisingly well-done","rating":7,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"A surprisingly well-done horror. It's half mockumentary, featuring interviews with the characters about their haunted experiences, which make up the rest of the film. It does admittedly have a bit of a languid ending, but the proper creepy moments and even a few good laughs throughout make up for it, in my humble opinion. It seems to me to be a commentary on matriarchy, which others might have picked up on if they gave it more than 10-15 minutes. But, hey, I guess female-led horror films aren't for ever fanboy with a keyboard. Anyhow, it definitely doesn't deserve 1 star, by a long shot.","user":"queeroid","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"terrible","rating":1,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"Just another piece of trash that someone spent a maximum of $10,000.00 total budget to make. Even worse, the story is as bad as the acting and everything else about this \"film\".","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"Great mix of horror and comedy!","rating":10,"date":"19 July 2019","review":"It's tough to get the horror/comedy angle right in a film. Too far one direction and there aren't really scary parts. Too far the other, and the funny parts seem like an afterthought. Ashes has a great vibe.","user":"viclord12","rank":[3,4]}]
