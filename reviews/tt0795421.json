[{"title":"Sad","rating":26,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"It is all marketing. I hate marketing. Amanda Siefried, who was a great actress in Big Love, and also was in the fascinating and Boogie Woogie tries to sing in this film that exists only to market itself via the songs of Abba.\nIt is cringeworthy.","user":"lathamtaeden","rank":[66,80]},{"title":"Amanda Is Quite Attractive...","rating":4,"date":"30 October 2019","review":"... it is quite an achievement to take a woman as pretty as that (watch her legs in Boogie Woogie) and as capable as that (watch Big Love) and make her boring, irritating and essentially insane.<br><br>Mamma Mia! What a shallow movie.","user":"tamiloreariz","rank":[64,82]},{"title":"As Far Away From Essential Cinema As Wal-Mart Is To Quality, Class Or Cleanliness","rating":2,"date":"25 December 2019","review":"My goodness, how far has humanity fallen?<br><br>Imagine the olden days when a man serenaded and sang odes to women.\nNow come see this. Its nail scratching, hair pulling torture. I rather shop at Wal-Mart and subjected to a marathon of Once Upon A Time In America than suffer through this rubbish again.\nWomen should use their mouths for beautiful things.","user":"ntlufms","rank":[36,46]}]
