Like they were in front of the camera for the first time.","user":"darkseeker-33501","rank":[32,38]},{"title":"What's with the bogus reviews?","rating":1,"date":"27 December 2019","review":"It says there are 6 reviews. Then it becomes 3 critics reviews. When I check the critic review from Rotten Tomatoes there is no actual review. When I check for reviews there are none. And yet this movie has a rating of 8.5? What is going on here?","user":"rockyandbullwinkle","rank":[51,66]},{"title":"Everytime this trainwreck gets a view...","rating":1,"date":"28 December 2019","review":"...an innocent bunny will die. This is how bad this is. It's breakfast cereal with water bad. It's a snowstorm without shoes bad.
