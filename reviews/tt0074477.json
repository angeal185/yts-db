[{"title":"A Real Gem That Deserves More Attention","rating":15,"date":"15 September 2017","review":"Emma Mae (1976) <br><br>*** (out of 4)<br><br>Emma Mae (Jerri Hayes) moves from the South out to the ghetto in Los Angeles and it doesn't take long for her to get involved with JEsse (Ernest WIlliams II). Emma believes that the two of them are in love and when he's arrested and thrown into jail she decides to support him any way she can. This includes committing a crime to try and protect her man but she's got a lot to learn.<br><br>Director Jamaa Fanaka will always be remembered for the PENITENTIARY trilogy but there's no question that this here, his second feature film, is his best work. The film has been re-released under the title BLACK SISTER'S REVENGE but that's just a fake title to try and pass it off as some sort of exploitation movie and that's certainly not what the film is. This here is basically a very good character study about a young woman in a new environment and having to learn that not everything is as it seems.<br><br>I was really impressed with how good this movie actually was and I really liked how it didn't fall into the various stereotypes that were common with these films. There are two cops here that start abusing their power and get all of the mess started yet they are the white racists that we normally see. These are two black cops that get things going and the film has a certain message about people sitting around killing one another off without achieving anything in life. There are some really good moments here where the director gets his point across without having to preach.<br><br>Hayes is extremely believable in her role as the tough Southern girl who might need to learn a few things but she's also got things to teach to others. The actress was very good in the role and there's no question that you felt that she really was this character. Williams was also extremely good in the role of the worthless boyfriend and his fits of anger rang true and authentic. I also enjoyed Malik Carter who plays the wise old man.<br><br>It's really too bad that this film here isn't better known. I think the problem is that people probably get to know the director through his exploitation pictures and then they check this out and are disappointed that it's not more of the same. EMMA MAE is certainly an interesting little gem that deserves to be seen.","user":"Michael_Elliott","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"On of my Favorites","rating":8,"date":"23 October 2010","review":"I only took the two points because of the budget. This is a very good moving for a low budget. It is one I grow up watching as little girl and enjoyed the storyline, acting and step into time. Now I share with my children. The acting is very good from the two leads, Jerrie Hayes and Ernst Williams. Although, not a very common story line, the story line is one we may still need to pay attention to today. There are many lessons to be learned from this moving. Although they may have lost me in there mean to an end action to free Zeke and Jesse. It doesn't ways work out this way in life, but it is a movie. Nevertheless, there were still great meaning behind the film. We need to understand who we are, what we are living for and is it worth the cost? I really wish more projects like this one could have been produced. I would have loved to see both Hayes and Williams in other productions. I believe that both of them may have been overlooked. I guess there wasn't very many roles available to someone with such beautiful skin and talent. LOL.","user":"latosha-ddavis","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"Very likeable and well observed","rating":8,"date":"21 June 2018","review":"Na√Øve country gal Emma Mae (a fine and appealing portrayal by Jerri Hayes) moves in with her relatives in a blighted urban ghetto neighborhood. After her boyfriend Jesse Amos (a solid performance by Ernest Williams II) gets arrested and sent to prison, Emma decides to rob a bank when more legitimate means for raising bail money prove to be unsuccessful. <br><br>Writer/director Jamaa Fanaka relates the engrossing story at a leisurely pace, vividly captures the lowdown funky vibe and limited options of Compton, California in the mid-1970's, and populates the rambling episodic narrative with believably earthy and engaging characters. Hayes in particular projects a sweet wide-eyed charm and sturdy unwavering feistiness that makes Emma Mae an easy person to root for and sympathize with. Most importantly, Fanaka brings a gentle humanity and simplicity to the plot that manages to be surprisingly affecting and even occasionally incisive. It's this latter sterling element that enables this picture to stand out as a winning and authentic slice of black American life.","user":"Woodyanders","rank":[2,2]}]
