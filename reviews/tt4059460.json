The plot is overdone, the dialogue is boring and the acting marginal.\nHe was a terrible actor in his prime and it seems that he hasn't improved - so really practice does not at all make perfect.","user":"mjdk2","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"The worst Dolph movie so far, don't watch it.","rating":1,"date":"13 December 2019","review":"Words cannot express how horrible this movie is.\nWho signs off on it's production?\nAre they proud of their work?\nDo they have any concept of shame?\nThere is nothing else to say besides save the 1.5 hours of your life and read a book.\nIn summary, don't waste your time.\nIt is a disaster, very bad acting, very bad camera scenes,very bad movie effects, very bad everything.\nThe voters are probably their friends and neighbors, because u canÂ´t vote more than 2 if u are person with the normal taste for movies.","user":"psxexperten","rank":[13,16]}]
