[{"title":"Actions Speak Louder Than Words","rating":8,"date":"12 June 2018","review":"For the last couple of months, I have been thrilled and admire how powerful the silence (usage of less dialogues) and sounds can be in today's films. They say that - Actions Speak Louder Than Words. For example, \"the Tribe\" Ukrainian powerful drama about deaf teenagers, or \"All is Lost\" intense 105minutes by Robert Redford who tries to stay alive. Or even recent hit \"a quiet place\" where a family forced to communicate through sign language in order to survive. In all these films audience could feel the dialogues by beautiful performances by main characters. The Chinese \"Wrath of Silence\" had similar effect on me.<br><br>To be honest I was surprisingly interested in the Chinese \"Wrath of Silence\", for me watching foreign films sometimes can be challenging, following the film and subtitles sometimes can be annoying. but after watching the half of the Xin Yukun's \"Wrath of Silence\" I found myself locked in it.<br><br>The \"Wrath of Silence\" is very well-executed thriller that gets more interesting as it goes. As an audience we all can feel for the main protagonist who is looking for his son. This unfortunate and hopeless quest is supported by powerful moments, bone-crunching action and dark humor. \"Wrath of Silence\" also have great storytelling, sound effects and beautifully crafted cinematography. Each shot worth thinking and analyzing twice. <br><br>The only flaws for me was the pace of the first half. I believe it was too slow and very long, and ending could be a little better, more artistic and more meaningful rather than just having kid drawing what happened. I wish we could see him drawing before a little by little and trying to tell what happened instead he was just creepy wearing the mask.","user":"kkurbanov","rank":[32,34]},{"title":"Well-executed thriller that gets more interesting in afterthought","rating":8,"date":"16 April 2018","review":"I wouldn't quite call it the best Chinese film I've seen this year--that would be BangZi Melody, but it does follow a recent trend of improvement and innovation in Chinese cinematography I haven't seen in many years. Still, domestic reception is lukewarm, while crappy Jingoistic popcorn films like Wolf Warrior and Operation Red Sea get showered in praise, but that just means China is in lack of good audiences--which can't be helped in the short term, not good filmmakers. The censorship obviously isn't helping, but in the case of this film, doesn't seem a huge hindrance either.\nThe start of the film felt a little puzzling, but I unfortunately missed the first 3-5 minutes of the film, and judging from the rest of the film, that could mean a lot. Good thing it didn't prevent me from following the rest of the plot, and the way background information is delivered little by little, subtly and naturally, I find to be a common characteristic of all good drama.\nOur mute protagonist's acting is a notch above Chinese popcorn films, somewhere around Youth(a.k.a Fang Hua)'s level, and most of the other acting is held to a decent standard. The children's acting is above average by Chinese standards and was a pleasant surprise. The only notable exception seems to be the two attorneys near the beginning and the interrogators at the end of the film, all part of the judicial system. They were like marionettes...this seems to have deeper implications?\nThe story unfolds steadily; the dark comedy throughout most of the film aptly complements the grand concept. I was confused about the name at first(the Chinese name is no less confusing than the English version), but when you grasp the grand concept, you'll have an understanding of the name, but even then there may be multiple layers to the meaning or multiple interpretations. The film also used a few Chinese metaphors graphically, but that unfortunately means that the international audience will probably miss it. One universal symbol though is the money; if you follow the money, the nature of all the characters could be determined...I hope this doesn't count as a spoiler. Overall, there are few useless shots--they either build characters and fill in the background, which in turn contribute to the grand concept, or deliver the clues necessary in a thriller. Speaking of clues, they're quite well hidden, and sometimes cleverly misleading, that's why the film would seem well-executed the more you think about it afterhand. \nTheBigSick is a reviewer that left me a deep impression by giving a 9 to Operation Red Sea; this same reviewer now comes over and rants about \"too many plot holes\" in Wrath of Silence. IMDB should consider adding an IQ test to help add credibility to user reviews.","user":"xenontetroxide","rank":[32,35]},{"title":"A truly outstanding dark work","rating":8,"date":"25 May 2018","review":"This is the best Chinese movie I've watched in 2018. Each shot and plot worth to think twice.The ending is so powerful that I can't help to spend another 30 minutes to check reviews about the movie.","user":"travisliu","rank":[28,31]}]
