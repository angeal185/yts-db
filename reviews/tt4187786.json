[{"title":"All time low","rating":1,"date":"24 March 2018","review":"I have seen an awful lot of horror movies,good ones,bad ones,great ones and vile,disgusting ones,but this is by far the worst I have ever seen,not because it was anything of the vile,disgusting,or just plain bad ones,but everything about it was just atrocious,the camera work full of double exposure,the constant overuse of thick smoke,terrible lighting and what can only be described as truly atrocious acting beyond compare to anything I have ever seen in anything I have ever watched, by every person on the screen.Never,ever let this complete trash darken your life.","user":"aw1963","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Arty time waster","rating":1,"date":"5 March 2017","review":"NOCTURNAL ACTIVITY is an independent British horror film shot in London with a cast pretending to be Americans. The accents range from the very bad to the just about acceptable, but the real problem here lies in the story, or lack of it. The director tries his best to deliver a dream-like atmosphere with scenes of swirling mist and the like, but very little happens in this movie and you feel cheated as a result.<br><br>The main character seems to be possessed although nobody believes her. She hangs and mopes around in her apartment for most of the running time. There's a sub-plot involving a sleazy businessman character who is played by Jonathan Hansler who gives the film's one decent performance. An early scene involving a girl being forced to strip down is included for exploitation value alone and it's the only time anything really happens.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":2,"date":"21 November 2019","review":"If you're after some minor titillation, this is for you. If you want horror, don't bother. Awful acting, poor story line, only got the two stars due to some partly naked women","user":"steve-63782","rank":[0,0]}]
