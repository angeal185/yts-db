[{"title":"Surprisingly impressed","rating":8,"date":"9 October 2018","review":"Bottom line: This is your standard slasher film done in a different way.<br><br>By nature syfy channel original movies are pretty crap, because they're done cheaply and seemingly written by 12 year olds, but this one pleasantly surprised me. Granted, I had low expectations, but whereas most syfy originals I either turn off halfway through or fall asleep to, this one I stayed till the very end. I even went so far as to recommend it to friends. Imagine that! There's a fine line between doing a funny horror movie and doing a cheesy horror movie, and this one tread that line very well. If you're looking for an actual scary movie, this isn't it. But if you're in the mood for something fun and different, this one is a must watch.","user":"tattgirl8418","rank":[47,61]},{"title":"Not the best but not the worst.","rating":6,"date":"23 July 2019","review":"A nice spin on the horror franchise that has had it's run of the same slasher films. Very predicable but worth the B horror scene watch.","user":"dar0417","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Not the greatest but interesting","rating":5,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"Definitely a B list style movie... It's not the greatest but it's interesting like the head line says... It's a good laugh for a horror style movie!","user":"star_dust2468","rank":[21,29]}]
