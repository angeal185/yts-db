[{"title":"Philadelphia is about life, and making it matter.","rating":14,"date":"14 February 2004","review":"Philadelphia is a guttingly emotional and tragic story of how a lawyer fired for having AIDS attempts to vindicate himself in court.  Tom Hanks gives perhaps the most powerful performance of his career as Andrew Beckett, the afflicted lawyer.  He received the Academy Award in a waltz, and you could almost pick any of his major scenes as worthy of the award.<br><br>This movie is probably the best drama regarding gay issues ever made. Remember, it was made in 1993, when AIDS was still a terminal disease, and it recalls the early days of an epidemic that may not square with the vision afforded today, but at the time, this was the reality of AIDS. <br><br>\nThe entire crew is A-List.  Tak Fujimoto, who would also film Silence of the Lambs and Sixth Sense, directed cinematography.  Jonathan Demme, also of Silence of the Lambs fame, directs with typical honesty and grit.  Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young contributed hauntingly touching original songs. Even Antonio Banderas, whom I never miss an opportunity to vilify, is moving as Hanks' devoted and supportive partner.  Denzel Washington was well cast as the homophobic lawyer who ultimately takes Hanks' case, and Mary Steenburgen is surprising in an uncharacteristic villain role.<br><br>Ron Vawter, who played one of the lawyers in the firm from which Hanks was fired, and also appeared in Silence of the Lambs, was himself suffering from AIDS at the time of filming, and he eventually succumbed to it a few years later.  His appearance in the film encapsulates the reality of the AIDS epidemic, in that it often touched our lives in unexpected places.<br><br>Although I have literally thousands of movies in my collection, I don't own this one.  Not because I don't love it.  I do.  It's because I can't watch it without being overcome by emotion.  Anyone who can watch Hanks' in the Opera scene, or hear Springsteen's or Young's eerie and melancholy ballads and not weep is dead inside.  But in the end, Philadelphia is about life, and making it matter.","user":"budmassey","rank":[156,176]},{"title":"Absolutely astonishing!! Hanks' best performance!!!","rating":10,"date":"23 August 2004","review":"I only saw this film recently after I saw the special edition DVD for sale at only Â£5.99. I bought it and watched it as soon as i took it home and I thought it was amazing. Jonathan Demme's direction was great too. but the two best things about it was Tom Hanks' performance as the lawyer with aids and Bruce Springsteen's song \" Streets of Philadelphia\". I always thought that Liam Neeson's performance in Schindler's List was what should've recieved the Oscar in 1993. But when I eventually saw Philadelphia a few weeks ago, I could see why Hanks won. Denzel Washington as the homophobic but supportive lawyer is also great. The three, Hanks, Washington and Demme make a good team. The film is wonderful.","user":"The_Scientist-86","rank":[69,77]},{"title":"Hanks gives his best performance ever","rating":10,"date":"5 October 2005","review":"\"Philadelphia\" may be the movie that changed Hollywood. For so many years, they portrayed gays as sissies, but this movie forced them to change. Tom Hanks gives the performance of a lifetime as AIDS-afflicted lawyer Andrew Beckett, fired from his law firm after they discover his condition. Equally good is Denzel Washington as homophobic lawyer Joe Miller, who is forced to ignore his own stereotypes in taking Andrew's case. Good support also comes from Jason Robards as Andrew's vicious ex-boss, Joanne Woodward as Andrew's ever-loving mother, and Antonio Banderas as Andrew's companion.<br><br>Maybe this is just me, but I think that \"Philadelphia\" was released at just the right time. Think back to 1993. We had just come out of the Reagan-Bush years and we now had Clinton. Maybe he wasn't openly pro-gay, but he did change the military's policy towards gays. Moreover, Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington are analogous to Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier: the embodiment of the new era under a new president (in Newman's and Poitier's case, it was Kennedy; in fact, those two co-starred in \"Paris Blues\" the year that Kennedy became president, much like Hanks and Washington were starring in \"Philadelphia\" the year that Clinton became president). But let's not get sidetracked. This is a great movie, and I recommend it to everyone.","user":"lee_eisenberg","rank":[101,131]}]
