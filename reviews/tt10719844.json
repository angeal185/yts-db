[{"title":"my true review","rating":1,"date":"25 March 2020","review":"I can't believe there is no review released 06 August 1919?<br><br>Comedy I didn't smile once that's Australian Comedy it should be good, it should be Drama only, Comedy genre is supposed to make you laugh or smile a lot, a lot of irrelevant Drama/Romance 100%, I skipped through the boring crap, weak storyline, very drawn out slow going, you're waiting for something good to happen but it doesn't, total garbage, its like watching cement/paint dry<br><br>Let me explain why I use a lot of irrelevant Drama for reference with my other reviews.<br><br>Good films/movie's spend a lot a money making these films. It appears the film/movie makers set the genre considering they are making it.<br><br>They must make the storyline if no one has watched it. Therefore there are loads of genre's I like. Action, Crime, Fantasy, Horror, Sci Fi and Comedy?.<br><br>I rate all my films from the genre and storyline given if it plays out.<br><br>When I watch them if they don't meet that genre then the rating can drop to 1 as you can't rate 0.<br><br>I also like a good Comedy. To me a comedy is supposed to make you laugh or the low point smile a lot.<br><br>Every Comedy film I've watched some are Comedy only which makes even more of an insult. You don't even smile, that's US Comedy for you when they laugh at anything.<br><br>That's why they get a lot of irrelevant Drama %. to me irrelevant Drama is when they talk about anything useless of storyline that has no interest what so ever. So the more irrelevant Drama there is means they are reading a bad script or the storyline has no good foundation, they are just filling in in time.","user":"keithstanier","rank":[1,2]}]
