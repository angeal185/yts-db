[{"title":"Whatever Floats Your Boat","rating":5,"date":"4 January 2017","review":"While jogging, an attractive young blonde woman is attacked by a man concealed by a dark hoodie. In broad daylight. Fortunately, a handsome young man intervenes and scares off the attacker. The young woman is 18-year-old Gatlin Green (as Lily Becker). She has just discarded a cheating boyfriend and is looking forward to college. The young man is 20-year-old Austin James (as Mick Grant). He's new in town and lives on a boat in the marina. These two characters are mutually attracted, but Ms. Green's \"true crime writer\" mother Brigid Brannagh (as Jennifer) and others think our pretty protagonist should proceed very slowly with Mr. James. James is cute, heroic, polite and muscular with or without his shirt. He seems almost too perfect...<br><br>Not confirming anything, but \"His Secret Past\" means James' character. Of course, these TV movies are liable to pull a fast one on you...<br><br>Our first real clue may be the character not wanting to have his picture taken. Either James is miscast as an unattractive young man or he's secretly a picture picky actor. James does well in the role, with director Randy Carter growing him a smaller stature as compared to Green's tall, dark ex-boyfriend Alex Heartman (as Scott Ellison); note, he has no last scene. Also well cast is Green's concerned best friend Lindsay Bushman (as Kelly). Serving nicely as his own film editor, Mr. Carter makes the story and players smooth and natural. So, when the characters get rough, it means something. \"His Secret Past\" is routine but engaging. There is a lesson to be learned about calling 9-11 when you are in trouble. They put you on hold for a very long time.<br><br>***** His Secret Past (12/26/2016) Randy Carter ~ Gatlin Green, Austin James, Brigid Brannagh, Alex Heartman","user":"wes-connors","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Worst movie every","rating":1,"date":"17 December 2017","review":"This movie was the dumbest movie I every watched.
