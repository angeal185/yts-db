[{"title":"Regular sequel with little budget and average FX","rating":5,"date":"18 June 2007","review":"This following is set in the 10th century , A.D. , and concerns about an orphaned young boy named Geoff (Chris Masterson) living in a stable , he spontaneously meets a dragon named Drake (voice by Robby Benson, while in the first version by Sean Connery) , the world's last living specie . The dragon is being hidden and cared by a novice monk (Hickey) . Drake is the only film dragon that can breath ice . The young boy dreams becoming a valiant knight and befriends that same dragon and join forces with him to vanquish an astute tyrant , Lord Osric of Crossley (Harry Von Gorkum) . The young boy suddenly encounters himself the only companion who can save the kingdom and then his dreams come true , as he soon to be become a beloved hero . Meantime , in the monastery appears a Chinese young girl (Figueroa) and Master Kwan (Henry O). <br><br>This is a lack-luster and short-budget sequel made for direct to video and TV . Unlikely premise from the first part to be continued in a similar plot , there is also a last dragon and a young knight that dreams of becoming a brave knight in shining armor and both inspire the people to fight for their freedom and taking on a tyrannical villain . The film contains agreeable performances and is compromised by borrowing elements from original film , as footage from the prior movie is used . In fact , the scene where Drake destroys the windmill in flames by accident is partly re-utilized from ¨Dragonheart¨. It is entertaining and fun but with mediocre computer generator special effects bringing the dragon to life . The movie was produced in a few money by Raffaella De Laurentiis (Dino's daughter) . Musical score by Mckenzie is ripped off from excellent , memorable soundtrack by Randy Edelman . The motion picture was regularly directed by an usual television movies director , Doug Lefler (The last legion) . It's a familiar film but is specially appointed to kids .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"Nostalgic, but mostly for the kids","rating":6,"date":"19 April 2012","review":"I was saddened by such a low score on this film when I looked it up. Obviously it doesn't hold a finger to the original, but it's not terrible. I've seen much worse. <br><br>I saw this when I was 11 or 12 and really enjoyed it. I was at the time (and still am) a huge fan of the first film. I felt this one wasn't trying to match it though but more or less show the story to a much younger audience. <br><br>The acting was decent over all, not anything special but not terrible. I liked Chris Masterson as a young orphaned stable boy. As a kid I could relate to him because of his desire to fight and become a knight but not being able to. <br><br>Over all the effects are not great, but it was basically done on a TV budget. The dialog wasn't really that good, but it didn't bother me like other films have.<br><br>I think this is a great companion to the first one in the fact that it can re illustrate the power of kindness and love to children. Don't expect the original film, but sit down with your children and have some fun with them!","user":"colvinsart","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Not nearly as good as Dragonheart, but an ok film.","rating":6,"date":"10 June 2002","review":"I can definitely say \"Dragonheart: A New Beginning\" is a kid's movie.  I'm REALLY shocked that this film even got made, not because it was that bad or anything, but I just can't imagine that there is much of a demand for this kind of movie.  But, I guess it got made somehow.  There are a some cool things in this film, but nothing really great.<br><br>You can't talk about this movie without mentioning the special effects because the whole movie is a special effect.  The Dragon looked ok, but quite cartoony at times.  The special effects in the first installment blow away the special effects in this one, but they're still kind of cool at times.<br><br>The story is ok, but again, nothing spectacular.  The story is a little thin, but for a kid's movie that's kind of typical.  The characters aren't anything terribly interesting or great, but they're cool I guess.  I had never heard of any of the actors, but they all seemed to do an ok job.<br><br>All in all, this is an ok film, but definitely not anything to go out of your way to see.  If you REALLY liked \"Dragonheart\", then you'll probably want to see this film.  But even then, it depends on WHY you liked \"Dragonheart\", if you liked the film for it's incredible special effects only, then you probably won't like \"Dragonheart: A New Beginning\".  On the other hand if you liked \"Dragonheart\" for it's story, then you may like this film.  Anyhow, I hope you like the film, and thanks for reading,<br><br>-Chris","user":"LebowskiT1000","rank":[5,6]}]
