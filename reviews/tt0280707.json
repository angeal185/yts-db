[{"title":"Right said Bob!","rating":23,"date":"23 May 2003","review":"Robert Altman's long, fragmented and very hit-or-miss career reaches another of his periodic highs with this clever and beautifully realised dissection of the English class system and skit on the classic Agatha Christie whonunnit.<br><br>Altman's preferences for kaleidoscopic social observation has sometimes failed in the past due to the weight of its own ambition: multi-plotted and multi-charactered snapshots of time and place held together by loose ties or a general thematic framework. Sometimes it pays off spectacularly (Nashville); sometimes it flatters to deceive (Short Cuts).<br><br>It works well here due to the necessary discipline of the single location and the greater opportunities for interaction among the characters this affords. Add to that an exemplary cast of (mostly) British character actors and a knowing script by Julian Fellowes that gives Altman's keenly observant camera plenty of time to make its own points.<br><br>Rightly, Altman is less concerned with the murder mystery, which is almost an aside, than with the opportunity given by a shooting party at a 1930s stately mansion to observe the English aristocracy and their servants in social interaction.<br><br>Never happier than when involved in a bit of human anthropology, Altman lightly dissects the complexities and hierarchies which go on both above and below stairs; in which many subtle and unsubtle rituals are played out among groups of people who clearly dislike each other but are forced through circumstance, need or employment to observe the fundamental social practices required.<br><br>1932 is also a time of intruding change into the nature of the old English ruling classes, slowly disintegrating in this between-wars period and, in this case, largely reliant on the wealth of one particularly reluctant patron to keep them in furs and flunkies. In on this act comes the (to them) faintly odious whiff of 20th century new money, represented by Hollywood and popular culture. These intruders are kept in their place, but the message is clear - change is coming, and coming fast.<br><br>The muted colours and autumnal setting continue this theme of a world in terminal decline and of a group of characters keenly conscious of place and tradition yet also wearied and exhausted by it. Only at the very end, when fundamental change has occurred and many characters are left to face up to very different destinies do we see a bit of sunshine creeping in, heralding the dawn of a new era.<br><br>The cast are all excellent, with special mention deserving of Maggie Smith's effortless scene stealing as a bitchy but broke old Countess; the ever reliable Jeremy Northam as matinee idol Ivor Novello, well aware of his place in the great scheme of things and young Kelly Macdonald in the pivotal role of Smith's harassed maid who's inquisitiveness rattles a whole load of family skeletons.","user":"oldreekie546","rank":[182,215]},{"title":"Good Work, as usual...","rating":7,"date":"7 January 2002","review":"When Robert Altman makes a new film, it's always a noteworthy event that gets the attention of critics and audiences alike: large productions with huge ensemble casts of major Hollywood movie stars, playing real people with full, fleshed out characters, each with their own subplots that intertwine only subtly, until the end when it all finally makes sense. In Gosford Park, Altman makes only two changes to this formula: Hollywood stars are replaced by Top British talent that may be unfamiliar to most American audiences, and a straightforward murder mystery supplants his traditionally complicated plot line. It is in these changes, however, where Altman charms his audiences in a new way. The story takes place in 1932 at a gathering of aristocrats and their servants for a hunting country weekend at the estate of Sir William McCordle. Some time after all the guests are settled in and whose affairs begin to intertwine, one of them is bumped off. While all the characters are well fleshed out, it's Mary, played by Kelly Macdonald, who is the focus of the drama. She's the maid of Maggie Smith's Countess Constance of Trentham, and is being groomed to follow a path to become head servant. After the murder takes place, emotions unfold and secrets from the past are revealed that help the characters - and the audience - solve the mystery. The drama is even more punctuated when Mary's innocence and naivet√© is lost as she pieces together the deeper scandal, involving servant-master sexual relations and bastard children.<br><br>One of the best aspects of film is how it illustrates that fine line dividing the master-servant social structures, and how often that line is crossed, reminding us that life is just a game of costumes and masks, and we're all the same underneath. While the story was reminiscent of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians, where it's the mystery that captivates the audience, Altman goes beyond the mystery with Gosford Park by using the murder as a vehicle to draw attention to the human condition and class hierarchy.<br><br>On the downside, but to no surprise to fans of Altman's work, the movie is often hard to follow. His style of filmmaking involves entanglements of characters and subplots that don't appear to have much to do with one another at first blush, and Gosford Park takes this to the next level. Here, the murder takes place at the climax of this confusion, leaving you rather disoriented in the middle of the 2-hour-plus drama. Fortunately, the tone loosens up when a comedy-dim police inspector basically gets nowhere in his investigation, but the pieces start coming together through the other characters. The good news is that it all seems to come together in the end in a way that didn't require grasping every detail of every scene.<br><br>Despite its intricacies and confusing moments, there is so much more to Gosford Park that makes it interesting and enchanting. While it is clearly a sophisticated piece of film work with impeccable acting, directing and design, don't stress about not keeping up with it all the time. Sit back and take it in, and you'll feel satisfied in the end.","user":"argv","rank":[116,137]},{"title":"A review of a great film","rating":28,"date":"28 February 2002","review":"Violence, mystery, sex, and murder, Gosford Park has it all.  Director Robert Altman once again takes the Hollywood formula and gives a unique twist.  The story begins when aristocrats during 1932 gather at Sir William McCordle's (Michael Gambon) estate for a shooting party.  The guests are wealthy people with their trusty servants.  People arrive at the McCordle estate two by two and the traditions begin.  The servants set up dinner for their masters and the aristocrats begin their personal routines.<br><br> The story moves on as the characters begin to establish their names and the audience learns their varying social status.  The intertwining stories among the guests begin to surface and the audience begins to realize there is much more in this house than what meets the eye.<br><br>During the night one member of the elite group is killed.  None of the guests seemed to be fazed by this event and are only upset by the inconvenience it sets up for their lives.<br><br>The only one troubled is Constance, Countess of Trentham's maid, Mary (Kelly McDonald).  The story begins to focus on Mary, who discovers secrets among the visitors and leads the audience to solve the mystery.<br><br>The great aspect about this film is Robert Altman's abilities to bring the past to life.  He pays excellent attention to detail and is able to recreate the feelings and morals during the time period.  He emerges the audience into a film world filled with history and story.  Throughout the film Altman visually shows the audience the contrast between social classes through his various shots, lighting techniques, and camera filters.  His fluid camera movements visually portray foreshadowing and relationship among characters. These elements give the audience a complete understanding of the mood and atmosphere in the film.<br><br>I recommend this movie to anybody who has the patience to sit and focus on this excellent film.  Although the beginning is appropriately slow moving and the characters names are difficult to remember, the payoff is worth the efforts.  This movie is made for active film viewers and all Robert Altman fans.","user":"Mezzotint91","rank":[111,133]}]
