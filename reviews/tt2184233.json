[{"title":"Authentic and beautiful","rating":10,"date":"9 April 2017","review":"'1 Mile to you' tells the story of a young man who loses his friends in a bus accident and his journey to recovery after the event. Graham Rogers, Billy Crudup and the entire cast are outstanding and give wonderfully compelling and honest performances. So moving and brought me and the entire family to tears. The cinematography is outstanding (Gary Shaw who shot 'Moon' by Duncan Jones). Music by Paul Doucette (Member of the the band 'Matchbox 20') is amazing. Loved the music. This is not a film for the jaded or if your looking for something dark and ironic (Ie; the LATImes review calling it cluttered WHICH IT IS NOT). <br><br>'Run' to the theater!","user":"treebranch","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"delicate and profound","rating":10,"date":"9 April 2017","review":"What a great movie! brought me to tears. Kevin's painful journey is one that anyone can relate to. Its about overcoming the death of your beloved ones and keep rowing the boat. or running with your heart...:-) Billy Crudup's performance is outstanding. Its a tender movie that will also make you laugh. Highly recommend!","user":"tatiana-roza","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"A really good film overall","rating":8,"date":"19 July 2017","review":"This is a really good film. Strong narrative, decent acting performances, likable and relatable characters, and decent production quality. 1 Mile to You joins a large number of films that combine a teen romance theme with a heartbreaking story, and this movie is one of the better examples despite its generally simpler narrative. If you're looking for something light and heartwarming, this film is an ideal choice for you.","user":"me-589-145643","rank":[10,12]}]
