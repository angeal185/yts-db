[{"title":"The Witch : Part 1","rating":9,"date":"3 February 2020","review":"An often mesmerizing, occasionally kooky but thoroughly entertaining thriller.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[45,47]},{"title":"Brilliant Acting From a Rookie Actress and More","rating":9,"date":"3 July 2018","review":"Make no mistake, this movie's theme is thriller, not horror. And as such, this movie was suspenseful with plenty of twists and turns to entice the audience. However, the most brilliant factor about this movie was the amazing acting from both the main protagonist (played by Da-Mi Kim) and her best friend (played by Min-Si Go). Although others shined in certain areas as well, these two actresses were absolutely phenomenal, especially considering the notion that Da-Mi Kim is still considered as a rookie who recently started her official career. This movie is only the first part of a series that is to come and may be one of the biggest hits in Korea yet.","user":"mrchurick","rank":[47,63]},{"title":"Brilliant","rating":8,"date":"7 November 2019","review":"Action 4.5/5\nDrama 3/5\nPlot 3.5/5\nSuspens 3.5/5\nWell entertainer","user":"sifat_islam","rank":[9,10]}]
