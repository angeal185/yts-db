[{"title":"Mediocre at best","rating":4,"date":"8 September 2019","review":"It is sometimes hard to pinpoint where exactly films fail, the cinematography wasn't bad and you can definitely see that Kristen Stewart tried, but everything else about this film was below mediocre. Characters were one dimensional and lacked any depth, plot development, from the very moment the two main characters meet and then meet again, was abrupt and unbelievable. The other main characters - the good FBI agent vs. the bad one, were just as shallow. Not to mention the wives, whose role never went anywhere and might have as well not been in this film at all.<br><br>In the end, it simply wasn't interesting to watch and that is something no amount of blank long gazes and gratuitous nudity can fix.<br><br>If you haven't yet, do yourself a favor and watch 'The Lives of Others', a 2006 German film that shares a similar theme but actually does it justice.","user":"ArtistGrl","rank":[83,107]},{"title":"Real Life Story Deserved Better","rating":4,"date":"10 March 2020","review":"Jean Seberg's real life story is full of twists and turns and things that can be applied to things happening in 2020. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't separate itself from the pack and become anything fresh or original. And it feels like you can contribute some of the fault to the directing choices made by Benedict Andrews. The film never felt as engaging as the subject matter calls for. Seberg is deserving of a movie based on her life, but this certainly wasn't it.<br><br>4.8/10","user":"ThomasDrufke","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Should be called The FBI Story","rating":3,"date":"15 January 2020","review":"This has to be one of the poorest biopic that I have seen.Having read the biography Played Out I was hoping for a book that would reflect the tragic life of Jean Seberg.Alas no.What we get is a film which concentrates on harassment by the GNU and almost excludes Seberg.","user":"malcolmgsw","rank":[28,35]}]
