[{"title":"An enjoyable and funny movie","rating":9,"date":"10 August 1999","review":"Thunder and Lightning is an interesting movie, it's an action movie with a plot! The characters actually have reasons to do what they do. David Carradine stars as a bootlegger and Kate Jackson is his fiancee. Her father is a soft-drink manufacturer who is secretly making and distributing large quantities of moonshine. The conflict starts when her father's goons decide to close down Carradine's operation. It is pretty much an adventure comedy from then on, with lots of car chases, fights, banjo music, rednecks, hillbillies and moonshine. Watch for the gator-wrestling church!","user":"beable","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"A whole lot of good'n'giddy goofball 70's Southern-fried car chase fun","rating":8,"date":"19 January 2006","review":"David Carradine, sporting an earring and a short, severely cropped coiffure which makes him resemble a rough trade Greenwhich Village gay leatherbar regular, is his customary lean, laconic, stoical, stubbornly nonconformist self as Harley, a fiercely independent and self-reliant moonshine runner who locks horns with fat, odious slimeball rival Hunnicutt (a broadly mugging hunk of overripe ham by Roger C. Carmel) over who has exclusive dibs on a lucrative Florida illegal whiskey business. Naturally, there are further complications; Harley's fretful, peevish'n'pettish steady girlfriend (comely brunette Kate Jackson, who looks like she just sashayed off the set of \"Charlie's Angels\") just happens to be Hunnicutt's firebrand daughter, two bickering, bumbling New York mafia hit men are trying to rub out Hunnicutt, and Harley has to intercept a shipment of poisonous rotgut before the driver makes a potentially lethal delivery. Directed with workmanlike efficiency by Corey Allen, bookended by a rousing air-boat chase at the beginning and a similarly stirring extended car chase in the last reel, with Andy Stein's sprightly bluegrass score and James Pergola's sunny, golden-hued cinematography adding additional spice to the already tasty mix, this affably lightweight drive-in item certainly hits the satisfying spot somethin' solid. Moreover, the dense, marshy Everglades swamp locations are suitably picturesque, the pace clips along at a speedy rate, there's a smattering of nudity, everybody talks with extremely thick'n'heavy drawling good ol' boy Southern accents, Pat Cranshaw and Sterling Holloway are very funny and engaging as a pair of amiable old fuddy dud moonshine makers, and late, great crime novelist Charles Willeford has a nice cameo as a shady, shifty bartender. Better still, the flick overall offers a cheery, good-natured, basically harmless and entertaining celebration of that quintessentially 70's grind-house anti-hero: the carefree, firmly individualistic and autonomous \"I just wanna do my own thing\" uncompromisingly free-spirited loner. Best scene: Carradine uses his patented martial arts prowess to beat the living tar out of scruffy, bellicose cracker Charles Napier, which prompts Napier to snarl the following deathless zinger: \"Hey a**hole, knock off that kung fu s**t!\" Fun stuff.","user":"Woodyanders","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Doesn't have the commercial appeal of \"Smokey and the Bandit\", though the leads are game...","rating":3,"date":"3 June 2008","review":"Fatuous, witless, disappointing Southern moonshine adventure, with Kate Jackson as the daughter of a soda pop king and manufacturer of poisoned whiskey; she and thrill-seeking boyfriend David Carradine attempt to stop of shipment of the bad booze but run afoul of both the law and the moonshiner's shotgun-toting stooges. The redneck histrionics are shrill and labored, and the comedy relief is rather obvious (one of the better scenes has two hired killers bemoaning all the violence on TV, though it doesn't have the punch that better writing and directing might have given it). There are car crashes galore, two geezer brothers making whiskey in a swamp-land shack, an alligator wrasslin' preacher, and an ear-splitting soundtrack filled with hick music and squealing tires. Jackson and Carradine aren't bad, but they have next to nothing to work with; supporting cast includes some fine character actors, including a bearded, shaggy-haired Charles Napier, but they get stuck playing unfunny goons. Some of the best lines are delivered by the bit players, such as a garbage collector who points when he talks and a foreign delivery man who sings to himself on the job. *1/2 from ****","user":"moonspinner55","rank":[4,7]}]
