[{"title":"Delivers what they promote","rating":7,"date":"29 December 2018","review":"If you like raunchy B horror comedy then this is for you. This movie delivers exactly what they claim. It's fun and the quaility was actually better than I expected. It's not a family film by any means and i don't think they promote it that way. Made me feel young again. Great to see a movie that is the film makers true concept and not influenced by what's right, wrong or politically correct.","user":"lrussell-84512","rank":[19,26]},{"title":"A guaranteed good time!","rating":10,"date":"31 December 2018","review":"CherokeeCreek is an uproariously funny horror comedy about a bachelor party in the woods gone very very wrong. This independent horror flick takes cues from 80s classics such as Friday The 13th and Sleepaway Camp while adding A modern and hilarious twist. The special effects and gore were not only phenomenal for an independent film but were were on par if not better then but bigger budget films I've come across. You can tell this film was a passion project and everybody involved did an amazing job! Big Foot himself looks and sounds terrifying! If you love cheesy fun horror comedy like I know you horror nerds do then you need to check this out! It's one hell of a good time!","user":"tyler_baker1996","rank":[18,25]},{"title":"Why all the hate?","rating":10,"date":"6 January 2019","review":"Honestly, I'm confused as to when this movie is getting such poor reviews. It makes me question whether those people have actually watched it.<br><br>I'm not saying it's the greatest film ever made, but for an indie horror film, it delivers. I'm giving it 10 stars to make up for those reviews.<br><br>The quality and sound are great, effects are nice, and the acting (except for a couple of people) was really quite good.<br><br>It is definitely funny, a little over the top and well-written. It's an entertaining movie and a fun watch.","user":"ccam-46934","rank":[16,22]}]
