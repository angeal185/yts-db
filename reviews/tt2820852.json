[{"title":"One last ride - not a bad action flick i like it","rating":9,"date":"15 August 2017","review":"A really good movie and not a bad action movie I really like it, the whole gang is here. Fast Five (2011) is still to me the best one and my favorite in the franchise and then it would be Furious 6 than The Fast and the Furious I think this would be my fourth favorite film in the franchise. It is an entertaining fun fast paced action film and that really a good one. But it is not perfect I have issues with the film which I will get to it but first I want to write goods about this film.I can't wait till I watch The Fate of the Furious I am getting on Blu-ray next week so yesterday I re-watch this film and I have enjoy it. <br><br>Furious 7 is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the sixth highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide – more than the franchise's first five installments combined – making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released on April 14, 2017.<br><br>The film's about Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast &amp; Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. <br><br>The cast includes: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris \"Ludacris\" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. <br><br>I like this flick they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces. Kurt Russell is in this and like I have said in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 my review I hated his performance in that movie but in here I loved him he was awesome and a really good guy and likable. He has more to do in this film than he did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is always terrific and a bad-ass I absolutely love him. Jason Statham is a crazy motherf***** in this I have enjoyed him I always wanted Statham as a bad guy. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz Dom's girlfriend was hot as always I have simply enjoyed her. The rest of the cast was alright.<br><br>The issues with the film I have is: Why is shaky cam in the beginning of the fights between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham and on the end of the fights between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that really hurts this film. I got a migraine because of the shaking cam.<br><br>Dwayne Johnson was only in the beginning of the film and for the rest of the film he was departure he appeared only on the end of the film in the final showdown I only wish he would be more in this film and he would have more to do but I still have enjoyed his performance awesome. <br><br>Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto is useless in this movie she doesn't do nothing her character is just wasted and useless. I don't know why they put her character in this movie. Lucky Michelle Rodriguez fulfill the emptiness in Dom's crew. <br><br>Car's with flying parachutes also doesn't fit in the film because of the metal weight parachutes can't hold that kind of metal and some unnecessary CGI was used in this film that also hurt the movie. <br><br>Those are all the issues I have, I can't wait for The Fate of the Furious to see it I heard it is a good film.<br><br>The rating this film get's is a A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but those issues in my opinion hurt the film. <br><br>Paul Walker died in November 30 2013 so his two brothers Caleb and Cody Walker replaced him and they help to make this film right so I have enjoy from all three brothers performance. R.I.P. Paul Walker my favorite actor and my all time favorite character of the franchise Brian O'Conner. This film is dedicated to his memory which I love. <br><br>Furious 7 (alternatively known as Fast &amp; Furious 7 and Fast 7) is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan.

But, that movie has an important part and effect to the franchise. And now to the film, It was a full action flick alongside with a tear crying tribute to Paul Walker. From the first race of Leticia to the last scene between O'Connor and Toretto, It was one of the best movie in the franchise. The Core part of the story tells us about good ol' fashioned revenge combined with Speed of NOS and muscle. Deckard Shaw seeks out his kind of style revenge which pulls Toretto and his family into Shaw's world.And so, he combine forces Mr. Nobody to complete a mission for him and in return gets Deckerd Shaw. What happens afterwards, is your's to see. The performance of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is fantastic. From the Screenplay to their actions, their brother 2 brother relationship was amazing. Michelle Rodriguez played her principal cast perfectly. She had done homework in her fighting and she looks gorgeous as always. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson played their respective roles well and their chemistry for humor doesn't cease to amaze at most of the times. Rock and Tony Jaa and other's also played their part to their maximum. But Elsa Pataky wasn't given that much to her role. She was a like a cameo appearance but it wasn't that much necessary to include in the whole movie. The graphics and stunts was nearly mind blowing except that the CGI work done for Paul is notable at some times. But, it wasn't that much drawback for the movie as he played his part well and his brother's completed the work he is done. The franchise might have losen a big cast, but it manages to keep the film to the edge of the seat climax. The tribute given by Vin Diesel for him is absolutely superb. It was very touching when he said,\"It's never Goodbye\" and when they separate in cross roads, it was really amazing to give such an tribute to Paul Walker.<br><br>Overall, as the franchise keeps promising its Action and Adrenaline, it manages to keep it together even though they lost Paul Walker. A must see for everyone. Try it in a cinema and your money's value will be nicely spent for a good entertainment.","user":"ritheshk555","rank":[75,84]},{"title":"It was a good movie","rating":30,"date":"30 April 2015","review":"The movie was a very action packed film it had a lot going on almost at all times which really grabs your attention and other people attention. I would rate it a 8 out of 10 because it was a very good movie, also the director of the movie is a good one. He uses short cuts so then he can get all of the action in. You can't have long cuts with action packed movies because it's very hard to do. My favorite part of the movie would have to be when they were driving through all the buildings because it is something that is highly unlikely but still looks very cool. It's shows how much balls the guys driving the cars have and how bad ass they are. They chose very good actors for the characters because you can't have someone that looks wimpy driving through buildings and racing cars. They chose Dom because he is big and muscular which Is good. But overall the move fast and the furious 7 was a very good movie and very action packed.","user":"eduardoskelly-252-683387","rank":[68,76]}]
