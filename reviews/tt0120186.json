[{"title":"Actually, pretty good","rating":6,"date":"28 January 2005","review":"Body Count is about a group of guys who attempt to rob an art gallery, but their plan backfires and one of their gang winds up with a broken neck. It stars the likes of David Caruso (better known for his TV roles in CSI: Miami and NYPD Blue), John Leguizamo (Romeo &amp; Juliet, Moulin Rouge) and Forrest Whitaker (Panic Room, Phone Booth). It has a very unoriginal plot, is obviously heavily influenced by Reservoir Dogs (which is so great, that you wonder why people would even bother try to copy it), and the fact that it stars David Caruso who is notorious for his failure with trying to do decent movies, indicate that it is NOT very good. However, despite it unoriginality and choice of lead, Body Count is deserving of a look in. It has garnered a lot of bad reviews, but it is actually rather entertaining. I came across it when it came on the TV one time. At first I thought it was an episode of CSI: Miami, but it soon became apparent that it wasn't when who I thought was Horatio started attacking people. Upon realising it was in fact a movie and not an episode of CSI, I did watch it all the way through and though \"Reservoir Dogs rip off\" did enter my mind, the movie was entertaining and watchable. Don't bother buy it, but if you see it on video at a friends house, or it comes on the TV sometime, do sit down and watch it. It is pretty good.","user":"blonde_ambition","rank":[25,34]},{"title":"Blatantly derivative crime flick.","rating":5,"date":"31 October 2003","review":"\"Body Count\" copies \"Reservoir Dogs\" so closely that it's a wonder Tarantino didn't sue its makers (or maybe he was simply flattered). The plot (concerning the aftermath of a daring art museum heist, which we only see in flashbacks), the irrelevant/\"philosophical\" dialogue, the violent, constantly sparring partners-in-crime....NOTHING is fresh in this movie, everything feels forced, tired and second-hand. The characters are extraordinarily stupid; they are supposed to be these big-shot criminals but they behave in the most unprofessional manner possible, doing everything they can to screw up their own plans. Still, the film is not unwatchable; John Lequizamo does a good job of playing a complete sleazebag, and there are a couple of twists at the end. As for the rest of the cast, Ving Rhames keeps his dignity but the great Forest Whitaker is wasted and David Caruso and (especially) Linda Fiorentino are awful.

This one could've been a success - if anyone outside the festival circle would've been aware it even existed. BODY COUNT has a great cast, some nice twists, and generally a zany, well-paced script. It's a matured RESERVOIR DOGS, with less pop-cultural chit-chat and more substance to the plot. Check it out, you might be positively surprised.","user":"EnvyYouProductions","rank":[11,16]}]
