[{"title":"Best movie I've seen in years deserves a very High Rating","rating":10,"date":"7 March 2012","review":"Top Movie and well deserved as well , This was just an exceptional movie and Brendan Gleeson once again superb he just keeps getting better and better . This was one roller-coaster of a movie and very much emotional and no it was not boring at all only someone that has very limited intelligence and that knows nothing whatsoever about horse racing would say it was a boring movie .<br><br>I am really glad i didn't pay any attention to the miss-guided and hopeless reviews that some peeps wrote here about this movie as they were so inaccurate and false its incredible . <br><br>Its been many years since i watched a real genuine top class movie like this one , THE Cup 2011 and all actors played their part fantastic and an excellent True story-line which we just don't see enuff of these days and no daft special effects and far fetched garbage this is just a pure good movie with excellent Actors and a fantastic end which made this movie very special indeed .<br><br>i give this 10/10 Rating and very much advise anyone to sit down and watch it even if your not a massive horse racing fan its still gonna be well worth watching you wont be sorry so forget the negative clueless peeps that failed to give this the positive Review it deserves and go watch it and you'll remember this for a long time to come because it could well be many more years before another movie comes along thats anywhere as good as this one was .","user":"barneyharvey1","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"The Cup","rating":9,"date":"11 March 2012","review":"Excellent Film, Recommended for Horse Racing Fans as is based on true events, Gets you en-thrilled with the action, Hopefully there will be other films done Similar to this on some of the UK's main Races such as the Grand National, Epsom Derby, Cheltenham Gold Cup etc.<br><br>Simiarilities to this film are Secretriat, which is nowhere near as realistic as The Cup, I thought Brendon Gleeson Did a excellent job playing the trainer Dermot Weld. To improve this film the only thing I think they could of done to improve it is have the Jockey's played by themselves.<br><br>As mentioned at the start though, a brilliant film to watch for all horse racing lovers, whether thats owners, trainers, jockey's or backers.","user":"peoplesno1","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"A very entertaining true horse racing movie that can stand side by side with \"Seabiscuit\". Very much worth seeing. I say B+","rating":8,"date":"13 September 2012","review":"\"Remember anything can happen, it's the Melbourne Cup.\" This is a movie based on the true story of the 2002 Melbourne Cup horse race in Australia. After winning the best jockey award for the 4th year in a row Damien Oliver (Curry) surprises everyone, including his brother in announcing he will race for the hated Irish trainer Dermot Weld (Gleeson). After tragedy strikes during the qualifying races for the cup Damien must decide if racing is still for him and if he can regain the spark. I may have to rethink the way I feel about certain movies. I was not interested in seeing \"Seabiscuit\" because it was about horse racing and I really enjoyed that movie. I was still not looking forward to \"Secretariat\" and that movie blew me away with how good it was. For the third time I was really reluctant to see this movie and again I was shocked at how good it was. The movie is pretty cheesy in parts and even the tragedies are kind of glossed over but this is still very much worth watching. Whether you are a horse racing fan or not this is still a very good movie that is very entertaining and a very good watch. I highly recommend this. Overall, pretty cheesy and acting is iffy at best but the fact that this is a true story helps overcome those short-comings and makes it very much worth watching. I give it a B+.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[4,4]}]
