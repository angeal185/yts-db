[{"title":"Underappreciated movie from Wes Craven.","rating":10,"date":"16 August 2018","review":"\"Vampire in Brooklyn\" is probably one of Wes Craven's most underappreciated movies, and that for some weird reasons.\n<ul><li>Eddie Murphy and Angela Bassett are great together and really got a great chemistry (cf: the dance scene)</li><li>It got some chilling moments (Rita's dreams, Nikki's death, the final...)</li><li>The musical score from Craven's old collaborator, J Peter Robinson, is great.</li><li>The humor especially from John Witherspoon and Kadeem Hardison are hilarious.</li><li>ANGELA BASSETT ! OH MY GOD ! ANGELA BASSETT ! She's the best on that movie.</li></ul>I think the movie is entertaining movie. It's not Craven's best for sure but it's probably one of his most fun.","user":"air-man77","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"Not The Travesty Some Claim","rating":6,"date":"24 July 2014","review":"Maximillian (Eddie Murphy) is the only survivor from a race of vampires on a Caribbean Island, and as a vampire, he must find a mate to keep the line from ending.<br><br>Some have said this film is the worst for Murphy and for Wes Craven, with Murphy saying the wig he had to wear was a big part of the problem. Now, looking back almost twenty years later, the wig does not look bad, and this was far from rock bottom for Murphy. For Craven, it may not be his strongest film, but it may also not be his worst (\"Cursed\" is pretty bad).<br><br>Seriously, this is not that bad of a film, even if the humor never hits exactly right.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"Not for today's society","rating":10,"date":"5 May 2018","review":"This movie is not a vampire movie. It's a movie about human behavior, religious hypocrisy, animal behavior, social issues, and difficult choices. I don't feel it will translate well to today's expectations. This is one of my favorite movies.","user":"donancricchiasaverio","rank":[17,19]}]
