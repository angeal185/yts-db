[{"title":"For what it is, actually pretty good.","rating":8,"date":"28 September 2011","review":"I don't recall seeing a movie like this in a good, long time. It's a macho-action-thriller that didn't have an A-list budget, but probably didn't really need it, either. You used to see more of this back in the 70s and 80s; these days this kind of movie usually has a much bigger budget, with the requisite special effects and massive action sequences such a budget buys. Here, though, it's a little different.<br><br>Good action, intriguing setup (definitely no good-guy/bad-guy here; nobody is completely innocent by any stretch), and pretty good characters. And a story that's somewhat better than you usually find in this particular kind of film.<br><br>Don't know that Jason Statham's a great actor, exactly, but he's definitely a presence and he's got others to do the acting around him, and he performs in a several action scenes that come right up to the edge without getting silly. And I liked the basic plausibility in most of the scenes.<br><br>I'm a guy, and Killer Elite is a pretty decent \"guy\" movie. You could do worse.","user":"Thunderbuck","rank":[148,196]},{"title":"Much better than I expected; excellent pacing","rating":8,"date":"15 January 2012","review":"Decent acting from the supporting cast, an interesting story that is thankfully absent any clich√©s, and a lack of any \"gotcha\" in the story certainly help this movie stand out. But really it's the pacing that made it for me. Things happen FAST. They happen logically, and reasonably (well, reasonably given the nature of the story) but they happen quickly. The movie does not have any periods of introspection for our main characters. It suggests that they are having those moments, but doesn't linger on them or play them up at all; they are just facts, like everything else that happens in the movie (fights, deaths, kidnappings, etc.).<br><br>The story is complicated, involving at least 5 separately motivated factions, but at no time was it confusing (so there was no need for an \"aha!\" moment).<br><br>The fight scenes were all exceedingly well choreographed and fit the story so well that there was never a time when 2 people were facing off just so we could see them fight; I really appreciated that.<br><br>All in all, a very satisfying film: lots of action, lots of very good acting, and lots of attention to detail (it really looked like it was the early 1980s).<br><br>I was going to give this a 7/10, but as I was writing and thinking about it, I upped it to 8/10.","user":"snowboarderbo","rank":[55,70]},{"title":"The title says it all...","rating":10,"date":"26 September 2011","review":"I'm baffled by some of the reviews I've seen of this film. I saw it this weekend and think it's really strong. Clive Owen and Jason Statham are both excellent as... elite killers. The action is great, the story is intricate and watching the plot unfold is just fun. You've got a group of mercenaries on a dubious mission, a group of ex-SAS stumbles on to them and then both sides are trying to figure out who the other guys are and what they're up to. Maybe it throws some people that there are no clear cut good guys and bad guys here. Both sides are essentially bad guys acting out of a questionable sense of what is right. But that's what made it interesting to me.<br><br>The film is at it's best when Owen and Statham are on screen together either coming after each other, fighting or staring each other down. Add a gun wielding, ass kicking De Niro into the mix and I'm happy sitting in a dark theater and munching popcorn.","user":"mewperry","rank":[149,218]}]
