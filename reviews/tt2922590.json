[{"title":"I have the honor to be the first reviewer that absolutely hates it","rating":1,"date":"12 April 2018","review":"Well apparently I have the honor to be the first one to review this movie. I got tricked into watching Sangue Del Mio Sangue by the ratings it got. It wasn't too bad of a score so I thought it would be interesting to watch. But it's quite the opposite. It's a bad movie, with an extremely weak story, full of plot holes, going nowhere, an absolute time waster. The first part is about some catholics doing their absurd things because they want to prove something that doesn't even need proof. Very boring to watch, and that's not even because I'm a convinced atheist, but more because the story is so weak. The acting is sometimes pretty mediocre as well. But the major letdown is absolutely the story. You'll have to ask the director what he wanted to show as a story because I still don't get it and I did my really best to stay concentrating while hoping this nightmare of a movie would end as fast as possible. Why people spend money making stupid movies like this one will always remain a mystery to me.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[8,20]}]
