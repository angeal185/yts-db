[{"title":"Trailer","rating":7,"date":"1 November 2014","review":"The movie is a good movie but thought I should mention this for the people who has made the trailer for this movie. <br><br>well, first you should put a spoiler alert at the beginning of the trailer because the whole movie is in this trailer. First of all the trailer shouldn't reveal who is the real villain here. I was watching the trailer and I felt sorry for watching it because after watching it I knew what's going on in the movie. This is not the first movie to use this concept, so it wasn't so hard for someone to figure it out after watching this trailer. I really wish if I didn't watch the trailer. :( so, that;s pretty much it and thought worth mentioning anyway...","user":"EragonOrigins","rank":[144,168]},{"title":"Highly underrated movie, surprisingly smart and will keep you wanting more","rating":9,"date":"8 December 2014","review":"I only watched this movie because it had the word \"Asylum\" in the title (Honestly - I just hoped it would have some Arkham Asylum type crazies in it). I did not have high expectations when I started watching this movie... <br><br>Was I pleasantly surprised - it was a GREAT movie and I almost wanted to watch it again. I liked the characters and their stories, the setting as well as well as the plot twist at the end. <br><br>I must however point out that the fact that the movie description/summary I read contained a key spoiler - this did not spoil the movie for me, but I would have enjoyed the film even more had I not known certain details. <br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed this fantastic movie and I was a little bit sad when it ended.","user":"mbarnard-smini","rank":[50,61]},{"title":"Brilliant!","rating":8,"date":"30 October 2014","review":"Had a great time watching this movie. I'm not a fan of 'old time-y' films but this was a good watch. The story was so that it kept my interest as I kept wondering where it was going to go with all this and I felt at one point it would turn out a bit clich√©. I was wrong, and never bored getting from one scene to the next. I recommend it but I can't say much more other than I liked the cast (Don't want to spoil it). Great actors/actresses.<br><br>I wondered what Kate Beckinsale was doing in such a film but then it all became clear, she did great, looked great. Micheal Caine, Brendan Gleeson, Ben Kingsley and even David Thewlis were all wonderful. It was my first time encountering Jim Sturgess in any film but he did a great job too, I mean, everyone was right at the top of their game.<br><br>The movie is not fast on its feet and contains little action but it makes up for it all with a well told and engaging story. Plenty of suspense.<br><br>Overall: I highly recommend it. Maybe not a 'must watch' but after you see it, you'll be glad you didn't miss it. Great ending too.","user":"pjr235","rank":[109,140]}]
