[{"title":"lacking thrills","rating":6,"date":"1 March 2019","review":"Greetings again from the darkness. I pity the poor soul who, based on the film's title, buys a ticket assuming it must be a light-hearted romantic-comedy starring Katherine Heigl. While we do watch a slow-building romance, this is much more of a road trip through parts of the world we don't usually see on screen. Writer-Director Michael Winterbottom (A MIGHTY HEART, THE KILLER INSIDE ME, THE TRIP) has had a solid career with movies that tend to be quite watchable, though not particularly memorable. Chalk up another.<br><br>The film opens in a subdued manner with a man (Dev Patel) meticulously packing a suitcase, boarding a plane, landing in Pakistan and renting a car. These are all things any of us might do if headed to a wedding. Only this mysterious man of few words also buys 2 guns, plastic ties and duct tape. Either this is going to be a honeymoon unlike any other, or he's on a different mission altogether. We don't have to wait long, as the night before the wedding, Patel sneaks past the armed security guard and into the family compound so that he can kidnap Samira (Radhika Apte), the bride-to-be.<br><br>Mr. Patel plays a British Muslim man with various names and identities, and a supply of passports. He was hired by a shifty rich guy (Jim Sarbh) who loves Samira to prevent her from going through with the arranged marriage. The meet up gets delayed as the kidnapping and fallout make national news. The story evolves into a predictable and familiar road trip, but with a delightfully different setting and backdrop than what we are accustomed to. A train to Delhi plays a role with Samira and her kidnapper on the lam - working to remain anonymous.<br><br>The film does offer up some twists and turns for us, but after an intriguing first 15 minutes, we pretty much know where things are headed. Fortunately the camera work of Cinematographer Giles Nuttgens (HELL OR HIGH WATER) keeps our attention, as does the back and forth between Dev Patel and Radhika Apte, two excellent performers. So yes, the film is one we can enjoy watching, though it will likely never come up in conversation.","user":"ferguson-6","rank":[33,37]},{"title":"Promising beginning but the rest of the story is left to the viewer's imagination.","rating":5,"date":"18 March 2019","review":"I would like to give this movie a higher rating. Both of the leads are incredibly attractive, and good actors who created characters who quickly captured my interest. The settings gave me an satisfying dose of some aspects of Indian and Pakistani culture and day to day realities, and what it might be like to exist in that space as a moderately privileged person. The plot setup in the beginning 25 minutes or so was good, and I thought \"This might really go somewhere\". But it didn't. It just kind of sat there, and then ended.","user":"jundury","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"Good concept, good acting, terrible execution","rating":5,"date":"15 April 2019","review":"The Wedding Guest should have been an engaging and rock solid thriller like t was advertised to be (the trailer is arguably one of the best I've seen in awhile). Unfortunately, the movie was a huge slog and went on for way too long without really going anywhere or proving anything. Dev Patel was fantastic as always and the romance was great, but at what cost?<br><br>C-","user":"cgearheart","rank":[22,27]}]
