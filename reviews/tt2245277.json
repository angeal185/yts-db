[{"title":"A beautiful story about life,love and caring for others.","rating":9,"date":"16 November 2014","review":"This film was intriguing and the actors were very convincing. It appeals to all age groups; from assisted living to age 10 and up. Sunny and Butch aroused an interest as to what and how the film would end. The plot was carried out very well!! Would like to see more of the actors in another film. The relationship between Sunny and Cotton seems authentic and progressive as the situation would actually happen. One really feels for Cotton and wants to help resolve the situation. Jonathan Banks is always a treat and nice to see in a different role.The same with John C. McGinley as a completely different character. Butch and Cotton really click; you want to make everything all right for them. Very well written in that one did not know who was going to do what. Cotton's performance at the end brought tears to my eyes....very believable. Really liked the film a lot!!","user":"lucinda40942","rank":[10,16]},{"title":"not good by any extension of the word","rating":4,"date":"16 August 2015","review":"I figure I might as well review this since barely anyone else has. Here are my thoughts on the film. I'm not going to sugarcoat anything. Basically: it sucked. Not in an entertaining way, it's not overtly bad that you can laugh at it, it just kind of lumbers along and then stops. I know this is an independent, comparatively low-budget film, so I won't criticize the technical deficiencies (of which there are a few). I will simply attempt to make some sense of the film, or why the filmmakers decided to use such a leaden, humourless, and poorly written script. <br><br>Sunny is a failed actress who returns to her hometown to attend her mother's funeral and take care of the sister she never knew. There are other things that happen to people for reasons, but it's so poorly set up that there's no drama or tension. What a waste of Jonathan Banks! That guys a badass, but the script made him this meek pushover. <br><br>There is some \"comic relief\" in the film in the form of two fools in a bar who prattle away about nothing, but their clich√© banter is simply unfunny. <br><br>Conrad Goode plays Butch, a washed up football player who sits around all day writing crappy country songs. Goode also wrote the script, which perhaps explains how his character gets to bang someone half his age. <br><br>I can't really talk about the story as there is no real story. This would have been okay, had the acting and the dialogue been good. They weren't. <br><br>The worst part of the movie is an extremely half-baked subplot involving Sunny's ex- boyfriend from a long time ago. He gives her a job (hence a beautifully edited janitor montage), but then tries to rape her. She kicks him in the balls and shouts something like: \"If I see you again, I'll kill you!\". We never see him again. Ah, the wonders of plot arcs!<br><br>The one bright spot in this film is young Bailee Madison, who should fire her agent. Who else could be to blame for the string of mediocre to downright bad productions this talented actress has been in recently? Talk about wasted potential. <br><br>I didn't mince words here, but I can't recommend a film with such a bad script. It's deplorable that this got past the pre-production stage. It's a prime example of how most independent films are worse, not better, than major motion pictures. At least Hollywood delivers.","user":"PandoraProductions4","rank":[8,14]},{"title":"Waste of my Time","rating":2,"date":"13 February 2020","review":"A few stragglers with no jobs in a soon to be ghost town.\nThe only good thing going for this movie was Bailee Madison's wonderful performance and her predictable tears. It was a horrible story line.","user":"Toolmom5","rank":[0,0]}]
