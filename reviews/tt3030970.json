[{"title":"Utter waste of time","rating":1,"date":"21 May 2015","review":"Having no idea how the score got into the 3 area, I must say that when this film would have been made as a project in a film school, I would fail each and everyone involved. The plot doesn't have just holes, there is no plot! It is rarely a good idea, when the main actor is also the writer and director. It was supposed to fail from the start, and man it DID fail. From casting to acting to cutting and special effects, nothing gets even close to professionalism. Plan 9 from Outer Space was at least involuntarily funny, and is cult today. But our film here is just bad. I am sure that intentions were good, or else Mr Baard would not have made this film, but he is well advised to look for experienced people to realize his projects, if someone is willing to finance it. He needs a writer to get it from the idea to a story, something he did not manage; this made the film boring to watch from start to end. With the basic ingredient lacking, a really good director could have still made a halfway decent film, given enough liberty to stray from the script. But as the director was the writer, no such thing happened. The same good director could have told his lead cast how to play the role with more than just one face, but again the director is the main actor. So that 1 star is only given, as there is no negative vote.","user":"yehoshua-wittmer","rank":[19,19]},{"title":"Second worst movie i've ever seen!","rating":1,"date":"13 December 2015","review":"Wow, just, Woooow!!! This is a horrible movie! The acting is awfully horrible, the special effects are complete and utter crap, the plot ubber crappy and told in a bizarre confusing way that makes you question what happened when and where and from a movie with \"ninja\" in it's name you would expect at least the fights were good right? Nope! not by a loooooong shot! Worst fight scenes i remember seeing in my life! The only thing that aren't really really bad at this movie is the music that sometimes is even good(if you close your eyes and manage to ignore all the crappy horrible things happening at the screen), will there really be a sequel to this? really? Who the hell is funding this and why did Danny Glover agree to appear on this? Seriously, if you're lucky enough to read this before you watch it, please, for your own sake, DO NOT WATCH IT! It is not even weird enough to be funny, it's just a horrible waste of time!","user":"darkxpyder","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Really?!?!?!?","rating":1,"date":"1 May 2015","review":"DO NOT waste your time or money.<br><br>This is absolutely the worst acting that I have ever seen. This is absolutely the worst script ever turned into a movie. This movie has the hands-down worst special effects ever. I mean, I've seen better effects in cartoons.<br><br>This movie has made me question what is going on with the movie industry. My God, how did this ever even make it onto disc much less film?<br><br>It wouldn't have been so bad if it had been advertised as a comedy spoof. But, then again, maybe it would.<br><br>I want my $1.50 back.<br><br>Hey Danny, Really? What were you thinking? The only reason I rented it was because your name was headlined and I hadn't seen your acting in a while. I can only shake my head...","user":"ventime","rank":[23,26]}]
