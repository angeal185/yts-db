[{"title":"It is Intriguing","rating":7,"date":"18 August 2019","review":"Honestly, a lot, and I mean a LOT of nudity and drugs. It basically tells the story of a group of friends dealing with street life, as the party, and party but the effects lead them to descend into darkness, sadness and madness. This can be often complicated to show as people break in different ways. This film did a good job of showing it. It can be confusing but it is worth a watch.","user":"dcmackdon","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"My Review Of \"She's Just A Shadow\"","rating":5,"date":"10 October 2019","review":"The story is a blend of traditional underground crime thriller exploration of sub-culture and more experimental risque imagery circling tropes such as sexploitation and torture porn. There is heavy influences that permeate the film, most notably Tarantino and Stahelski. The synopsis and my initial description make \"She's Just A Shadow\" seem like a very exciting film. And given the cinematography and set design for a lot of the scenes, this movie has some cool moments. But...there are several flaws here.<br><br>First off, the story moves so freely that there is a feeling of \"lack of cohesion\" that makes it hard for any of the major plot points to sink in. The foundation starts to feel weak. It is a gritty and interesting story, and the setting and subject matter are pulp fiction candy tropes. Unfortunately there seemed to be more focus creating moments of extreme sensationalized tableauxs, than creating solid story continuity. Again, there is some really cool stuff happening in \"She's Just A Shadow\", unfortunately it all seems disjointed and more fitting to music videos and short film, arthouse pieces.<br><br>The acting is tight, the cast do a good job bring life to these characters, there just isn't enough written here for them to go on. Most of the characters are two-dimensional, weakly written \"shadows\". So much so that inorder to give them substance you really need to grab on to the film's title, and near hallucinatory asthetics and hold on for dear life. Something that helps equally with watching this one is the celebratory over-the-top display of violence and gore. There is plenty of blood flowing in \"She's Just A Shadow\". I just don't know if there's enough going on here to satisfy most film fans.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"Nudity & violence....","rating":10,"date":"9 September 2019","review":"....what's not to like?<br><br>The film has a Tarantino-esq quality.\nIt is well shot and well directed. The editing has a mildly artistic quality without being annoying.\nThe acting is realist which lends a good gritty feel under all the polish.<br><br>Definitely worth watching.","user":"srpnt","rank":[5,14]}]
