[{"title":"A great film, victim to negative people","rating":8,"date":"11 February 2003","review":"It seems to me like in today's film world, critics, whether it be Ebert or the viewers, are quick to down a film if it has a large budget.  I think Hoodlum fell victim to this epidemic.  With a bankroll of wonderful actors and actresses, and some of the best historical recreation of the locations, the movie delivers. The plot was simple, but it doesn't need to be complicated in a gangster flick like this.  It was based on real people, so the creators of the film cannot go ballistic on changing the story.  Maybe the 'critics' would like it better if it had a little green man who uses the force, or maybe a future crime prevention device.  Well, you won't find this here.  It's a wonderful, semi-true story about the way things were in Harlem and the surroundings areas back then.  Fishburn turned in a wonderful performance, and Roth played a great villian as he always does.  Just relax, and take it for what it's meant to be.  Entertainment.","user":"dynamicresolve","rank":[43,53]},{"title":"I Had Forgotten How Good This Movie Actually Is!!!!","rating":9,"date":"17 May 2007","review":"I had this movie on homemade VHS for a while and just received the DVD.<br><br>Mesmerizing!!! Beautifully Filmed! Hats off to Bill Duke - another very distinguished African-American director!! Once you get past the fact that the movie is FILLED with phenomenal performances from the likes of Laurence Fishburne, Andy Garcia, Tim Roth, Vanessa Williams. Queen Latifah, Loretta Devine, Clarence Williams III, and of course, Miss Cicely Tyson you also discover a gem of a movie.<br><br>It follows the exploits of a 30s Harlem gangster Bumpy Johnson. Fishburne reminds you of why he is such a charismatic actor. His performance here is one you can watch over and over again. Of course the movie may have been exaggerated but what movie isn't?! It is a very stylized presentation and the obvious attention to detail to create the look and the feel of the period help intensify the viewing experience.<br><br>I am quite proud of the production and highly recommend it become part of your movie collection. Notwitstanding that is a worthy project, there are treasures of performances here that warrant attention.","user":"RaiderJack","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"If you like Ol'G thirties style in color...Hoodlum is it!","rating":11,"date":"11 August 2003","review":"Hoodlum.....what can I say, if you had cool Grandparents that grew up in Harlem in the 1930's who liked to party, dress and play numbers then maybe you'd of heard some of the stories about the going ons in Harlem U.S.A. during that period. Numbers were literally the Black mans lottery back then and communication between runner and player no matter how small the amount played was the lug that connected dreams with hope for the little guy; Hoodlum is a story about the preservation of those hopes and dreams by a one Bumpy Johnson. The music, wardrobe and cinematography is superb, I highly recommend this tale of Harlem history.<br><br>Macheeste~","user":"Macheeste","rank":[21,26]}]
