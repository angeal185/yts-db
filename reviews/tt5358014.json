[{"title":"Modern day Resevoir Dogs","rating":10,"date":"16 October 2019","review":"Loved it. Lots of yelling, swearing, gunfights. Great acting, diverse too. Reminded me of Reservoir Dogs. If you like that, you'll like this.<br><br>Saw a few people commenting on the subtitles. Subtitles turned on automatically for me during the spanish parts. Told my brother, who's outside the United States, to watch the movie. He mentioned he had to manually turn on his subtitles. Just so you know.","user":"Bangerang11","rank":[9,14]},{"title":"A fun film out of the blue!","rating":9,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"Action suspense and good acting. Solid movie with set ups and pay offs that get you cheering for these thieves! Not too graphic a few more subtitles than I am used to but the acting covered that up for me. Worth a viewing and maybe two if you like to see the characters with the new Information you get throughout the film. No spoilers! Watch this before you watch a random episode of a TV show for sure.","user":"wirelessconsultant-90998","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"great","rating":9,"date":"19 October 2019","review":"Really good action film with a few laughs too.
