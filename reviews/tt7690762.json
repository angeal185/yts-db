[{"title":"Is The Price Too High","rating":6,"date":"5 February 2019","review":"The mother of a girl in a coma with little chance of survival, makes the decision to enter into a high stakes pact in an attempt to save her daughter's life. This is the basic plot.<br><br>Let's start with the positives. This film has a polished look to it, simply meaning that it doesn't look like it was cheaply made. The story is decent and the actors did a great job in their roles.<br><br>The negatives. This script could've used some work. The terms of the pact are never really explained well and we never got a good indication as to who the sinister miracle worker is. I didn't really understand the spider aspect. I didn't understand why they were showing up or exactly what they were meant to signify. This was marketed as a horror film but it was more like a dark drama with some supernatural elements.<br><br>I didn't think this was an awful film but it could've been much better.","user":"Foutainoflife","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"If you like supernatural Dramas/Thrillers.","rating":5,"date":"17 December 2018","review":"The first part is interesting but towards the end is more like a supernatural Drama, Thriller that does not have that amount of Horror as expected. Belén Rueda did a really good work here, the rest of the cast too. Of the aforementioned I liked more <a href=\"/title/tt7158686/\">No dormirás (2018)</a>.","user":"gimailito","rank":[8,13]},{"title":"Very Interesting...","rating":7,"date":"26 December 2018","review":"I cannot give harsh reviews to this movie bcz I didn't disappoint from this movie...
