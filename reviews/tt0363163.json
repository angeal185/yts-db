[{"title":"This Historian is awed by the effort for accuracy","rating":10,"date":"21 August 2005","review":"I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian \"Come and See\" &amp; \"Schindler's List\" are darn close as well).<br><br>I had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans, one a GI who fought from Omaha to Czechoslovakia. . .and a German infantry officer, a veteran of four years on the Eastern Front. The German, who met Hitler several times, within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy, right down to \"Hitler's\" lower class Munich accent. . .something an American audience would never pick up on. My German friend, who at the end of the war was in East Prussia, in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the Russians, was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror, the hospital scenes, the utter chaos, the lynchings, the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. And an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea Berlin, at the end, had been as bad as what he witnessed along the Baltic coast and is still haunted by. It truly was \"Gotterdammerung\" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. If you are a parent of small children, the terrifying ending for the Goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.<br><br>I think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of Hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman, usually overplayed like a bad performance of King Richard, but far more subtle. I've talked with many who knew Hitler, including a childhood playmate of Helga, Goebbel's oldest child, and all will tell you that Hitler could be absolutely charming, focused on you, even courtly when with women. The terror is, that even as the actor shows us that \"human\" side, in his soft voice he is dictating orders, observations, and comments of absolute evil. The true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface, it seduces us with a fair face as it leads, sometimes an entire nation, into damnation. THis film captured that evil.<br><br>My German friend's comment at the end of the movie. . .\"I still can not believe we fought for that monster for six years.\" <br><br>A history professor at Montreat College","user":"wforstchen","rank":[270,281]},{"title":"Impressive achievement, realistic and shocking","rating":10,"date":"24 November 2004","review":"This film definitely is a must-see because of the incomparable degree of realism displayed in it. Direction, camera and acting are of an unparalleled level and make you, as the viewer, feel as if you are actually in Berlin, 1945, and in the FÃ¼hrer's bunker. The film does not provide any commentary or judgment, it just shows facts.<br><br>The film is criticized because it gives the Nazi's a human face, but this is exactly it's strongest point: the Nazi's were not extraterrestrial monsters, they were as human as you and I. The image of Hitler crying of sorrow because all is lost, is still burned on my retina.<br><br>In my opinion, this is a film that should be shown in schools to illustrate the Second World War with. It is probably impossible to provide a more realistic account, without *any* form of judgment.<br><br>A major achievement, even for Germany as a whole. It is very brave to create such a realistic film about one's own past.","user":"nosiesnetnieuws","rank":[756,828]},{"title":"The Most Impressive, Depressive and Realistic Dramatic Movie about the World War II","rating":10,"date":"19 January 2006","review":"\"Der Untergang\" is certainly the most impressive, depressive and realistic dramatic movie about the World War II ever made. I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command, and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year, I saw the deceptive, boring, pretentious and overrated \"Molokh\", showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But \"Der Untergang\" is awesome and comparable to \"Apocalypse Now!\", my favorite movie of war.<br><br>Two years ago, I saw the powerful \"Das Experiment\" and I was impressed with the work of Oliver Hirschbiegel. With \"Der Untergang\", this director is certainly included in my list of favorite directors. It is difficult to highlight one actor or actress in this constellation of stars, but I was impressed with the performance of Bruno Ganz and his \"human\" Hitler, totally different from the stereotypes usual in other movies. The cinematography and the battles are stunning, and the scenario of Berlin completely destroyed recalled the neo-realistic movie of Roberto Rossellini \"Germania Anno Zero\".<br><br>For those who know Germany and German people, it is amazing to see how this wonderful country survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. For those who might have believed in Hitler and his Nazi Party, it is impressive to see how people is forgotten and treated without compassion by their leader in his last hours. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost. My vote is ten.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"A Queda! As Últimas Horas de Hitler\" (\"The Fall! The Last Hours of Hitler\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[247,275]}]
