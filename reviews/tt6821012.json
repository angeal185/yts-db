[{"title":"Why so hard on this movie?","rating":7,"date":"9 May 2018","review":"Yes, this movie is no great writing blockbuster but it is what it is supposed to be. A whole hearted funny Adam sander movie that will make you laugh and feel good at the end. People need to stop thinking they are professional movie critics and just have a few laughs for a couple hours. Lighten up people!","user":"cartney14","rank":[108,125]},{"title":"Delightfully Odd and Touching.","rating":7,"date":"1 June 2018","review":"Personally, The Week Of is a movie about growing up for adults, incidentally, it's one of Sandler's more mature-themed films. It's a very heartfelt movie that revolves more around the event of a marriage than having a dramatic story, despite this, the many crazy shenanigans common in the Sandlerverse are still present but they are entirely realistic. Chris Rock and Adam Sandler seemingly fall into their roles and feel like real people (most of the time) and the cinematography captures the chaos of a wedding in near dizzying perfection. It's a fun, loving film for fathers and almost everywhere.","user":"sirena-34303","rank":[48,58]},{"title":"Good for a one time watch","rating":7,"date":"28 April 2018","review":"Dumb and slapstick but I was laughing throughout.
