[{"title":"Asylum aims for the middle again.","rating":2,"date":"23 August 2016","review":"I signed up for IMDb just to write this review. I think that is an important thing to make note of. I came into possession of this movie and saw NO reviews of it, only a semi-favorable rating. I thought, \"I can enjoy a bad horror movie now and again, so why not give it a go? I should not have given it a go.<br><br>Whenever you start a horror movie and the \"Asylum\" logo appears on screen, you already know what to expect. Unless you're drunk, you will not enjoy this movie. <br><br>The acting is bad. The visuals are mediocre. The story is uninteresting and you will predict the ending at around the 30 minute mark of the movie. You may ask yourself if you should even bother continuing to watch at this point, the answer is no.<br><br>There is a woman in this movie who is supposed to be hacking for some reason, I guess she's hacking ghosts? I stopped paying attention to what she was supposed to be doing when I realized that her computer screen was just a random number generator and she was mashing keys haphazardly the entire time. <br><br>There is a scene where shadowy ghoulish figures appear - however it is clear that they are just men in black morph suits, complete with visible wrinkles and seams.<br><br>The best part of the film is right at the end when the credits are over and you can go reflect about how you wasted about 90 minutes of your life and you will never get them back.","user":"dodajoshua","rank":[17,25]},{"title":"not so bad","rating":8,"date":"19 July 2016","review":"This film is not so bad, there were some scary moments but the story is really simple and easy to predict, if you don't have any film to watch and this comes up, I'd say go for it...the acting was pretty average also. there were some good scary scenes and some gore to the film. I just wished they would had a more complex storyline which would made it scarier but I was expecting a really bad film but I was proved wrong. Watched it with my wife who's an avid horror fan and she was not thoroughly disappointed with the movie.The director of the film and the special effects team should be given praise as well. There aren't a lot of American horror movies but this one should be given a look or two at.","user":"lifelinespublishing","rank":[19,37]},{"title":"Asylum's dud","rating":3,"date":"10 July 2018","review":"GHOSTHUNTERS is another cheapie from The Asylum, released to capitalise on the GHOSTBUSTERS all-female reboot. This has nothing to do with any of the Hollywood films and instead is a typical low budget haunted house horror flick in which a team of paranormal investigators set up base in a haunted house in order to capture the spirits living there. One of the team has a personal connection to the dead but that's all the depth you're going to find. This is slow, slow stuff indeed, with rubbish direction and stilted acting. The gloomy visuals are sleep-inducing and the whole thing has an air of tired predictability.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[2,2]}]
