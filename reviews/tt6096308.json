[{"title":"At first I wasn't sure","rating":7,"date":"2 February 2019","review":"It was slow and I kept drifting off to sleep. Didn't know if I was just too tired to start a movie or if it was that slow. Either way, I finished the second half the next day and I'm glad I did. It really was different and I like that. I thought what kind of polygamy plot is this? Is it a cult? The ending made you think once the movie was over and that's a good sign. I'm glad the blonde killed the two goofs because they were not responsible enough for this magic. I felt she would carry it on until she found someone to share it with. I loved that Ella decided to be with Adam and end it the same way the people did before them. It was a nice change of pace. Give it a shot if you're not sleepy.","user":"jenniferlynn-49555","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Good movie that keeps you thinking","rating":9,"date":"24 January 2019","review":"It's rare to find a good story without the gore and heavy duty sex scenes, oh sure, there's some killing and even some implied sex. But that's not what makes this movie good, it keeps you thinking and that's satisfying and made even more enjoyable thanks to good acting and good direction.","user":"dianne00","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"Entertaining","rating":8,"date":"13 January 2019","review":"2 people find the fountain of youth, literally, in the 1800s, and kill everyone who comes close to know the secret.
