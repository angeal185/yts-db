[{"title":"1st time I ever felt the desire to write a movie review!","rating":10,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"I have never reviewed a movie before but having seen this film on its opening day, not the kind of movie I'm normally attracted to (I booked it really for my wife as it was our wedding anniversary yesterday) I was so surprised how much I really enjoyed it! It has something for everyone to connect with. Beautifully put together and performed. But be warned, this is one moving movie. Even the toughest of guys will need the Kleenex nearby. My face was wet!\nJust as you have managed to hold back one tear-jerker response, along comes another. A real emotional roller-coaster which leaves you in awe at the end.\nBest real movie I've seen in a long time.\nKevin was amazing. So was Amanda and Milo. Real characters with real feeling. You should all be so proud of this. My friend read the book and said it had the same affect. Clearly you have done the book due justice. Just Fabulous!","user":"nigelrarnold","rank":[177,211]},{"title":"True to source material; Very good movie","rating":9,"date":"13 August 2019","review":"I read this book several years ago, and I remember crying like a baby in the Charlotte airport on a layover as I read the last two chapters. Tears of sorrow combined with tears of joy streamed down my face, and this little old lady came over to me and said, \"Honey, are you ok?\" I smiled and just said, \"This book is so good!\"<br><br>Flash forward to the movie, and I literally almost started crying at the very first scene. I hold the book in high regard, and the opening shot of Enzo just brought back so many good memories of the book. As I watched the movie, I felt the producers/director stayed very true to the message of the source material. Do I know scene-by-scene if they stayed true? No, I do not. However, the overall beginning to end conveys the major events that happen, and without a doubt, it was such an incredible struggle not to burst into tears during the final moments of the movie. I was not alone in this as I heard many sniffles in the audience. It was almost sold out on a Tuesday matinee!<br><br>The overall message is perseverance, love, loyalty, and being true to yourself. The story of Enzo is a heartwarming story, and I can't recommend this book and movie enough.","user":"derekprice1974","rank":[76,96]},{"title":"Poignant & funny. This movie is a gift.","rating":9,"date":"8 August 2019","review":"My thoughts:<br><br>The Art of Racing in the Rain is beautifully and sensitively directed by Simon Curtis, who deftly orchestrates the poignant moments with humor.<br><br>Milo Ventimiglia's \"This is Us\" fans will recognize and love his Denny Swift; he was perfectly cast in this role.<br><br>I especially love how the movie showed the evolution of Eve &amp; Enzo's relationship.<br><br>Kevin Costner is not the first person I'd think of to be the inner voice of a dog, but he does a great job.<br><br>This movie is a gift to anyone who's ever owned or loved a dog.","user":"karen-heffernan","rank":[111,144]}]
