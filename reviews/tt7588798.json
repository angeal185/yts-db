[{"title":"You Know How It Will End","rating":6,"date":"8 November 2017","review":"I Have Reviewed OVER 400 ( C H R I S T M A S ) MOVIES so beware of fake reviews &amp; reviewers. Many Christmas films only have 1 review. When it's a POSITIVE REVIEW chances are that the reviewer was involved with the production. If its a negative review then they may have a huge grudge against the film.<br><br>I am fare about these films. The only reason why I review them is to keep track of what \"I have seen\". <br><br>In this film<br><br>A lovely lady Nicknamed \"Miss Christmas,\" the official tree finder for Chicago's renowned Radcliffe Tree lighting is left desperate to find the perfect tree. A letter from a young boy promising his tree is perfect sends her to a small town where she learns the young boy's dad isn't willing to part with his tree. <br><br>Now any Christmas Film that has a \"One Horse Open Sleigh\" scene is almost guaranteed to get a rave review from me.<br><br>Now what I like about this film is shows us how \"Christmas Traditions\" in your childhood get carried over when your an adult. In fact you miss the people that you lost the most at Christmas Time. <br><br>Now this wasn't the greatest Hallmark Movie however the leads are pleasant. The film has faults but most films do. <br><br>I will watch it again<br><br>Merry Christmas","user":"Christmas-Reviewer","rank":[42,56]},{"title":"Okay film","rating":6,"date":"15 November 2017","review":"Run of the mill production from Hallmark. In this film a woman who is in charge of a towns Christmas Tree Festival must look for a new tree when the one she wanted is no longer available. <br><br>The tree finder is Chicago's renowned Radcliffe Tree lighting is left desperate to find the perfect tree. A letter from a boy promising his tree is perfect sends her to a small town where she learns his dad isn't willing to part with the tree.<br><br>When she arrives in town she finds out the owner of the tree doesn't want her to have it. <br><br>Heart warming feature. Give it a shot! Now there is someone here attacking another reviewer. I trust his/hers views. They have been on IMDb for years. <br><br>I looked at what the reviewer has \"Claimed\". There are many films that have reviews and the reviewer has only reviewed that film! <br><br>I looked at his/her reviews and they are never \"rude\". I think someone on this board got called out on their behavior!","user":"Thetruthhurtsss","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Yet another Hallmark Christmas movie...","rating":5,"date":"9 June 2018","review":"Yeah, this was yet another mass produced Hallmark Christmas movie, that broke no new ground.<br><br>It was as generic and scripted as they come, and I say that in the most possible positive manner, because this was not a bad movie. But it was one that follows a very over-used formula of 'how-to-make-a-Christmas-movie' that Hallmark uses repeatedly.<br><br>The storyline in \"Miss Christmas\" was predictable, as it tends to be for movies such as this, and you knew exactly how the movie was going to end. However, there were some nice enough moments throughout the movie to make it worthwhile actually sticking with it to the very end.<br><br>And I will say that both Brooke D'Orsay and Marc Blucas were performing quite well and really carried the movie quite nicely, which made it all the more enjoyable to watch.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[7,8]}]
