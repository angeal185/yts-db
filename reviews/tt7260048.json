[{"title":"Perfectly perfect !","rating":10,"date":"7 April 2018","review":"Director: Lynn Shelton and writers: Jay Duplass &amp; Lynn Shelton have created a story that goes straight to the heart &amp; soul. Beautifully scripted, filmed, and acted \"Outside In\" is one of those unforgettable stories that puts tears in your eyes but a sense of hope and joy in your heart.<br><br>Jay Duplass plays 'Chris' an ex-con who comes home after 20 years in jail. We know his readjustment to everyday life will be challenging for him but too his luck there are people there who do not want to judge him for a long past crime. Love and friendship finds it's way back into his life but this brings alot of troublesome baggage with it. Chis just wants to do whats right!<br><br>This is a beautifully made film and the Duplass brothers have another star in their crown. I truly hope this movie gets the public attention it so deserves. Seek it out and watch it!","user":"cekadah","rank":[31,37]},{"title":"Simply told story, memorable acting.","rating":3,"date":"3 April 2018","review":"Although Lynn Shelton's slice of small town Pacific Northwest life (pay attention Everett and Granite Falls) in Outside In is so authentic as to defy artful interpretations, it is a minimalist portrait of ambitions circumscribed and affections compromised. In other words, it elevates working class melodrama into art house heavy while retaining the hint of desperate housewives of any small town.<br><br>Almost 40-year old Chris (Jay Duplass) has been released from prison after 20 years with the aid of his do-gooder former teacher, Carol (Edie Falco). Arriving in Granite Falls, Washington State, he is faced with hitherto unsuspected expectations from the two leading ladies: Carol and her daughter Hildy (Kaitlyn Dever). A brief brush with another lady reminds us that a handsome bachelor, recently released from prison for being innocent, is fair game for romantically inclined small-town women.<br><br>Shelton's approach is to let the realism dominate without veering too sharply into contrived, ironic situations. Chris's adjustment into civilian life will be fraught with suspicion and jealousy, just as in the real world his siblings and friends have always lived. <br><br>Falco and Duplass are so believably good as two adults who need to start life over that you miss the clich√©s and unsurprising turns because the leads become family whose fates matter very much to us.<br><br>Outside In is not kitchen-sink drama; it is simply simple life warm, troubled, and endearing. And that acting . . . .<br><br>\"There are aspects of small town life that I really like - the routine nature of it, the idea of people knowing you and your likes and dislikes.\" Cress Williams","user":"jdesando","rank":[23,27]},{"title":"A real Gem of a movie for drama lovers","rating":8,"date":"9 April 2018","review":"The story is focused on Chris, a likeable guy in his late 30's who has just been released from prison after a 20 year stint. He was jailed for a crime he didn't commit and his early release is down to his former school teacher Carol who has spent practically the last 20 years supporting and working on his case to prove his innocence. Carol is much older than Chris and their time together has created a bond. Carol is married and has a daughter. Carol's marriage and home life is problematic, not helped by the amount of time she has spent fighting Chris's case in addition to her regular teaching job. That's the background to the movie but the real joy is seeing how Chris integrates back into small town life in Granite Falls, Washington State. His relationships with those around him. The stigma associated with his imprisonment His innocence attracting the attention of potential lovers. Then there's that bond between Chris and Carol and where that might lead. \nThere's a lot of love and thought gone into the story. The 2 lead characters are superbly cast and absolutely carry the movie. I was very impressed with the camera work. Some really nicely composed shots and direction that helped to portray the atmosphere without being 'in your face different' \nMy rating 8/10 \nHighly recommended if you like a good drama","user":"Frame-By-Frame","rank":[22,27]}]
