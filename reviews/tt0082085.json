[{"title":"The scream!","rating":8,"date":"2 August 2005","review":"Brian DePalma was at the height of his film career when he undertook the direction of \"Blow Out\". Some comments to this forum have compared it to other distinguished films like Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Conversation\" and Michaelangelo Antonioni's \"Blow Up\", a comparison that seems to make sense, in a way, but Mr. DePalma, who wrote his own screen play, is an intelligent man who didn't need to copy anything from those masters of the cinema.<br><br>In fact, \"Blow Out\" has kept its impact as a thriller mystery with its political overtones as it mixes crime with the lives of influential people that might give viewers a point of reference between the movie and actual historical facts.<br><br>We are given an introduction to Jack's line of work as we watch scenes of the porno film that he is working on as a sound technician. The only thing that is needed is a real scream which the many actresses, either on the film itself, or being auditioned, can't produce. Whatever comes out of those women's throats are wimpy sounds, not a horror yell for help.<br><br>Jack, who is out one night recording sounds for future ventures, captures the shot that causes the \"blow out\" and makes a car plunge into a creek. Jack abandons everything and jumps to rescue whoever he can save. He is only successful in bringing Sally out of the water. This is the beginning of Jack's involvement into the mystery behind the actual fact.<br><br>Mr. DePalma's thriller is visually stylish. He photographed the movie in Philadelphia. The film has the excellent Vilmos Zsigmond behind the camera. The atmospheric music by Pino Donoggio serves the movie well.<br><br>John Travolta's career was in decline when he made this movie. He gives a terrific performance as the sound effect man who stumbles in a conspiracy to eliminate the witnesses to the accident. Nancy Allen is not as effective as Sally, the young prostitute at the center of the story. Being married to the director might have helped her land the part, which with some other actress might have paid off better. John Lighgow is perfectly creepy as Burke, the evil man. Dennis Franz has the pivotal part of Karp, the man who was able to photograph the whole incident.<br><br>\"Blow Out\" is a must see for all Brian DePalma's admirers.","user":"jotix100","rank":[76,95]},{"title":"Brian De Palma's forgotten masterpiece.","rating":8,"date":"19 September 2012","review":"In 1981, Brian De Palma released what might be considered his \"best\" thriller to date. The \"Slasher\" genre was at full blossom, and the conspiracy driven, psychological thrillers of the 1970s were slowly declining in terms of popularity. <br><br>\"Blow Out\" stars John Travolta as Jack, a sound engineer for an independent movie picture, that discovers what first appears to be a tragic car-accident - is in fact a murder. Sally, who is rescued from the wreck by the protagonist (Travolta) himself stays as his counterpart though out the movie. Jack must set the story straight, and prove the police wrong.<br><br>De Palma is known for his themes of guilt, paranoia and obsession which work as essential parts for the character development in \"Blow Out\". It's a hell of ride from start to finish, and one can truly state that Brian De Palma is a master of suspense. <br><br>The acting of John Travolta is superb and convincing, and I dare to say that it's his best role to date. I was a bit skeptical to Nancy Allen at first, but her naive character grew on me over the course of the film, and might actually be one of the things that makes this film so great; that is believable character development without the often sudden change of identity. <br><br>Blow out is stylish, and both the directing of De Palma and cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond is highly impressive. From beautifully shot scenes in the vein of Francis Ford Coppola to the drastic suspense of Hitchcock, De Palma uses all the best tricks in the book. <br><br>\"Blow Out\" is non-stop suspense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The last 15 minutes finale is quite extraordinary. The atmosphere, mood and cinematography are all close perfect. It truly is Brian De Palma's forgotten masterpiece.","user":"Westlake123","rank":[34,41]},{"title":"An enjoyable mix of `Blow-Up' and `The Conversation'","rating":16,"date":"16 March 2002","review":"Jack is a sound editor for small films.  When he is out one evening recording background noises, he inadvertently records a car crash which kills a politician running for the US Presidency, although Jack saves a girl in the car.  When pressured to say that the politician was alone, Jack finds that his recording may prove that it was murder and not an accident. However someone is cutting off the loose ends around the crime.<br><br>A clever rework of Blow-Up that is given a thriller twist and visual style by De Palma.  The story is quite straight forward and doesn't contain too many twists and turns.  However it does have a good premise at it's core and it builds to a suitably low-key ending.<br><br>De Palma works well with the material  at some points it's a little obtrusive, but he certainly can frame a shot.  From his use of foreground and background focusing to the scene where Travolta realises what he has on tape  he has style to spare.  He handles the ending well but perhaps feels he wants to be like Coppola a bit too much.<br><br>Pre-career dip Travolta gives his best performance before Pulp Fiction  he plays the everyman really well and is totally convincing.  Allen is a little too squeaky and irritating, but get past this and she's OK.  Franz is on-form as a sleazy opportunist, while Lithgow is chilling as a ruthless, clinical killer.<br><br>Overall it occasionally feels like there is more style than substance but everyone holds their end up and the result is a solid, enjoyable thriller that maybe pays a bit too much homage to other work.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[72,95]}]
