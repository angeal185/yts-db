[{"title":"From Funan to Kampuchea","rating":10,"date":"3 January 2020","review":"Great background and setting drawing but not so great characters, beacuse the style feels like not in complete harmony with the rest of the image and story. Taking into account the type of story they are telling us, an undercooked or less detailed design would have worked better to me, leaving the only nice to see thing, the background, as the vanishing point for the viewer from the nightmare these people had to experience.<br><br>For those of you that want to know more about this historical event, i would recommend you this two documentaries; {S-21: the Khmer rougue killing machine} (2003) and {The missing picture} (2013),both directed by Rithy Panh.","user":"mikeluriarte","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Wonderful, Heartbreaking and Beautiful.","rating":9,"date":"2 January 2020","review":"This is one of the most touching movies i have seen in a long time,\nI wouldn't call this a review, as i am not a movie reviewer.\nJust Watch it.","user":"jhsdcsjdcvbdj-44787","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"the khmer","rating":6,"date":"15 March 2020","review":"Very intense and realistic plundging back into 1975 revolution; deportation of local population and forcing them to arm and fight for the communistic way of life, where you feel human value has no meaning. Harsh behaviors forcing people to labor work.\nToday when visiting Cambodia you can still feel the strong presence of communist residue and poverty","user":"bnessi","rank":[0,0]}]
