[{"title":"I've watched this movie twice.","rating":7,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"Yes, it's low budget with relatively unknowns, but it was really sweet and the acting was not bad. I think this is a cute date movie and I'd recommend. The lead actor is adorable and he did the best he could for this genre. I thought he was charming and quite handsome. I can see him in a Psycho movie as that Bates character or as comedic character. I'd like to see him in some other roles. I'd never usually write a review for a movie like this, but I liked it. Give it a watch. Good story.","user":"josborn5136","rank":[50,50]},{"title":"Feel good film with a charming lead","rating":8,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"A really feel good film with a charming and complicated central protagonist who seems to bounce from one tragic situation to the next. It's funny and uncomfortable in spots. But that only ads to the humour. Kick back, relax and enjoy the company of these characters.","user":"Anmer93","rank":[50,50]},{"title":"Passion at it's Best","rating":28,"date":"28 August 2018","review":"An excellent film that has been given the attention to detail by someone who is passionate to tell a story. This isn't a feat I can say that is easy and by no means one I could do myself without much practice. Glad to support friends in their art.","user":"lachlanquintana","rank":[54,55]}]
