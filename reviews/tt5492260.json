[{"title":"A sad, subtle, resonant drama","rating":6,"date":"11 September 2018","review":"A Canadian drama; A moving story about a woman struggling to cope with the onset of the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's, and her son coming to terms with his identity and sexuality. The film is all about the performances, especially soft-spoken Shirley Henderson and her delicate performance. The characters seem very well observed in how they cope with grief, trauma and circumstance - a mutual appreciation for one another. These people are good people and it is refreshing the way the drama unfolds.","user":"shakercoola","rank":[14,14]}]
