[{"title":"So bad, that we walked out","rating":1,"date":"7 September 2019","review":"For the first time in years, we walked out of the cinema. It's not a movie - it's a political attack of a worst kind. There's no plot, no story - just re-telling of news reports from the last few years in Poland. One star for some smashing performances of lead Polish actors and actresses but the whole thing is not worth the time. (As a disclosure - I don't support Polish PiS government, so I really wanted to like the movie.)","user":"eckert-karolina","rank":[18,26]},{"title":"Coraz gorsze te jego filmy","rating":3,"date":"6 September 2019","review":"The film is quite boring, most of the jokes not funny Vega is getting worse, probably too much and the boy wants to get rich quickly and his films are getting worse.","user":"iwan-66741","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"The Worst movie of 2019 by mile.","rating":1,"date":"5 September 2019","review":"Jokes are not funny, so boring I try not fell asleep most of the movie.
