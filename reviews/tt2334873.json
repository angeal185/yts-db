[{"title":"Blanche and Stella in Woodyland","rating":9,"date":"24 November 2013","review":"What a treat! Cate Blanchett gives a stunning performance as a Blanche-like character written and directed by the most prolific American author of the last 40 years. Cate seems to be an actress without emotional borders. Jasmine walks a very tight rope, her sense of despair etched in her magnificent face vanishes ipso facto when she meets Peter Sarsgaard. She realizes in a sort of disbelief -extraordinary, heartbreaking and horribly funny moment - that he could be the rescue raft in her own personal tsunami. Sally Hawkins, another stroke of genius in the casting department, is a profoundly human creature very much the Stella of the situation. This two sisters, adopted both from different parents are also from different, if immediately recognizable, universes. I could go on and on but I'm not going to, I just wanted to urge you, in this times of 3D super extra loud marvel sequels, to run and see it.","user":"littlemartinarocena","rank":[89,100]},{"title":"Hurricane Cate.....","rating":10,"date":"27 February 2014","review":"Loved the script, loved the cast, loved all the performances, but dear God, Cate Blanchett was so incredible I couldn't catch a breath. What a performance! So many emotions at the same time, so multi-layered, subtle and yet unbearable.... She takes a character one normally wouldn't really care about where she ends up to someone, who despite her tragic and repeated mistakes and the fact that she made her own bed, you send up caring about, you end up understanding her. <br><br>Blanchett took a huge risk with that emotionally exposing role and proved herself to be master and commander. If any other actress had played that role, it wouldn't even be half as good. Her theatrical background and experience is all concentrated in in Jasmine. Heart-wrenching, powerful and utterly vulnerable at the same time, cruel but simultaneously caring in her very own way... <br><br>It's the performance of the decade for me and one of the best of all times, a true masterclass.<br><br>And as Letterman told Blanchett when she was a guest at his show (not really a fan of his but what he said was totally true), even if he had directed the film instead of Allen, the result would still have been a masterpiece because of Cate.","user":"corazonlatido","rank":[100,113]},{"title":"One of Woody Allen's most unsuspecting heavyweight films in a long time.","rating":8,"date":"9 August 2013","review":"Sometimes it feels like Woody Allen is deliberately hit and miss. Every other film appears to be a winner so it's become easy to just skip the mediocre ones. I thought Midnight In Paris was pretty good but I felt like its idea wasn't explored well enough and it became too repetitive. Blue Jasmine is a film that feels like it'll be another basic story at first then as the tragedy slowly unravels, it becomes all the more fascinating. At first the film's structure of flashbacking without transition is a little frustrating as the present time doesn't give you much to chew on in the first place, but it soon becomes clear that this was the only way to tell this brilliant and complex story of a woman's place in the world. Cate Blanchett is setting the reviews on fire and she certainly deserves it. I've always loved her engrossing theatrical style in films like The Aviator and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and I've missed her since.<br><br>Here she is in full force as she switches from glamour to glare seamlessly and effortlessly. Blanchett has often played strong women and she tiptoes the line of Jasmine's strength and vulnerability both with and without sympathy. It's incredible to watch. Although I was concerned I was going to only appreciate the performance and not connect with the character, I ended up finding her struggle to feel useful in the working world and not knowing how to achieve her ambitions to cut deep into the first world human anxieties about identity and self- worth. It's great to have a film that addresses those issues so earnestly, without feeling self- pitying. Although the spotlight is on her, there's plenty of room for the supporting players to shine with the delightful comic relief performances from Louis C.K., Michael Stuhlberg and Max Casella and deceptively charming performances from Alec Baldwin, Andrew Dice Clay and Peter Sarsgaard. The real talent on the side belongs to Sally Hawkins and Bobby Cannavale who give compelling and heartbreaking performances.<br><br>I like how Allen has such confidence in his shooting style of simple wides and closeups that he doesn't let it get in the way of the story but sometimes it does feel bland rather than just Woody's brand. It sometimes feels like the story is taking uninteresting broad strokes with its archetypes but when the details come in like a mystery novel, they enrichen the story and leave just before they drown you making you want more. Perhaps Allen could've made a better job of making me intrigued in the details but that makes the pay-offs all the more sweeter. However, I'm not quite sure what to make of the ending, perhaps Allen is trying to say there's some people who can and can't be fixed, I'm not sure, but it's a fascinating tragic comic tale nonetheless. Maybe it's intended as a punishment film regarding the sin of greed. That would make sense though it wouldn't be as satisfying. It's been compared to A Streetcar Named Desire a lot but I don't remember much of that story despite having seen it twice. I think I prefer Blue Jasmine. One of Allen's most unsuspecting heavyweight films in a long time.<br><br>8/10","user":"Sergeant_Tibbs","rank":[211,264]}]
