[{"title":"How reviews work","rating":13,"date":"13 October 2011","review":"If you find yourself coming to IMDb for a sneak peek at your next movie outing, please remember this rule: reviewers who vote a film 8* or more, if they have only one, or two at the most, reviews posted .. are probably what the industry calls \"sponsored reviewers\" or, in layman's terms, \"professional bullsh**ers\".<br><br>Unfortunately Father of Invention is one of those titles that the parent studio feels needs sponsored reviews, as you can see for yourself if you browse the few reviews here on IMDb (just click on the Author's name in the review); the film isn't terrible, but apart from Kevin Spacey doing his best, there really isn't much of a story to keep it afloat.<br><br>Rober \"Bob\" Axel has just come out of jail for marketing a faulty product (whait, what? do corporation chairmen go to jail for that? this film must be set in a parallel universe where criminal charges apply differently than real-life US), and he has to start again from the bottom rung of society, trying to rebuild all he lost, including his family, car, friends, and all that upper-crust stuff. He fails. <br><br>That's about it for a pretty mediocre film, with a very diminutive script, truly awful supporting characters, middle of the road acting, and lacklustre direction; Spacey is good, but the constraints of a unimaginative ..everything .. leave him no space to shine.<br><br>Avoid this film if you can, there are too many boring and inconsequential filler scenes in it to make this an easy sit-through, even with friends. Instead, do go see something else out this week, like Soldier Spy, Machinegun Preacher, 50/50, 1911, Heavy Times, or the superb Drive. Anything really, but not this. Or Melancholia.<br><br>Final vote, 4/10. Pretty bad.","user":"digdog-785-717538","rank":[28,37]},{"title":"The only real attraction here is the brilliant acting of Kevin Spacey","rating":7,"date":"25 March 2013","review":"If you watch this movie because it sounds like a great movie, you'll probably be disappointed. It's not great. It's not bad, either. It's okay.<br><br>If you watch this movie because you enjoy watching Kevin Spacey act, then you'll enjoy this flick. Spacey is that rare actor I can enjoy watching even in a bad movie...and lately some of his flicks haven't been that inspired. But, Spacey is a gem, even when the film isn't.<br><br>I rather enjoyed Camilla Belle as the daughter and Heather Graham and Anna Anissimova as her friends. John Stamos' part was so small as to be pathetic -- basically 1 scene. Johnny Knoxville did okay as the store manager. To be honest, I've never understood the attraction to Virginia Madsen as an actress, and I still don't. Among these supporting actors, the only one that stands out -- perhaps -- is Camilla Belle.<br><br>The plot? After Robert Axle (Spacey) goes to prison when one of his inventions maims many customers, he comes out after 8 years. Will he rebuild his reputation? It doesn't seem that way at first when he winds up as a rather unsuccessful custodian in a discount store...and gets fired. But, he finally gets a great idea and makes it a success. The bigger question is whether or not he will be successful in repairing his relationship with his daughter.<br><br>Unfortunately, the plot is beneath Kevin Spacey. But it's watchable, and of course, his acting is very watchable.","user":"vincentlynch-moonoi","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Instead of a comedy about an inventor, we get a dramedy about a father","rating":4,"date":"25 November 2011","review":"\"Father of Invention\" stars Kevin Spacey as a fabricator, an infomercial king, who combines existing products into new ones. Problem is he was in jail, now he has lost his empire, and lost his family. The key word in the title is father. The entire film is him trying to reconnect with his daughter (Camilla Belle).<br><br>Spacey has frequently played fathers trying to reconnect with their daughter, the prime example being \"American Beauty\" (1999). Not that one is likely to confuse the two films, but there's an underlying similarity about the pursuit of success and the pursuit of family. That's what \"Father of Invention\" is about but it doesn't actually explore those issues.<br><br>It's also supposed to be a comedy, but because it was just him and his daughter there was nothing clever that catches you off-guard to make you laugh. The daughter (whom, by the way, I have already forgotten her name) lives with two roommates. One is in love with Kevin Spacey (whom I have also forgotten his character's name) and the other is a lesbian. There was no slow reveal for any of this. Those facts were just presented as if they create whole characters.<br><br>The conflict which this builds to isn't surprising (it's part of the mandate for dysfunctional family dramedies) or even interesting since we never did care for the characters in the first place. \"Father of Invention\" certainly didn't invent anything and there's nothing special about the daughter or the father.","user":"napierslogs","rank":[20,29]}]
