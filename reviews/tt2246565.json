[{"title":"I loved this movie","rating":10,"date":"25 February 2015","review":"This week a stunningly beautiful, brilliant and poignant new documentary about James Randi comes out and it is as riveting as any narrative film I have ever seen. \"An Honest Liar: Truth and Deception in the Life of James 'The Amazing' Randi\" paints a luscious portrait of James Randi and a fascinating history of the crusades that he has waged in the name of honesty - as well as two provocative discrepancies in his personal life.<br><br>Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.<br><br>And sometimes revealing untruths is even stranger than anything you can wrap your mind around.<br><br>James Randi is a vigilante. He is exceptionally bright, gifted, articulate, audacious and relentless in a quest for truth that often consists of denouncing psychics/magicians who fall below his moral barometer. He feels that taking advantage of the limitations of consciousness as entertainment is perfectly acceptable; however, taking advantage of the limitations of consciousness to scam people for financial gain or trying to pass it off as \"science\" is utterly abhorrent.<br><br>James Randi devised elaborate hoaxes over many years to prove that renowned scientists could be easily fooled by magicians into thinking that such gimmicks as psychokinesis (supposedly moving or influencing objects with one's mind) were real and not optical illusions.<br><br>For four decades Randi took particular umbrage with master showman Uri Geller and publicly implored him in his book \"The Truth About Uri Geller\" and on multiple television appearances to stop referring to himself as a psychic. His main disgust was at the money wasted by lauded institutions such as Stanford University investigating illusionists such as Gellar. In the end, it is Uri Geller who sells fake diamonds on QVC while James Randi's Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge remains intact.","user":"iraisrael","rank":[27,32]},{"title":"Great way to learn about Randi's story","rating":9,"date":"5 March 2015","review":"I admire Randi since I was a kid because he was passion about the truth, and his effort to expose BS. I always hear about he was a magician, but never got the chance to see him in those days. Gladly, this documentary tell his story from the beginning to the present, so there is a lot of footage of his magician days.<br><br>The story sometimes jumps back and forward, but I think in a good way. Overall is told chronologically.<br><br>A long story compress in so few minutes. But don't feel like was too short or too long.<br><br>Also is great to see people that was involve in all those stories talking about it in the present.<br><br>If you are a fan of Randi, for sure you most watch it.","user":"InterlinkKnight","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Everybody must see this movie","rating":10,"date":"28 June 2015","review":"Without detailing into spoilers,<br><br>This movie provided enough interesting lessons spanning much wider than just a movie. I think it's pretty unique in its underlying message, at least I don't know of any other movies with these lines underneath. I may even fall in a separate category. <br><br>For scientists this movie will show you that there are other variables besides \"controlled conditions\" and \"a bunch of references\" which you should be taken into account, when performing tests with humans: humans may deliberately fraud your research. As far as I remember that was never a topic or even a consideration during classes on how to conduct controlled experiments. <br><br>It also taught me that, no matter how smart you are, people will always be able to fool you. So you do need strict conditions and help of trained professionals when performing tests or experiments in this area.<br><br>The movie also taught me that even if you put the plain proof that people are frauds in front of people, it is no use. Apparently people disregard the truth even with evidence and for reasons I can't yet comprehend, donate gazillion of dollars to frauds even with recorded proofs of fraudulent behavior. <br><br>The movie made me aware that knowing the truth is one thing but assuming other people are interested in the truth is another thing.<br><br>Apart from these and other pretty unique things the movie lets you think of ... it gives an insight in the career of Randi. I was not completely aware of his complete career, which was an eye opener.<br><br>I also did not know how broad his operations stretched, the determination during the 2 years of paranormal research was absolutely stunning.<br><br>If I would have to categorize the movie in my DVD/Blu-Ray collection I would create a separate drawer \"Truth\".","user":"deleau","rank":[10,12]}]
