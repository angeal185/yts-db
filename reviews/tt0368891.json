[{"title":"An entertaining movie for the whole family","rating":9,"date":"30 May 2005","review":"**********SPOILER WARNING************<br><br>I had the pleasure of seeing this film twice at the theater. The only shows where I've seen the audience more into a movie were Spider-man 1 &amp; 2, X-MEN 2, and Rocky. The movie is interesting from start to finish. <br><br>While all the actors (and actress) do a good job, Sean Bean steals the show. So many times, the villain can make or break the film. Sean Bean was the absolute best choice for this particular villain. The characters arrogance, intelligence, and relentless resolve shine through. <br><br>I feel the main drawback to the film was its PG rating. It would have been better as a PG-13. Some obvious violence was toned down. Even people that never use foul language, would have dropped the \"F\" bomb here and there. But as it stands with its PG rating, everyone can enjoy it.","user":"thegoauld-1","rank":[19,19]},{"title":"Take \"National Treasure\" for what it is.","rating":7,"date":"4 January 2005","review":"This is a fun movie that most everyone in the family can enjoy. It's rated PG, has some violence, but no nudity and no language. Younger kids will probably not understand the Masonic and Knights Templar references, but they'll probably still enjoy it. The only thing anyone needs to understand about the Masons is the Knights Templar eventually became the Masons, and many of our founding fathers were Masons, so there's a bit of Masonic lore/connection tied into the movie. Other than that, it's easy to follow. Ben Gates is chasing a dream of finding a lost treasure, the map to which is supposedly hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. He steals the Declaration, then takes off on his adventure to find the treasure. To put it simply, \"National Treasure\" will remind you of a cross between the Indiana Jones trilogy (minus the snakes) and \"Ocean's 11\" (minus the drinking and profanity). You don't have to be a genius to watch it, and you don't have to be a history nut to understand it. No, there isn't really a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence (Is there?), but Indiana Jones didn't actually find the Ark, either. It's a fun, fantasy, what-if, kind of movie. Enjoy it.","user":"dgrooms72","rank":[232,266]},{"title":"Pleasant Surprise!","rating":7,"date":"20 December 2004","review":"National Treasure was not on my must-watch list. but it turned out to be a most pleasant surprise. the history behind the show may not be accurate and it also has around it, an air of mystery, but it certainly was a fun filled ride with the face-paced action flicks! I'm NOT a particular Cage fan. nonetheless i had to admit he did a pretty good job as Ben Gates - slightly serious yet very witty! together with Riley, they provided the tickles that brought the audience through the entire film.<br><br>with no explicit language and scenes, National Treasure is well-suited for family entertainment! its a light-hearted film good for an evening of chilling out! the subtle love story also adds credit to the film.<br><br>well done!","user":"silly-lil-thing","rank":[199,245]}]
