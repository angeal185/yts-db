[{"title":"The Snatchers","rating":6,"date":"27 November 2009","review":"A young woman is seen on a flight that is bringing to France. As she exits the terminal, she is met by a chauffeur driving a Rolls Royce. We realize this is a girl from the upper classes. The surprise comes at an intersection where she is forced from the luxury vehicle and made to get into a dilapidated car. The worst nightmare comes true, she is being kidnapped.<br><br>The men behind the caper take her to a solitary house by the ocean. Little do these people realize there is a local policeman who loves fishing nearby. At first, they get concerned, but there are more important things to consider, including the way they plan to exchange the young lady for the ransom money they are demanding from her wealthy father.<br><br>The kidnappers turn out to be an assorted lot. There is Bud, the driver of the limousine, Leer, a hired gun from the United States, Vi, an airline hostess that happens to be on the flight where the victim travels. The fourth member is Wally, who happens to be Vi's brother and who has planned the snatching. It is clear not everything is well with them as Bud objects the inclusion of Leer, a sinister character, in the proceedings. Vi, on the other hand, has a drug problem; she is a cocaine addict, whose carelessness might put the whole process in danger. One feels for the innocent girl, who is helpless against the brutes that are holding her.<br><br>Huber Cornfield was instrumental in getting Lionel White's novel \"The Snatchers\" to the screen. He wasn't a man with a lot of experience behind the camera though, and it shows. The basic problem is with the staging that, at times, seems weak. There is little logic in the way Mr. Cornfield and Robert Pippeny's screenplay that feels awkward at the most dramatic moments. Then, there was the notorious feud between the director and his star, Marlon Brando, who almost appears acting in a different film.<br><br>Marlon Brando, a brilliant actor, was not an easy man to direct. He had strong ideas about acting and he tended to clash with whatever he thought was wrong. His Bud is a man that went along for the promise of riches that would be collected from the girl's father, but he also had a good side to himself in that he saw Leer for what he really was, a ruthless criminal. Bud and Vi were lovers, yet he felt she was beyond help and therefore she could derail the well made plans.<br><br>Richard Boone, an excellent character actor, did not receive credit for directing some of the scenes involving Mr. Brando. He plays the creepy Leer who wanted more than just the money. Rita Moreno's wig made her look different in the opening scenes. There is no logic in her flight attendant's job, but we know she is Wally's sister. Drugs were not so prevalent in the late 1960s as they are today. Jess Hahn, an American actor that settled in France, makes an impression as the beefy Wally. Veteran actor Jacques Martin puts in appearance as the cafe owner. Gerard Buhr is the policeman that knows a lot more than what he lets on.<br><br>The ending is left to the viewer's interpretation.","user":"jotix100","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Freaky!","rating":6,"date":"23 June 2001","review":"Night of the Following Day is as freaky as it's title is meaningless. Blonde-haired Marlon Brando and his blond-haired girlfriend (Rita Moreno) along with a couple of untrustworthy accomplices decide to kidnap a rich British girl and ask for ransom. What starts out a fairly straightforward crime caper soon develops into an over-the-top psychodrama as the criminals begin getting paranoid and start double-crossing each other. Richard Boone is exceptional as Brando's chief nemesis...a ruthless turncoat who'll stop at nothing to get his piece of the ransom. Of course, he's going up against Brando, so...you know the rest. Boone's craggy, pock-marked face and perpetual scowl have seldom been put to such good use. Brando and Moreno are dynamite and clearly have A LOT of chemistry. Pamela Franklin plays the unlucky victim. This is one of several odd-ball movies Brando made during the '60s (see Morituri, The Apaloosa, etc) and one of the least known. It's definitely worth seeing!","user":"JasparLamarCrabb","rank":[27,32]},{"title":"Brando shines in outstanding performance","rating":10,"date":"16 January 2005","review":"The Night Before The Following Day is one of Marlon Brando's most over-looked films. Looking as fit and trim as he was in Streetcar Named Desire, Brando gives an emotionally charged performance as Bud (Brando's nickname in real life!), the leader of a gang of ruthless kidnappers. Brando's acting is at its best in an amazing scene in which he has an intense conversation with Jess Hahn about his misgivings regarding the success of their kidnapping.<br><br>The supporting cast is remarkable. Richard Boone as a sadistic murderer, gives his finest career performance. His villain is the most chilling in movie-screen history. Jess Hahn, as hard-luck Wally, steals the show. He has the look and build of a man who has been dealt the worst of bad luck. Rita Moreno as Wally's drug-addicted sister and Brando's girl-friend, is at her rawest. And a young Pamela Franklin as the kidnap victim shines in a truly abusive role.<br><br>Raw acting, graphic brutality, realistic action, a surprise ending, and out-standing acting performances makes The Night Before The Following Day a Marlon Brando classic.","user":"angelsunchained","rank":[40,50]}]
