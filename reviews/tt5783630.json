[{"title":"A success","rating":9,"date":"28 September 2019","review":"The dialog and the photography go hand-in-hand in this delightful movie. Some of the acting might be a bit unpolished but I got totally into the dual conversations. A fascinating format for the writers subject.<br><br>The only thin part of this film that I really didn't care for was the interviews at movies end. Were they still acting or just being themselves? Doesn't matter really. It's still a grand film with some marvelous scenes of NYC.","user":"cekadah","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"A refreshing change of pace.","rating":7,"date":"28 August 2019","review":"With many films today, you get cookie-cut narratives and very little dialogue that has substance or meaningful interactions. This film has all those things. A great work that not only makes us question ourselves, but the relationships we've had or even will have. The Narcissists makes you think of your past and your future in or out of relationships with others. I really enjoyed this film and the honest narrative that looks at the pressures we place on ourselves and our partners in relationships. Great film.<br><br>A concise introspective about relationships.","user":"zysis","rank":[2,5]}]
