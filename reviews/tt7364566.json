[{"title":"Excellent","rating":9,"date":"13 May 2018","review":"I have watched a few documentaries about Callas over the years and this one still had many surprises in store for me. I thought the interviews and footage used were excellent. I had never seen her speak so much and, at times, lucidly about her life. You have the success and the solitude, the art and the love. There are also some exquisite arias. It is very moving, if you look carefully behind the facade.","user":"jonflynn1","rank":[26,27]},{"title":"Superb Documentary","rating":10,"date":"7 October 2018","review":"I don't think some of the viewers understand, this is Maria by Callas. This film contains no modern commentary, it is strictly focused on Maria Callas own memoir, performances, and TV interviews. Very well inserted footage of David Frost show, Callas performances, and news-clippings from the period of about 1947-1977. The film goes deep into understanding the demons that haunted Madame Callas, pressures from spouse, pressures from the Met, and other places of performance to continue to perform and please the masses.","user":"Tony Rome","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"splendid","rating":21,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"One of most impressive portraits of Maria Callas. lovely because it is answer to many expectations. explanation for the presence of her name with same intensity today, like yesterday. her vulnerability - from the egocentric perspective about life and the people around her to the chance gived by Pasolini. a film who escape to the temptation to be a pure eulogy/hommage. a film defined by the emotions you feel. more than by other pieces. so, a splendid work.","user":"Kirpianuscus","rank":[15,15]}]
