[{"title":"Before Broadway, There Was The Movie","rating":10,"date":"13 December 2001","review":"A down-on-his-luck Broadway producer, Max Biolystock (Zero Mostel), is reduced to funding his shows by romancing old ladies for cash. Enter neurotic accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), arriving at Biolystock's apartment to do his books. Upon discovering that Biolystock had extorted $2000.00 from his last Broadway flop, Bloom, simply on a whim, mentions to Biolystock that he could've made a fortune on the flop if he'd only gotten more money from the old ladies. Needless to say, this revelation gets Max's mind working---get the old ladies to invest $1,000,000 on what Biolystock knows will be a surefire flop, then run off with the excess cash! Max convinces the gullible Leo to join him on the scheme, and off the two men go, on a crusade to produce the biggest disaster Broadway has ever seen. They come across a god-awful work written by a former Nazi (Kenneth Mars) called \"Springtime For Hitler,\" and decide to produce it. If it's a flop, Max &amp; Leo will become rich. But if it's a hit, they'll go to jail....<br><br>If you're one of the infinite many who've been unable to secure any of those scorching-hot tickets to Mel Brooks' current Broadway phenomenon, \"The Producers,\" there's always this, the original 1968 movie version to watch &amp; enjoy. This Oscar-winner for Best Screenplay is a comedy classic, and easily Mel Brooks' masterpiece, a brilliantly funny film that hasn't aged a bit. Zero Mostel &amp; Gene Wilder are hilarious &amp; perfectly cast as the con-artist producers, with terrific chemistry between them (just their opening scene together, including the great bits about Leo's blue blanket, and Leo terrified of being jumped on by Max, is already one of the great filmed moments of comic acting). Kudos all around to the rest of the cast, too: Kenneth Mars as the deranged Nazi playwright of \"Springtime For Hitler,\" Christopher Hewett as the no-talent gay director who only makes \"Springtime\" even more misguided than it already is, Dick Shawn in an outrageous performance as L.S.D., the hippie ham who lands the coveted role of Hitler (his audition song, \"Love Power,\" is a major highlight), and the gorgeous Lee Meredith as Ulla, Max &amp; Leo's dimwitted secretary. And then there's the \"Springtime For Hitler\" production number itself---yes, it's everything you've ever heard about it, a wonderfully hysterical \"you gotta see it to believe it\" moment in film comedy.<br><br>Mel Brooks' direction is spot on, and his hysterical screen writing here has never been better (though his co-writing with Gene Wilder on \"Young Frankenstein\" comes close). His Oscar win for the screenplay was very well deserved, indeed. \"The Producers\" is a timeless comedy classic, and the defining moment of Mel Brooks' long illustrious film career.","user":"Gazzer-2","rank":[75,86]},{"title":"Zany Mel Brooks comedy is over-the-top laugh riot...","rating":7,"date":"20 January 2007","review":"There are so many laughs in THE PRODUCERS (long before Mel Brooks lost his magic touch), that you'll be in tears by the time Brooks gets to his \"Springtime for Hitler\" routine. ZERO MOSTEL's early scenes with ESTELLE WINWOOD are hilarious enough, but he and GENE WILDER top themselves by the time you get to the frantic ending.<br><br>LEE MEREDITH is the curvy Ulla who can shake a mean hip and DICK SHAWN is the hilariously daffy Lorenzo St. DuBois (LSD for short), and everyone in the cast has a fine time delivering over-the-top performances in the spirit in which this sort of satire requires.<br><br>The story is simply that of a producer running short on cash who devises a scheme whereby if he produces the worst musical in the world, he can actually get his investment back and then some. He convinces his mild-mannered bookkeeper GENE WILDER to join him in the scheme and then the fun gets off to a great start.<br><br>The climactic \"Springtime for Hitler\" is just one of the delirious highlights (if politically incorrect by today's standards), and is probably the reason so many of the comments here resent the film and everything it stands for. But there's no getting away from it--the script is downright brilliant and original--winning an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and numerous other writing awards including an award from The Writer's Guild of America.<br><br>Summing up: Mel Brooks at his wittiest.","user":"Doylenf","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"\"Hitler was a great painter! He could paint an entire apartment in one day, . . Two Coats! \"","rating":8,"date":"2 April 2009","review":"Mel brooks' first attempt at directing is this film \" The Producers, \" originally entitled \"Spring Time For Hitler.\" It's the story of down and out producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), once known as the 'King of Broadway' who can't believe his incredible streak of bad luck. Once when the Moon of his Fortune rode high, he had Six shows running at once. However now-a-days he's so poor, he wears a Cardboard belt. Into his life arrives a timid little man named Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder). As an accountant, he makes a startling discovery. In his last play Max, raised more money to produce his show than he needed. As a result, Leo speculates Max could make more money with a flop, than with a hit. Max demands to know how and a crooked scheme develops. Max decides to find the worse play ever written. He will then hire the worse, director, the worse actors and then raise a $1,000.000 for a flop of a play which is sure to close the first night, allowing Max to keep all the rest of the money. This then is the plot and with Bloom becoming his partner, the pair plans on keeping the fortune. The movie which also casts Dick Shawn as 'L.S.D.' or Lorenzo St. DuBois, Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind, Christopher Hewett and Roger De Bris all combine to create a wonderful masterpiece of hysterical madcap comedy. It is with little wonder this film began as an unwanted idea and ended up becoming the surprise hit of the decade. A milestone for Mel Brooks, but a Classic for any audience. ****","user":"thinker1691","rank":[10,10]}]
