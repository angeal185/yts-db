[{"title":"REMARKABLE AND UNIQUE","rating":9,"date":"9 January 2020","review":"Missing Link is not missing anything, it has everything. A smart movie based on an old fashioned plot, but treated as it is brand new with some of the greatest characterizations of all time in animation-films stories and it gives us all a remarkable story, sensations and unique personality. Funny, amazingly designed and conceived (technically speaking), catchy direction on a pure-talented cast and again on an amazing story. One of the best animation films of all time, challenging and maybe winning the biggests we already saw.","user":"RinoBortone91","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"A charming entertainment based on an unusual epic","rating":7,"date":"19 April 2019","review":"An original and heterogeneous trio goes on an expedition in search of Shangri-La, during the Victorian era: 1) Sir Lionel Frost is a British adventurer who might be considered as the perfect mix of the professor Otto Lidenbrock from Journey to the Center of the Earth (Jules Vernes, 1864) and Indiana Jones (Steven Spielberg, 1981-2008), 2) Adelina Fortnight is a wonderful widow with character and 3) Mr. Link, a caveman as ingenuous as touching, a kind of missing link between us and our ancestors, is desperately looking for a soul mate.<br><br>The drawings are remarkably successful and the story is riddled with madcap plot twists. Given the kinship with the exquisite <a href=\"/title/tt4302938/\">Kubo and the Two Strings (2016)</a> and the excellent <a href=\"/title/tt0327597/\">Coraline (2009)</a>, I probably hoped for better. Nevertheless, this zany story of adventurers addressing such important topics as friendship, trust or recognition, is overall a success that I really appreciated. I was obviously not the only one to laugh, in the movie theater.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[36,47]},{"title":"Beautiful stop motion but a boring story","rating":6,"date":"27 April 2019","review":"Missing Link is plagued by over-simplified caricatures of protagonists and even worse antagonists. The lack of depth reaches into its comedy too, with a joke repertoire that seems to restate itself over and over again. The first act introduced some interesting characters and had some funny moments, but by the end I was fairly disappointed because there was no growth from there. The impressive stop-motion animation was brilliant, and saved this film.","user":"jackgdemoss","rank":[34,45]}]
