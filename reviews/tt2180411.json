[{"title":"Wonderful musical and great film adaptation!","rating":10,"date":"23 March 2015","review":"Okay, first of all, let me address the 1-star crowd. Yes, it's a musical. How could you not know that it was...this musical's been around for nearly THIRTY YEARS NOW! Ahem. Okay, yes, it has dark elements, including references to pedophilia. THIS WAS IN THE ORIGINAL MUSICAL! In fact, Disney toned it down severely! Horrible score? Tell that to Sondheim - he wrote the pieces (and won awards for them)...sigh. Some people just don't \"get it\".<br><br>This is the first film adaptation of \"Into the Woods\". Several others had been contemplated, worked out, even started casting for, but this is the only one that was ever completed...NOT because it was \"horrible\" \"awful\", or whatever, but because it was such a daunting task! I thought that this movie was a wonderful work of art that addresses a lot of life issues (after all, Sondheim is also a noted psychologist). Others were upset that it was a musical. Oh, boo-hoo. People are singing their lines. How un-Disney-like.<br><br>Okay, I will agree with one point: It is NOT your typical Disney fairy tale. Nope. Not at all. Instead, it's more true to the original Brothers Grimm stories...let me repeat that...true to the original Brothers Grimm...if you don't know what I'm speaking of, if you think Snow White was about dancing dwarfs and tweeting birds, then you really need to visit a library.<br><br>People are screaming up and down that this is most definitely NOT a family film. Um...hello? Do you even know what \"PG\" stands for? It means \"Parental Guidance suggested\"...this means that you, as a parent, should decide if it's right for your child to view. In other words, BE A PARENT! Sheesh...<br><br>Okay, enough of that.<br><br>\"Into the Woods\" is a musical. If you don't like musicals, don't watch it.<br><br>\"Into the Woods\" is a blending of different fairy tales from their original DARK, FOREBODING, DISTURBING perspectives. If you want butterflies and songbirds and happily-ever-after, go watch the earlier Disney greats.<br><br>\"Into the Woods\" is dark. It's creepy. It's disturbing...and it's great. You just need to be in the proper frame of mind. I knew what I was getting into, and I loved it. If you're expecting \"heigh-ho, heigh-ho, it's off to work we go\", you aren't going to like it.<br><br>This movie isn't for everyone, true enough, but for those of us who \"get it\", it's WONDERFUL!","user":"makingwaves-184-509826","rank":[259,361]},{"title":"Excellent Adaptation. All the Hate is Unjustified.","rating":10,"date":"24 January 2015","review":"I have seen both the original Broadway play and this film adaptation, and I can gladly say that this lives up to the original's reputation. The only major change is with one aspect of Rapunzel's storyline.<br><br>There are 3 types of people who hated the movie: <br><br>1. Parents who thought this isn't suitable for kids. Well, this doesn't say anything about how good the movie actually is. Yes, not all the content is for kids; heck the original isn't meant for kids at all. Even then, I don't think its that worrisome. If you think it is, just don't let your kids watch it; but you can enjoy the story. <br><br>2. Fans of the original who are complaining about every little change. People, its an adaptation; certain things need to be changed when transitioning to a different medium of storytelling. And some of the small changes are actual improvements to the original. <br><br>3. Those who weren't expecting a musical. I don't get this one. If you don't like musicals, fine! But you can't rate it 1 star just because its a musical!<br><br>If you are looking for a typical Disney movie, look away. But if you care about originality and want to witness familiar stories in a different light, this is it. It has Disney characters but uses them to deliver a more realistic and mature point of view about the world. The story as a whole has some really good messages, but people seem to be stuck up on the fact that it defied their expectations. As Into the Woods points out, your actions have real consequences and sometimes your wishes come true but not quite in the way you expected. Be ready for an unexpectedly twisted journey...<br><br>\"Into the woods- Each time you go, There's more to learn Of what you know.\"<br><br>10 Stars!","user":"enigma9119","rank":[93,134]},{"title":"So close to greatness, yet so maddening. (spoilers)","rating":7,"date":"27 December 2014","review":"I saw this movie, and everything was *awesome!*...<br><br>...until Act I ends. <br><br>Before I get to negatives, let me say the music is very faithfully reproduced here. The singing is good (in some cases great), the acting is good, the costumes and \"sets\" are also often good. Everything was in place to make this the definitive version of Into The Woods...<br><br>...and then they threw Act II out the window. <br><br>People unfamiliar with the musical might not notice or care about the changes to Act II (or technically Act III), but fans of the musical should be warned that this show is completely drained of all gravitas and pathos. Also, several wonderful songs have been cut- it will tick you off. <br><br>SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!<br><br>So if you've seen the musical, you know how Act II goes. More importantly, you know the great songs there. Well for some reason (PG rating, perhaps), Disney has cut everything about Act II that gives the entire show meaning. <br><br>#1- Rapunzel does not die. This ruins the Witch's arc in Act II. No reprise of Children Don't Listen, and the witch leaves the movie rather abruptly in Last Midnight. And of course, Rapunzel is almost completely pointless to the story now, since nothing bad ever happens to her and her prince stays happily married to her, which brings me to...<br><br>#2- No second \"Agony.\" This was my favorite song in the damn show, and they cut it. Of course, the cut everything building up to this too- We don't get to see the princes and their wives tire of married life, nor do the baker and his wife, which comes to...<br><br>#3- The Baker and his wife have no troubles in Act II. There's no fall from grace for these two- they never have to deal with a stressful marriage. The wife only kisses the prince (no sex), and the action leading up to that point is far from justified. Her lyrics about \"And/Or/Both\" are groundless here- it's still a fun song, but there's no reason for her to be singing it. <br><br>#4- No Narrator. He shows up as an apparition, but does not get to sing \"no more,\" which is the other best song in the musical. This also hastens the Baker's journey- while he still hits the main points of his arc, we're denied any real struggle here. <br><br>#5- Arguably, the entire point of the musical is missing. The stage version breaks down \"happily ever after\" and teaches a real lesson about loss and how gray the world really is. The movie...does not. <br><br>So I can't really recommend this to fans of the musical, unless you can accept the loss of Act II. People unfamiliar with the musical might still enjoy it.","user":"DarthPaul85","rank":[188,294]}]
