All I can say is the writer, director and Eisenherg had all of their friends and acquaintances sign up and give 10 stars.<br><br>The movie never goes anywhere and has no purpose. The characters have no purpose and accomplish nothing besides digging a hole. It is so nothing. Lol. I would rather watch the season finale of Lost once a week for the rest of the year than watch this again.<br><br>It was sooo bad I showed my kid the highlights, took less than 5 minutes.<br><br>I gave it 2 stars just because it was bad enough where I was inspired to sign up and write this review.","user":"bnhnicholls","rank":[189,284]}]
