[{"title":"Well made, thought provoking entertainment","rating":8,"date":"8 April 2018","review":"The film about the life of a young woman from rural area of the Philippines. She lives with her father who wants to prepare her for adulthood and teach her to be self sufficient. The world turns out to be far more complicated and dangerous than she can imagine at her age. Her actions will eventually draw the attention of local authorities. She and her father appear as victims of a police force whose priorities are at odds with the interests of the community.\nRather than spelling out every detail, a subtle symbolism carried the events along as we are allowed, for the most part, to draw our own conclusions.","user":"bogus-bogus-one","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Another Difficult Film","rating":8,"date":"5 January 2019","review":"This film, was difficult to watch after recently seeing \"Despair\". Both portrayed the insane brutality, of which we humans are capable. While \"Despair\" was obviously a contrived work of fiction, \"Birdshot\" showed a very real situation in the world, where groups feel threatened enough by those in power above them, to abandon their ethical or \"moral\" principles to survive. It makes me ask,\"Who started this chain of submission and why did no one try to stop it, before it got out of control ?\". I think of Soviet Russia and how \"Party\" members murdered so many of their own citizens under Stalin's orders. How far down the hierarchy did this have to go , until it was too late to reverse it ? Are we so needy for social standing and recognition, that we will go along with hideous acts to satisfy this ? Do we value our brief and inconsequential lives so much, that we will not risk them to save so many others, from \"immorality\" ?. This film, within a very small milieu brings up these difficult questions very powerfully.","user":"onlythusfar","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Thought provoking","rating":9,"date":"16 May 2018","review":"Fabulous movie, even more so when my Filipina wife shows me some related history around the storyline.","user":"roywynes","rank":[2,4]}]
