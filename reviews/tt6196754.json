[{"title":"A movie that is beautifully real","rating":10,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"What a beautiful movie. There are lessons in there that I will take to heart, hopefully for the rest of my life. Thank you. I am hopeful that I will grow and take action.<br><br>The actors, their emotions, their facial expressions, everything in movie, felt real. They truly have their craft down. Saying that feels like it's a mechanical thing, like a negative. It is not. They truly understand human nature, and it showed. Thank you.<br><br>I am so glad I watched this. GREAT job everyone. &lt;3","user":"huyzer","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"sincere and authentic","rating":8,"date":"27 February 2019","review":"This movie felt me like it's real in every way. Story is fairly realistic. I was sick of youth movies that everyone in it is throwing parties and they are sure about the life and seem they know everything what's coming. The girl character made me feel so sad. I just wanted to hug her and he hugged her as well in the end. It's a tv movie but it has more in it than a regular tv stuff should have.","user":"fatihkan1","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"great movie.","rating":6,"date":"6 January 2019","review":"This is good and family movie.loved to watch and it is just nice and good.\ngood plot about the family matters you know,totally drama and romantic.<br><br>great acting by Katherine C.hughes kinda genuine acting of her.lovely movie but end was supposed to be more great.","user":"yasir619","rank":[4,4]}]
