[{"title":"Maybe a comedy, definitely not about peace in the middle east","rating":27,"date":"27 November 2019","review":"Elia continues his brand of cinematic stream of consciousness. This one is an extremely subtle film that's hiding under obvious comedic veil.<br><br>I don't have many words to express how good this actually is, and I don't feel an urge to discuss my explanation of some of the scenes because that would be a waste of time.<br><br>It's a very \"meta\" film, from a true voyeur in an image-obsessed world. Homage from Elia to himself, Jacques Tati, and imperfect symmetry. Imperfect symmetry has been the visual key in a seemingly random collage of a story.<br><br>Oh, and people are absolutely clueless. And Elia probably hates Twitter and notifications.<br><br>The soundtrack is amazing as usual, but the editing is something else; unbelievably good.<br><br>Thanks Elia of Nazareth, with all the conclusions a word might have.","user":"duckburg","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Is Palestinian comedy an Oxymoron?","rating":7,"date":"5 August 2019","review":"Maybe the best response for an absurdist situation is to reflect back that same puzzlement. I suspect the \"p\" word puts off many viewers who want to watch a film without too many arguments. The idea that some kind \"Buster Keaton persona\" could be present at so many bizarre situations without launching an obvious rant of some kind is a tidy conceit.<br><br>Most of the time - that stance works. It does get stretched a bit thin as the locus moves from Nazareth to Paris and New York. Apparently Montreal was a location too but that wasn't obvious. That may have been intentional.<br><br>The film maker appears to be asking us to makes some comparisons between international scenarios and the Palestinian politics. There is very little spoken dialogue in the film itself.<br><br>I liked the music and the general keystone cops sequence in Central Park but some of the other sequences are a bit more cryptic. On the whole the film does a great job of setting expectations and then flipping them for comic effect. Some of that comes across as self parody.<br><br>There are genuinely funny moments. I saw this at a film festival and I was delighted by it. It did make me think some more about the absurdity of the modern media and the milking of outrage rather than the more important discourse that we never quite get to.","user":"conannz","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Beauty, irony, fun and a heartfelt movie","rating":8,"date":"15 January 2020","review":"This is a movie that will bring you great delight, if you have a bit of patience; each scene is full of meaning, metaphors, symbols, and overwhelming beauty. Beauty of a country field or of an empty city, of the passers-by who seem on a catwalk, or of the nostalgic music. But it's not just pleasure, it's also fun and troubling at the same time, warning about the absurd taking over in all societies, about the disconnection in the middle of the crowd, about the fate of the artist who is left aside. There is hope though, as long as there are still people who care and who don't give up, like the director himself, faithful to his artistic choices, despite the pressure to take sides. The soul untamed by rules, like the angel chased by police in one scene. Oh, and the irony is everywhere, maybe at its best when Gael's character steps in. Pure joy of watching a movie with a heart. Definitely for authentic cinema lovers.","user":"alinemarie","rank":[4,4]}]
