[{"title":"Yes,they managed to do it.Worse than part 1.","rating":4,"date":"9 March 2016","review":"OK,it's not that part 1 was good,you actually knew it would suck,but the 2nd really grinds my gears. <br><br>You have in your hands a civil war,the final battle into the heart of the capital,and you spent 2 hours of your life watching your main character taking a walk in a war zone. <br><br>And with all that time strolling,you have no character development,for none of them,just a few moments that the movie is like \"Ok,from now on,that's how things are\". <br><br>I watched this for closure,i wish i hadn't.<br><br>I didn't expected it to be a great movie,just a good action one,and it failed.Miserably. For goodness sake,London has fallen had more character development than a book based quadralogy,LOTR had less walking..good riddance to the series.","user":"panayiotisblack","rank":[304,451]},{"title":"Well padded","rating":3,"date":"9 March 2016","review":"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a film without any artistic integrity. It was purely made to grab as much cash from its audience as possible. You can sense this in the film which does not have much of a plot, scenes that are purely filler and the story just crawls because the book that it is based on has been split into two which means more padding than a model wearing a Wonderbra.<br><br>Panem is in chaos Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) plans to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland.) Snow meanwhile wishes to spring a trap to finish off the rebels. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is volatile as he turns his anger towards Katniss. Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) the leader of the rebels who plans to usurp Snow as President has her own agenda. You could say she and Snow are two sides of the same coin.<br><br>Some of the action is humdrum and poorly lit and Katniss's use of the bow and arrow is almost laughable in this film. Given the first film in this franchise was a decent film, it has been disappointing to see the decline in quality to the sequels.","user":"Prismark10","rank":[217,342]},{"title":"Do not understand of the 10/10 brigade with respect to this film","rating":6,"date":"14 April 2016","review":"-- this review may contain spoilers --<br><br>How can a reviewer say \"not the best in the series\" and then give it 10 stars? 10 stars is perfection, not as good as perfection is not 10 stars... In my opinion it was far from perfect though not terrible.<br><br>I have loved the Hunger Games franchise but this film let me down. For much of the film it reminded me of Frodo's (boring) journey to destroy the ring except that Frodo actually does get there in the End. Katniss sets off to kill the president and spends most of the film trying to get there but then doesn't, in fact she is beaten by the resistance, who managed to get through all of those traps that she could not and still get there quicker. She then wakes up to find the war is over. The twist at the end is so well signposted that it doesn't take much inferring leaving the happy ever after.<br><br>Special effects and infinite arrow archery skills ultimately don't make up for the lack of story and obvious plot holes. I cannot fault any of the actors, they did the best they could with a bad script.","user":"stephen-ellwood","rank":[49,72]}]
