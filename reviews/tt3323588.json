[{"title":"Sexy slasher.","rating":5,"date":"24 July 2016","review":"This movie starts with a girl getting a beating from her boyfriend for accusing him of cheating while their infant child watches through a crack in the door. 18 Years later a group of halfwits are out clubbing in Sexy costumes (well the girls are anyway). After getting drunk they leave the club and decide to break into an abandoned store where it turns out a killer dressed as a bunny girl lives.<br><br>There's not much plot here but what do you want from a slasher? I suppose you want kills. Well it has those but they're all crammed into the last 20 minutes of the movie. I had to laugh at one girl who as soon as she turns up at the building gets murdered straight away. <br><br>The kill effects are actually really great with old school make up effects. One torture scene filmed by the killer has some really nasty effects in it although it loses the effect of being filmed by the killer when all the camera angles start changing and the killer appears on camera as well, whoops!<br><br>The acting is poor, the girl dressed as red riding is awful her voice was so annoying and her delivery was terrible. Humans just don't talk that way. The filming and sound aren't going to win any awards either, especially the sound which is really muffled for the most part.<br><br>I did really like the killer. The outfit was sexy and creepy at the same time. It's a shame she wasn't in the movie more.<br><br>Then at the end there's a terrible post credits scene that looks like it was filmed much later than the rest of the movie. Don't know why they felt the need to add this, maybe because of how short the running time is. Anyway it's pointless and adds nothing to the film.<br><br>Bunni is not a bad film. If your into slashers it's quite a fun one. If you're not into slashers I'd probably avoid this.","user":"Greenzombidog","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Disappointing slasher with some positive elements","rating":4,"date":"28 October 2019","review":"Getting together for a Halloween party, a group of friends decides to visit an abandoned store at the urging of a friend, but when they start mysteriously disappearing realize they've been led into a trap with a savage masked killer and must uncover a deadly secret to get away.<br><br>This one was a decent enough if flawed effort. Among the best aspects here is the rather chilling location used for the setting as the abandoned building gets worked over for great effect. The darkness, complete sense of disuse and disorienting outlay that allows them to get lost inside adds to the suspense alongside the various off-screen noises in the distance that alerts them to their being someone else with them. That leads into the shorter if no less thrilling stalking scenes taking out the group around the building which offers up the kind of shocking outbursts in the quick kills, featuring some great gore effects along the way. Along with the somewhat imposing outfit for the killer that's unique and original, there are some enjoyable aspects at play here. There are some big flaws here. The main problem here is the utter and outright stupidity present that causes the entire film to occur as it does. That has several problems as there's little reason to have this group be friends at all since there's little connection made between them as the decisions to keep staying there at the building are inherently lame. The continuous insults and put-downs aren't appealing or funny, the behavior of the horndog friend is aggravating to the point of being unrealistic that he would be around their prissy nature and the general stupidity of the group not to realize that the noises they hear around then would be someone else with them so the ignorance of staying there shows through. All told, these elements showcase the utterly lame and frustrating nature of the characters. The other issue here is the low-budget production that shines through here. The fact that the continuous close-ups on the characters' faces keep happening to hide where they are grows increasingly aggravating as it happens during the stalking scenes at several points in the film gives away the idea of the budget quite well, much like the shaking camera that keeps popping up. That makes for a disorienting time as the inability to see what's going on during these scenes is incredibly distracting and takes you out of the film easily. The brevity is also important to that factor, running out of steam easily and just ending without much fanfare. Lastly, the tacked-on finale helps this by running forever just to get a twist that doesn't work and is there only to spread the length out in the film. On the whole, these are what hold the film back the most.<br><br>Rated Unrated/R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence and Brief Nudity.","user":"kannibalcorpsegrinder","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Sexy costumes","rating":7,"date":"12 June 2016","review":"About the best thing that this movie had going for it were the outfits the girls in it were wearing, but then that's just my opinion. If you don't like 'sluts' in movies then you might want to give this one a miss.<br><br>It is a short B-movie horror, at only about an hour long with credits that seem to be 10-20 mins on top of that. I think they contain scenes of what happens to the main character, who I call Queen Bee because she was dressed up as a bee, after the night of horror and its pretty much optional whether you want to watch them or not. She wasn't a character I cared about so I didn't bother.<br><br>Roughly 40 minutes into the movie saw a death match between Queen Bee and Bunni, and it was pretty obvious Queen Bee was going to win it as she was the 'good girl'. Would have rated this movie higher if it had some sort of plot twist from there.<br><br>What finally sealed it that Queen Bee wouldn't die was that she announced she was pregnant. I slightly chuckled as I thought she was lying so Bunni wouldn't kill her. This made the ending even more obvious as a pregnant woman never ever dies in a horror movie. Soon as she says \"I'm pregnant\" you can bet your life she will still be alive and the end and the final scenes will be some cheesy garbage with her in hospital holding her baby in her arms and grinning like an idiot.","user":"capelladewdrop","rank":[2,5]}]
