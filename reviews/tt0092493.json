[{"title":"Adventure romance that's every bit as fun as the original","rating":9,"date":"6 May 2006","review":"When I saw the low rating this movie received, I was flabbergasted and knew I had to comment. What on earth does it take to entertain people these days? The Australian outback's Mick Dundee is surely one of the cinematic world's most charismatic characters and amusing adventurers. Here he's back in a sequel that's every bit as fun as the original tale.<br><br>The previous movie begins in Australia and then moves to New York. By contrast, as this film opens, Mick is settled in New York with his beautiful journalistic girlfriend, Sue Charlton. However, Sue's ex husband is murdered in Colombia after taking pictures of a drug cartel's dealings. He has sent these photos to Sue, resulting in her being kidnapped by Rico and the other drug hoodlums. Mick must come to her rescue and the pair then head for safety to HIS terrain Down Under, naturally pursued by the gangsters.<br><br>As in the original, there's plenty of fun in the sequel. Mick's assault on the drug kingpin Rico's house, assisted by a likable but very amateur young gang, makes for some pretty entertaining scenes. Once Down Under, it's non stop pranks cooked up by Mick as he &amp; his 'sheila' traipse around his own bush 'estate', with the urban villains hot on their trail (and often vice versa!). Suffice it to say, some of Mick's crazy antics almost make you feel sorry for the bad guys! <br><br>Sue Charlton (played by actress Linda Kozlowzki) always looks lovely and perfectly groomed, whatever the bush conditions! Once again, the chemistry between her and Mick sizzles throughout the tale. Mick's bumbling but totally endearing sidekick, Wally, is back and there's also a couple of amusing aboriginal characters. As for Mick himself (actor Paul Hogan), he still has the same charm and affability as in the original. This time he's really having the time of his life with the villains. Don't listen to the naysayers, it's a highly entertaining yarn. The next sequel, Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles, is definitely watchable...I can never resist Mick...though not quite up to the same standard.","user":"roghache","rank":[30,33]},{"title":"A Very Good Sequel","rating":8,"date":"11 January 2006","review":"I know I am in the minority here but I actually liked this sequel better than the original...and the original was very good and extremely popular.<br><br>Maybe I was biased because I played this with some kids present and was pleasantly surprised to hear almost no profanity, which I couldn't say was the case in the first film. It was a \"cleaner\" movie, and still an equally entertaining one with a good mix of drama, action, comedy and even some good music thrown in. The film has no lulls and 110 minutes go by pretty quickly.<br><br>The first half of this movie takes place in New York City, where we last saw \"Mick Dundee\" (Paul Hogan). The second half, the crocodile man takes his bride (Linda Kozlowski) back to the outback in Australia. Hogan was never more entertaining and, of course, feeling comfortable back in his home territory.<br><br>This is just a fun ride all the way and, yes, to use a clich√©, good family entertainment.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[44,53]},{"title":"The Most Strangely Addictive Movie Ever Made","rating":10,"date":"14 February 2004","review":"If this movie is on TV, I will watch it all the way through.  I don't know why exactly, but I do.  It's got some strange hold over my psyche and it just won't let go.  It's nice to know that there are 111 other people who give this movie a 10.<br><br>If I remove myself from the addiction, I know it's more like a 7 or even a 6 but I have to acknowledge it's wonderous nature for an idle afternoon. Bravo, Mick.  Bravo!","user":"v22gamblor","rank":[41,54]}]
