[{"title":"Blown away","rating":3,"date":"13 September 2018","review":"Another silly and melodramatic Lifetime movie. Jo Flay's mother is seriously ill and in need of a liver transplant. However as the mother is an alcoholic, she does not qualify for the transplant.<br><br>Jo gets irate that her mother would die and attacks one of the nurses in the hospital. She is soon arrested and imprisoned.<br><br>When she is released, she vows revenge on the people who refused to treat her mother.<br><br>Luckily for Jo her father was an ace arsonist who taught her things like how to make a light bulb give off a toxic gas and then explode.<br><br>The disturbed Jo goes on a murder spree with some deaths that are deviously constructed. She also befriends the teenage son of the hospital administrator as she plans to kill him.<br><br>Actress Carlena Britch who plays Jo has a bad hair day. If the producers spent some time working on the script , this could had been a passable film.<br><br>The film is made in such as plain, mundane manner. The film soon ends after the choppily edited climax. I guess they run out of money.","user":"Prismark10","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Brutal","rating":1,"date":"5 July 2019","review":"Worst acting I have ever seen! I repeat ... worst acting ever!","user":"blownwideopen","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Abruptly ends","rating":5,"date":"25 April 2019","review":"At the very end of the movie, it just fades to black without any epilogue or revealing the fate of the main character. Why the sudden ending?<br><br>The movie itself is good afternoon watching for when there isn't anything else to watch, and I did find the storyline kind of interesting if a bit farfetched: a girl's mother needs a liver transplant, but as she is an alcoholic, she doesn't qualify. As a result of her death, the girl goes berserk and kills several people who she thinks might have had a hand in her mother's death.<br><br>While the main protagonist (antagonist?) has obviously done something very evil, it would've been nice if the movie at least closed with her rotting in prison, or something.","user":"NovaBrunswick","rank":[2,2]}]
