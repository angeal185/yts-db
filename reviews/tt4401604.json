[{"title":"A must for all you owl lovers out there.","rating":9,"date":"10 February 2016","review":"I have always thought owls are gorgeous creatures and I love that I live in a part of the world where they are amazingly common. Still, there is a ton I don't know about the animals and I was excited to see this episode of \"Nature\". It talks a bit about how ubiquitous and successful they are, but the main thrust is on the factors that make them that way. So, how and why the birds can fly so quietly and slowly is explored scientifically...as well as other qualities such as their amazing eyesight and hearing. What I loved, however, was seeing the owlets...and when they were raised by the scientists. It sure looked like a great job and the baby owls were captivating. One of the best films out there about owls. Well worth seeing, well made and fun.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"The Quiet Flyer's Kryptonite","rating":8,"date":"25 June 2016","review":"From their silent flight, to their radar-like hearing, to their astounding night-vision, to their unique appearance - I think owls (Yes. All 240 different species of them) are, without a doubt, one of the absolute coolest birds on the entire face of this planet.<br><br>And, with their amazing \"super\" abilities - I think owls put the likes of eagles, parrots and crows in a 2nd place position in the world of birds. I really do.<br><br>And, you know - Perhaps after watching \"Owl Power\" you just may find yourself in total agreement with what I say about these remarkable creatures-of-the-night. Yes. No doubt, you'll be completely surprised when you find out how many degrees an owl can actually turn its head around without any strain.<br><br>With its excellent camera-work and its educational narration - \"Owl Power\" is an impressive nature-production from PBS that is, most definitely, worth an 8-star rating.","user":"strong-122-478885","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Great documentary, if you love owls or not.","rating":8,"date":"18 October 2019","review":"If you are interested in owls or you just want to know almost everything about owls in one hour then Owl Power is the perfect documentary for you. Everything is well explained and the images are just stunning. From slow motion to normal speed, every aspect of those beautiful creatures are shown in this documentary. I probably learned more about owls in one hour than any school teacher could teach me in an entire year. For the cinematography alone this is already worth the detour. I want more nature documentaries like this one.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[0,0]}]
