[{"title":"ATM","rating":6,"date":"13 February 2020","review":"I didn't hate this movie and it was watchable. Was I not so bored, would I have bothered? Probably not, but once started, I wanted to see the end. The acting was very good. Surprisingly good given the reviews. The story line had promise. I think that's mainly what did this movie in. It was mostly well made. Just needed some oomph in the plot. The end scene was pointless without some history and I wasn't emotionally invested in the characters due to lack of back story.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[37,38]},{"title":"MidWest Bank's Help Guide","rating":3,"date":"17 April 2012","review":"Welcome to MidWest Bank's helpful guide on how to use our ATM vestibules! Please follow these tips to make the most out of your cash- wanting needs!<br><br>1. We understand that the modern lifestyle leaves little time for exercise. To help you, we recommend parking your car far from our vestibule and taking a walk across the car park. We even recommend this in sub-zero temperatures.<br><br>2. Like all banks we're really only in it for profit. This means that we don't bother paying for locks on our doors. This has the handy benefit of saving you time getting in and out.<br><br>3. Stay calm within our vestibules! Our security cameras are programmed to only film violent actions and gestures. At all other times, they just don't work.<br><br>4. We only install cameras inside the vestibule. There are none outside whatsoever, so if you want to fight – please exit and we hope you win!<br><br>5. We also don't install alarms in our vestibules. The absolute only way of setting off an alarm is by activating the fire-sprinkler system. Smash our machines all you want, as there will be no alarm! Our cameras will activate however – see point 3 above.<br><br>6. We pointlessly heat our vestibules at the moment. We don't build in any insulation, so most of this heat leaves within minutes. To save costs we will probably be removing all heating soon.<br><br>7. All our vestibules are in safe areas. Please feel free to leave your cars unlocked and valuables within, including cell phones and handbags. <br><br>8. Our security guards are hired from the finest stock of fat men that couldn't pass the police exam. We realise they are stupid, so we don't arm them either. But they do get a nice company car and a decent pension.<br><br>9. We really don't want our alarm to go off, so we install the sprinkler system high up and it can only be activated by heat. There is no way a solid blunt hit will smash the bauble and release the water and sound the alarm.<br><br>10. If you withdraw the maximum of $500 in one go you will automatically be entered into our free prize draw! The prize is a stylish Parka Coat to help keep you warm in our vestibules! <br><br>Latest winners have been:<br><br>Killer of Winnipeg – he says he spends a lot of time at our vestibules and this coat has greatly improved his activity there!<br><br>Janitor of Winnipeg – he often withdraws cash at our vestibules on his way to work. Just don't mistake him for Killer!<br><br>Security Guard of Winnipeg – one of our own employees! We even emblazoned this one with SECURITY to help make him feel special!<br><br>Banker of Winnipeg – however he busted up our vestibule so we will not be sending him his coat. <br><br>Yeah, I jest, but this film is a joke. Don't bother with it. If like plenty of other people you're tempted by the trailer, you've seen all the film has to offer.","user":"Rhapthorne","rank":[64,71]},{"title":"I can't even. Spoilers.","rating":1,"date":"27 September 2015","review":"So here's how the pitch meeting probably went: <br><br>\"So we're going to do a thriller, kind of like Phone Booth, but with an ATM machine. We're going to get the Buried writer on board and some young up-and-coming talent to play three saps who get tormented by a faceless killer who traps them in one of those stand-alone bank machine buildings in the middle of nowhere in the dead of night.\"<br><br>\"Okay, so far so good.\"<br><br>\"Except they're not trapped. Like the doors are unlocked and they can leave any time.\"<br><br>\"Wait so... what?\"<br><br>\"Don't worry about it, okay? They're just like, in there. And the killer, see, he has all these ATM schematics that we'll superimpose over the opening credits, Se7en-style, to show that he meticulously masterminded this whole thing.\"<br><br>\"Alright I'm listening.\"<br><br>\"Except he doesn't bring a weapon of any kind with him. Or tools. Like, he's planning on messing with the heat 'cause it's really cold out and he has to like clang around in the back there to turn the heat off and also flood the place--cause it's waterproof. He just gets the tools out of their car, see.\"<br><br>\"So he has their car keys?\"<br><br>\"Oh no, they have the keys in there with them. They don't make a break for the car while he's doing other stuff though, because they parked really far away for some reason.\"<br><br>\"I'm starting to see the logic of this. And of course they don't have phones in there.\"<br><br>\"Why would they? It's 2012, nobody has a cell phone.\"<br><br>\"Alright, I'm into this. And this killer--he's some disgruntled guy, right? Like we find out that our heroes actually wronged him somehow so what's happening to them is karma? Twist ending, love it.\"<br><br>\"Oh no, he's a total rando who goes around trapping people in ATM booths and the like because he's really bent out of shape about living in a storage container.\"<br><br>\"SOLD.\"","user":"NarcoNelly","rank":[34,37]}]
