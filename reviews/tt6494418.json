[{"title":"I wanted so bad to like this film..","rating":3,"date":"28 July 2018","review":"Ignoring the bad reviews this film was getting, I head to the cinema to give it a shot. The first scenes were okay, he's gotten into trouble, he's trying to find a friend otherwise he'll be in bigger trouble..Then all of a sudden he meets a girl and he sleeps with her in no time yet by the end of the movie he is willing to sacrifice himself and risk his life in order to save her.. So he basically found a woman in a village full of men and he managed to love her to death in 3-4 days? Also, Keanu and Ana Ularu share no chemistry whatsoever. Doesn't help that the writing didn't delve deeply into their characters in order to make us feel for them. By the end of the movie, I didn't care if either one was hurt because there was no depth. If you asked me to describe who Lucas Hill was I wouldn't know..<br><br>Of course there were plot holes and the whole plot was kind of weak but what annoyed me the most were the sex scenes. I wouldn't mind them if the film was branded as erotic. But this one tried so hard to provide the viewer with everything: action, romance, drama and it failed miserably.","user":"martax9","rank":[118,140]},{"title":"2 hours of my life that I'll never get back again.","rating":1,"date":"22 July 2018","review":"This film can only be described as a badly executed porn film. The acting is awful. The plot has more holes in it than a strippers fishnet tights and for the first time ever I was rooting for Keanu to get his ass kicked. Please, for the love of god, do not waste your time watching this film.","user":"yvonnefoulger","rank":[163,201]},{"title":"Ummm...","rating":1,"date":"3 August 2018","review":"I honestly cannot think of a movie that is worse than this one. It is boring as hell and the storyline doesn't make any sense. A high school student could produce a better film.","user":"fhuelster","rank":[97,120]}]
