[{"title":"Nothing original, terrible acting, nonsensical plot.","rating":1,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"This film is terrible, I am not a writer but could write a better film than this in 10 minutes. Nothing original, terrible acting, nonsensical plot. At the start it had potential to go somewhere but after about 20 minutes it went badly wrong.","user":"pauljamesessex","rank":[24,28]},{"title":"Just skip this one!","rating":2,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"The villain just got out of jail. Kills 2 people in front of his cop friend. Threatens a toddler at gun point in the park in front of his cop friend then goes shoot some hoops. Wow, this was bad. Bad acting, bad script, rushed storyline. Overall just bad.\nThese singers should just be left singing, leave the acting to actors.","user":"dieperdsegat","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"If you don't wanna go to jail FLEE...FLEEEEE...!!!","rating":3,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"We can't blame Trey for starring in this ridiculously written horrible movie...I'm sure he needed to get that bag...This movie was not good in anyway, shape, matter or form...and the acting was 110% HORRIBLE...and anybody who says any different is either friends or family with the cast or crew...or simply not that bright...I can't even tell you all of the stupid things that transpired in this film because it would be me telling you the entire movie bit by bit...It's a revenge movie...4 boys commit a robbery of sort...3 run away...1 stands there and doesn't run...he goes to jail...then has the audacity to want revenge for doing 15 years in prison...WHAT...?
