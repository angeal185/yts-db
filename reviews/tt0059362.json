As a product of its age, it convincingly portrays an image of 'swinging London' that so dominated the media at that time. It is an enduring image, which has long since seeped into our collective consciousness.<br><br>Today, The Knack appears, at best, to be an attempt at understanding the changing moral landscape that was being radically redrawn during this era. As a piece of contemporary film making, it manages to capture the spirit of that age perfectly. What it doesn't necessarily do is make sense of it all. The 1960s was, after all, a period of rapid social and political change - an age of cold war tension, supersonic invention and lunar landing pretensions, combined with increasing freedom for teenagers, both in terms of sex and spending power.<br><br>The quartet of principal actors, Crawford, Tushingham, Brooks &amp; Donnelly all give bravura performances.  Richard Lester's direction was exemplary; indeed, he has probably not made a better film since those heady days. The locations, featuring some rather dingy-looking parts of the capital, look all the more so thanks to the decision to film in monochrome.  This was particular brave considering the colourful times the film was depicting. The one ingredient which most of all created the sense of playfulness indicative of the film was John Barry's wonderfully mischievous jazz-tinged pop score. One cannot imagine the film without it, which is the highest compliment one can pay to a film soundtrack.<br><br>There is no doubt that The Knack was and remains a stylish movie, albeit rooted in its time.  No viewer can fail to date its origin correctly ... yet that's precisely what makes this celluloid time-capsule such a fascinating viewing experience.  It exists as the archetypal mid-sixties art-house movie, which, like the decade in which it was written, took risks, dared to be different, and, if it didn't always succeed, sure as hell made an impression.","user":"GeoffLeo","rank":[35,44]},{"title":"Misunderstood, Under-appreciated, and Overrated","rating":7,"date":"7 April 2008","review":"A steady stream of very attractive and nearly identical manikins come to life and march starry-eyed around the block and up the stairs to a flat where they briefly meet the object of their desire before dutifully signing his guest book on the way out. The man they came to see is the suave Lothario who will try to mentor the socially awkward teacher living downstairs in the \"knack\" of seducing women. As so often happens in situations like this, they will eventually end up competing for the affections of the same intriguing ingénue.<br><br>This may sound like an overused cliché likely to result in a formulaic romantic comedy, but director Richard Lester gives us something very different as he presents the story through a combination of exaggerated caricatures, fantasy sequences and zany metaphors. The result is that we are not so much interested in the details of the story as we are in the fun we have reaching the inevitable conclusion and the social commentary we encounter along the way. <br><br>Created in 1965, Lester makes a hefty contribution to the creation of a frenetic visual style of comedy which will be imitated with great commercial success throughout the rest of the decade (think \"Laugh-In\"). With its mod styling, rapid-fire editing, non sequiturs and wacky antics, Lester effectively uses this style to provide some wickedly clever parody of early 1960s sexism, conformity and consumerism.<br><br>The film is unfortunately not without some serious flaws. The comic style which may have seemed fresh and exciting at the time has not aged well. The good-natured mood of the film robs the social commentary of any punch or staying power, as does the failure to integrate it into a unifying framework. Also, the four main characters may be wonderfully portrayed with excellent comic acting, but only one of them is scripted such that he ever becomes human enough for us to care what happens to him, something which is essential in a story that is entirely about the relationships between the main characters.<br><br>One may find this to be a very enjoyable and memorable film in spite of these flaws, but it clearly requires that you recognize how to accept what it attempts to offer rather than criticizing it for what it doesn't deliver. I'd also think that it's a valuable film for anyone interested in the 1960s mass media image of a mostly mythical swinging London and in the trends influencing popular entertainment during that time period.","user":"bobc-5","rank":[26,32]},{"title":"\"Skirt is meat!\"","rating":10,"date":"1 November 2008","review":"As the '60's progressed, a sea change took place in British film comedy. Norman Wisdom and St.Trinians were suddenly out-of-date ( though they kept on going for a few more years ), and a new wave of Britcoms appeared, among them 'The Knack'.<br><br>Richard Lester had just made 'A Hard Days' Night' and brought the same mindset to this picture. Coming a year before Time magazine published its famous 'Swinging London' article, it depicts a Britain on the cusp of a cultural and ( more importantly ) sexual revolution. As Spike Millgan later put it: \"Queen Victoria died in 1960!\".<br><br>It is arty ( shot in glorious black and white ), sexist, often irritating, yet manages in its own way to say something serious about human relationships.<br><br>Michael Crawford stars as 'Colin', a shy, repressed schoolteacher brassed off because his boarder, the good-looking 'Tolen' ( Ray Brooks ) has a knack for 'pulling the birds'. Tolen is the Russell Brand of his day; girls are literally queueing outside his room at all times for sex. Tolen offers Colin a masterclass in the art of seduction.<br><br>Tolen's attitude to the fairer sex is: \"I see, I want and I take\", the sort of chauvinistic attitude probably responsible for Women's Lib in the first place. But even his powers are about to be tested to the limit when along comes Nancy ( Rita Tushingham ) a Northern lass newly arrived in London in search of lodgings. Nancy is immune to Tolen's 'Mr.Tight Trousers' persona, and when he tries to get fresh with her she cries 'Rape!'.<br><br>A number of reviewers have described the movie as 'dated'. They are absolutely right. But it is fascinating for that reason alone. It is now a quaint museum piece, the sexual attitudes and mores of the era are on view and are fascinating. It may surprise some to learn that the play on which the film is based was written by a woman - Ann Jellicoe.<br><br>Lester took the play and opened it out ( with help from screenwriter Charles Wood ), turning it into a visual delight. Surrealism had finally joined the comedy mainstream. The jokes come at you so fast you need to be quick to pick them up. For instance, when Colin wonders whether to let his front room to a monk, we suddenly cut to a bus full of monks. When he gets angry and tries to keep Tolen out of the house by boarding up the front door, the film turns into a mini-lecture on carpentry.<br><br>Throughout a Greek chorus of elderly people comment on events. \"I know what she's looking for and its not the Y.W.C.A.!\". Their remarks are much the same as you would hear nowadays. Being too old for sex themselves, they frown on the younger generation for being able to do it. Its these quirky flourishes that gives the film much of its charm. The famous scene where Colin, Nancy and Tom push a bed through the streets of London employs a style that was later used on 'The Monkees' and 'The Goodies'.<br><br>The cast are excellent, in particular Donal Donnelly as an eccentric Irishman with a mad compulsion to paint everything white. Michael Crawford's 'Colin' has all the naivety of his later ( better known ) role of 'Frank Spencer'. Tushingham's innocent waif is appealing. As 'Tolen', all quiff and dark glasses, Ray Brooks is the epitome of '60's cool, a man who has women falling for him like dominoes. Watching this again recently, it occurred to me what a great vehicle for Peter Cook and Dudley Moore this would have made. The humour is broadly in line with what the duo were doing on 'Not Only But Also'. You can easily imagine Cook as 'Tolen' and Moore as 'Colin'. Perhaps these characters inspired the ones they later played in 'Bedazzled'. <br><br>The film has its share of longueurs, however. Colin pretending to be a lion is something I think it could have done without. And Nancy's cries of 'Rape!' to passers-by have ensured it a high place on the 'it has not aged well' movie lists. <br><br>'Comedy has a new freedom' gushed Newsweek magazine at the time of its release. Absolutely. Rather than being brushed under the carpet, sex was now openly talked about on screen. There was to be no going back. Nudity and bad language would soon enter the equation.<br><br>I must mention John Barry's marvellous score. He was on the top of his game here ( having just done 'Goldfinger' and 'Zulu' ) and the music perfectly accompanies the offbeat action. You will be humming that gorgeous title theme for days.<br><br>If you want a British movie that has 'Sixties' written all over it, look no further. It also manages to be a life-affirming, witty and accomplished piece of work.","user":"ShadeGrenade","rank":[15,18]}]
