[{"title":"Underrated. 7 of 10.","rating":7,"date":"5 July 2002","review":"The plot starts out in a very straight-forward manner: a man with an ambition to become criminal legend kidnaps the daughter of a congressman right out from under the nose of the FBI. He then sends a note and a sneaker of the girl to Detective Alex Cross, hence forcing him out of his self-inflicted isolation, the reasons of which are explained in the opening scene. Along with the FBI agent who was in charge of security at the scene of the crime, he follows the clues laid out by the kidnapper in order to find the girl. And so the story goes. <br><br>The kidnapper is portrayed by the always formidable Michael Wincott, the best serial villain on that side of the Atlantic. He should have the Best Supporting Role awards piled up in his attic. Alex Cross, whom we remember from \"Kiss the Girls\", and portrayed by Morgan Freeman, is just the kind of cop you like best: sincere, sympathetic, intelligent, thorough and committed. Monica Potter features as the FBI agent determined to redeem herself after she let the kidnapper escape. <br><br>This may not be a blockbuster, but this solid and underrated thriller delivers what so few of them have to offer these days: a final plot twist that genuinely surprises. It shall not be revealed here.","user":"Nahret","rank":[53,63]},{"title":"Does What A Thriller Should, No More, No Less","rating":29,"date":"29 May 2001","review":"\"Along Came A Spider\" works.  It may suffer from one plot twist too many, it may borrow liberally from other pictures, it may have narrative holes you could run a horse race through, but in spite of all that, it WORKS.  And as everyone knows, that is about the highest compliment a film like this can be paid.<br><br>Directed by Lee Tamahori, \"Along Came a Spider\" hits the ground running with a bravura sequence in which a federal sting goes horribly wrong and a good agent dies.  Det. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman), the leader of the sting, goes into brooding isolation, but a year later, the daughter of a U.S. congressman (Michael Moriarty) is kidnapped from her prestigious Washington boarding school by a brilliant madman, and Cross, a mental wizard with the ability to see into the mind of the maddest psychopath, is the only one who can track the criminal's M.O. and save the girl.<br><br>Standard thriller territory, and it's given more or less standard treatment, albeit with a fair share of stylistic spark and energy.  Tamahori does a good job choreographing his action set pieces, particularly that shattering opening and a nifty cat-and-mouse chase that closes out the picture. Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti gives the film a dark, brooding visual richness, and Jerry Goldsmith contributes another thunderously effective thriller score.<br><br>The acting is also generally strong across the board.  Morgan Freeman.. what can one say?  I honestly cannot think of another modern actor who has done such consistently high-quality work.  Granted, Cross does not seem like a role that would overly tax a top-notch thespian like Freeman, but he doesn't sell it short either, giving the character his full, commanding force.  He is the tough, solid center that really elevates \"Along Came A Spider\" above pulp territory.  Michael Wincott plays the psycho (as naturally he would; what else is Michael Wincott going to play in a film?), and gives it his gravelly-voiced best, making us hate this guy just as much as we should. Monica Potter is fine as the young security officer helping Cross track the fiend, but I was constantly distracted by the fact that her voice sounds EXACTLY LIKE JULIA ROBERTS!  I swear, it sounded like she'd been dubbed. Am I the only one who noticed this?  Probably, so I'll drop it.<br><br>If there's any real complaint to be had with \"Along Came A Spider\" (aside from my weird personal difficulties with Monica Potter's voice), it is an age-old one for a thriller:  script problems.  Screenwriter Marc Moss keeps things moving nicely, and there are some clever moments throughout, but the film also raises unanswered questions.  What was the purpose of the weird Lindbergh website the kidnapper sets up?  When will they learn that internet-related plot devices just don't work in films?  What was the point of the Russian kid who seems to play such a big role in the middle portion of the picture?  Why did Moss feel the need to crib his most exciting sequence, a footchase with the maniac leading Cross through Washington via cell phone, from \"Dirty Harry\"?  Granted, I haven't read the novel by James Patterson upon which this film was based, so I may not be casting blame in the right place.  But Patterson didn't write this script, so maybe I am.<br><br>As I mentioned before, however, all of this largely doesn't matter.  In the moment, while it's unfurling in front of you, the film's fast pace, engaging performances, and visual polish keep you intrigued, and allow you to overlook the plot's more outrageous contrivances and awkward reversals. \"Along Came A Spider\" is not a perfect thriller, but brother..it WORKS.","user":"uglykidmatt","rank":[58,73]},{"title":"Hey give it some slack...","rating":6,"date":"6 February 2002","review":"I've been reading some of the comments for this movie, and think that many of you are over-critical. This is a psychological thriller, and plays it's part well. Morgan Freeman is one of my favourite actors, and he plays Detective Alex Cross very well. I enjoyed the movie on a thriller type basis. If you want to be critical about it not living up to the book's legend then fine... cause I'll be the first one to tell you that it's barely anything like the book. \"Along Came a Spider\" was a wonderful book and the character of Gary Soneji was compared to a spider... if anyone was wondering why the title was called that. I'm not one to bash movies unless they are horrible, and for those of you that think this movie is horrible... thats just your call. This movie is good, its just not the book. *** out of *****","user":"rye9969","rank":[33,42]}]
