[{"title":"Weak screenplay, lousy cast, bad directing.....","rating":18,"date":"18 February 2020","review":"\"Know Thyself\" is the big problem that most of the people with dreams should be take into consideration when they decided to do something they actually didn't have the talent to do it. In this movie, I've found out that almost everyone involved in making it, 'TALENT\" were extremely lacking; from the lame screenplay writer, the director, the casting agent, editors to all of the actors, none of them should continue considering stay in the movie making business.<br><br>What we saw in this lousy film are just overwhelmingly countless: The husband didn't look like a husband, the wife didn't look like a wife should be, the mother didn't like a mother, the actress who played the wife to her husband, the mother to her son, and the daughter to her mother, all the roles she played simply failed miserably. She was like a walking stiff, a cardboard rigid caricature, a zombie-like woman without any human feeling, to her husband, her son, even to her mother. She was the worst Chinese actor I've seen in recent years. The actor who played the husband role was also terrible and quite unlikable. As to the directing, what can I say.<br><br>This was such a painful viewing experience to me.","user":"LogicIsEverything","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"A poignant, emotional take on a universal dilemma.","rating":8,"date":"19 February 2020","review":"Even if an international audience is not aware enough about the history and the contemporary political details about the inter-relationship between mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, there is something universal about an artist's relationship with their country's laws of censorship. Having said that, audience from many perpetually liberal countries will have a difficult time appreciating a film like this - a film that has so many rough edges out of a humble production. If you have lived in a repressive state that treats its political dissenters with fierce spite, you can totally relate to the dilemma of a political artist - whether to conform and protect your family from state vendetta or to continue with your ideological battle even at the cost of putting your loved ones in trouble. The director of this film seems to tell their own deeply personal experiences, a rather absurd one at that, through a lens of fiction. Yet its connections to reality are deeply unnerving. There is little point in evaluating a film like this in terms of the quality of production, acting etc. Still the director has managed to unfold several subtle, poignant instances of human reaction. The characters appear all too real. Playing the protagonist must have been difficult for the actress - her character is an emotional mess, yet adopting a deadpan exterior to suppress all the anger inside. The occasionally brilliant screenplay doesn't say much, but suggests a lot- a trait I have often come to appreciate in cinema.","user":"shanbhattacharya_","rank":[0,0]}]
