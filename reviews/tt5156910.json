[{"title":"a new game is played by a group of players in a haunted house","rating":1,"date":"4 January 2017","review":"if I could have given a minus 1 I would.thought this was a great looking horror movie but from the start knew I had made a huge mistake.couple of the males acted well but the women were terrible,the policeman unbelievable and the whole plot stupid.least favourite part was the phone girl,wanted to rip it out of her hands.the plot wasn't made clear and the introduction of a couple in a car made no sense.A former actor being bought back made no sense either.the masks worn by the haunted house males were actually very good. LOVE horror,this was only fit for the cutting room floor. it looks like an old film but isn't and with the right actors and an understandable story line it could have been so good","user":"hotchocolatetb","rank":[21,21]},{"title":"Avoid for your own sake!!!","rating":1,"date":"22 July 2017","review":"6.4 IMDb? Really..!?? I am a true horror genre fan, but this was absolutely unwatchable, terrible acting, I tried to watch it for 10 minutes, then I realised it was getting even worse, so I started to fast-forward it just to see if there is something interesting about it. Believe me, there's not! Keep away and don't waste your time...","user":"irene_j-892-280304","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"Films Can't Get Much Worse","rating":4,"date":"18 January 2017","review":"A haunted house attraction isn't generating revenue so they try a new angle with people playing Charlie Charlie instead. This game is a Mexican Ouija board sort of with two pencils balanced on each other forming a cross. You then ask Charlie yes or no questions. Five young adults play the game unleashing the Mexican demon.<br><br>This film is by the far the worst I've seen. The whole setup is just crap. I don't know who would pay twenty bucks to stack two pencils and watch them spin but that's just me. Charlie is always an unseen force (a blue laser light sometimes) that goes around killing everyone. The score is ripped from Full Moon's films and the acting is crap. This thing makes no sense and the ending didn't help.","user":"shawnblackman","rank":[22,23]}]
