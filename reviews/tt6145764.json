[{"title":"La Haine in London","rating":10,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"I lived in London for many years and this is one of the very few films that has portrayed the rough times during 2011 London Riots in such realistic and vibrant way. Superbly directed with great performances and no pretension.\nMore films like this should be made so that we are aware of what's happening beyond our bubbles...","user":"roseloren","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"Mundane and predictable","rating":2,"date":"17 June 2019","review":"Obviously this film has good intentions in telling the story that it wants to tell but unfortunately it falls flat with a way to familiar story I have seen told in films way to many times about how rough it is to be young living in an urban ghetto side of town. It was predictable mundane and at times a bit boring.","user":"fellini_58701","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Solid Seven","rating":7,"date":"29 November 2018","review":"Took a shot in the dark on this one and was pleasantly surprised. It portrays how wicked humanity has truly become.","user":"mspray11","rank":[4,7]}]
