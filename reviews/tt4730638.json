Don't waste your time.","user":"james-29524","rank":[32,34]},{"title":"Utter rubbish. Recommend not to bother watching.","rating":1,"date":"19 March 2020","review":"Script writing is super bad, story goes nowhere, no consistency in the character-arc (some times they are good, sometimes bad, no reason for anything change in motivation), nor character development. The story has more plot-holes than Swiss cheese. Clumsy directing, poorly shot scenes, endless, annoyingly loud dialogues, bad editing job. No budget at all on production design (the whole film set is just somebody's SUV, the poorly dressed actors, bad makeup - everything is poor and cheap). This is the worst film I have ever watched. Got it to see because of its imdb score but turned out to be a huge disappointment.","user":"tomjr-67482","rank":[36,39]},{"title":"Forreal?!","rating":1,"date":"14 March 2020","review":"A Native American curses the girls so they kill and brutally get rid of their token brown friend, while the black and brown cops aren't competent enough to detain both girls because they're star struck by a white football player. Wow tell us how you really feel.","user":"letitia-54231","rank":[38,42]}]
