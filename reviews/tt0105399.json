[{"title":"Twin Dragons is a uplifting extravaganza of fun and beauty","rating":9,"date":"14 February 2002","review":"Twins separated at birth meet again blah blah<br><br>But it's fun to watch and you get to see Jackie Chan's hilariously imaginative fight scenes!<br><br>With a couple of babes thrown in and the inadvertent swapping of partners from one twin to the other, you can but tempt to imagine the glorious fun that results. This is Jackie at his silly best, a dignified world-famous conductor in one role whilst a bumbling bad-ass mechanic in the other, we get to see how versatile, if unique, an actor he is.<br><br>For much of the film, both twins keep meddling in each other's lives causing havoc and confusion without knowing the cause until finally they come face to face...<br><br>I saw it 10 years ago, several times because of its watchability. The soundtrack was excellent -- I still remember some of the tunes now.<br><br>\nFeeling down, need a lift? This flick will rejuvenate your spirit for open-hearted fun living.<br><br>9/10","user":"serf9","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Long lost brothers take on thugs","rating":7,"date":"4 April 2000","review":"Lots of karate antics, action, and lovely ladies as 2 Jackie Chans' try to outfox a band of hooligans intent of their demise. Slapstick humor all the way as Chan escapes one impossible to escape mess after another. This was a funny film, but it got a little trying at times keeping up with who was who.","user":"helpless_dancer","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"my favorite Jackie film","rating":9,"date":"7 July 2003","review":"My favorite Jackie Chan film, a showcase for his physical skill and personal charisma.  It has the right amount of fighting without becoming boring and monotonous; it has the right amount of comedy without being over the top. The sex farce is played like Feydeau and yet is handled deftly enough to allow one to take one's older children without squirming on anyone's part. Great!","user":"DanStarkey","rank":[6,7]}]
