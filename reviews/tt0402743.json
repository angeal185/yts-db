[{"title":"A great way to spend an evening...","rating":6,"date":"20 May 2006","review":"I have a category of movie I call a \"Good, bad movie\". You'll either get that statement or you won't. If you are a real movie buff, you'll appreciate the value of a good, bad movie. This is a really cool twist on the Big Foot mythology. I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel and I expected some of their usual crapola. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Certainly this isn't a masterpiece or anything. But for the obviously small budget, it was very well done. The FX were cheesy, but adequate. The script was average. But the basic plot and the cinematography set a mood that really sucks you in. It's gripping, suspenseful, and doesn't drag or bore you. Matt McCoy (Preston Rogers) was quite good, exceeding his B list status. And Haley Joel (Amanda) didn't settle for being the dumb bimbo that this part was probably written to be. She actually had a touch of depth to the character.<br><br>If you want to huddle under a blanket with your significant other and have an entertaining, suspenseful evening, I recommend Abominable.<br><br>Also, make sure you don't miss the final scene. No spoiler here, but I have to say that the final shot of the movie was B movie brilliance.<br><br>Tachyon","user":"tachyon_1","rank":[47,56]},{"title":"Lo and behold, a good Sci Fi Channel premiere","rating":8,"date":"21 May 2006","review":"The movies that the Sci Fi Channel premieres on Saturday nights are a decidedly mixed bag -- \"mixed\" meaning \"bad, but watchable enough because it's free on TV\". That said, Abominable is probably the best one yet and one of the few that I wouldn't have minded paying for as a rental or even in a theater (well, matin√©e price). Basically, it's a monster movie spliced with Rear Window, with an \"abominable\" man-beast as the menacing killer -- a simple story wonderfully executed with quick pacing, a strong cast of character actors, and gloriously gruesome effects. You'll appreciate it all the more next week when Boa vs. Python vs. Komodo vs. Gerbil comes on.","user":"bruceleroy","rank":[40,52]},{"title":"Abominable","rating":6,"date":"1 March 2008","review":"\"I'm gonna need a bigger knife.\" <br><br>The Flatwoods Sasquatch terrorizes victims within the vicinity of his cavernous dwelling.<br><br>Wheel-chair bound cripple, Preston Rogers(Matt McCoy), still recovering psychologically from a tragic fall from nearby Suicide Rock which took the life of his wife, finds himself in quite the dilemma. Despite his wishes against returning to the cabin he shared with his wife, both rock-climbing experts who scaled Suicide Rock often, Preston is forced, thanks to his doctor who has assigned a smart-ass orderly Otis(Christien Tinsley, who imbues his character with a smarmy attitude)over his care, to confront what ails him. Instead, Preston helplessly watches as the rotund furry beast attacks a female group gathering together, across the way in another cabin, for a bachelorette party. Attempts at getting the police(..and Otis) to help fails because no one believes such a wild story as a Sasquatch on a violent rampage. Somehow, Preston will have to take matters into his own hands..but, how can he? And, what if the Sasquatch comes after him? How will he defend himself when he's limited by his disability? And, how can a wheel-chair bound cripple ever help others in need? <br><br>REAR WINDOW is mined yet again for inspiration, but I felt the story-line was effective..I thought there were some suspenseful moments thanks to the benefits of having a crippled hero, limited in ways he can help those in trouble due to his lack of mobility. Through Preston, we're helpless on-lookers towards those who are assaulted by the Sasquatch. The unrealistic Sasquatch, which looks like a costumed beast, can either be a liability or a gas depending on your mood. There's a sense of fun at work here if you can look past the limited resources director Ryan Schifrin has..he delivers an entertaining little creature feature with plenty of gory carnage to satisfy gore-hounds. One victim's body is pulled through a small window, from the waste snapping her frame in two. One female victim is crushed under-foot by the Sasquatch. Another's face is completely eaten off. You get to see Tiffany Shepis completely nude, taking a shower. Recognizable faces, in small roles, populate the film such as the late Paul Gleason(THE BREAKFAST CLUB)as an ornery sheriff, Jeffrey Combs as a chain-smoking gas station employee with tubes feeding him oxygen from a can(..quite scraggly under frizzled hair, dirty cap and grubby beard), Dee Wallace Stone as a terrified wife who accompanies her husband outside finding their horses ripped apart, and Lance Henriksen as a cynical hunter who \"just wants to kill something\"(..he supplies a very funny \"Darwin's awards\" monologue).","user":"Scarecrow-88","rank":[9,10]}]
