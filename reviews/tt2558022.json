[{"title":"Really not bad as people as making it sound to be","rating":6,"date":"11 June 2016","review":"I expected something really bad, but it was surprisingly good, yes its cheesy, but for people who are into gaming too its quite enjoyable, the entire movie follows a FPS pattern, even the story unfolds like a game. There's the dumb NPC s , the cannon fodder, the big bad villain in the end, and some surprises in between for the conspiracy nuts... it even pays homage to some games, like at one point the protagonist picks up a crowbar and says hes gonna go freeman on the zombies ass... and at many points it reminded me of Castle Wolfenstein... All in all it was a good time pass movie provided you are looking for pure mindless violence and fun.","user":"debabrata4747","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"amateur movie, not worth a penny","rating":2,"date":"29 September 2015","review":"saw it on the premier screening at a festival a few days ago. but what can I say... no suspense, incredibly bad actors (bad English too), boring story, lame 3D. typical trash coming from Germany. after 10 minutes it just gets plain boring and repetitive. <br><br>2 points for the nice locations and a few splatter moments. but calling this a film is actually pretty weird. if you are fan of amateur trash in 3D you might want to give it a try, but don't waste more than a dollar or two for it. but there are much better ego-shooter films or even fun splatter films out there.<br><br>too bad... the director seemed pretty sympathetic on the q&amp;a. :(","user":"thomasbayer","rank":[18,32]},{"title":"Well, I liked it.","rating":7,"date":"30 August 2017","review":"I knew nothing about this title when I sat down to watch it and I think that made a difference.<br><br>I found this movie fun and funny but I'm glad I didn't see it in 3D. There's no way I could have avoided being sick. It was uncomfortable enough watching in 2D.<br><br>The nausea aside, the movie was a good B-grade zombie flick. And not just zombies, nazi zombies. What's not to love? You know those freaking Nazis, always messing with some 'super soldier' formula and making mutants.<br><br>And then there's the alien. The alien looks like a guy who got lost on his way to a costume party. XD It's perfect. Some of the zombies look really good. Excellent makeup. I love the \"American\" soldiers with the German accents. Or were we not supposed to notice that? XD<br><br>Most of the acting is kind of wooden but it works because the entire movie is like the play-through of a video game and the acting is about on par with that.<br><br>In the end you literally get to partake in beating up the final boss : Zombie Hitler. (Because you KNEW he was in there somewhere) Also included: Some excellent movie reference puns. (Downfall, Predator etc)<br><br>I really enjoyed it. Good ending. Thumbs up.","user":"RandomFlux","rank":[4,5]}]
