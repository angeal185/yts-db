[{"title":"tip-top","rating":4,"date":"4 July 2003","review":"This is the ultimate Terry Thomas film. He gets to act out being the most wonderful cad, stealing girls off poor saps arms, driving open top sports cars are a furious pace, and generally getting the chance to utter 'hard cheese old boy'. Carmicheal is excellent, bewildered to begin with and slowly learning the dark arts of Upmanship. I implore all to see this film, as always the golden rule is - if a film as Alistair Sim in it, its got to be worth a look. Currently avialable on a 2 film DVD release, with another UK B&amp;W comedy classic. Buy and enjoy.","user":"ianginge","rank":[46,47]},{"title":"Hard cheese! A jolly good show!","rating":10,"date":"17 October 2004","review":"This fabulous film is available on DVD at last, twinned with another Alaister Sim classic, THE GREEN MAN. But, the star of this film is the dapper TERRY-THOMAS. Every scene he is in is superb. From the suave cad in the first half of the film to the flustered toff in the second, this is one of his finest performances and stands up to repeat viewings due to his expressive faces and masterful comic timing.<br><br>I hear there is going to be a Hollywood remake of this film, which will be a huge mistake as there has been no one like T-T since. I recommend anyone who is a fan of British comedy to see this classic or you will forever be crying 'hard cheese'!","user":"freddievalentine","rank":[49,52]},{"title":"A beautifully funny, nostalgic and fabulously-acted comedy of English moeurs.","rating":10,"date":"23 January 1999","review":"I cannot remember how many times I have watched this film now - it takes me back to a time of charming English etiquette which, being too young, I never witnessed.  The range of social situations through which we are taken in the apprenticeship of 'Lifemanship' are hilarious, and in a gentle and exquisitely-understated way.  Ian Carmichael is, of course excellent, but my all-time hero, Terry-Thomas, is on the toppest of forms delivering the \"Look's like a Polish stomach pump\" and \"Oh I say, smashing cricket stroke\" lines with his unshakeable aplomb.  A nostalgic treasure of a film.","user":"Richard-96","rank":[39,41]}]
