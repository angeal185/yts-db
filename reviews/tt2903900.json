[{"title":"Jim Vanbebbers' GATOR GREEN is GARBAGE,a Point of Contention for the Late HEIDI MARTINUZZI","rating":24,"date":"24 December 2014","review":"GATOR GREEN is GARBAGE. This JIM VANBEBBER \"Short\" uses a White actor in the racist minstrel style BLACK FACE makeup. Jim Vanbebber Tries to Mimic Robert Mitchum as Max Cady in CAPE FEAR,but DRASTICALLY misses the mark,and comes up with a Campy \"performance\". No story here unless you count the Clich√© 70's ABSURD \"Deranged Vietnam Veteran\" genre,which went OUT with \"Disco\" a LONG time ago.GATOR GREEN makes \"Plan 9 from outer space\" look like \"Gone With The Wind\",it's THAT bad.The Alligator used here is a Prop that wobbles around like \"Jello\" sitting on the wing of a 747 Aircraft.Vanbebber,incoherently mumbles to the Rubber gator throughout the short film,and it's been reported that an official from the local Florida Mental Health agency was busy doing research on Life imitating Art. This review contains SPOILERS but be warned...there's NOTHING to Spoil. GATOR GREEN was a \"point of contention\" for the LATE HEIDI MARTINUZZI who slaved as a caterer on this \"Short\" while making pasta on a daily basis,her last job in Schlock Cinema.","user":"zet1699","rank":[4,20]}]
