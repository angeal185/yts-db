[{"title":"Why so Low?","rating":8,"date":"10 December 2003","review":"Why is this movie rated so low?  I admit that it is the fourth in the series and that is getting pretty ridiculous but this one has many memorable moments in it.  Also where else can you go see Sharon Stone, David Spade, and a speacial appearance by a young kid at the time named Tony Hawke.  No where else can you get so many people in one of their first movies.  It is also still highly entertaining and causes me to laugh often.  This is where you should stop watching the series however b/c they lose Steve Guttenburg and he is the only reason the series kept on for as long as it did.  So don't give this a low score.  Help it get out of the lowest 100 where other real horrible films belong.","user":"iwatcheverything","rank":[21,31]},{"title":"Another great movie gangster of the 1980s – David Spade!!","rating":6,"date":"5 April 2009","review":"So what's happened so far? A gaggle of society's goofiest citizens have taken advantage of a new policy to loosen hiring standards at the police force and actually made it through despite efforts from all directions to get them thrown out. They embark on their first assignment, which is to turn around Commandant Lassard's beloved precinct 16, which has been dubbed the worst precinct in the city and given 30 days to turn around or suffer some major employee turnover, a fate which is relentlessly helped along by the eternally butt- kissing Captain Mauser. They display a spectacular feat of water-borne police work, saving the academy and then return in the next movie to beat the city's other police academy when it turns out that the governor decides it's not worth the money to keep them both open.<br><br>Oh, and of course you all realize who is in this thing, right? None less than Sharon Stone, David Spade in his first film, and Tony Hawk in an early stunt-skateboarding role! You gotta see this!<br><br>This time, Commandant Lassard has come up with a scheme he calls Citizens on Patrol (C.O.P. Get it? Get it?), in which he elaborates slightly on the plot of the original movie. You see, the police force has been stretched a little too thin and the public has developed a negative opinion of them due to the fact that they can't be everywhere at all times to stop every single crime in the city. So the natural solution, of course, is to train the public as deputy police officers and basically have briefly trained undercover cops all over the city. <br><br>In fact, so close is the resemblance to the first movie that we are even treated to a couple characters who are forced to join the police academy or face jail time – an idea suggested, of course, by Mahoney himself. <br><br>This is the best part of the movie, by the way. There is a hilarious gang of skateboarding punks who are disturbing the peace left and right, headed by none other than David Spade, who is a hardened urban predator if I've ever seen one. Thug life, baby!!<br><br>Sharon Stone also has a relatively small role in the film, although probably one of the ons that she would like to forget about, and Lieutenant Harris is back after being gone for the last two movies. All of the other relevant cast members return, with the addition of a new group of misfits, like the token fat black guy, David Spade and his idiot skateboarder friend, and Tackleberry's FATHER-in-law. Remember that guy? Who is always gleefully punching out his son? I can't wait until the grandparents start joining!<br><br>But don't worry, until then we have Mrs. Feldman to hold us over. Here's this sweet old lady living in a nursing home/military barracks and who has more of a love of all things camouflaged than Tackleberry himself. In fact, I was waiting the whole movie for her to tell her that she's his long lost mother, but no such luck. Something went wrong with the screen writing in there somewhere, but ultimately she turns out to be one of the most consistently funny characters in the movie. She's played with a good-natured smile by Billie Bird, who clearly enjoyed herself while making the movie. You can always tell when the actors are having a good time, and it always makes the movie better, which is good because this movie needs a lot of help!<br><br>Of course, it's not much different than the last three movies as far as being worth watching. Bud and his father are still trading punches and it's still more groan-inducing than laugh- inducing, people are still accidentally wandering into the Blue Oyster Club, which hasn't been funny for three movies by now (Proctor inadvertently wandering in naked was the high point of this gag, but also the point where it becomes the most clear that the joke has lost its steam), and Jones is still doing that Bruce Lee impersonation which was funny in the first movie when I was a kid, but as an adult not so much But, Callahan has a great wet t-shirt scene that makes the whole movie worthwhile!<br><br>Oh, and was Mahoney's mischievous grin ever amusing? That poor guy, man. His reputation has for some reason become so tarnished that he is seen by most of the public as even more of a washed up has-been than, umm, well no one else really comes to mind. Bill Paxton? Nah, he's cool, I think. I never needed to forgive him for Weird Science, but Guttenburg unfortunately has a whole string of bad sequels to make up for, and Cocoon and Short Circuit are just not gonna cut it! At any rate, super-gluing the loudspeaker to Harris' face was funny, but why they missed out on the opportunity to have Harris screaming through it at high volume at the doctors in the hospital I just can't understand. The screenwriters are not scoring many points in this one!<br><br>But still, this is one of the better Police Academies so far. This one and part 3 are the best ones in the series that I've seen so far, despite the hilarious 1980s badness (there's a boot- legging crime lord, for example, who operates his illegal warehouse standing around with a fistful of cash and a hula hoop around his shoulders), but there definitely are some fun gags. Harris macing his armpits is one is one of the more memorable gags in the whole series, along with Mauser getting his hands glued to his hair, and I have to admit that I enjoyed some of the scenes of the original recruits trying to recruit the public for the new C.O.P. program. It's not a good movie, but it's a good Police Academy movie!","user":"Anonymous_Maxine","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Surprisingly Funny","rating":7,"date":"16 June 2019","review":"Actually, I found this one to be quite amusing, and the stunts at the end, well, they were pretty good as well, considering we do have Tackleberry jumping from a plane to land on top of a Balloon. Once again, some of the cast have been whittled down, though of course we still have Sweetchuck and Zed, who are now full fledged officers. Oh, and Sharon Stone also joins us as a reporter, and of course she gets paired off with Mahoney at the end (who else).<br><br>The story is that Lesard has this idea to recruit citizens to perform some of the duties that police officers perform, though not to the same extent. It is sort of falling halfway between Neighbourhood Watch, and the actual police force. Well, some people think that it is a great idea, while others are worried it is just a means of undermining the police force.<br><br>Lt Harris returns in this movie, and Lesard ends up in London for a conference, so Harris is left in charge. Of course it turns out that Harris is one that doesn't like the idea, so of course he is doing everything in his power to undermine it, while running it anyway. However, as it is also the case, our heroes from the first movie are here to provide a helping hand.<br><br>Yeah, this film actually turned out to be much funnier than the previous two, maybe because I hadn't really seen it. I think I originally tuned out after the third movie, though I do have to admit that this may be the reason. Yet, in many cases it once again seems to be a complete rerun of the first film, with a lot of similarities. Mind you, Blankes and Copeland are now gone, but we have that really annoying Proctor turning up, who happens to be the guy that runs around after Harris, thinking that he is the most wonderful person in the world.<br><br>Still, it is interesting to see how the characters have developed because once again they are so much not like the characters that we have seen in the first two films. In a way they have matured and become so much more competent. However, the jokes where Sweetchuck gets bashed around do get a little tiring after a while.","user":"The-Sarkologist","rank":[2,2]}]
