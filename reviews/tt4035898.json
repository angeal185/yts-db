[{"title":"A 90 minute \"don't do drugs\" hidden in horror","rating":5,"date":"17 October 2016","review":"My quick rating - 5,0/10. Sheer moments of brilliance in this movie get dragged down by some really bad casting and lack of continuity. The opening credits absolutely drag you in. Shot and edited wonderfully I really just wish whoever was responsible stuck around for the whole film. The story itself is nothing new. This time a group of people head to a cabin in the woods (not too clich√©, right? ) for a fun filled weekend. Of course this includes the usual, drinking, sex, oh, and a virus laced bag of cocaine that turns your average paranoid user into a zombie like rage freak who only knows killing. The first crime scene found in the wake of a night of partying is a gorefest with one of the worst looking compound fractures I recall seeing in along time. Unfortunately this is where the lack of continuity kicks in. Great looking scenes like this that get lost in overdrawn pointless moments of which character can act like a bigger snob. The pacing really dragged at times and this gets distracting up until it really gets going. That being said, I found myself interested throughout and at the end you realize after being drawn into a mediocre horror film, you just watched the longest, most violent anti-drug commercial with a huge underlying tone of slamming American politics in recent history. Still worth a view if nothing better is on and for being an indie budget flick it does pack a decent punch and solid message.","user":"jackmeat","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Anti Drug Campaign","rating":5,"date":"12 October 2016","review":"During the opening credits they do this stylish editing job with a woman submerging herself and playing in what appears to be blood done in awesome cinematography. Are they telling us we're in for a bloodbath? Sadly whoever filmed the opening scene left after the credits never to return.<br><br>A group of friends head up to the cottage unaware that the cocaine one of them has is laced with a virus. First symptoms are bleeding eyes then extreme rage followed by the need to eat somebody.<br><br>Once you snort the coke it takes a couple of hours for the virus to kick in so when it does they all start attacking each other. You laugh a few times listening to them growl, grunt and groan as they fight. I think the actors weren't too sure if they were zombies, tigers, bears or some new breed of monster. This flick isn't too bad considering we've seen this kind of thing before. Still entertaining though. The effects are quite good as well as there are some violent moments. If you got some time to kill check it out. I wonder if there is some kind of hidden message in this film?","user":"shawnblackman","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"The dumbest twist ending I've ever seen","rating":3,"date":"25 March 2018","review":"This is a cabin-in-the-wood flick where sexy young people kill each other because a bag of cocaine laced with a psychoactive element makes them all go crazy and hunger for flesh. It's shot like a TV movie and none of the actors have the range to do anything besides \"YEAH BOOOIIIIIII\" and \"OH MY GOD MY BOYFRIEND IS EATING ME.\" However, the gore effects are good and there's enough schlock factor that I would have still given this a 5 if it wasn't for the incredibly stupid twist at the end.<br><br>Basically, a cartoonishly evil Texas republican is lacing popular drugs such as cocaine and weed with cannibal juice so that he can cause mass hysteria and use his anti-drug agenda to get elected president, with the bonus that all of the young reefer democrats will be too busy eating each other to vote. It's like a liberal version of those Pureflix Christian movies where the villains are always cartoonishly evil atheists who hate all religion because reasons.<br><br>This could have been worth a 90 minute sit on a rainy day, but the filmmakers just couldn't resist crowbarring their exceptional political agenda at the last minute. Don't bother.","user":"tgoldberg6","rank":[10,14]}]
