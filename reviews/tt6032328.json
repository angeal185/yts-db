[{"title":"Come For The Soundtrack, Stay For The Movie, Sleep Through The Credits","rating":6,"date":"30 March 2019","review":"Finding Steve McQueen is a love story disguised as a bank robbery movie. This is a Baby Driver wannabe, without the great production, direction and dialogue. If you've never heard of Travis Fimmel before, well, this film won't leave a lasting impression of him with you either. Finding Steve McQueen has 24 Producers, so if the tempo or mood or anything else seems uneven-there you go. Everything starts out exciting as a bank heist film, but then it flips to a love story and by the 1 hour marks it's ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz. The soundtrack is fantastic, so this is the movie you play in the background while doing something else, like surfing the internet.","user":"PurpleCrayon2014","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"Lovely Love/Hiest Movie","rating":8,"date":"19 March 2019","review":"I thought this was a delightful little film. I liked the structure and the way the story unfolds. Anyone who lived through Watergate will also appreciate the time. I loved that we had an appearance by Deep Throat in his official capacity as Deputy Director of the FBI. I also loved seeing Forrest Whitaker as the dogged FBI agent","user":"brendaniforth","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"It grows on you","rating":7,"date":"19 March 2019","review":"From the beginning, I wanted to dislike this movie. The lead just didn't strike me as very interesting to start. But like the simple plot and easy to digest acting, he gets better as the movie moves on. The ending was simple and endearing.\nNah, it's not that amazing or groundbreaking in the least but it's fun and well paced.","user":"jonalovin-45307","rank":[22,26]}]
