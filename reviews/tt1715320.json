[{"title":"A surprising movie starring a wrestler that isn't actually that bad. Not good, but not bad. Made me laugh. I say B","rating":7,"date":"25 March 2012","review":"\"In one week Willy Bieber gets his just punishment because I refused to compromise.\" Detective Nick Blades (Edge) is on trial for corruption and Assistant DA Gold (Kennedy) is the one prosecuting him. After a mistrial occurs and Gold's car is stolen it is up to the two adversaries to work together to solve the crime that gets increasingly more sinister. Yet another movie starring a wrestler. I will have to admit that this is one of the better ones and at least they realize that it is hard to make a serious movie with one. While this boils down to just another buddy movie it is actually not that bad and kind of entertaining. There is enough comedy in this to keep you watching and even though this is fairly predictable it is still very much worth a watch. Fans of wrestler movies will love this, everyone else will enjoy this. At least I did. Overall, much better then the recent wrestler movies. I kinda liked it. I give it a B.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[32,40]},{"title":"Don't judge the movie by its trailer","rating":8,"date":"10 March 2012","review":"Bending the Rules certainly isn't going to win any awards and it probably won't win over the critics, but it's an enjoyable film that simply doesn't make the most of its potential.<br><br>Adam \"Edge\" Copeland was impressive in his first film. Though I'm not familiar with his in-ring persona at all, I thought he was very comfortable in his role and could easily have handled more. Perhaps a more serious movie will be in his future. Jamie Kennedy was fine though not memorable, while Jennifer Esposito and Alicia Witt were essentially wasted in small roles. Pruitt Taylor Vince and Philip Baker Hall were excellent in their limited screen time and Jessica Walter did not disappoint, though her character was a bit campier than I was hoping for. Her fans should especially enjoy the scene where no fewer than nine pictures of Walter herself adorn the background. Hall and Walter were perfectly cast and it seems like a film based around the Gold family could be quite a treat - either as a comedy or a family drama.<br><br>The biggest problem is that while there are some great funny moments, Bending the Rules is not really funny enough to be a comedy - yet it's too absurd at times for a drama and I was torn between wanting more laughs and wishing it was a serious film. The assembled cast is certainly capable of either and deserved better. I'm giving the film an 8 out of 10 not because it's a stellar film but simply because it's a fun film that doesn't drag and it exceeded my expectations. Some of the film's weakest moments are in the trailer and if the first-day turnout in Memphis is any indication, too many people have written it off based on that alone. That's unfortunate, because the film deserves a better fate. Those shut out by the limited release only have to wait a few weeks for the DVD, which I hope will fare better than the theatrical release.","user":"thatgirl1971","rank":[24,35]},{"title":"A decent but extremely light buddy movie!","rating":5,"date":"9 April 2012","review":"The trailer made the movie seem funnier. But like most trailers they picked out the best scenes. So what is left. Well,the main characters make a nice duo. Not really that much interesting interaction between them though.But it wasn't bad. Jamie Kennedy was out of his game somehow. He played a far too serious character and it did not work for him. They put him in all kinds of situations.And you would expect a character to freak out or something. But his reaction to those events was so under played that it did made you think why he was in the movie in the first place.Nice is good but a buddy movie,yes, that is what it supposed to be, requires great chemistry and fireworks.Or at least something that would put both characters on edge (no pun intended). Not being familiar with wrestling I don't really know the people involved. But I thought that the main character who played Nick Blades was very decent and extremely charming. And his charm and laid back character is extremely effective in otherwise a barely eventful movie. Decent enough for a rainy Sunday.","user":"chrichtonsworld","rank":[10,13]}]
