[{"title":"In the 80's it probably wouldn't have been much of a standout but it could have been a mildly loved looked over gem (much like it is now)!","rating":7,"date":"14 July 2011","review":"'TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br><br>This 80's movie homage actually is just that: a tribute to the youth films of the 80's and it does a pretty good job. It actually feels like a film from that decade (like something John Hughes might have produced) and not just a send-up or satire of it (like the advertisements sort of implied). Topher Grace stars in the film as well as executive produced and co-wrote it (with Gordon Kaywin and Jackie and Jeff Filgo). Michael Dowse (who also directed the popular 'headbanger' film 'FUBAR' and it's sequel) directed. Teresa Palmer, Dan Fogler, Anna Faris, Chris Pratt and Michael Biehn (one of my all time favorite actors) co-star in the flick.<br><br>The film is set in the summer of 1988 after Matt Franklin (Grace) just graduated from MIT. Instead of pursuing a high paying career like his education entitles him to he takes a part time job as a video store clerk at the local Suncoast Video store in the mall, much to the disappointment of his father Bill (Biehn) who's also a local police officer. Matt is scared and completely unsure of what he wants to do with his life, all until his old high school crush, Tori Fredreking (Palmer), comes back into town and into the store where he works. Matt lies to Tori and tells her he works for Goldman Sachs. Tori is impressed and invites him to a Labor Day party hosted by his twin sister Wendy's (Faris) boyfriend Kyle Masterson (Pratt). Matt goes to the party with Wendy and his best friend Barry (Fogler) and all hell breaks loose when Barry steals a car from the dealership he was fired from the same day. <br><br>The movie really does have a classic 80's nostalgic feel to it and like I said it feels like a movie out of that time period rather than just a comedic reference to it. The script is somewhat smart and emotional and the characters are really well developed. Topher Grace is very fitting as the film's lead, Palmer looks beautiful and is equally fitting and Fogler is actually good for a change (he's still not really that funny but he gives a decent performance). Faris isn't bad as well and Pratt and Biehn (who's the perfect 80's icon touch, with nerds) give nice supporting performances. The soundtrack adds a nice touch as well. The film does a good job of pulling off a classic 80's throwback feel and definitely accomplishes what it set out to do. If it had actually came out in that decade though it probably wouldn't have been much of a standout but it could have been a mildly loved looked over gem (much like it is now).<br><br>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg96qKy2R0","user":"Hellmant","rank":[26,30]},{"title":"from 70s to 80s","rating":8,"date":"17 February 2011","review":"There was an attempt to follow up That 70s Show with a disastrous and thankfully short lived That 80s Show. This should have been it. <br><br>Fast Times at Ridgemont High is the first name that comes to mind when one thinks of the 80s movies about kids in high school/college. Take Me Home Tonight takes it a step forward going for 'what next?'. And it succeeds, while not going too serious and keeping it feel-good in the lines of the aforesaid movies. Topher Grace, one of the co-writers of the story, naturally fits into the character drawing from the perfection with which he fitted Eric Foreman of That 70s Show. You can't help feel this i exactly Eric in the 80s (apart from the fact that the character's apparently an MIT grad). One can't help notice the resemblance of Teressa Palmer to Kristen Stewart, but thankfully, she can act a bit. Rest of the cast fit their roles perfectly, with a huge cry to Chris Pratt and Dan Fogler. <br><br>Saw this movie at a free screening (woot!) followed by a Q&amp;A session with Topher and Teressa where Topher said the first thing they did was make a mix-tape of 80s classics and then set on doing the story and henceforth. You totally get that, with some pretty rad soundtrack which brings a smile to all 80s fans. <br><br>All in all, went in expecting a no-brainer to get a good relief from the lab-work, got out pretty satisfied and rejuvenated. Sure it still is a no-brainer, but seeing it once in a while will bring a smile to the face. And I'm always up for reruns on headcramped days.","user":"arupananda-yash","rank":[60,75]},{"title":"Enjoyable, good entertainment, with a message!","rating":7,"date":"2 February 2011","review":"I saw this at a screening today and I enjoyed the movie. <br><br>I thought that all the leads did a good job, especially Topher Grace and Teresa Palmer. <br><br>They had some good chemistry, and Topher does a good job of playing an uncomfortable guy at times in the movie... Its fun and engaging, so you don't notice the time passing. <br><br>Also, it has an excellent 80s soundtrack, and even a message, which I won't give away so nothing is spoiled. <br><br>All in all, a good time will be had by all who go who like these kinds of movies!","user":"davetrek-966-664246","rank":[59,84]}]
