Why would you dub this ?\nPoor.....","user":"naymyothein","rank":[29,48]},{"title":"Famous actors in a terrible film","rating":2,"date":"22 February 2020","review":"Like most Chinese movies, there is a lot of pointless awful-looking CGI and the plot is a complete mess used to tie thing together, instead of the other way around..<br><br>There wasn't really anything memorable, and the few actions scenes weren't that impressive. Even the cast of heroes and villains are forgettable.. no good lines either. Nothing! This movie has no love and nothing going for it.","user":"daisukereds","rank":[9,13]}]
