[{"title":"Brings lots of smiles and laughter","rating":9,"date":"30 July 2018","review":"For days afterwards I reflected on how much I enjoyed watching this film. The story took me for a ride, the real-ness of it all is easy to identify with, and the morals and message are readily applicable in today's world. If more people learned from the role models of this film, the world would be a better place.","user":"matthewtdr","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"Wholesome entertainment!","rating":10,"date":"31 July 2018","review":"Wonderful story, beautifully filmed - viewers will easily relate to the characters! So refreshing!","user":"skglick2003","rank":[23,29]},{"title":"Wonderful, suspenseful at time and over all, a FEEL GOOD movie.","rating":10,"date":"12 November 2018","review":"This was a great movie. I'm just a simple water machine installer, not affiliated with the film production as someone that gave it a 1 star review claimed. I absolutely loved how Matt Dillon showed his genuine love for the orphan. AWESOME ACTING, by everyone. Even Jim the villain. Anyone that gave this a bad review is just an overall grumpy person. And the comments about it being a disgrace to Hawaii, I highly doubt you lived in the 1920's to witness the racism against the Japanese.<br><br>The movie was gorgeous, made me want to visit Hawaii like TOMORROW and I'm headed to bed with a smile.","user":"tinkerballou","rank":[12,14]}]
