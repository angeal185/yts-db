[{"title":"Really needed a better documentary maker.","rating":4,"date":"31 December 2018","review":"Really interesting topic, but sadly the documentary maker doesn't have the first idea on how to make a good documentary, he seems more interested in appearing on screen himself, than asking relevant questions, following interesting avenues, or even just letting the story tell itself. There is almost nothing here that people who know the Bob Lazar story won't already be familiar with, but for anybody new to the subject, it is an OK (if rather one-sided) introduction.","user":"Mex5150","rank":[187,193]},{"title":"Awful narrator","rating":5,"date":"21 June 2019","review":"Mickey Rourke as the narrator was probably the worst choice made.

Out of focus. Oversaturated colours. Mickey Rourke mumbling fresh out of a presumably rehab or a stroke clinic prattling on some beatnik stoner philosophy. Not so much a documentary but a social experiment that Netflix is probably running to see how many will make it to the end credits.<br><br>Go watch the Joe Rogan podcast with Bob Lazar instead.","user":"paulkierley","rank":[50,51]}]
