[{"title":"Looks good, but is bad","rating":1,"date":"5 February 2019","review":"The cinematographer did a good job. For a low budget the film looks great. However, that is all it has going for. The story is a snorefest. The dialogue is unrealistic and boring (nobody really speak like this). The alein costumes are awful... the tongues popping out every few seconds looks absurd. The acting is rough. PLus, what is that ending? Doesnt even make sense. Skip it.","user":"asucabcp","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Real aliens, please accept apologies.","rating":2,"date":"11 October 2018","review":"Weak storyline and full of contradiction. Ended up being a mediocre monster movie. Really bad alien costumes. Couldn't watch all of it, thank goodness. There's a wealth of collective experience in the real world that could have been sourced without including 1960's type \"death-rays\" over cities. Monsters with advanced access to space-travel who stick their tongues out to frighten people then get knocked unconscious from behind. Ye right.\n2 stars for nice graphics of space craft.","user":"saparonia-42212","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Avoid.","rating":13,"date":"13 October 2018","review":"Awful plot. Bad acting. Poor CGI and horrible make-up. \nIf you like ugly teenagers running and screaming erratically, this movie is for you.\nIf you like sci-fi, do not waste your time.","user":"permaculture-45885","rank":[17,23]}]
