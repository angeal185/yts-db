[{"title":"you need to be on the same level","rating":5,"date":"22 December 2019","review":"To like this film. its a story about living in a kind of spiritual community, where the humming rans high and the soles seems very brittle. to summarize my impression is that its a bunch of people that cant make up their minds and scores very low on descisionmaking.<br><br>two things stand up front of this product, that is the acting and the editing, but as for the filmography it moves too much and the use of close up facial shots seems to never end and feels stressfull. the story do not have any originality at all, the only thing one seems to take along with you are the experiences that the caracters go tthrough.<br><br>its not a funny flick, neither horror or crime, its just drama on a basic budget, and the grumpy old man have had better filmmoments than this gave, a very small recommend.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[7,10]}]
