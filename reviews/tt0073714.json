[{"title":"\"It's like a private zoo. It amuses me. It's as much fun as a carload of gorillas.\"","rating":7,"date":"17 March 2007","review":"\"Sister Streetfighter\" is but one of Sonny Chiba's \"Streetfighter\" series, this time with the impossibly cute and dimpled Sue Shihomi in the starring role.<br><br>OK, I will admit, this film is technically not that great. The acting is bad, the plot cheesy, and you can drive a truck through the holes in it.<br><br>So I will admit I have a sick addiction to these types of movies, because I loved \"Sister Streetfighter\".<br><br>What other movie gives you a cavalcade of freak-shows like a drugpin who collects \"killers\" at is secluded villa, a guy who exports his heroin disguised as human wigs, a henchman named Hammerhead with a gang who wears black cone-shaped wicker baskets for helmets, a group of girl Thai kick boxers in leopard-print named the \"Amazons 7\", a dart-blowing freak with a weird African shield and dime-store cape... a movie where you will see an assortment of weapons including staff, forks, tonfa, nunchuku, darts... need I go on?? \"Sister Streetfighter\" is that, and more.<br><br>Sue Shihomi starts off the movie doing a combination of the katas \"kanku dai\" and \"heian yodan\". There is not much biographical information on her on the web but I would guess she has some formal karate training because she is executes many of her kicks well, and in one scene she executes three really nice thrust kicks (kekomi) in a row. You don't often see good technique in martial arts films. As a result the fight scenes with Shihomi in it are very good, exciting and dynamic. She shows herself skilled also at using nanchaku and the sai (forks), one of which she plant in a poor fellow's head. And Sonny Chiba steals the few scenes he is in.<br><br>The cheesiness of this movie cannot be understated. In one scene Tina Long (Shihomi) finds her way onto the evil drugpin's property. She is discovered by the henchman \"Hammerhead\". Suddenly and inexplicably, they are transported high atop a sea-side cliff. Then, just as suddenly, they are fighting on a suspension bridge. I mean, this is classic stuff people! Also hilarious is the person introduced as \"Eva Parrish - Karate Champion of Australia\" is shown doing an absolutely horrible version of the kata \"tekki shodan\". Then the mysterious Ms. Parrish is never seen again in the film. <br><br>Recommended with two thumbs up for fans of the genre!","user":"wandering-star","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"One of the worst movies ever - I love it!","rating":1,"date":"1 February 2005","review":"A guilty pleasures. A terrible movie, little more than a live-action comic-book. Sets, costume design, editing, acting - all pure dreck. No continuity at all, the heroine appears to be killed off a couple of times in the film, &amp; I can't even provide a spoiler telling how she escapes - because the film never explains how she escapes, she just does! BUT - the martial arts action is fast, furious, &amp; occasionally almost believable; as for Sue Shiomi, she is only one of 2 female martial artists (the other Polly Shaun-Kwan)that I would call CUTE - in a positive sense: it's hard not to like this actress, even if she can't act, she's that appealing, &amp; in an innocent, girl-next-door kind of way. Never a dull moment, &amp; a heap o' fun; but really cannot be rated, even as a genre film - you either love to waste your time on it or you got something better to do. (Beware - although by same crew, not really a \"Streetfighter\" sequel, &amp; not a Sonny Chiba film.)","user":"winner55","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Cool","rating":6,"date":"5 November 2004","review":"Version: Avenue One DVD. Dub only.<br><br>'Sister Street Fighter' was basically made to show much arse Etsuko Shihomi kicks. Sonny Chiba appears in this third Streetfighter installment for only 10 minutes, letting Etsuko do most of the arse-kicking.<br><br>Lee long is a martial artist who the Hong Kong police use to help stop a Japanese drug-ring importing drugs into Hong Kong. When he goes missing, its up to his sister Tina (played by Etsuko Shihomi) to go to Japan and find him. She gets help from Lee's martial arts school (which just so happens to include Sonny Chiba) to free Lee and generally kick arse.<br><br>The story is your average \"relative has been kidnapped and our hero/ine must save them\". But who needs a decent plot when you've got cool fight scenes, bad dubbing, and an 'interesting' array of bad dudes and dudettes (to say the least). <br><br>Avenue One re-mastered the movie for their DVD and included some special features, yet they couldn't do a subtitle job? I would have taken this movie a bit more seriously (and thus given it a higher rating) if it had been subbed, and not dubbed. Oh well, at least the dub was funny-bad.<br><br>Good action movie. 6/10. Check it out if you're a fan of Etsuko Shihomi.","user":"AwesomeWolf","rank":[8,9]}]
