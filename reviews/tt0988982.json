[{"title":"Same Ol' Same","rating":5,"date":"3 May 2008","review":"I've been a fan of the Naruto Anime Series since it's glory days. When I got hooked, it was around episode 50 out of the near 300 episodes out today. I've seen them all and I have got to say, the production and writing team are doing their best to destroy this franchise. Horrible filler episodes, lackluster animations, clichéd story lines, and hackney character developments. This entire movie felt like one long and boring filler arc of the Naruto television series. When the action kicked up, it was alright. The animations and choreography were all standard for where the series is right now, but it was nowhere near the quality a feature film should have. The story is just modified from every Naruto movie we've seen before. Just do yourself a favor and re-watch Rock Lee fighting Gaara or Kimimaru, and you'll get more excitement out of it than from this movie.","user":"hawsman2","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"Uncompelling story","rating":6,"date":"30 April 2008","review":"The first three Naruto movies were entertaining and exciting. And they showed the essence of what Naruto's character is about. This fourth installment is not that much different but is nearly not as compelling as the previous movies were. In Shippûden Naruto has grown considerably. And you do notice that he has matured. In this movie it is like he never changed except for his appearance. To me it is strange why the writers don't show some elements that are relevant to the show or it's characters. After the developments in Naruto Shippûden I had hoped that we at least got to see what happened in the two years that Naruto was training with Jiraiya or something like that. But to have the same story told over and over does get boring. (Priestess is cocky,Naruto gets angry and corrects her and finally ... her. You know. The end!). This movie does contain some superb action scenes especially the one with Rock Lee. Not a a bad movie,but very pale in comparison to the previous movies and the series.","user":"chrichtonsworld","rank":[9,17]},{"title":"Prophecy Of Death!","rating":9,"date":"20 July 2014","review":"Naruto Shippūden the movie is noticeably darker than most Naruto movies. It is the first Naruto Shippūden film and fourth Naruto film overall. It was a pretty hyped up movie. The main part of the plot that got fans interested during promotion was the rumor of the death of the series' main character, Naruto Uzumaki. Now the annoying thing about this film is that the plot follows the classic mission for Naruto in the series: protect or escort a client-usually a female-usually a princess. Naruto is assigned with Sakura, Neji and Lee to protect a princess named Shion who has the limited ability to foresee the future, limited meaning that he can only see death. Apparently the priestess/princess wakes up from one in which some unfamiliar blonde leaf Shinobi in orange(Naruto) dies fighting this frigging scary demon called Moryō. It really added a mystery factor to the movie. Hence, Destiny...Prophecies...The Boy's...End!(trailers) To add to the horror aspect of the movie, the antagonist is stirring up some crazy ritual jazz and the priestess Shion in basically an exorcist who has to stop Yomi. Overall, the movie's plot is a general repeat of the whole protect the girl thing, even adding the whole thing where she's mean, spoiled and ungrateful for what he has until Naruto changes her with his ideology. But this is movie is more thought out and is on the darker side of Naruto movies for sure. The glimpses of Naruto Uzumaki's death and his friends mourning at his grave really hype up people to watch the film and find out what happens to the main character and how he avoids such a terrifying end to his life by this dark creature. The constant deathly visions of the near future also keep you curious. Action in this film is pretty cool too as it was nice to see Naruto, Sakura, Neji and Lee(original series main characters) face these new foes who sought world destruction. There are a bunch of cool and epic moments and touching parts too concerning sad back-stories. I do recommend this movie though to most if not any type of viewer as it should be entertaining enough.","user":"kadiotatsuryu","rank":[1,1]}]
