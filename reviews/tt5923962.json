[{"title":"Amazing action film. If you like Gantz, you'll LOVE this movie.","rating":10,"date":"2 December 2016","review":"Gantz is one of my favourites ( or probably my favourite) manga ever. I've following Hiroya Oku ( the guy who created Gantz) work for years. When i knew about a new Gantz Film coming this year I was very excited but, at the same time, I didn't think that we could watch this film on theatres in Argentina. Well I was wrong, we could due anifest Latin America. What can I say about Gantz O? The animation is AMAZING. The best that i've seen for a long time. The fights, superb . Oka , \"George\" and Nobuo , members of the sadistic and cool Osaka team, have the best fights of the movie. The music fits really well. The Osaka mission is know as one of the best of the manga and it was a really clever choice to pick it up and make a movie about it. About Kato, he is the hero in this movie and you'll end loving him. And the aliens... they're bizarre, scary and really violent. Just like in the manga. To sum up, if you have the opportunity, watch it. Yeah, there're some missing characters, but this movie was so good, so entertaining, that you will forget that in seconds.","user":"franco-km8","rank":[76,99]},{"title":"Stunning!","rating":8,"date":"26 September 2017","review":"As with other reviewers here I came across this little gem browsing Netflix.<br><br>I guess Gantz is pretty big in Japan for them to be able to make something this amazing. The animation and overall design quality is simply incredible. <br><br>Any mature anime fan will love this regardless of knowing the backstory.<br><br>The main reason I'm \"reviewing\" this title is because I see many people complaining about the laughable dialogue. To circumvent this, watch it in it's original Japanese language with subtitles!","user":"skecys","rank":[22,26]},{"title":"Amazing Visuals but worst writing I've ever seen","rating":6,"date":"22 February 2017","review":"Seriously, the visuals were incredible. 10/10. The monsters in it were the perfect level of disturbing and fantasy. The movements fluid, But the dialog, my god the dialog. If they said literally anything other than the things they said I would have enjoyed it 100x better. They could have just shouted random names of fruit and I would have cringed a lot less.","user":"mattstger","rank":[80,116]}]
