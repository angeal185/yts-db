[{"title":"Where to even begin?","rating":3,"date":"30 May 2018","review":"With a budget so low the \"ghost\" effects are simply an actor with a lot of makeup to make him \"pale\", there's not really anywhere to go with a film. Add in some flat performances, some way over the top performances, some dumb as dirt decision making by the protagonist and dialogue that Tommy Wiiseau would find laughable and you have waste of an evening.","user":"hcampbell-70473","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"A Pale Movie","rating":1,"date":"14 April 2019","review":"The movie is based on a short story and hence all the nonsense in the movie of the girl coughing and splitting blood all the time and other unwanted scenes. It is just a typical murder ghost story concoction executed by an amateur director who is still a work-in-progress. It is kind of funny in parts. Avoid this movie and watch some other movie worth your time and intelligence.","user":"whoami-1328","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"So naiv","rating":3,"date":"25 May 2018","review":"She plays without emotions, no body languages. Like a robot. And the story is not new. Hom many times we have seen this: car is brocken somewhere....she came in a stagen small town..nobody is friendly except the guy wh is saviour, actually everybody elese is wired....she got ill and suddenly she got touched by an angel..and no more ill. Normally I give always more than 7/10, here only 3/10.","user":"lupcop","rank":[3,8]}]
