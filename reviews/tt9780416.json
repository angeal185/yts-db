[{"title":"It's definitely worth watching","rating":9,"date":"3 October 2019","review":"You don't have to be a cricket fan to take something away from this amazing sporting documentary. If you do understand cricket though it will help you understand it more. However it's not just about cricket it's about how to get the best out of yourself, friendship, team work, how you can be at the bottom and feel good and optimistic and being at the top it feels like your going to fall off. In short it's all in the mind and like Trot puts it concentration is the absence of irrelevant thoughts.","user":"zabiebadz","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Powerful insight into the mind of an athlete","rating":9,"date":"27 September 2019","review":"After the most exciting and memorable summer of cricket since 2005, I finally got around to watching \"The Edge\" a documentary directed by Barney Douglas which follows the England cricket team from 2009 to 2013 and the rise to No.1 in the world. This documentary is brilliant, to put it plainly it's one of the best sporting documentaries I've ever seen.<br><br>The film its self is shot beautifully with some creative solutions to help the audience visualize what is happening in the mind of the athlete, the documentary also manages to perfectly describe what is happening without alienating viewers new to the sport, but doesn't make it boring for long time fans. What you see during this film is a testament to the work that goes into being a professional athlete, showing grueling scenes of the work they put in to get to where they are. However, this film is far deeper than just showing how hard they work, its an in-depth look into the psychology of sport and the effects that pressure and failure can have on the human brain, it manages to show this through countless revealing interviews with players and coaches about what they went through. In times like these where we are trying to learn more and more about mental health and open ourselves up to the idea that its ok not to be ok, this film is really inciteful and important in helping us understand what it means to fail and to have pressure placed upon yourself.<br><br>I would implore a and sport or cricket or anyone that's wants to gain an understanding of what happens in the mind of a professional athlete to watch this film it's hard-hitting revealing, but ultimately its important that films like these are made and its important that people learn as much as they can about mental health.\n9/10","user":"thesimplecritic","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"An excellent insight","rating":8,"date":"27 September 2019","review":"After the sacking of Kevin Pietersen as England Captain, the Test Team set the themselves a target of becoming the first Englamd side to reach to be ranked the world number 1 test side. This documentary charts that journey from a very low point to the ultimate high and then explains how it all fell apart. This is a real insight with the majority of the explanations coming from those coaches and players that were at the centre of that period of English cricket. A much watch for any cricket fan.","user":"russell-818","rank":[2,2]}]
