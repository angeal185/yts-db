[{"title":"Good, not great.","rating":7,"date":"22 December 2018","review":"This film is worth a go, especially at 75 minutes. I enjoyed it but would have done the final scene differently. It needed a little more vengeance.","user":"anmishoe","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Don't read any spoiler or detailed reviews!","rating":9,"date":"19 December 2018","review":"If you're a fan of home invasion movies then this one is for you!<br><br>Actually, even if you're not a fan of home invasion movies you may still want to check this one out because it's... a little different.<br><br>I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. The acting is very good, creepy isolated location, the camera work is fantastic and it's very suspenseful!","user":"Lizlynn_1111","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"Drags on","rating":4,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"On paper this probably seemed like an amazing idea. On film it just drags.<br><br>There's a rather big twist, which initially I really liked. But it just outstayed its welcome until it lost its edge and any potency it might have had on the outcome. For a film only 1hr 15mins long it felt longer, and not in a good way.<br><br>And unfortunately, as is the norm for many horror / thrillers, the characters do many things that left me thinking 'why would you do that?' which breaks any sort of suspension of disbelief.<br><br>For a low budget effort this is fairly well acted and directed, which made it watchable, although its totally forgettable.","user":"Watcher42","rank":[11,17]}]
