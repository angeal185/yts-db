[{"title":"If You Get It, Its Amazing, If Not, Its Not","rating":8,"date":"8 June 2005","review":"I remember seeing A Life Less Ordinary back in the late 1990s with high expectations as Trainspotting was one, and still is, one of my all time favorite films. What I got was a different film, but not in a bad way. It was fun and very different from anything else that came out around that time. But the funny thing was that after I saw it I kept thinking about it, little things; lines and camera shots that stuck in my head. By the time I watched it again, a week or so later, it was like the film was an old friend. There is a charm in every scene of A Life Less Ordinary and if you are able to pick up on it the film is a great experience. People I know are split on the film, most think its just OK. Although I enjoy ALLO its not perfect, some parts don't work very well and come across as corny, but the good, my man Ewan is just great as the lovable loser, far outweighs the bad and thats why it has a place in my film collection.<br><br>no quote<br><br>(This review was originally written by a man but then a robot replaced him.)","user":"ecwjedi","rank":[45,52]},{"title":"A difference of opinion.","rating":10,"date":"3 November 2003","review":"It seems that with A Life Less Ordinary you either love it or you hate it. Personally I am of the former persuasion, with it being a favourite of mine. I can see were the detractors come from, especially after viewing Boyle &amp; Hodge's previous works.  ALLO is in a completely different in style to their previous two films Shallow Grave and Trainspotting.  But to say it is the weaker of the three films would be a fallacy.  Stylistically the film is excellent - reminding me a lot of a Coen brothers film.  The script is spot on and the performances of McGregor and Diaz are both excellent (which surprised me for Diaz) as their does seem to be a real chemistry between the two.  A very enjoyable romantic comedy overall, and if an old cynic like me can say that, it must be good.","user":"The_Slider","rank":[67,81]},{"title":"Nice little Fantasy","rating":8,"date":"15 July 2001","review":"After the success of Trainspotting (1995), British filmmaking trio, Danny Boyle, John Hodge &amp; Andrew MacDonald made A Life less Ordinary. The film could not be a more different departure from their previous effort. A Life less Ordinary is a wild and sweat natured romantic fantasy, concerning our hero Robert (Ewan McGregor) and spoiled rich girl Celine (Cameron Diaz) and the two angels (Hunter &amp; Lindo) who are given the task of getting them to fall in love. Boyle uses many great cinematic techniques to make the film seem even more fantastic, and Hodges writing is some of the funniest in a long time. Sadly the film does go off the rails somewhat in the last twenty minutes, but it's still an extremely entertaining film, full of bizarre characters and images that makes it one of the most enjoyable two hours you could spend watching a film.<br><br>8/10","user":"jonathandoe_se7en","rank":[27,32]}]
