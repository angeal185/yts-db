[{"title":"Predictable","rating":5,"date":"7 January 2012","review":"Exorcism of Emily Rose tops this movie.... And that's not saying a whole lot. The plot was good, the acting....par but you saw everything coming. The ending was I call a \"ran out of money\" ending. Definitely worth waiting for the DVD release. I didn't mind the whole Blair witch/paranormal activity/cloverfield camera action they used. It was just the fact you knew what was coming 1 step ahead. Not to leave out the very dull ending but I guess it would have cost too much $ to actually leave us paying folk to know what happened to the people we spent the last 87 minutes caring about. Overall had a few creepy parts. Dog barking made my body ache. Just don't waste your time and money running to the theater to see this one.","user":"Putnaml-259-317472","rank":[62,81]},{"title":"Laughing all the way to the bank.","rating":2,"date":"1 March 2012","review":"Before saying anything, let me point out I watch all films with an open mind, and normally I can enjoy a film regardless of how technically poor it is.<br><br>This however, was a farce. I honestly can't believe this film got released into theatres, scene after scene was a regurgitation of scenes that we've all seen before. Not just individual scenes, but the whole tone of the film was so familiar and dull.<br><br>I didn't take count, but after a noticeable amount of times of the date being shot at me with a low dong was laughable, the bloke who made it must've watched paranormal activity and thought \"ooh that was good, I'll have that... then I'll grossly over use it\" There was nothing new about any of the exorcism scenes, apart from it was with a hand held camera.. wow. just watch the exorcist and shake the TV around.<br><br>I felt like i was watching an awful, pretentious student film from the outset and most of the acting had me cringing in my seat. I literally have never seen a worse all round acting display in my life... it was just totally unacceptable. They were trying so hard to make it look 'real' or 'genuine' and it just looked pathetic, so many face head scratching and little smirks to themselves.<br><br>I won't go into the ending... but it summed the movie up really. unoriginal, contrived and no shock factor (which was obviously intended) you know when a film is so bad its kind of entertaining? well this is just offensive. It was shameful. I can't think of one redeeming quality.<br><br>DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS FILM","user":"zard-man","rank":[82,124]},{"title":"Shaky Camera Garbage","rating":31,"date":"31 October 2017","review":"If you enjoy scenes that come into focus and out of focus as the shaky camera also juggles, this is a great movie. <br><br>If you think shaky cameras and blurry movies suck, then we are in agreement. This movie is so awful that I could not see much of it. The characters talk to the camera, because one of them is filming everyone constantly. So in addition to the shaky blurry scenes, we get annoying characters talking to the camera to let the audience know what they are thinking. <br><br>I wanted to throw up on the television after a few minutes of this awful movie.","user":"Johnny_West","rank":[5,5]}]
