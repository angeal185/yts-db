[{"title":"Another solid Scooby Doo mystery","rating":8,"date":"18 September 2011","review":"Coming from a big Scooby Doo fan, I enjoyed Scooby Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur. If there is anything that stopped the film from being truly great, it would be a longer length by about 5 or so minutes to give way to a little more clue-solving and as sweet as it was the romance felt rather thrown in. Otherwise, the animation once again full of colour, vibrancy and fluidity with a mix of What's New Scooby Doo and the original classic series is great, the music is fitting and doesn't detract from the mood, the writing is very funny with its fair share of thrills and scares, the story is interesting and well paced with some nice action pieces the best being the motorcycle race and an unexpected and very decent final solution, the monster is believable and the voice acting is solid. Overall, a nice, diverting mystery. 8/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Jurassic Park references possible inspiration","rating":8,"date":"22 June 2017","review":"I grew up watching Scooby Doo. I can hear the theme song in my head while I'm typing this! My teen-aged daughter decided to pick this movie to watch and we literally rolled on the floor laughing! Without saying much (don't want to spoil it for others!) there were so many Jurassic Park references from the first two JP movies and there was one scene that coincidentally mirrors a scene in Jurassic World. If you are a fan of the JP franchise like I am, you will recognize them when you see them. YOU HAVE TO WATCH this movie!","user":"educatorscott","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"An Honest Review","rating":9,"date":"1 April 2017","review":"Let me get this out of the way right now, this is one of the scarce few Scooby Doo movies where the ending is a decent pay off. One of the very few that doesn't end with a \"meh.\" And, to boot, the start is totally hysterical. The premise that gets the gang to the location of the mystery is almost too funny for words.<br><br>Darn spoiler rules...<br><br>I can only assure you that the start, the premise, the reason for the whole movie just out does Shaggy in personality and philosophy in one of the funniest possible ways.<br><br>the only downside is that as a big bad, Phantosaur is sort of lame and takes away from the movie.<br><br>It's worth ignoring the faults. The jokes, the humor, it's all top notch and for once the ending actually works. The ending is something that will be remembered after viewing.<br><br>This is one of the better Scooby movies in the catalogue.","user":"generationofswine","rank":[2,2]}]
