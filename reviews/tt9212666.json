[{"title":"I would rather drown in Egg Nogg","rating":3,"date":"14 December 2019","review":"Pumped in snow, wearing winter clothes in California, and just because the word \"Christmas\" is said as often as I blink my eyelids does not make this a Christmas themed film. The lead actress and actor show off their chiselled stomachs a few times during the movie which doesn't exactly harken of angels singing, but may be more appropriate with a stripper's rock song.<br><br>The romance between the two lead actors looks about as real as anything in the film but what does that have to do with Chritsmas?<br><br>I give this Lifetime film a 3 out of 10 rating","user":"Ed-Shullivan","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Total turkey.","rating":1,"date":"15 December 2019","review":"This movie sucks. Nothing looks believable to be a Christmas type of movie.","user":"ramananand","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Ridiculous","rating":1,"date":"7 December 2019","review":"This film is ridiculous... who believes that a 33 year old, hot, sane guy would be single and would be such a Christmas geek. How can this have a 6.1 rating?!","user":"tatjaansjaan","rank":[3,5]}]
