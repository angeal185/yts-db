But really. How hysterical and insanely weird can one girl get? It was just unbelievable that anyone would behave that way. It became rather laughable. One thing: if you are hiding in the woods from a homicidal man with a gun who is very keen to find you, you do not shout at the top of your voice during an extended and entirely unnecessary argument with yourself. In an echo chamber.\nAnd on the subject of characters being believable, what WAS John Cusack? A reluctant killer? Homicidal maniac? White collar worker turned to the dark side? Sweet chap really, who is just a bit clumsy when around guns? Therapist/ psychologist? Make your mind up.\nI don't know what is going on with Sky movies. It seems they show any old crap in order to fulfil their mission statement to put on a new premiere every day. A Channel 5 afternoon movie at best.","user":"sue-74122","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"What a waste of time","rating":1,"date":"18 March 2018","review":"Can I please give it a zero?
