[{"title":"Worth a look, but knit or do a crossword while you watch","rating":7,"date":"2 December 2019","review":"3 Way Junction is one of those movies that sets aside action and drama for mood and the inner drama of a character's life. You usually find this sort of slow pacing and attention to details in independent films. I am not as inpatient with these movies as many viewers are, the ones who toss one star reviews onto IMDB with phrases like \"slow moving\" or \"nothing happens!\" Or my favorite unhelpful review phrase: \"Worst movie ever!\"<br><br>But... I will say that introspective, patient movies such as 3 Way Junction usually are a study of a deep personal crisis. Someone close has died, or a couple has broken up; some life event is causing the main character to feel like their life has slowed down for their inspection. In this movie, it is the character's frustration with his job. It almost doesn't seem important enough for us to slow down and study his life alongside him.<br><br>I say 'almost' because I did stick with the movie in the end. The witty interplay between our architect and a woman he meets is fun to witness, and just enough happens to keep me involved. But I confess I worked on something else while I watched it, as it didn't quite earn all of my attention. So Inrecommend working on a jigsaw puzzle, or crochet a hat, or check your emails as you watch. The movie is worth a look if you don't try to stare hard and long at it to glean it's inner meaning.","user":"narrator56","rank":[3,3]}]
