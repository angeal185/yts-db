[{"title":"It's ok","rating":6,"date":"1 March 2020","review":"Way over hyped and over priced. I've heard the same things from the same directors for years. Nothing really new other than a few annoying personalities. The Dead Meat podcast guy is kind of overbearing in this. It was ok. Not worth $60.","user":"derekaldous","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","rating":7,"date":"24 February 2020","review":"There was so much hype surrounding this with those brilliant crowd fund trailers. It would truly be hard for it live up to its promise. What stands is a decent effort but fails to offer anything really new and doesn't spend nearly enough time on any of the films and skips so many amazing gems of the decade. That being said it's decently entertaining but I would have preferred a ten hour cut instead of the four and a half one this is.","user":"rivertam26","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Horror since 1980","rating":5,"date":"11 March 2020","review":"Good to watch and select couple of missing pieces from old times. Each horror like 3 mins overview and last for 4 and half hours.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[4,4]}]
