This was a heartwarming Christmas movie. I found most of the characters believable and (apart from the 'Bad Guys' and the lead female's Policeman Boyfriend) rather adorable.<br><br>Since I wasn't expecting an Oscar-worthy movie, I found it a relaxing and enjoyable story of 'Christmas fluff' - just the thing pleasantly to occupy a holiday afternoon.","user":"prickly101","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"I loved this holiday movie","rating":8,"date":"4 January 2020","review":"I usually don't like holiday made for TV movies, but I loved this one.
