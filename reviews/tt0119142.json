[{"title":"Excellent movie, especially to a Pennsylvanian","rating":10,"date":"29 April 2005","review":"I saw this movie originally in NYC (Times Square) after I couldn't get seats to the Broadway show I wanted to see. After watching this movie, I was glad I missed the play. I laughed so hard, I was afraid I was going to be asked to leave the theater. I am a resident of Pennsylvania and have spent lots of time in Amish country. Their life style makes me hunger for the simple life, the peace and tranquility of sensible living. I have watched this movie about 25 times and I still look forward to seeing it again. Some thought should be given to a sequel perhaps. In these times of turmoil and discontent, maybe this blue-print for the simpler life should be considered. Incidentally, I know that Maryland locations were used as Pennsylvania stand-ins, but that okay. The scenery was almost as beautiful as ours.","user":"buddha13","rank":[24,25]},{"title":"Gentle amusing comedy","rating":6,"date":"25 January 2001","review":"This is a gentle and amusing comedy.  It is the story of a (very) rich couple on the point of divorce forced to flee from the IRS.  They end up in Amish country and pretend' to be from another Amish community. The main comedy is from how they try to adapt to the new life, whilst keeping up the pretence of being Amish, and is quite remarkable in portraying the Amish way of life sympathetically.  Even the Amish accent is a little more accurate than is normal in a comedy (having lived there myself). It is understandable why it was not a great hit in the Cinema, as it has no big blockbuster special effects, but for the TV it is just what is required when a good laugh is required  and the language is suitable for all (except for possibly an Amish viewer).","user":"corek","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"Lots of Fun","rating":13,"date":"13 December 2002","review":"This movie may not be Academy Award material, but I found it very entertaining.  The performances by Kirstie Alley and Tim Allen are hilarious.  There's also a \"moral to the story.\"  I've seen \"For Richer or Poorer\" several times and highly recommend it.","user":"wavylady","rank":[25,29]}]
