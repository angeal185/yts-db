[{"title":"Awful....Patrick is rolling over in his grave","rating":1,"date":"24 May 2017","review":"This is seriously horrendous. Abigail Bresline is not a good dancer, she's not fit enough to be Baby and her outfits are awful. The dude playing Johnny is not good looking and a horrible actor. AND what is with the singing?!!! This is not a musical! ugh.....I hope this get's erased from history never to be seen again.","user":"sweeets19","rank":[108,120]},{"title":"The Magic is Missing","rating":2,"date":"24 May 2017","review":"This remake may have a great cast of actors but Dirty Dancing isn't just about the iconic lines and scenes. It's about the magnetic connections and tension between the characters, the swagger and desire, innocence and curiosity, and pushing the boundaries of the 1980s movies. Simply put, the magic is missing. The vibe, the joy, the heartache - none of it is there. Sometimes, remaking a classic movie is the WRONG move. When they get it right the first time....leave it alone! No need to waste three hours watching this film.","user":"divadenton","rank":[90,100]},{"title":"Horrific Atrocity","rating":1,"date":"25 May 2017","review":"This is seriously one of the worst remakes in history. It was entirely and wholly miscast. Debra Messing? Seriously? She wasn't even relevant in Will &amp; Grace. This film had no heart, no taste, no class and no chance. I had to watch the original just to erase the memory of what I witnessed in this movie. It's the only chance you'll have to un-see this movie.","user":"thegarbagecan-958-793427","rank":[114,128]}]
