[{"title":"Sea Monster Crap","rating":1,"date":"17 May 2018","review":"I wish I could give this movie a 0, but you are required to give a 1-10, so I give a 1 and that is too good for this crap. Sea Monsters is an awful movie. First thing I noticed was the animation. The animation is so awful and fake that the animations from Dire Straits Money for Nothing video look like PS4 graphics by comparison. The voice acting is also horrendous. No one can voice act. It is terrible and hurts your brain as well as your ears. The plot line is just as awful as anything else. A school of mutant fish is getting ready for contest to see who is the funniest fish in the bunch, so some young fish try to seek out another fish called The Maestro who can grant there wishes to become funny. So they go on a quest to become funny. That is literally the plot. There is no plot. It is stupid. I also find it really weird how none of the characters mouths move in synch to the words that are coming out of there mouths. Some occasions there mouths don't move until the last two words of a sentence they are saying. And this is an American made film. This is not one of those cases where this was a foreign film that had a dubbed vocal track. American made. That is literally the way they were made. The Old Japanese Godzilla films look better with the dubbing than this piece of crap. Like I said the animation is crap and the characters are absolutely scary. The possessed girl from Exorcist is nowhere as scary as these characters. The way they look and move is complete nightmare fodder. The movie has no point and is visually boring, it's boring across the board. The movie is only 1 hour and 8 minutes but it is so painfully boring it feels longer than a Lord of the Rings film. This movie was so boring I would much rather spend 1 hour and 8 minutes eating mud encrusted broccoli off a dirty country road. Even that would feel like a better way to spend 1 hour and 8 minutes than watching this garbage. This is one of the worst animated films I ever saw, and I don't see how anyone , even children, could enjoy this. It is not funny or magical or anything. You could not get enjoyment out of this even if you were stoned out of your skull while viewing it. Avoid this movie like the plague. This movie is so awful it actually gives you the plague.","user":"etusciuk","rank":[4,8]}]
