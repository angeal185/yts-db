[{"title":"Lovely & Thoughtful","rating":10,"date":"3 January 2016","review":"I will admit that the film had me in the first few seconds. That it was no accident made it even more appreciated. That it fulfilled its promise by the end left me thinking, smiling and feeling good. A lot of care, love and thought had gone into making a story about likable people who are complex characters. Please, give me more. The script, the acting, the camera work and the perfect pace, made it all a beautiful pastiche of quiet and quality film-making. Yes please, give me more. But it would be helpful if these gems are not hidden away from the public. Thank God for Netflix. I've searched for some information on the film after watching it and saw that this was a debut for Victor Levin as a director. I am looking forward to more.","user":"ivana-88-757720","rank":[36,46]},{"title":"The most extraordinary story about love","rating":10,"date":"31 March 2017","review":"I began this movie, knowing little of what awaited me. Many movies you watch in life are movies that just fleet by, without having an impact on your view of life, of love, of what's important to you. This movie was and remains different. It is a movie that will challenge your idea of life and of love foremost. If you are prepared for this, then I strongly advice you to watch this movie. It was gripping without its like. I have never been this moved by a movie, and it will probably take a long time for me to find a movie of its like. 10/10","user":"madeleine-zuber-1993","rank":[24,31]},{"title":"Til then then","rating":7,"date":"2 April 2015","review":"Greetings again from the darkness. Somewhere along the line, the magic of movie romance has been lost. Love stories these days tend to take either the direction of snark or sap (or whips). Ever so popular in the 1940's and 50's, well-written sentimentality for the big screen would best be described these days as passé'. And that's what makes writer/director Victor Levin's little film such a pleasure to experience. <br><br>We begin with a narrator proclaiming that some of the best writing is found on the tribute plaques attached to the benches within Central Park. Those plaques are used a few times throughout the film to drive home a particular situation or status within the story. The narrator is Brian (Anton Yelchin, Star Trek), a 24 year old struggling writer whose parents want him to give up his writing dream and head to law school.<br><br>One day, while walking through the city, Brian catches a glimpse of striking woman smoking a cigarette. He crosses the street and the two exchange some clever banter. Just like that  the story begins and their lives are forever changed.<br><br>The woman is Arielle (Berenice Marlohe, Skyfall), and she is French, older than Brian, and married  3 things that are equally problematic according to his dad (Frank Langella), though his mom (Glenn Close) is just thrilled someone likes her boy. As the flirting escalates, Arielle proceeds to explain to Brian that she is open to seeing him daily between the hours of 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm. Familiar with French language, but unfamiliar with customs, Brian is brought up to speed on \"cinq a sept\" affairs – a tradition in France, where a married person's whereabouts are not questioned during the period after work and before home. <br><br>As you might guess, the affair does wonders for Brian as he is finally experiencing the world  passion  connection. Arielle opens his eyes and mind to many things, and Brian is especially taken aback as the lines blur between family and outsiders. This leads him to meet Jane (Olivia Thirlby), who is not just a rising young editor, but also the mistress to Arielle's husband Valery (Lambert Wilson). Yes, it's a tangled web that's woven.<br><br>Mr. Levin's script is remarkable in its effectiveness at providing the awkward situations with a dose of humor; and his targets include Jews, the French, and Americans and their customs. It's impossible not to think of the classic film The Graduate, or even Linklater's \"Before\" franchise, but this one is different  it does not shy away from sentimentality, romance or emotion. The film wears its heart on its sleeve – or more aptly, the screen. We feel (good and bad) right along with the characters.<br><br>The camera only uses close-ups when it must, and instead allows the scene and the characters to breathe. There is a simple looking, but wonderful shot of Brian and Arielle walking through Central Park directly towards the camera. They are in discovery mode towards each other, and it's fascinating to listen and watch. <br><br>Anyone who fancies themselves a writer will tip their cap to no less than eight lines that are near perfection. Being \"too happy to write\" is certainly a relatable emotion, but few films feature better last lines than this one  if only we could each be that one reader to which the line refers. If you are open to some heartfelt sentimental romance, then give this one a watch. If not, you'll certainly find no shortage of reviews from caustic critics so quick to rip a film lacking in snark and sarcasm.","user":"ferguson-6","rank":[49,73]}]
