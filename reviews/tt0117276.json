[{"title":"Enjoyable and Quirky Comedy","rating":24,"date":"24 February 1999","review":"This is one of those comedies, that while it is predictable, is still a joy to watch again and again.  Ever since her debut in \"The Man in the Moon\" I have loved Reese Witherspoon.  Her ability and charm come through just as bright as ever in this little known comedy. \"Overnight Delivery\" is basically a rehash of the typical \"Keystone Cop\" physical comedy style that was overdone in the late eighties and early nineties.  But, it possesses in its actors quirks that are not seen in other movies of the same genre.  I won't say that you should run out and rent this movie tonight, but if it comes on cable, or if you need a good laugh, pop a bag of popcorn and assume the couch potato posture.","user":"YOTS77","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Cute and funny","rating":8,"date":"16 September 1998","review":"This is a funny romantic comedy with some laughs.  The movie is held together by the cute and sexy Reese Witherspoon. Her performance makes the movie worth seeing.  Paul Rudd gives a good showing also. I would recommend seeing this movie if you are bored one night.","user":"IkeDOG","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Hypnotic.","rating":16,"date":"16 January 2000","review":"This film was one of those that you will watch because there is nothing better on the television and it just draws your attention. I saw this movie during a free Showtime weekend. I enjoyed this film very much. It was amusing, funny, and had a good storyline on how a boyfriend goes from Minnesota to St. Louis to get a hold of a revenge package that he sent her, with the help of a new friend. I suggest that if you have the chance watch this movie. It will end making you happy.","user":"Jack-247","rank":[14,21]}]
