[{"title":"Women will like this more than men","rating":6,"date":"21 October 2019","review":"Unique thriller with a good concept involving lost memories and an unsolved crime. I think this is a movie that women will like more than men in that it follows a female character, including her conflicted relationship with her sister, and there is also some romance thrown in as well with a good-looking male character. The main character was likeable and relatable.","user":"anniefairfield","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Twists and Turns - Fun Thriller","rating":8,"date":"24 April 2018","review":"Last Seen in Idaho is a fun thriller chock full of twists and turns. Just when you think you have it all figured out, another surprise is thrown into the mix. The premise of the story is that a woman named Summer witnesses a murder and while she's trying to escape the scene, she's pursued by the killers and wrecks her car. Later at the hospital, she can't recall the murder she saw, but now she's having premonitions about her own future murder. So there's a bit of fantastical element to it. Meanwhile, the killers decide that if Summer's memory shows any signs of returning, they will eliminate her. <br><br>An indie production, this film seems to have the ambition of larger films. There are some action and suspense scenes throughout the first two acts of the film, but mostly, it relies on tension and mystery that builds through those acts, leading to a massive final act with bigger action and spectacle. <br><br>Hallie Shepherd is a believable and relatable as Summer, a heroine who is continually facing down the worst possible news - You're going to be kidnapped... wait no, you're going to die.... Wait no.... She's brave and tough and resourceful. Casper Van Dien is creepy as all get out, as a killer who has no emotions about his murders, just bland curiosity. Wes Ramsey is complex character who uses his charm and good looks to get close to Summer. He shows range in this film, needing to have both likeability and a rough and dark criminal side. Shawn Christian is colorful and eccentric as a cocky bad guy. Alexis Monnie plays Summer's younger sister, a na√Øve young woman who doesn't seem to have the same street smarts her older sister does. This solid cast also has a variety of supporting characters that add to the overall mystery of \"Who is the Big Bad Crime Lord?\" <br><br>All in all, a really fun thriller! It kept me engaged the entire time, and I didn't see the end coming.","user":"ardentayu","rank":[18,26]},{"title":"Badass Movie","rating":8,"date":"16 April 2019","review":"I was genuinely surprised at how awesome this movie was. I originally only gave this a chance because of Shaun and Wes were in it. But it it was a very good movie.","user":"fireeater-32147","rank":[6,7]}]
