[{"title":"Heartwarming, Heartthrobbing, Heartbreaking","rating":8,"date":"3 July 2014","review":"\"Ek Villain\" is a film that made me squirm, smile, as well as cry. Most Bollywood films, to borrow a line from the film, have a hero, a heroine, and a villain. This film however is an exception since the love story is of the villain himself.<br><br>When a girl with a bucket list is on the threshold of fulfilling her last wish - of saving the life of a man, ergo, a villain, and turning him into a hero, a vicious villain's psychotic attempts at becoming a hero to the one he loves, forever changes their shared destinies.<br><br>This is not a film for the faint of heart. The violence is often stomach churning, while the cold blooded actions of a merciless mercenary will send shivers down your spine. However, at the same time, the bubbly effervescence and undiluted romance of the lead pair will surely bring a smile to your face, as will the innocence of a child caught between hope and expectation.<br><br>Finally, the extremely nuanced performances by Ritesh Deshmukh (a revelation, and brilliant), Shradhaa Kapoor (fantastic, and effortlessly heartwarming), Siddharth Malhotra (excellent, and very different from his earlier outings), and Aamna Sharif (just what the psychiatrist ordered!) will make you go through a gamut of emotions in steady succession, finally culminating in an unprovoked opening of the floodgates.<br><br>The real hero of this film filled with villains (almost everyone has gray shades - including the nefarious Kamaal R Khan - playing as irritating a character as he appears to be in real life) is actually its Music courtesy Mithoon and Ankit Tiwari (especially the two versions of the song - Teri Galiyaan), who do not disappoint after the hugely successful Ashiqui 2. The biggest villain in this film is fate and its cruel twists and turns which, like tentacles of an omnipotent hunter, slowly binds it's prey to a future you cannot escape from, come what may, and irrespective of how many times you pray (again, a recurring theme in this film). <br><br>I loved the director Mohit Suri's 'I saw the Devil' but don't care approach as far as storytelling was concerned, and director of photography's brilliant execution of wishful thinking, especially during the songs and panoramic shots of the city. I would have enjoyed even more if the writers had chosen more thrills over violence, but then the mush more than makes up for these shortfalls.<br><br>Overall, \"Ek Villain\" is a movie which if missed will definitely make you repent, and feel like a villain. Just go with the flow and catch the nearest show. And need I add? Ritesh - take a bow!","user":"ayanpal1","rank":[45,64]},{"title":"Worth the watch! Good film!","rating":10,"date":"28 June 2014","review":"I for one thought it was an excellent movie. Okay, seriously though, so many people are complaining that it's a Korean movie ripoff, but how many really saw that movie in the first place? Regardless of where the plot is derived from it was an enjoyable watch. It was great! The only qualm I had was Remo Fernandez's performance. It was rather contrived, but honestly that is about it. The non- linear plot format was intriguing, especially when compared to modern and rather stale mainstream Bollywood films. The various characterizations as well as embedded parallelism and circular plot progression can also provide good post-movie conversations. Despite reading negative reviews about Malhotra, a all I can say about him is wow. Not only is he magnetic on screen but he did exactly what he had to. He doesn't have many lines in the film, but he manages to convey his character's issues so well! Riteish was very good--I wanted to hurt him myself, and Shraddha was also very good. I honestly think that those who are reading the negative reviews and deciding to take a hike are truly missing out! Watch it!","user":"sahithi_rs20","rank":[29,55]},{"title":"Powerful performances keep you hooked on.","rating":9,"date":"29 June 2014","review":"When I watched this movie I didn't knew its similarity with the Korean movie I Saw The Devil. But despite that I liked it. Its definitely modified for Indian audiences as there is not much violence as in ISTD. Some people found it a little disturbing but it wasn't the same for me. If you are a fan of Hollywood/foreign thriller/horror movies you wont find this disturbing at all. What lightens the mood of the movie is Guru and Aisha's sweet love story. Sidharth Malhotra and Shraddha Kapoor's chemistry in the movie is adorable. And the songs enhances there love story even more. <br><br>Another reason to like this movie are the performances of the 3 main leads. Sidharth Malhotra's role in this movie is different from his last movies and he does justify to the role quite a lot (and even looks better in this one). Shraddha Kapoor's acting in this movie is definitely better than it was in Aashiqui 2. She's charming and brings a little humor in the movie. But the man who stole the show was Ritesh Deshmukh. We've loved him in comic roles, no doubt he has great comic timing. But this movie completely changes your view about him. He does complete justice to the negative role given to him.<br><br>Watch Ek Villain if you like something a little different than the typical Bollywood movies. Just don't go in with a lot of expectations, maybe it won't be full-filled and you'll end up hating an overall good movie.","user":"sonaissweet2008","rank":[20,36]}]
