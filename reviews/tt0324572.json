[{"title":"Merry Christmas Pooh bear, and a happy new year!","rating":10,"date":"4 January 2012","review":"Maybe I am biased, because I love Winnie the Pooh, loving AA Milne's charming, whimsical stories, a vast majority of the films and specials(especially The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and of course the four shorts Honey Tree, Blustery Day, Tigger Too and Day for Eeyore) and the TV series The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.<br><br>Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year is wonderful. It is beautifully animated with bright colours, pristine backgrounds and well-drawn colours with the best animation coming in the featured Christmas classic Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too. The music is very memorable, with some Christmas favourites and lovely incidental music.<br><br>The writing also delights, with a perfect mix of funny, charming and moving moments and droll dialogue. I especially found the ending quite touching, and if you haven't seen Eeyore happy, wearing a Pooh shirt, on his hind legs and eating honey, then you haven't lived.<br><br>I equally loved the story, so sweet and charming and manages to maintain the childhood innocence that makes the stories, movies and series so endearing to me. The characters are forever timeless, Tigger has always been my favourite character but Pooh is so lovable, Piglet adorable and Rabbit(I love how he learns from his mistakes in general, and he is pretty much the only character in a sense that does) likable once you get to know him.<br><br>The voice acting is terrific. John Fiedler is still stellar as the timid Piglet, Michael Gough inspired and very funny as Gopher and Ken Samson very effective as Rabbit. Jim Cummings is very good as Pooh and even better as Tigger, though we mustn't dispute the brilliant Paul Winchell as his voice in the Christmas Too story featured.<br><br>Overall, really charming and wonderful, a must see for anyone who loves these characters and stories. 10/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Pooh on a Christmas Day","rating":6,"date":"30 November 2014","review":"A collection of stories focused on Pooh and his friends around Christmas and New Year.<br><br>Although some of this is rehash from older Pooh stories, which results in some mixed animation and voices that do not quite match up perfectly (although close enough that few will notice), what better than a collection of Pooh stories for Christmas? Everyone loves Christmas and everyone loves Pooh, so it only makes sense to have a special focused on his exploits.<br><br>The singing over the opening credits is a bit dreadful, and it returns at the end, but the rest is pure magic that will make kids (and adults) smile. If you have never seen Eeyore cheery and smiling, you absolutely have to see this... it is quite a sight.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Adorable Christmas and New Years story with Pooh and friends!","rating":10,"date":"7 December 2016","review":"This was a adorable movie where they shared Christmas presents and share the story of \"Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too\" with Roo. It is followed by Celebrating the New Year and Rabbit is mad at Tigger for being too bouncy, Piglet for being to scared, Pooh always eating honey and Eeyore for always being sad. Rabbit gets so upset he starts packing to leave so Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and Tigger make New Years Resolutions to stop doing the things that make Rabbit made but they end up being like each other which makes Rabbit even angrier and storm away. In the end he finds out that they tried to change for him and he stays telling them he loves them the way they are normally. The movie ends with everyone celebrating the new year together. I really loved how the characters tried to be better for their friend cause they loved him so much but he ended up accepting them for who they really where.","user":"jaydewardle","rank":[0,1]}]
