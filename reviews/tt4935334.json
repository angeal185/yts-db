[{"title":"Loved it !!","rating":10,"date":"12 October 2018","review":"As an Actor myself Anthology films are one of my favorites in the genre but many times you get several stories that dont hold up to the others, in Southbound however that is not the case. This is a film that could have easily come out back in the 70s 80s and even has that grindhouse look and feel and feel especially with the score. I highly recommend this one check it out !","user":"punisher-42628","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Inventive and unique","rating":7,"date":"11 February 2016","review":"Southbound does three things well.<br><br>First, it has some genuinely new stories to tell. That's not typical for horror, where the same few stories are iterated upon repeatedly.<br><br>Second, it has fascinating characters that are brought to vivid life, with remarkably few brush strokes, but without ever resorting to stereotype. The quality of the writing, direction, and acting shine.<br><br>Finally, each of Southbound's authors know to leave enough unsaid. Each chapter suggests a world of back story, but there's no spoon anywhere in sight. Which is particularly important for horror, where what is made explicit can never approach the creepiness that is only imaginable.<br><br>What does it do wrong? Well, the effects can be shoddy, and there are a few scenes designed around an effect, rather than the effect crafted to the vision, leaving those scenes wooden. But that's all, and for each awkward bit of gore, there are two or three masterfully directed scenes to compensate.<br><br>Southbound is a seriously enjoyable horror flick. See it when you can.","user":"vasiln","rank":[59,79]},{"title":"Excellent, fresh horror-anthology","rating":9,"date":"18 September 2015","review":"Checked Southbound out at the Midnight Madness screening at TIFF 2015 and it was a blast. A throwback to the horror-anthology style of the 80's but with a fresh twist on the wraparound. The device in which each segment flows into the next was unique and added a new layer to the experience. <br><br>I am a huge fan of horror anthologies in general (VHS, ABC's of Death, Late Night Double Feature, etc.) but occasionally they seem like a collection of shorts thrown together. While there is a charm to those types of anthologies, Southbound is clearly well thought out and designed. <br><br>Loved all the segments, with \"The Accident\" being my favourite. This is a well written, shot, directed and performed feature. Highly recommended.","user":"navinramaswaran","rank":[83,124]}]
