[{"title":"A comedy precursor for the next decade","rating":7,"date":"22 June 2010","review":"Despite being a child of the '90s, somehow I missed \"Heavyweights\" entirely. Considering the similarities it shares with \"The Mighty Ducks\" movies such as actors Kenan Thompson and Shaun Weiss, I'm almost embarrassed. Regardless, there's still plenty to appreciate about \"Heavyweights\" 15 years later in spite of its silliness -- and it's more than just a joke about the ineptitude of the Buffalo Bills.<br><br>For one, it was written and directed by Judd Apatow, who has a majority hold on the comedies of the last decade and for two, it marks one of Ben Stiller's first prominent roles as fitness wack-job Tony Perkis, who takes over a once-adored fat camp and harasses the kids.<br><br>Good thing \"Heavyweights\" was made then or it may never have surfaced, seeing as the age of political correctness and weight sensitivity has befallen us. The film is not cruel at all in its depiction of overweight campers, so parents surfing around for slightly older kid films and coming across this one shouldn't be concerned about that factor, but there's no doubt that such a concept would be hard to get off the ground, especially at Disney, in the 21st Century.<br><br>Co-written by Apatow and Steven Brill, writer of \"The Mighty Ducks\" films, it was as if the two conspired to plant a seed for a type of humor that kids my age at the time would come to identify as their own as they entered the PG-13 and R-rated age. Tony Perkis, for example, is the spitting character image of Stiller's White Goodman from \"Dodgeball\" and yet to me he is just as amusing doing his patented whispery intimidating voice now despite my countless repeated viewings of \"Dodgeball.\"<br><br>There's also a classic overnight camp comedy sense of humor in \"Heavyweights\" like the kids getting beat in sports by their rival camp, an awkward dance mixer with a normal girls camp and when the kids unload the candy stashes they've snuck in camp into secret compartments -- as well as the run-of-the-mill fart jokes. Characters such as Tony's hysterical right-hand European man Lars, however, were way ahead of their time.<br><br>\"Heavyweights\" is pretty immature and excludes girls (because fat girls would be too taboo for the '90s). Its typical camp movie plot as well as its \"overthrow-the-bad-guy\" story arch - - which ruled the '90s -- come off as stale. But ignore those distractions and \"Heavyweights\" is a funny, quotable movie with some classic scenes, which is all a kid (or someone trying to go back and grab some nostalgia) really wants.<br><br>~Steven C<br><br>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","user":"Movie_Muse_Reviews","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"A classic that delivers laughs as big as the kids stomachs!","rating":9,"date":"23 July 2004","review":"Heavyweights is the story of a group of kids who with the help of their counselor go on a mission to take back their fat camp from a crazy man who has never interacted with kids before (played by Ben Stiller) who is intend on making it into a money making informercial.<br><br> I first saw this as a child, and absolutely loved it. I must have watched it again on at least 5 other occassions. Recently I was in the video store and came across a copy of it for sale. After convincing my friend to buy it , we went back to his house and popped it into the VCR. I wondered if the film would hold up after all these years. Did it? Absolutely! In fact I may have gotten bigger laughs this time around. <br><br>I do not understand why this film has a 5.1 rating, after reminding this movie to my friends they all recalled loving it, and everyone I recently watched it with loved it. Ben Stiller's character is hillarious, and the rest of the cast is great. Besides Ben, Kenan Thompson is the only other actor in this who went on to become somewhat of a star, which is suprising because all the kids give great performances. Tom Mcgowan, the man who plays Pat, seemed to be chosen for the role because Chris Farley passed on it, and John Candy died, but he gives a great performance.<br><br>I know it sounds cliche, but Heavyweights is truly one of the few movies that people of all ages will love.<br><br>9/10","user":"HATED_IT","rank":[24,33]},{"title":"Greatest movie of all time","rating":10,"date":"5 August 2005","review":"This is the best movie ever. I have watched it 1192 times. Ben Stiller's performance is excellent and the kids, although amateur, provide many, many, many laughs. This is a great movie to sit back and watch when you feel like using no brain power. The comedy is completely mindless and hilarious. Watching a group of obese children being \"torchered\" by a diet-obsessed ex-heavyweight is a great premise for a movie. it has all the elements of a good movie: you laugh, you celebrate, and maybe, (if you're extremely sensitive) cry. I don't know how you can't absolutely love this movie. My praises for this movie know almost no bounds. This is just a great movie. Well, I'm going to go achieve 1193!","user":"trogdorkilla-99","rank":[41,60]}]
