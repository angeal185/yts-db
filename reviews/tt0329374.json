[{"title":"One Great Classic Get-to-gether","rating":10,"date":"4 September 2002","review":"WARNING: Telling Secrets<br><br>This is a greatly put together piece of work, from Lonesome Ghosts to other Halloween classic tales told and starred by the Disney gang.  My favorite part was the Trick or Treat with Donald and his three nephews, and Hazel the witch, when she zaps Donald a few times.  This is one video a Disney fan can not be without. It should be in every Disney library.","user":"Hollywood_Yoda","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"It's Our House Now!","rating":23,"date":"23 September 2002","review":"What a great song!!<br><br>\nAnyway, this House of Mouse movie was much better than the Christmas one. The concept and plot of the villians was very interesting.  Many of the segments were hysterical.  Especially \"How to be Ghost\" (or something like that).  You could tell that \"How to be a Ghost\" was animated very well. The classic segments were a great addition!  Also, the music and animation matched perfectly for the \"Dance of the Goofys\" and the \"Hansel-mickey and Gretel-minnie\".<br><br>Great movie and the DVD's game was also very well done.<br><br>10/10","user":"kramrueb","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Good, Fun Disney Moments","rating":7,"date":"30 January 2004","review":"If there's anything I learned by watching both House of Villains and Snowed in at the House of Mouse, it is that the House of Mouse format just doesn't seem to fit as a full-fledged movie.  I definitely enjoy the House of Mouse series, but both these movies just seem to drag on a little too long.<br><br>This is not to say that I didn't like any of the HOM movies.  I thought all the cartoons showed on the Christmas special were great, and I thought most of the ones on Villains were great too.  However, Villains has the upper hand when it comes to the in-between segments.  The story for Villains was much better and interesting as the Villains tried to take over the House of Mouse.<br><br>However, that is really just a small part of this movie.  I still think the greatest draw is the animated shorts.  Villains has more of a Halloween theme as they showcase Disney classics like Donald Duck &amp; the Gorilla and Lonesome Ghosts and even new spooky shorts like the hilarious How to Haunt a House.  This cartoon resurrects the classic Goofy How-to cartoons and gives it a paranormal twist.  A narrator instructs Goofy and the viewers on how to properly act like a ghost.  These are the type of cartoons that Goofy is best at as he bumbles and stumbles along trying to scare Donald, who definitely added even more humor to this cartoon.  Even Mickey has a funny cameo.<br><br>So overall, Mickey's House of Villains has its entertaining moments, but it's nothing too extraordinary.  My suggestion is to check out the whole thing once, and from then on, watch the cartoons and segments you enjoy the most.  There are some good ones in there!<br><br>My IMDb Rating: 7/10","user":"travisimo","rank":[5,6]}]
