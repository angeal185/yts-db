[{"title":"Generic B-movie","rating":5,"date":"21 March 2018","review":"What's with all these 10/10 reviews by people who have only reviewed this particular film?<br><br>Anyway, onto the movie. It's a B-movie. It's not horrible, but if you've seen other crime movies, you've seen all the same clichés countless of times. This movie has nothing to offer that hasn't been done better in hundreds of other crime films.<br><br>The lead actor was pretty good, but everyone else were shockingly bad actors.<br><br>Watched it today, will forget all about it by tomorrow.","user":"jeppemichael","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Overdose on a Crimeless Thriller","rating":10,"date":"16 April 2020","review":"An exposé into the beating heart of Silicon Valley, this film loads a bullet into the chamber with your name on it the second you become too smart for your own good. A series of interconnected human decisions define our characters while blurring the line between protagonist and anti-hero. With every character living on the frontier of time, this gripping story leaves its viewers in the dark until they are begging to break night.","user":"joker_hahahahahahahahahahahahaha","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Gritty and comedic romp..but thriller!","rating":10,"date":"5 March 2018","review":"Turns, twists, suspense, safecracking, jokecracking, drugs, nudity sex, shooting...loved the surprises and shock ending.
