[{"title":"A Fun Movie, Even If It's Not Pixar's Best","rating":7,"date":"18 June 2016","review":"I felt compelled to write a review, primarily because there are so many \"1 star\" reviews taking up residence on this site. Let's be frank, folks. If it wasn't Pixar, you wouldn't be whining about how \"awful\" it was.<br><br>Here's the truth for those who are actually interested in seeing it: it's a pretty great flick.<br><br>I would love to hop on here and tell you that everyone's wrong and it's the most amazing animated movie I've ever seen, but that wouldn't be true. I would honestly say it's near the bottom when compared to all the other Pixar films.<br><br>But it's still a lot of fun. Here are the most laudable aspects, in my humble opinion:<br><br>1: The animation is the best Pixar has done to this point. It's truly beautiful! They did a tremendous job of capturing the beauty of nature, from forests to prairies, and interposing an almost cheesy-looking dinosaur in the midst of it was fantastic. Don't waste your time with a DVD on this one, splurge for the Blu-Ray.<br><br>2: The characters are heartwarming, and the plot is simple. Frances McDormand is especially wonderful as the mother of the simple farming family of apatosaurs, and the characters are driven by simple values like family and hard-work. I understand why many were frustrated with the simplicity of the plot, but do we always have to jump the shark in a movie? It's a fun and beautiful journey.<br><br>3: It's a beautiful parody of a classic western story/film. I'm a little annoyed that the previews didn't push this aspect more, because a lot of the movie-bashing is based on the fact that people didn't get the story they expected. This is not unlike classic Disney movies like \"The Incredible Journey.\" Don't expect something modern or game-changing here. This is just a twist on a classic homecoming story.<br><br>I hope this preview helps dispel some of the hate. It's a fun movie, and worth a watch, even if it's not my favorite Pixar.","user":"MrGenre","rank":[87,93]},{"title":"A beautiful and powerful movie... especially for shy and/or insecure kids...","rating":10,"date":"4 March 2016","review":"It's pretty amazing that so many people seem to want to trash this movie. I watched this with my 2 daughters and my 10 year old said it was the best movie she's ever seen. She identified with Arlo's anxiety and insecurity as she also feels this way sometimes. His journey in dealing with these issues by facing his fears and, even if sheepishly at first, challenging them one by one helped her to understand herself. It allowed her to see that others struggle and can overcome these struggles in a way she hadn't seen before... up close and personal. As a child and adolescent therapist in practice for over 16 years, I can definitively tell you that any movie that prompts a child to look into themselves... to challenge their fears... and ends with them hugging you tightly, is a true marvel to behold. It's the core of the emotional artistry that movies are meant to be. Having an emotional connection to a movie or any work of art for that matter, will always win out over special effects and beautiful backdrops. It's the reason Star Wars: A New Hope was brilliant and The Phantom Menace sucked. Anyone have any kind of emotional connection to The Phantom Menace these days?","user":"dickson-88463","rank":[71,83]},{"title":"A seriously underrated movie","rating":10,"date":"31 March 2016","review":"***WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Don't believe all the bad reviews. People have sticks up their asses.<br><br>The only mistake Pixar made was releasing this 5 months or so after Inside Out. This movie pales in comparison. That being said, it's a good movie. My 4 year old loves it. It's not necessarily of the same caliber as the other Pixar movies (except Cars 2; you are all forgetting that one. It is by far the worst one.)<br><br>It's definitely dark and has some pretty adult elements, but it's not something a kid can't handle. It's not traumatic, by any means. Give your kids some credit. The whole theme of the movie is conquering fear, so it might do your kid some good to watch it. And stop saying it's a bad carbon copy of The Lion King just because the dad dies. How many times has that happened in other Disney movies? Stop it.<br><br>I'll just say watch it and see for yourself. No, it's not as good as Inside Out, but it's a solid movie, and it stands on its own. It's worth watching.","user":"eireanngobrach23","rank":[81,96]}]
