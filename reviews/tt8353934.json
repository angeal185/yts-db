[{"title":"Lin Shaye","rating":2,"date":"28 January 2020","review":"Can't understand Lin Shaye taking these type films she is far better than a film like this deserves. And that accent oh dear. Less said about the film itself the better and it would be impossible to spoil anyway. Sorry this one's a stinker.","user":"B13-66","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"0 out of 10","rating":1,"date":"29 January 2020","review":"I have watched some pretty terrible movies in my time and this one takes the cake. The acting is so terrible. incredibly incomplete movie bad from every angles. Even the trailer is terrible. It looks unoriginal and almost comical. Not trying to be rude just my personal opinion of a first impression.","user":"MajidMsa","rank":[13,18]},{"title":"How is this rated so high","rating":2,"date":"28 January 2020","review":"Terrible writing, terrible cinematography, terrible acting by most, terrible editing, terrible art directing. I bet the cast and crew rated it so high. The director didn't want to roll until the fog machine ran for 10 minutes between each take, some college crap. I'd rather watch an hour and a half of herpe cream commercials","user":"mikey-plamondon","rank":[6,7]}]
