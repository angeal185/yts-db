[{"title":"Actually quite good","rating":15,"date":"15 June 1999","review":"An early, nearly-forgotten picture from the director of \"Rebel Without a Cause\", this story of fugitive love (though not in the same was as \"Bonnie and Clyde\" or \"Gun Crazy\") is in its own right a rather accomplished picture.<br><br>Farley Granger is best remembered for his Hitchcock roles, and he gives a good, multifaceted performance. It's clear from the get-go that despite the company he keeps and despite his time in prison, he's really a scared, uncertain kid. Cathy O'Donnell is all but forgotten, but here gives a nearly Oscar-calibre performance, extremely convincing and appealing as his naive bride.<br><br>The film is also notable for early use of helicopter shots of cars, and for its refusal to vilify either the criminals or the cops (one of the policemen admits that \"the system failed him\", an astonishing statement for 1949).<br><br>All in all, a film which deserves to be resurrected from its obscurity.","user":"Patsy-9","rank":[54,55]},{"title":"Beautiful!!!!","rating":9,"date":"10 August 2001","review":"Nicholas Ray is mostly known for his work, \"Rebel WIthout a Cause\", but his first work, a dazzling, moving (if sentimental) film noir, is far better. Unjustly out-of-print, \"They Live By Night\" may have its minor flaws, but the stark, beautiful camerawork, stolid dialogue and (perhaps above all) exquisite performances make up for it. It has none of the often phony emotions and annoying characters that are found in \"Rebel Without a Cause.\"<br><br>Bowie, the innocent, sympathetic outlaw hero of \"They Live By Night\" is a wonderfully drawn. By no means is he the cliched nice-guy-in-a-bad-situation; though essentially good-hearted, he can be frighteningly callous at times. Farley Granger, working with excellent direction, he gives us glimpses of a violent yet passionate nature, struggling against the condemnation of society. Cathy O'Donnell is also entrancingly tender, yet we can vaguely see that her character is trapped in a hopeless relationship with Bowie. She is also sadly obscure, which plainly has nothing to do with her talent.<br><br>The one significant fault of this film is over-restraint. At times, Ray's understated direction can be extremely effective, such as when he is dealing with violence. But at other times the characters' (and especially Keechie's) emotions are so tightly controlled that some of the impact on the audience is lost. Still, despite a few faults, \"They Live By Night\" is a wonderful film, and if ever you can find it, sell your hair but GET IT!!!","user":"lauloi","rank":[49,55]},{"title":"a classic \"B-noir\" film with heart and style","rating":10,"date":"13 May 2006","review":"Nicholas Ray's first film is a fascinating, enveloping example of a filmmaker getting as much as he can out of so little. His film was made under the radar at RKO, despite having John Houseman as a producer. While also having a cast of really unknowns, he also uses it to his advantage to tell a small story very well. It's close to being one of the more 'text-book' examples, in the story's core, in the history of B-noir (film-noir that didn't get the hype of The Big Sleep or Out of the Past, star vehicles as much as unique thrillers). Bowie (Farley Granger, soon to be a Hitchcock stock-player) escapes from jail with the help of a couple of bank robbers who make him, as they say, \"an investment.\" He meets a girl, Keechie (Cathy O'Donnell), daughter of a farmer they pass by, and he becomes friends with her, so to speak. She agrees to leave town with him and they also decide, almost on a whim, to get married (for twenty bucks no less). But soon, very soon, fall in love, however, despite the checkered and now notorious past catching up to Bowie.<br><br>Obviously, if you're looking for stellar, \"method\" acting, look elsewhere in the main performances. But they do have enough of a pull in their chemistry on screen- sometimes rough and spelling of their doomed relationship, other times tragically tender- to back up the best aspects to the film. The true pleasures in seeing They Live By Night are the details that Ray lays in the scenes, bits of life probably taken from the book the movie's based on. Godard once proclaimed that Ray \"IS cinema\". If this statement does hold validity to a degree, it shows for certain even in Ray's debut in the scenes with the secondary platers. Such as the wedding scene, or in general with the dialog in the script (i.e. \"Between him and the chicken, I'd bet on the chicken\", or \"I'm the black sheep\" \"the only thing black about you are your eyelashes), or even with the strengths in Ray's camera as a simple storyteller. In a sense this cuts right to the chase with the theme of doomed youth, years before Rebel Without a Cause yet with the given desperation of the noir films. <br><br>While generally less seen than Ray's other films (though more attributable to being less available on video), it's likely one of his best; a powerful mix of the bittersweet tale of a criminal and his love that would decades later meld with other crime-film elements into a work like True Romance.","user":"Quinoa1984","rank":[22,24]}]
