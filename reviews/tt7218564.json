The actors were flat detached basically waiting for each other to deliver their lines a my turn your turn result. Plot did not pay attention to detail with gaps in the facts 1 min she's not missing cher camp the next she's spending 5 weeks at a ranch, 5 cheerleading spots available yet only 4 tryouts were selected simple things that add to convincing viewers of the story. Showed little to no effort by writers, directors &amp; by extension actors. No background music which gave it more of a high-school stage play vibe. Madeline Carroll did her best but had absolutely nothing to work with or feed off. Acceptable for kids 10 &amp; under couldn't make it through.","user":"hustlerl","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Win a race, save a ranch","rating":5,"date":"12 March 2019","review":"Young Madeline Carroll who has just made cheerleader at her high school and\nconvinced that is the high point of her life is told by her widower dad Joey Lawrence that she will be spending a few weeks of her summer at Aunt Denise\nRichards's ranch.
