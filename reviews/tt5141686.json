[{"title":"Simple, poetic and beautiful.","rating":10,"date":"25 May 2017","review":"Jago is a (too) short documentary on an eighty year old Indonesian fish hunter. That's what you're expecting to see anyway. The reality is an absolutely mesmerising visual autobiography and a masterpiece in cinematographic storytelling. The set is an old man in his hut, relating his youth and how he came to be who he is. Subtitles unfold to the rhythm of his voice, and a re-enactment, as artistic as any award winning film, replay the story as if it was a very vivid prehistoric mythology. Sometimes the story carries on entirely visually, along with a superb musical score. Nothing is spelled out, dissected or explained. A shimmer in the water, a sparkling bubble, a teenage smile or a tear in the eyes of the old man say it all without any need for words. The story itself is a real life story and is quite simple, but it is all weaved like a poem and indeed the hero is a poet. Again, most is left unsaid and it is up to you to retrieve it, it's all there in a non verbal form. Simple it may be but no less elating nor harrowing. <br><br>Can I just add how beautiful that part of the world is, and how young and beautiful that old man truly is. <br><br>45 minutes you will never forget.","user":"theredmare","rank":[30,33]},{"title":"Wow, Just Wow!!!!!","rating":10,"date":"14 October 2018","review":"Just watched Jago with my Indonesian girlfriend and sat absolutely spellbound for the duration.This isn't a big budget blockbuster with a cast to die for, Just 1 man, a fishing rod and his memories. Together the combine to tell a story and then some! Not a computer game, mobile phone or internet in sight! This film brings home and makes you realise just how privileged us in the west are, and how there are still people out there living, and surviving in a world few Westerners can relate too, myself included! Jaw dropping scenery and photography make the film an absolute must! English subtitles are no problem, although it did help having some to translate explain certain things the subtitles didn't cover. Absolute amazing, 10/10, 5 Stars!","user":"BenPMitchell","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"must see","rating":10,"date":"28 April 2018","review":"I watched this film over and over again. i think this is a very very good film. music wise. cindemaphotograpy yes. it touches feeling too. thanks to james reed and team.","user":"coenrad-91551","rank":[5,6]}]
