[{"title":"A gentle giant","rating":8,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"It seems some viewers didn't have patience for this film. Really a shame because I think anyone who gives themselves over to it will be taken by this giant. Beautiful cinematography, understated performances, interesting historical and socio-politico context that resonates today. As with the character of the giant himself, the film depends as much on what is unsaid as that which is spoken. It is a film rich in metaphor and poetic resonance. Most of all, it's a universally human story about the misfit in all of us, and the love and recognition we crave for our true selves. If that's not enough to satisfy any sensitive viewer, then there's no point looking beyond Megalodon.","user":"socarrasjorge","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"A Hidden Giant of a Film","rating":9,"date":"17 November 2018","review":"I get the reviewers here who don't get the touching nature of the presentation of the characters. The apparent limited warmth between the family members, called \"salt taste\" by one of the reviewers here, is Basque. I'd say that's the way they appear to us outsiders, that this is look into what makes the Basque culture unique is revealing.<br><br>I found the film visually stunning, the characters facinating, deep and wonderfully challenging to get to know. Here, a faithfully Basque presentation.<br><br>A an experience I hope I never forget.<br><br>Watched with Spanish dub and English subtitles.","user":"pyramidalapex","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"A splendid period piece about a stirring story of a giant man , being based on true events","rating":7,"date":"25 September 2019","review":"Enjoyable Spanish film with melancholy , thoughtful events and being deliberately paced .

It is a simple , dramatic and intelligent portrait of two people , focused on brothership , friendship and sibling rivalry which ambition, money and fame will forever change the family's fate . This is an uplifting movie at times, too, not just a tear-jerker or horrific in showing man's suffering , as he attempts to regain the dignity he lost after years spent as a side-show freak.

The story has a certain melancholic style , a climate of transience and sadness that spread the dispute between the two protagonists brothers . Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, nightmarish world but enriched by some colorful images thanks to wonderful outdoors . It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty , as the story progresses, he becomes the hero . Being actually a bold and courageous man, standing against the evils of modern society . It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence . The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience . You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence . The intrigue is whether these intertwined lives finally will eventually find and recognize . it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man Joaquin Eleizegi was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people . It packs a nice cast though unknown who gives good performance .
