[{"title":"Surprisingly entertaining","rating":8,"date":"10 February 2018","review":"Reading the reviews in this in national newspapers, you'd think it was one of the worst films you could possibly see, but I saw it with my 6 year old today and all I can say is those reviews have either not actually watched the film or are biased against European cartoons for some reason. We liked enough to look up the other \"Tad The Lost Explorer\" on our streaming service when we got back from the cinema.<br><br>It's a breath of fresh air from the usual Disney and Dreamworks output and is entertaining for all the family (I laughed at a few parts, which is something I really appreciate in a cartoon) basically being \"Indiana Jones for a younger audience\", which is perfect if you want to introduce your children to that kind of genre before they're old enough to watch those live action movies.","user":"Paradroid78","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"A funny and enjoyable sequel.","rating":7,"date":"22 April 2018","review":"My entire family loved the first one and we bought this as soon as we saw there was a sequel. Though not as good as the original, we laughed quite a bit and really enjoyed this sequel.","user":"adam-195-622288","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"WORTH A WATCH","rating":7,"date":"5 February 2018","review":"I Went to see this with my 8 year old daughter and both really enjoyed it. Very easy to follow.<br><br>Loved the bird and dog friendship but did find the romance sub-plot between the two main characters a little weak.","user":"mrsjond","rank":[7,8]}]
