[{"title":"Redefined the genre, and still does","rating":9,"date":"7 September 2002","review":"Although this is technically not Lees greatest film, it is a personal favourite since Lee was in full control and everything is pure Lee.  Many have wrongly stated this film is bad, having not seen the originals where you can really appreciate the composition of the showdowns (visual director with potential - see the rare 'rocking chair' shot in Game of Death).  The script is bad in a few places, particularly the humour, but this film was never inteneded for the west, but designed to appeal to his country men.<br><br>Now, the film features the best array of fighting sequences ever commited to celluloid.  Obviously influenced by Sergio Leones trilogy, tension is excellently built up before fight.  The sequences are not overly choreographed or played in slow motion or 'lightly' then speeded up, but contain a raw, feral edge combined with breathless technique.  The perfect marriage between art and realism.<br><br>The fights with Wong Ing Sik and Bob Wall while short, are underrated even by Lee fans.  Those who have been lucky enough to see the double nunchaku sequence in full, will have witnessed one of the best display of weaponary ever shown on the silver screen (along with the 'original' and 'complete' nunchaku footage from Game of Death and the wonderfully comprehensive display of martial arts in the underground Enter the Dragon sequence).<br><br>And then theres THAT coliseum fight.  Perhaps the start is abit overdone (But Lee wanted to put forward a point i.e. don't play to your oponents strength), but it is undoubtedly the best expression of the human body ever, whether fighting, dancing, running whatever.  Those brought up on Latter day Chan stuff and in particular Jet Li fights, will not appreciate this piece, but those knowing anything about the fighting arts or good choreography will be shaken not just stirred.","user":"scream25281","rank":[50,83]},{"title":"A true classic from the greatest martial artist of all time.","rating":10,"date":"3 December 1999","review":"This is the best Bruce Lee movie, period.  The single reason is that this movie shows him off a lot more than the other ones.<br><br>In this film, the one and only Bruce Lee made his directing debut.  Not only the movie showed the world why he is the greatest martial artist to ever live, it showed that he is way ahead of his time.  This film showcased his astounding skills, agility, and charm much more so than the brilliant classic \"Enter the Dragon\", and this film will show how truly fast and nimble Bruce Lee is with his fists and feet (the people had to accelerate the frame rates of all his films in order to catch his movements properly). The fight scenes are unbelievable, and it is already widely regarded that the final Colloseum battle between Tang Long (Bruce Lee) and Colt (Chuck Norris) is the best fighting sequence ever filmed for a movie.<br><br>Do yourself a favor by watching the original Way of the Dragon with all it's original fighting noises intact.  Those who are content on only watching the English-dubbed version are missing out on a lot!!!!  Any true fans of Bruce Lee can attest the massive difference it makes in experiencing the real voices of Bruce Lee when he is fighting on-screen.","user":"Dark Eye","rank":[47,89]},{"title":"Bruce Lee at his best","rating":10,"date":"1 July 2002","review":"Movement #4...dragon seeks path.<br><br>That one scene sets the whole film for me.<br><br>I will definitely say I really love this film.  No matter how many countless times I've seen it ever since I was a kid watching it on the Big Apple movie (old skool!!).  This movie introduced me to kung fu and the legend Bruce Lee.  His character is very interesting in this one, because he's a stranger in another land (Rome).  The people he's supposed to help don't even trust him (hilarious scenes of awkwardness between Bruce and Miss Chen).  Ha Goon plays a great comic relief (CHINESE BOXING!).  Although the movie takes a dark turn, there are many moments of laughs.  I will never forget that you can't order \"chinese spare ribs\". For the action, Bruce dominates as he takes on a whole gang of thugs using everything from fists and kicks to darts, a pole, and of course his awesome nunchuk scene (MOMMA MIA!!).  I love the sound effects when Bruce hits his opponents and the WOOSH sound is great!!  His training scenes show that Bruce Lee had 0% body fat and is good motivation for working out.  The finale between he and Chuck is a classic kung fu moment.  Great shots before the fight including the cat too!!<br><br>This is a great film.  Another example of a great martial artist.","user":"InzyWimzy","rank":[32,68]}]
