[{"title":"please fast forward","rating":3,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"The story, acting and visuals all have their moments but I found myself fast-forwarding through multiple scenes. I could go on a rant about how tired and maybe a little confused I was with some of the gaps in the story.. I admit with my fast-forwarding I may have skipped over the moments that tied the story together but at those times we retraced only to find as with most of this film \"a wasted effort\".","user":"Fyiwfc-186-76892","rank":[2,9]}]
