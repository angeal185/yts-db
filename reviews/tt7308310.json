I guess the money ran out or the cell phone had to be recharged. People who make movies like this should have to watch this crap on repeat for 50years so they feel the pain we went through","user":"yelvertonclyde","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Total political BS","rating":1,"date":"28 November 2019","review":"Whoever in Hollywood wrote the mess should be shot.

If his \"mom\" speaks only Spanish and she has a heavy accent then it's only right if he does too. I honestly clicked off the movie once the Americans were having a shootout with the \"Drug Dealers\" that scene was just too long and there was little to no cover for the men to hide from being shot at. It was surprising how it took them 5 minutes to take down one of the drug dealers that was shooting at them, the guy was at least 3 feet away and he had no cover. It was a 3 against 1. Honestly if you wanna get a good laugh then watch this movie, I don't think this movie she be taken seriously. But I give it a 2 stars because the script wasn't to bad.","user":"tacotubev","rank":[3,3]}]
