[{"title":"Quirky & inventive but unpolished","rating":7,"date":"29 November 2018","review":"There's a lot I like about this film; some scenes are very funny, it's inventive and silly with lots of interesting characters. Problem is it feels sort of a mess of different styles and ideas. The character's behaviours and motivations don't quite hang together properly and there's very odd pacing and the plot doesn't feel like anything is really at stake. It just stumbles from each slightly disjointed scene to the next. None of the characters seem properly fleshed out or consistent.<br><br>It's definitely worth watching but it undeniably has its problems. I look forward to seeing what the director/production company do next as I think they could do some really fantastic work once they get these teething issues figured out.<br><br>\nI'm also puzzled why so many of the characters are wearing eye make-up.","user":"codexniagra","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"The funniest low budget movie I've seen in a LONG time! Good for teens and up","rating":9,"date":"1 December 2018","review":"I heard about this on a torrent site (thank you). I have seen a lot of indy and low budget films, this was hands down the funniest I've seen in AGES. It was solid from beginning to end pretty much and very very funny. The writing was great. I think this is a great lighthearted flick for a Friday or Saturday night with the peeps. It wasn't too raunchy either, which I appreciated - I watched with my teenage daughter. I thought it was well done. IT IS LOW BUDGET so adjust your expectations. But if you are looking for a really unique film with some frequent giggles, this is a solid bet. The 'unpolished' stuff doesn't bother me nearly as much as trite and hackneyed storylines and plot devices, so for me it's 9/10.","user":"criticalluminosity","rank":[1,2]},{"title":"Provider of a couple good laughs and that's good enough for me","rating":7,"date":"30 December 2018","review":"There are some pros and cons about Adopting Trouble. It's a very low budget movie, so it shows with the filming and editing, but it doesn't really matter as the movie is funny enough to keep you entertained the whole time. I had a couple really good laughs and that's all I care about when watching a comedy. Ryan Templeman played Nick, a clumsy character with a very funny repertoire. Heather Murdock as Maryanne, a catholic devotee was also pleasant to watch. Clint Vanderlinden as Roach is another character that I enjoyed watching. The story is quite simple but normal for a movie like this, as the major point is to make you laugh, and in my case they succeeded. Low budget comedy but not bad at all.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[0,1]}]
