[{"title":"I liked it","rating":6,"date":"6 March 2020","review":"Typical Mark Wahlberg flick with likeable actors. Nothing new, still entertaining. I don't get why some people have to analyse this kind of movies to death just because it's not Oscar material.","user":"heulnicht","rank":[240,288]},{"title":"A GOOD P.I. MOVIE!","rating":7,"date":"6 March 2020","review":"I was a fan of the original Spencer for hire series on TV. Seeing that Mark Wahlberg was raised in the Boston area this is a just right fit for him.\nHaving grown up in many different cities, including the Boston area , this movie brings a lot of memories back. Wahlberg brings his unique sarcasm, wit and physical presence to the role. Although it is somewhat different than the series, it is a good PI movie that you will enjoy. The thing that people have to remember is that you have to judge movies based on categories. This will never win an Academy award, but I would not compare it to titanic or pretty woman because that's not the type of movie it is. This is an action, comedy, and some what of a mystery. If you're looking for a good action movie with unique personalities and some comedy thrown in, this is your movie, enjoy.","user":"clarkishome","rank":[113,152]},{"title":"Loved it! Enjoyed it! People are just so hard to please these days","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"Don't listen to the \"critics\". We enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Why can't people just sit back, enjoy and not overanalyze a movie? Sure, we've seen it before but we know all the stories of the comics and Marvel and superheroes and Disney and we still watch it right lol","user":"adamei","rank":[251,357]}]
