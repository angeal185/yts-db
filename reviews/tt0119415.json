[{"title":"A classic example of Australian humor","rating":10,"date":"14 December 2008","review":"This is a great example of Australian humor which is prevalent throughout the movie. <br><br>With less known names such as Jamie Croft (\"The Real Macaw\") and Richard Moir (\"Round the Twist\"), this movie is bound to be enjoyed by those who appreciate and understand the Australian culture, and more importantly, the humor. <br><br>Although a couple of Americans appear in this film, they fit in well with the storyline, which is presented as them being introduced to the Australian way of life, which makes a nice change from the usual attempts which American film makers make to put an Australian spin on what is essentially an American film, mostly unsuccessfully. Being made by an Australian film company and including Americans, this movie simply works.<br><br>The storyline is consistent and demonstrates perfectly a true Steve Irwin style approach to animal activism and conservation, in this case, the protection of Australia's most well known animal icon: the kangaroo. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in Australian movies, movies about animals and movies about conservation. But most of all, those who enjoy a good laugh and appreciate the uniqueness of Australian humor.","user":"fieldmarshal-mitch","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Great for kids","rating":6,"date":"31 May 2010","review":"So this was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid. It put me into a Kangaroo and Australia phase for a while. Now that I'm older I watched some of it and I realize it's definitely more of a kid's movie. There's nothing wrong with that, there are many kids movies that are really good, but adults probably won't have much reason to watch this one without kids present. The acting is OK, I realize now that the music is ridiculous (but perfect for the movie) and there are some scenes that are kinda silly or campy. There may be one or two things I would understand better if I was an Australian.<br><br>Long story short it's an OK movie in the eyes of an adult but it is AMAZING in the eyes of a kid.","user":"curst_saden","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Surprising good movie","rating":6,"date":"2 December 1999","review":"When you look at casting, you probably won't find great names; but this adventure-comedy flows extremely well without the need of great acting performances. The story is simple and it works because it doesn't take place in USA but in Australia, and also because almost everybody is concerned with the amazing australian kangaroos and its environment. There are great shot compositions, and I suppose its natural to expect more from its director's work.","user":"ausum","rank":[6,7]}]
