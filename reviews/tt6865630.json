[{"title":"Amazing cinematography. The film is made to promote tourism. Puerto Rico is indeed beautiful.","rating":6,"date":"7 January 2020","review":"Lots of greenery, beautiful houses n the fascinating blowhole.\nThe film is about a salesman n a young kid n how the kid helps the man n teaches him to hustle.\nThe film is listed as a comedy but there is no humor.\nThe end scene of the blowhole is a bit far fetched.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[27,33]},{"title":"SURPRISINGLY BEAUTIFUL","rating":6,"date":"22 January 2020","review":"Light, fast and surprisingly beautiful. Ana does not worry about being a masterpiece with twists and a complex plot, but by serendipity, it manages to create and give everything a film needs. Careful and simply (less is more) direction by Charles McDougall, excellent characterization / interpretation of the characters with an excellent chemistry between Garcia and Keen that keep you glued to the chair. What else should be added? Great job!","user":"RinoBortone91","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Why the low scores? Movie is great fun to watch!","rating":8,"date":"10 January 2020","review":"Just like another user reviewed, it's a joy to see Andy Garcia and Dafne Keen acting, so, yeah, ignore the low score and watch it if you want to have a laugh. Some reviewers got a problem with humor here, but I am grateful another review made me watch this movie and I liked it a lot.","user":"suripat","rank":[10,14]}]
