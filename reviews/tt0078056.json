[{"title":"A forgotten gem","rating":2,"date":"2 August 2003","review":"Stallones directing debut is a forgotten gem, back when it was released crushed by the critics and snubbed by the audiences. Wrongfully so, because this is great film that especially today makes you wonder whatever happened to Sylvster Stallone the artist. Here he was in all his glory: writer, director, star (even singer of the title song), and maybe that was the reason this film was ignored and critically lambasted back then. When Rocky came out, everybody body loved the writer-actor, but as we know, more sooner then later, people (especially the press) love to turn on the one they once favoured. Paradise Alley is a beautiful fim that needs to be rediscovered. Its made by someone who loves to tell a good, human story, captured in beautiful shots (just watch credit montage - the rooftop contest) Its full of colorful characters, full of warmth and feeling and wonderful humor. This film was a promise Stallone sadly later on never fulfilled, maybe because everyone turned so harsh on this one, which is something I will never understand. After decades of forgettable movies I wish Stallone would finally defy all nay-sayers and go back to stuff like this. He did by starring in Copland, but since then he made horribly choices as an actor, doing movies which didn't even make it to the theatres.","user":"stfbarth","rank":[33,42]},{"title":"A Depression-Era \"Rocky\"","rating":14,"date":"14 July 1999","review":"Stallone made this film between \"Rocky\" and \"Rocky II\" and it shares alot of similarities with those films.  It's the story of three brothers who dream of busting out of the poverty of Hell's Kitchen in New York during the mid-1940's.<br><br>Sly plays Cosmo Carboni, the street-wise hustler with no visible means of support but a head full of get-rich-quick schemes who hatches a plan to promote his brutish but gentle-natured brother (who's job is hauling giant blocks of ice all over the city) as a professional wrestler.  Armand Assante plays his other brother, a cynical war veteran who was wounded in combat and now works as a mortician.<br><br>The story is peppered with colorful Damon Runyon-esque characters and a nicely balanced combination of humor and drama.  Stallone writes and directs well, getting good performances from all his actors, and the film has a rich flavor and feeling for the period.<br><br>One of Stallone's least-known and least appreciated films, but it's well worth seeking out.  Nicely done and entertaining.","user":"G-Man-25","rank":[22,28]},{"title":"if this were released today, it would be a huge hit","rating":8,"date":"21 February 2003","review":"... and maybe pick up an award or two.  This movie is very well-done on every level, and LOT of fun to watch.  Stallone's characterization of a lazy goofball who wants everybody else to bust their butts to make his dreams come true for him is just brilliant, possibly his very best performance. Actually, there's not a single bad performance in this whole movie and that's saying a lot, considering that some of the major roles were filled by guys who were professional boxers or wrestlers.  In addition, the sets/costumes/lighting give a very good sense of place and time -- only the hairdos on the female leads tip you off that this was made in the late '70s.","user":"itsbarrie","rank":[20,26]}]
