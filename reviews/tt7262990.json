[{"title":"All \"dumb,\" no \"deep\"","rating":1,"date":"20 January 2020","review":"Apart from the fact that this is a blatant and one-dimensional ripoff of 1408, this film hops on the bandwagon of everyone and their grandmother making commentary pieces on social media. The characters are unrealistically dumb and the plot makes absolutely no sense. Life is short, don't waste it watching this dumpster fire....unless you find incoherent garbage like this to be unintentionally funny, and if that's the case, have fun!","user":"taylordavison-68485","rank":[26,26]},{"title":"Pointless","rating":2,"date":"19 January 2020","review":"Made no sense.\nThe beginning doesn't not tie into how the \"demon\" exits, or why it wants kids?\nWhat does Bobby got to do with the game maker? Or the game itself.","user":"rogza","rank":[25,27]},{"title":"Terrible !!!!","rating":1,"date":"16 January 2020","review":"I have nothing positive to say .
