[{"title":"Much better than the score suggests","rating":6,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"I downloaded this movie because I wanted to know how a film with this subject could really have a 2.7 rating. I mean this thing must be garbage from start to finish, right?<br><br>Wrong. I mean it's not perfect, relies too much on drugs to provide character transitions between acts, and could use some editing, but it's fun to watch this collection of unlikable characters pretend to get along. It's even better when they just stop trying. There are a few excellent lines and funny scenes.<br><br>If I were going to write some sort of essay I'd probably write about how both of the primary male characters are both control freaks, but in completely different ways. Happily, though, I'm not in school so can just enjoy watching them be jerks.","user":"imdb-2920","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"its a hard way, but somebody gots to do it","rating":7,"date":"7 August 2019","review":"I guess when youve seen through this charming little flick of low budget production, you will find quite a few rekcognazibel syptoms from your own young adulthood, a turmoil of love and feelings, and for sure not getting better under the influenc of dope or alcohol.<br><br>the story is easy to follow, and the basic humour especially in the first half are good and made me laugh a few times. being afraid of coupling up with another couple that has transverse looks on life , and especially on the sex topic, are for some frightening and a reason to become jealous wether you will or not.<br><br>the grumpy old man had very similar takes on life as preachured in the film, so embarrasing or not, its very well recommended from me.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[2,11]}]
