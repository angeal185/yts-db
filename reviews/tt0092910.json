[{"title":"A weird mess but still watchable for morbid B-movie lovers.","rating":5,"date":"9 June 2004","review":"Finally I found this hard to find cheap Slasher flick. I watched it for the first time on USA NETWORK several years ago, and it stayed in my memory to these days. I explored the catacombs of a rare video store after digging and getting dust all over me, I found it under the title \"The House Of Horror\". <br><br>\"Doom Asylum\" is a Slasher flick that you have to watch it with very low, (I mean VERY low) expectations because it offers the minimal entertainment for fans of the subgenre. You have to choices: The first is to watch it as a very low budget spoof of Slasher flicks or as a low budget straight Horror flick. You get gore, a deformed killer, sharp instruments to perform kills, hot chicks in bikinis, a cheesy soundtrack, and a very creepy asylum.<br><br>The death scenes are as cheesy as you want, probably made by an amateur f/x artist. Although I love the drill kill(come on! in slow motion you can see how the drill has a tube that pumps fake blood as it makes pression with the guy's forehead) and the slashed face death; both scenes are extremely cheesy and laughable. I won't even get into the other death scenes because there's almost no production value or even decent fake blood. As a hint, check out when \"Mr. Killer\" cuts a guy's toes but before doing it, he smells his shoes.<br><br>There's a lot of black humor in the parody scenes. For example, when the black guy finds the black punk girl both fantasize about running in a green valley and then start to make out and simulate sex. Other example is the scene where the (at the time) survivors go to a chapel and pray for their dead friends! while a maniac is on their hunt. Now that I think, the whole movie is a joke! every scene has some humor , involuntary or not.<br><br>There are many goofs to laugh about. For example, on the beginning after the supposedly \"fatal\" car accident, you can see that the Mrs. La Rue's arm is hidden under grass! to produce a visual effect where the audience is supposed to believe that she lost her hand. Also, the killer doesn't seems to be badly burned and even moves without problem; seconds later he appears in the morgue horribly burned. The two main heroines are extremely hot! beautiful, sexy. I really cared for them. That could be a reason to watch the movie. Although there are many reason for not watching it. The killer spends almost 10 minutes of the movie watching black and white movies from Tod Slaughter! Also, the killer looks like a different person on several scenes. First, the make up makes him look like Leatherface, and then like Freddy Krueger (in half of the movie). Well I bet that filming lasted for 3 days. <br><br>Something to notice about is that the movie's events take place ONLY in the day. There aren't any night scenes, no budget for lightning?! Anyways, I haven't seen that in any other Slasher flick. <br><br>The movie has no plot. You just see the teens getting killed by the deranged coroner. What really got me about \"Doom Asylum\" are it's WEIRD dialogues. Check out for lines including Mickey Mantle, Ronald Reagan, the right to choose political preferences, incest, and the weird ending dialogue between the Coroner and his ex lover's daughter. The ending. Oh well, one of the worst in cinema's history. You need to watch it to believe it. <br><br>I may be out of my mind, but I recommend \"Doom Asylum\" if you want to laugh about it because all of it's goofs and weirdness. Grab a pack of chips, coca cola, and enjoy this ultra low budget. A hidden gem and almost impossible to find.","user":"insomniac_rod","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Perhaps the greatest B movie ever created","rating":10,"date":"6 July 2002","review":"It is the holy grail of B movies!  The acting is sad, but that only adds to the laughs! Effects?  Well in the opening scene where a girl loses an arm, you can clearly see her arm \"hidden\" under some hay.  Which only adds to the laughs!  And such classic lines as \"But, mom! That would be incest!\", \"I voted for Reagan\", and \"I hate rap music!!\" You would just have to see the movie to really appreciate these lines! If you see it to rent/buy/steal whatever... PICK IT UP!","user":"Shadow_Destiny","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"after you watch this movie, you'll be doomed","rating":19,"date":"19 July 2002","review":"hey! it's slasher 80's fun, I agree with the guy that said that this is pure Friday entertainment, we have  gore, a deformed killer, some hot chicks, and creepy settings. One thing that creeped me out, is the way this killer uses the instruments to kill,, it's so primitive! Don't be fooled by the box of the film, though it looks stupid, and the killer seems to be a joke, the movie is not that terrible. It's a baaaaaaaad movie, but after you watch you can say , that you can watching ANYTHING. Just recommended for true slasher fans!!!","user":"Insomniac_moviefan","rank":[7,10]}]
