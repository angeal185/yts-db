[{"title":"Don't go to McDonald's for Filet Mignon","rating":8,"date":"10 May 2019","review":"This is a simple, unpretentious comedy about middle aged women getting drunk and acting inappropriately. Don't read anything more into it and you won't be disappointed.\nI laughed because I could identify with it, but I probably wouldn't have found it as funny otherwise. Maybe this one is for the 40/50+ viewers.","user":"simon-pickersgill77","rank":[186,241]},{"title":"Fun, lighthearted, relatable, and not for everyone!","rating":9,"date":"11 May 2019","review":"The majority of the negative reviews for this come from men named George or Peter who expect aging women to be prim and proper, with their graying hair tied back into a birds nests, wearing mock turtlenecks and gently sipping on a maximum of one glass of wine. This movie connects with those of us who don't give a $@&amp;? about that.<br><br>I found this to be relatable and lighthearted. I don't think it was meant to be a blockbuster of laughs every 5 minutes. It's geared toward women who are struggling and aging and not sure where the $&amp;@? their lives go after \"a certain age\". It's about girl fiends who have grown together and apart and together again. I<br><br>Grab a glass of wine (or a box - who cares?!), get your Napa buzz on, lighten up, and enjoy this piece of gold from the SNL ladies.","user":"jessica-brawn","rank":[108,145]},{"title":"Age Appropriate Movie","rating":8,"date":"12 May 2019","review":"I wonder what age is of the reviewers who disliked this movie. As a older middle aged white male who has taken vacations with old friends I thought this movie was spot on with light humor.","user":"schrite-300-547811","rank":[104,145]}]
