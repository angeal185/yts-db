[{"title":"A neo-noir masterpiece","rating":8,"date":"25 May 2019","review":"<a href=\"/title/tt0498399/\">We Own the Night (2007)</a> is a powerful film based on a dark atmosphere, literally and figuratively. First of all, many, if not most, scenes are shot at night with an obvious aesthetic sense. Then, the topic deals with the violent conflict between the Russian underworld and the NYPD, within the Brooklyn of the 80s. It's an ultimate film noir: crime, treason, jealousy and fatalism are themes adroitly developed by <a href=\"/name/nm0336695/\">James Gray</a> and marvelously interpreted by an awesome cast. <a href=\"/name/nm0000380/\">Robert Duvall</a> is a honest and accomplished policeman, a wise and protector father, <a href=\"/name/nm0578949/\">Eva Mendes</a> is a deliberately inflammatory woman, <a href=\"/name/nm0000242/\">Mark Wahlberg</a> is the ideal son and then <a href=\"/name/nm0001618/\">Joaquin Phoenix</a> is the 'second' son with a slightly tortured mind and who seeks his own place in the shadow of his family. In my humble opinion, this movie is clearly underrated. As a synthesis: 8/9 of 10.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[21,26]},{"title":"Standing ovation -- Not just at cannes","rating":9,"date":"3 June 2007","review":"I saw that We Own The Night received a standing ovation at the European critics screening and premiere at Cannes. Well, I can tell you at the preview screening I saw a while ago in the US, the audience applauded enthusiastically as well. The audience was totally into this movie in a way you don't usually see anymore. Not just grooving on it, but engrossed. Reminds me of The Godfather not just the movie, but the way the audience enjoyed it. Only reason I didn't give it a 10 was I don't give most movies at 10 unless they're like The Searcher or Vetigo. Again I don't want to give away too much about the movie because I hate now how everyone knows everything about a movie's plot before it opens. Let's just say it's both a crime movie and a family drama. A socially conscious melodrama and a cop story. And it has a couple of great action scenes. The acting was top notch by Joaquin Phoenix, Mark Wahlberg (better than in The Departed), Robert Duvall (always good) and especially Eva Mendes who I've never seen like this before. 9/10","user":"Melville-7","rank":[189,293]},{"title":"Excellent!","rating":9,"date":"17 June 2007","review":"I caught a recent screening of this film and as a fan of thrillers I was more than impressed. The film creates a handful of true white-knuckle scenes but also accomplishes telling a story that has weight and depth. I love when a film takes its time to develop real characters and not repeats of what we've already seen. The crime genre is so full of clich√©s already. This film pays homage to classics such as French Connection while breaking new ground in its family/police drama. Phoenix, Wahlberg, Duvall and Mendes are all superb. Eva Mendes deserves a particular mention, as she has not yet been seen this way before.","user":"coopkar","rank":[152,251]}]
