[{"title":"Wow, this was impressive","rating":8,"date":"25 July 2013","review":"With a score of 6.1 when I started to watch, I wasn't expecting to much. Well, it's proved once more. Scores on IMDb can't be called trustworthy and they can bias your opinion.<br><br>Both Josh and Dan deliver some hilarious and profound acting! With a story not to far fetched and delivered at a steady pace, this movie was actually quite entertaining. It kept me interested throughout and had me on the edge of my seat. It's safe to assume you can easily empathize on what these guys have been through. Not to many plot holes and the ending was satisfying too. It makes you think about what one should do when you end up in a situation like this.<br><br>Also it reminded me of me and my best friend. There were quite some similarities. I will recommend this to friends, that's for sure.","user":"Hendrik_Numiah","rank":[67,81]},{"title":"Scenic Route-- SXSW","rating":9,"date":"10 March 2013","review":"I saw Scenic Route during SXSW on Friday. I had no idea what to expect besides a mohawk. I was blown away. The acting, dialogue, and desert scenery combine to make this an awesome movie. The deeper meanings and plot twists will keep you thinking about the movie and its implications for days. The group I saw the movie with was still talking about script and interplay between the actors two days later. In fact, I want to see the movie again because I think there are subtle things I may have missed on the first viewing that may make me appreciate the film even more. It really is a unique film. If you are tired of movies that seem to copy old ideas, then this movie is for you. I highly recommend it.","user":"jasonitkin","rank":[54,75]},{"title":"A fantastic movie that is very much worth seeing but won't get the audience that it deserves. I highly recommend. I say A-","rating":8,"date":"15 August 2013","review":"\"You stage a breakdown in the middle of the desert so we can talk?!\" Mitchell (Duhamel) and Carter (Fogler) are best friends we have started to drift apart when they decide to go for a ride. When the truck they are in breaks down in the middle of a desert they start to argue about the directions their lives have taken. The argument starts to escalate and their friendship is pushed to its limits. Before I start I have to admit that the plot doesn't seem exciting or interesting at all but this is a perfect example of you can't judge a book by it's cover. While the plot isn't all that intriguing the acting is so brilliant that it gives the movie a tenseness and excitement that the idea alone can not. You really begin to feel for the friends and are so invested in them that you find yourself living and dying with them with every passing minute. It's to talk to much about the events without giving something away because each event builds on the one before it but I will say that this was a pleasant surprise and I highly recommend this. Overall, one of the best \"under the radar\" movies I have seen in a long time and another movie that won't get the audience that it deserves. I give it an A-.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[31,41]}]
