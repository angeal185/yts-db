[{"title":"Food for thought","rating":8,"date":"17 September 2019","review":"An extra point earnt for two tracks by The Damned in the soundtrack. One or two low reviews by others almost stopped me watching this movie but as I'm a curious soul it spurned me on to watch it and find out myself and I'm glad I did. Sure the movie could have been better, twice as long but it didn't have to be, the point had already been made. The obscene, grotesque wealth gap of the social divide has been widening for many decades to the point where food banks are a lifestyle for those who have nothing, It's depressing stuff but it's real life for many and the injustice of it all is sickening. Is the movie believable, could it really happen?.., perhaps but hopefully not, it does however serve as a reminder that there's a limit a person can take when they feel they have nothing left to live for. It's a shame someone reviewed this movie as only being suitable for the white van man. I think it's a movie that tests a person's perception of reality and ignorance","user":"talktothebody","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"GOOD FILM..QUIRKY ENDING BUT ALL THROUGH OUT IT HOLDS IT'S FORM","rating":7,"date":"10 April 2018","review":"This film has great pacing good acting and intriguing cinematography. <br><br>DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE REVIEWS KNOCKING THIS WELL THOUGHT OUT Home Invasion. Hidden between many layers reveals a film that poignantly depicts the mindset of those who have and the have nots.. The film is also a dark comedy but plays it well not to disrupt the pacing. Camera angles are also a delight when watching this film, It's a pretty straight forward movie so I won't go any further and spoil the film but it's definitely worth a watch.. \nThrough out the entirety I was engaged , Though there was a scene or two at mid point that didn't seem to believable because it would of attracted to much attention for them to pull it off.\nAnd like I said in the header at the very end the movie kind of morphed into the dark comedy element which was kind of jolting but when you add it all up gives you a great amount of good film thats worth sitting down and setting some time aside for.\nso I give this a GOOD MOVIE rating.","user":"tkaine3","rank":[20,32]},{"title":"Spellbinding","rating":10,"date":"7 November 2018","review":"Jack Roth is outstanding in this film and his performance, together with Tim Bentinck's carries this thriller. Some humorous one liners. Current films do not deal with the issues of the widening social divide and the disenfranchised so this film is refreshing albeit a bit raw. Overall I enjoyed it and it gave much food for thought.","user":"jlc-42921","rank":[5,6]}]
