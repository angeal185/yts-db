Really, it reminded me more of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, another collection of short stories which feels meticulously plotted yet like an illusion that vanishes when you try to make literal meaning out of it. The two are the best evocation of the era when short story collections mattered to normal people and vice versa. There are almost no humans, but the movie is full of perfectly observed character moments that are orchestrated with thematic precision. This is the Winesburg, Ohio of avant garde filmmaking, and probably a better cinematic version of that book's accomplishments in micro-observation than the adaptation.","user":"rubberbandman197","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"This film belongs to a fine art gallery.","rating":6,"date":"6 August 2018","review":"Beautiful film and some frames are striking. It is slow and would take peserverance to sit till the end. I am surprised it'd be shown in HK cinemas which are usually quite commercial - probably because of his big name. I fell asleep from 11-16th frame, then again the last two frames. But no audience left the cinema which I find quite amusing.<br><br>I wouldn't say it's a great film. At many points I was a bit disappointed at how rough the details were made...it was like seeing a large installation work of a respectfulartost in a gallery, but noticing execution flaws here and there.<br><br>It would not have been shown in hk cinemas or received that many awards, if it were a film by a new film maker.<br><br>It's experimental but I can hardly describe it as a good film. I'd not recommend t to friends. Sorry.","user":"shushupu","rank":[13,28]}]
