[{"title":"One of my favorite MH movies to date!","rating":8,"date":"31 August 2015","review":"So one half of the movie is about 4 hybrids who have a history of dropping out of school after school since they've been discriminated for being different. Think of it as mixed people; whose parents are of 2 different races. Just like how the hybrids are from 2 different species. They shouldn't have been pushed around for being \"mixed\". A couple doesn't have to be the same race to marry or have children. Love knows no limit.<br><br>The other half is about 8 of our characters being fused into 4. Long story short, teamwork is the only thing they needed to pull it together, to set aside their differences. As for Draculaura and Robecca, turns out it's not always a good thing when 2 people have the same thing in common. In this case both of them are always giving in, but to control their fused body, either of them has to be given in to.<br><br>Frankie keeps mentioning how MH is family, so it means sometimes we all have friends who stick with us through thick and thin. Such friends are as good as family, they don't have to be related by blood. And of course the hybrids are really lucky to end up in MH where all monsters are welcome.<br><br>The part where the MH students had to reminisce their best memories of Frankie to revive her also reminds us we need to be grateful to the people who positively impact our lives.<br><br>Overall excellent with so many life lessons in 70 minutes. Plus the animation seems to be improving.","user":"fanboysfangirl-175-702564","rank":[4,5]}]
