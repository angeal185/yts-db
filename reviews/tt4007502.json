While she takes her sister on a treasure hunt for presents around town (bumping into some familiar faces), Kristoff is left in charge of guarding the decorations.<br><br>All seems well, until Elsa's cold starts to cause havoc; let's just say that when a Snow Queen sneezes, there's a high chance that's she'll end up polluting the area with extremely hyperactive \"snow babies\". Will the day be ruined, or will Kristoff and Olaf manage to keep them in tow? <br><br>\"Frozen Fever\" is colourful and fun, packed with stunning animation and humour to keep both children and adults intrigued. It offers numerous nods towards the original movie (including one \"Let it Go\" pun to make you giggle) and a catchy song that will surely stay in your head for days. <br><br>Be warned \"Frozen\" fans: \"Frozen Fever\" may just get you even more hooked than you were before! A solid 10/10","user":"Hunter-Lostie","rank":[28,38]},{"title":"\"Frozen Fever\" is a viral infection too awesome to avoid!","rating":10,"date":"15 March 2015","review":"Disney's 2013 film \"Frozen\" is truly a milestone in movie history. It became the highest-grossing animated film of all time, with over USD 1.2 billion box office revenue. It's also the first female- directed film to reach the billion dollar mark, thanks to Jennifer Lee. Now that if you miss to see the phenomenon in theaters, now is the chance to catch up.<br><br>The short film centers on Elsa's preparation to Anna's birthday, with help from Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf. It's funny and heartwarming. It's probably 8-10 minutes long only, and you'll beg for more. \"Making Today A Perfect Day\" is treated as the successor to the YOLO song \"Let It Go\". It's catchy and good, and consistent to the aura of the Disney Princess franchise. Expect some nice surprise at the last 2 minutes! It might be important for the upcoming full-length sequel.<br><br>Franchise movies thrive because audiences connect with characters. Even I myself experience it. \"Frozen 2\" is coming for sure, and it's too awesome to miss.","user":"AdrianValOlonan","rank":[23,33]}]
