[{"title":"Rapping wise it was good ,, Directing wise it was phenomenal","rating":8,"date":"2 December 2018","review":"\"My name is\"<br><br>Oh my goodness !! my rating for the movie was around high 6 ,, up until the last 30 minutes where i felt i'm on a crazy emotional roller coaster ,, the rapping ,, in first half it was good and steady but not that \"8-mile\" rap final battle level .. even though i loved the battle with \"Prospek\" at the beginning ,,, the rapping in the second half it was explosive, emotional and Soooo thrilling ,, i watched the whole thing with subtitle \"As you do :D\" and it still felt fast and connected and well rhymed bars.<br><br>\"That little love tap, That was real touching ... But i just murdered my own friend, so you should know that i don't feel nothing\"<br><br>Aside for the rapping \"stressing on the last unbelievable 30 minutes\" Joseph Kahn did one amazing job on the Directing !!! man the camera movement , the pauses , the monologue were just on point ,, with each zoom-in you just feel the excitement and thrill of \"Adam\" thinking what to say next .. In Joseph Kahn style of Directing you can see so many diversity you can even a smell a breeze of Quentin Tarantino in some close-up scenes .<br><br>\"I mighta lost a tooth but ... F#ck it, I just beat you for the crown\".<br><br>I gotta go back a little bit before going to the casting,, Eminem was in the whole thing as a producer but i actually felt some bars sees his style in some way , and i do appreciate ;) -- and not forgetting the comedy in the screenplay was high class,, and that nervousness added a lot to the drama/comedy mix.<br><br>So the cast ,, first time seeing that Canadian boy Calum Worthy on anything,, but OMG !!! ,,the last couple of scenes alone just say a lot about how he will turn out to be in a couple of years, his facial expressions are out of this world ... Jackie Long was amazing too and same goes for Walter Perez and Jonathan Park (who was really funny).<br><br>\"Megaton vs Adam\".<br><br>Finally ,, the story is really good and the rapping is even better than i expected \"Noting that i'm not a rapping expert and all\" ,, but the last 30 minutes a lone makes watching the whole 2 hours movie 10 times worth it ... do it .. recommended.","user":"Aktham_Tashtush","rank":[27,39]},{"title":"Where \"Where \"Hamilton\" introduced history to the live stage, \"Bodied\" brings rap to the big the screen","rating":10,"date":"6 January 2018","review":"On day six of 2018, music video and indie film director Joseph Kahn, and writer Alex Larsen (Kid Twist \"King of the Dot\") presents a street spoken word battle rap film that surpasses it's producer Eminem's 2002 \"8 Mile\". While this in-your-face, loud (sound track by Eminem ft. dr. Dre and music by Brain Mantia and Melissa Reese), fast moving and at times crude delivery in dialogue film may not be everyone's cup of tea, the performances, relevant dialogue, comedic tone, interesting special effects and the opportunity to peak into the underground world of battle rap should to be missed. Where \"Hamilton\" introduced history to the live stage, \"Bodied\" brings rap to the big screen. Enter young college caucasian grad student Adam (Disney \"Austin &amp; Ally\" star Calum Worthy), smack in the middle of a competition trying to explain the language spoken within battle rap to his equally out of place girlfriend Maya (Rory Uphold - \"HelLA\" TV). Doing his graduate thesis on \"battle rap\" and the use of the \"N\" word, Adam knows the lingo and all the players. Quickly he befriends lead battle rapper Behem Grymm (Jackie Long \"The Comebacks\" 2007) who takes him on as a reluctant protege. Once in, Adam realizes he's got it in him to battle rap, combining his his smart boy eduction and historic knowledge of the craft. Making a terrific reappearance on the big screen is the mature Anthony Michael Hall (\"Sixteen Candles\" 1984), as Adam's well respected literary professor and father. The film is also filled by many of today's battle rappers, who also coached the films stars in the craft. This is a well made indie film, packed with comedy and drama, that will surly be a huge stepping stone for its director, writer and especially it's main stars Calum Worthy and Jackie Long. You will want to be one of the first to see this film. \"Bodied\" was screened at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2018.","user":"ccorral419","rank":[44,77]},{"title":"Terribly Underrated","rating":9,"date":"6 December 2018","review":"It took me a few minutes to understand what was happening but it's not exactly what you think it is.\nIt's remarkably pure...that we can access whatever part of ourselves we didn't even think we had...but always had a hint (of greatness) of.
