[{"title":"Naff","rating":3,"date":"12 November 2019","review":"Like most low budget Christmas films that are mostly full of wooden acting. I felt that they should have had the script in front of them because it definitely gave me the impression of 'acting'. Why do they bother to waste the celluloid it surely can't return its outlay. Oh and the singing! that's when I turned off.\nGive it a miss!","user":"puddlecheck-12219","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Not the best Christmas story","rating":3,"date":"12 November 2019","review":"I only saw the last 30 minutes had to turn the sound to mute when Noelle started singing (awful). I only watched the rest because of Stephen Colletti.","user":"denise-dargan33","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Cheesy Holiday Movie - it's so awesome","rating":7,"date":"19 December 2018","review":"Got home from work early and came across a ton of holiday movies on Lifetime and Hallmark channel. This one follows the cheesy holiday movie formula quite nicely. Best of all, it stars one of my favorite actresses of all time: Melissa Gilbert. I'm a Little House on the Prairie fan for life!<br><br>However I nerded out and froze the frame where Noelle sees the article about Nick. The authors of this fake website forgot to use spell check. They forgot an \"S\" in \"Russell\", used \"collage\" instead of \"college\" twice and forgot to follow the grammar rule \"i before e, except after c\" in the word received. Then again, I may be the only viewer to freeze a screen and spend time reading the text on a fake website.<br><br>Aside from that. Loved the movie!!","user":"xinagames","rank":[5,9]}]
