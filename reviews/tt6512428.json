Tonight we saw the new film \"Indivisible,\" and it literally changed me. Made me cry like a baby. Challenged me to be a better husband, a better father, and a better believer. Yes, it's a \"Christian\" film, but it's so well done. I highly recommend that you take people you love to see it while you can. You won't be disappointed...","user":"brianebadger","rank":[30,41]},{"title":"Faith-Based Film is Authentically Portrayed","rating":6,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"Faith-based drama, based on a true story, depicting the devastating effects of war on military Chaplains, soldiers, and their families. In this case, the film follows a dedicated Army Chaplain (Justin Breuning) in his first deployment to the Iraqi War Zone, in 2007, as well as his equally dedicated wife's (Sarah Drew) desire to aid and comfort families remaining at their home base at Fort Stewart, Ga..<br><br>I thought the characters here were realistically presented and believable. At times, the stark realities of war and loss can be difficult to watch, but there are uplifting moments as well.<br><br>I'm normally not a regular viewer of faith-based movies, but I felt this one was rather authentically portrayed.","user":"larrys3","rank":[7,8]}]
