[{"title":"Atheist but always astonished by this masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"Let's forget for a while religions and conflicts between humans. Let's focus on the huge amount of creativity and greatness that made this masterpiece. Although DreamWorks have imitated Disney on different levels but the result surprised all those who watched it. The title itself implies that a great story took place in an old great civilization.\nIn my opinion, the story of this movie is not like what most of people think: conflict between good and bad. It's way beyond that. It's a story of two real brothers who love each other to the core but they were obliged to become enemies due to their differences in beliefs and religion. Don't you think that it's time for people to forget about their differences and become compassionate and empathetic? Love will unite us while religions make us enemies to each other.\nThe music was outstanding, as well as the songs. The soundtracks of this film make the spectator live in old Egypt which is a very genius innovation by the composer. Very few composers know how to connect their music with an epoch, land and a place.\nThe first scene when slaves were building the pyramids was one of the best starts in movies history.\nSimply it's one of the best movies in history. It's a combination of greatness and beauty.","user":"ali_harkouss","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"Spectacular re-telling of the Exodus","rating":9,"date":"4 May 1999","review":"For sheer spectacle, it's tough to beat the Bible.  With \"The Prince of Egypt,\" DreamWorks makes good on its promise to deliver a state-of-the-art animated film that will compete favorably with the best Disney has to offer. As with \"Antz,\" released earlier this year, DreamWorks has successfully resisted the temptation to populate this film with characters that can be turned into further revenue through toy sales.  (I do wonder, though, if three soundtrack albums--the film's soundtrack, an \"inspirational\" album, and a \"country\" album--were really necessary.)  The animation team has accomplished something truly spectacular; watching \"The Prince of Egypt\" is like seeing life breathed into a rich, luxurious tapestry.  The Biblical story told in the books of Genesis and Exodus is followed very faithfully, with only minor changes made for dramatic reasons.  The action sequences are truly exciting, overall pacing is excellent, and the miracles wrought by God are depicted with awed and respectful wonder.  One truly astonishing, harrowing sequence recounts the slaughter of firstborn Hebrew children by bringing hieroglyphic drawings to life on the walls of an Egyptian temple. The voice work is especially good--Val Kilmer is fine as Moses, and Pharoah, voiced by Ralph Fiennes, positively seethes with arrogance and hubris. The storytellers wisely chose to end their tale at the climactic crossing of the Red Sea; even the delivery of the Ten Commandments is portrayed only in an epilogue vignette.  (After all, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for forty years after that, and Moses ultimately is not allowed to enter the Promised Land--perhaps not the uplifting ending the filmmakers had in mind.) Some of the subject matter is dark and disturbing, and there is no shying away from the harsh realities of the original texts.  By all means, see it with the children in your life--and be prepared to discuss it with them afterward.","user":"WeslyM","rank":[114,135]},{"title":"This movie is so moving","rating":10,"date":"25 July 2005","review":"I was in tears and all emotional when I watched this movie. It's not a movie only for Christian people to watch, I think this movie's for anyone and I definitely recommend it. I used a whole box of my Kleenex and my eyes were so red by the end of the movie I freaked out myself. Honestly, people should make more movies like this, because nowadays, it's all movies like where you forget what the movie is really about. And then couple of months later, you don't even remember if you watched the movie or not. I don't think that really makes sense there. But anyway this movie is really good! I've got the soundtrack and it's really really good, watch the movie !!!","user":"blue_sea_water","rank":[38,43]}]
