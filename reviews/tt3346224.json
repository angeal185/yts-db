[{"title":"Zipper maybe goes deeper...","rating":10,"date":"10 December 2015","review":"I had this movie sitting in my drive for awhile. I knew about the premise (i.e. some hot shot lawyer who cheats repeatedly on his wife) and I wasn't interest.<br><br>Well...after seeing it, this is overall a good movie because of the strong performances and some semi-provocative little twists near the end that, although predictable, they show some hard truths about the values of the world we are living and how easy is to disavow our values for things that are in the end meaningless.<br><br>Despite the numerous sexual encounters of the main character the film is not erotic or sensual but focuses into his fear and his inner struggle with his newly developed passion that might cost him everything, his job, his family.<br><br>But the world we are living ...it is what it is, and in the end, everyone will play the role that he or she supposed to play...<br><br>Overall: Check it out.","user":"Dr_Sagan","rank":[33,40]},{"title":"Such a brave actor","rating":9,"date":"23 July 2016","review":"Just watched \"ZIPPER\" 9/10 - a very dark and gripping film about destruction by obsession. <br><br>The central character is portrayed by Patrick Wilson and this is another very brave choice of role after \"Hard Candy\" where he played a man internet grooming an underage female. <br><br>How many leading actors would dare to play these roles? <br><br>He's not just an amazing actor he's obviously fearless with his career and image.<br><br>The rest of the cast are superb too. Ray Winstone in a new kind of role for him..he's such a good actor and thank goodness he was allowed to keep his London accent after falling flat on his face in \"The Departed\" trying to be a Boston accented tough guy.","user":"John von K","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"An engaging thriller","rating":2,"date":"2 February 2016","review":"This film tells the story of a married lawyer with a promising political career, who gets side tracked by experiences with ladies from an escort agency.<br><br>\"Zipper\" keeps me engaged because the I like the story. The first half is more erotic while the second half is more of a thriller. How Patrick Wilson does a good job portraying his character, who lets his urges overtake his sensibility. His guilt in the diner with the reporter is piercingly good. I think the story is well presented, easy to follow and engaging. The scenes are nicely shot as well. I enjoyed watching \"Zipper\"!","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[12,15]}]
