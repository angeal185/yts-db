[{"title":"Beautiful","rating":10,"date":"20 October 2001","review":"A Matter of Life and Death, what can you really say that would properly do justice to the genius and beauty of this film. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination knows no bounds, every frame is filled with fantastically bold compositions. The switches between the bold colours of \"the real world\" to the stark black and white of heaven is ingenious, showing us visually just how much more vibrant life is. The final court scene is also fantastic, as the judge and jury descend the stairway to heaven to hold court over Peter (David Niven)'s operation. <br><br>All of the performances are spot on (Roger Livesey being a standout), and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never has there been a more romantic film than this (if there has I haven't seen it). A Matter of Life and Death is all about the power of love and just how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the film alone, the way he lights Kim Hunter's face makes her all the more beautiful, what a genius, he can make a simple things such as a game of table tennis look exciting. And the sound design is also impeccable; the way the sound mutes at vital points was a decision way ahead of its time<br><br>This is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in cinema, under appreciated on its initial release and by today's audiences, but one of my all time favourites, which is why I give this film a 10/10, in a word - Beautiful.","user":"jonathandoe_se7en","rank":[102,110]},{"title":"Timeless Classic","rating":10,"date":"21 December 2004","review":"Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as engrossing as this one. Technological advances have not dated this classic love story. Special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. The acting is superb. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do an outstanding job. The use of Black and White / Color adds to the creative nature of the movie. It hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. It is my favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for the DVD release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, \"A Matter of Life and Death\".","user":"voiceof67","rank":[112,125]},{"title":"A young WWII airman misses his heavenly call, and challenges the laws of the universe to remain on earth.","rating":10,"date":"20 August 1998","review":"I LOVE this movie.  Director Michael Powell once stated that this was his favorite movie, and it is mine as well.  Powell and Pressburger created a seemingly simple, superbly crafted story - the power of love against \"the powers that be\".  However, its deception lies in the complexity of  its \"is it real or is it imaginary\" premise.  Basically, one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young, poetically inclined airman during WWII.  Or is it?  The question is never answered one way or the other.  Actually, it is never even asked.  This continuous understatement is part of the film's appeal.<br><br>The innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers.  For instance, Pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of Richard Strauss' opera, Der Rosenkavalier, about a young 18th century Viennese aristocrat. This is evident in the brief interlude in which Conductor 71, dressed in all his finery, holds the rose (which appears silver in heaven).  The music even has a dreamy quality.<br><br>All of the acting is first rate - David Niven is at his most charming, and he has excellent support from veteran Roger Livesey and relative newcomer Kim Hunter.  But, in my opinion, the film's charm comes from Marius Goring as Conductor 71.  He by far has the most interesting role, filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness, brightening the film. It's a pity that some of Conductor 71's scenes were left on the cutting room floor.  It is also a pity that Goring's comedic talents are rarely seen again on film, except in the wonderful videos of  The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the 1950s.  This is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career.  He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of Niven, and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters.  Ironically, also in the mid -1940s,  Niven also starred against another heavenly \"messenger\", played by Cary Grant, in The Bishop's Wife.  Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring, unenergetic, and disappointing.  As a note, according to Powell, Goring desperately wanted the role of Peter Carter, initially refusing Conductor 71.  It's a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayal.<br><br>The movie, \"commissioned\" to smooth over the strained relations between Britain and the U.S., overdrives its point towards the end.  But it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war - the numerous casualties, both military and civilian, the need to \"go on\" when faced with death.  There is a conspicuous lack of WWII \"enemies\" in heaven, but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin.  Powell and Pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasn't necessary.  The movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for, but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the Atlantic.","user":"Loretta","rank":[64,70]}]
