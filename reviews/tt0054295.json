[{"title":"\"Mission: Impossible\" with a black hat","rating":7,"date":"6 July 2004","review":"Remember \"Mission: Impossible\"?  The TV series, not the movie.  It was always fun to watch the team pull off one of their stunts, because they balanced their Rube Goldberg concepts with NASA-quality planning.  This movie is cut from the same cloth.  It's about a casino robbery engineered during one of the gambling hall's biggest celebrations.  The eponymous crooks must work in synchronized unison to fulfill their plan.  Unlike the MI series, though, they aren't all quite equally devoted to their mission or, at least not to their particular roles within it.  Still, they have a clever series of steps that get more interesting to watch, even as it seems increasingly likely that the plan will succeed.<br><br>Along the way, there are some interesting mixtures of personality types, some mysterious backgrounds waiting to be uncovered, and a degree of slipperiness that make it hard to be sure just who we should be rooting for. Indeed, part of the charm of this film is that there are _no_ \"good guys,\" yet we want the thieves to get away with their crime.<br><br>A nifty, thoughtful piece, with little action and no sfx (in the current sense, anyway).  An added plus for some of us is a pair of fairly sexy dance numbers a 27-year-old Joan Collins does \"nearly naked,\" as her character puts it.  She was at her physical prime in this film, but don't underestimate her acting ability.  She carries the sole female role with every bit as much mastery as Wallach, Steiger, and the oddly endearing Edward G. Robinson carry theirs.  John Beradino (the original \"Dr. Hardy\" of TV's \"General Hospital\") has a small role, and Marcel Hillaire appears as more or less the same character he would play dozens of times in TV guest spots for the next few years.<br><br>7/10, recommended if you've had your fill of explosions, CGI, or Tom Cruise.","user":"pro_crustes","rank":[29,29]},{"title":"Unusual noir on the Riviera","rating":7,"date":"18 March 2005","review":"Usually films located on a place as lovely as the French Riviera, especially Monte Carlo get the full technicolor treatment like To Catch a Thief. But in Seven Thieves director Henry Hathaway opted for black and white because this is a noir and the key here is the plot of the caper and the relationships of the characters.<br><br>Expatriate American academician Edward G. Robinson calls on a young protégé Rod Steiger to come over from America to help him heist a casino in Monte Carlo. He's recruited a gang and needs someone he can trust to keep them in line.<br><br>Robinson's role is similar to that of Sam Jaffe in The Asphalt Jungle and Steiger it seems is his Sterling Hayden.<br><br>That's how it seems at the start, but there's a whole lot more going on here as the characters reveal themselves bit by bit during the planning and execution of the caper.<br><br>Coincidentally in the same year another caper film, Ocean's 11 about robbing casinos also came out. But this is definitely not as lighthearted as that Ratpack romp.<br><br>What to watch for is the relationships between Robinson and Steiger and between Steiger, Joan Collins and Eli Wallach.<br><br>Nicely done little noir classic.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[23,24]},{"title":"Good acting highlights crime caper drama","rating":7,"date":"3 December 2006","review":"Edward G. Robinson has planned the perfect crime in \"Seven Thieves,\" a 1960 black and white film also starring Rod Steiger, Joan Collins, Eli Wallach, Alexander Scourby, Michael Dante, Marcel Hillaire, and Sebastian Cabot. The film is set in Monte Carlo where Theo Wilkins (Robinson) has arranged to meet Paul Mason (Rod Steiger) to ask him to join in the plot. Wilkins is a former scientist who lost his credibility after commission of some sort of crime, but we don't know what it is; Mason has just finished three years in jail. The crime concerns the theft of 4 million francs from a casino and will involve a total of 7 people - a dancer (Collins), her friend (Wallach), her married boyfriend (Scourby), and a safe cracker (Dante).<br><br>Directed by Henry Hathaway, this is an interesting drama that moves somewhat slowly and might have been better. It has a couple of twists at the end that are interesting, and there is quite a bit of tension and suspense for the audience throughout.<br><br>The performances are excellent. Robinson gives a sympathetic portrayal of an old man looking for his last shot; Steiger gives a subdued (!) performance, his character being quietly threatening instead of screaming his guts out - good choice. Someone commented on this site that Joan Collins looks the same today as she did in this film 45 years ago - actually, it's kind of true. The only difference is that she wore less makeup then. Her figure is amazing, and she gives a wonderful performance as an unhappy, hard woman who has much compassion underneath. Eli Wallach does a great job as a nervous wreck.<br><br>\"Seven Thieves\" holds your attention. Strangely this is around the time of \"Ocean's 11\" where the touch is much lighter. This is a very dramatic story. It's not the greatest but worth checking out.","user":"blanche-2","rank":[22,23]}]
