If you like scary movies....strange, scary movies.....strange, scary movies with a plot.....strange, scary movies with a plot and fairly good ending.....then get the popcorn and have a good time with this one.<br><br>Look.....if I took every movie I have ever seen so seriously I had to dump on it more than enjoy it. Well.....there would be a lot of movies I would never watch. My Soul To Take is a good movie. It keeps you wondering, guessing and a little annoyed you didn't see it coming.<br><br>Admittedly, I do scroll through the reviews to get an idea of how people viewed the movie and how they rated it.<br><br>I have my own 5 Star system which got this film a 4.5.<br><br>If you are new to IMDb.....never, ever take the scoring system to heart. Even a really BAD film based on reviews will perk my interest to watch it and see for myself. For those of you who use IMDb regularly.....this movie didn't earn the 4.7 it got. <br><br>I would have said 8 out of 10 personally......but then that is me.<br><br>Please don't throw this one away based on critics who \"know the price of everything and the value of nothing\"....Zonker from his guru days.<br><br>......enjoy......Cookie Q(:-}","user":"twomainiacs","rank":[37,46]},{"title":"Interesting concept but poor executions","rating":6,"date":"17 October 2010","review":"I'm sad to be giving Wes' new film a meagre 6/10. I mean, 6 out of 10 isn't even that bad for a horror film but for a Wes Craven horror film it is a terrible grade. I like Wes' films because of the fact that he can make a simple story (psychopath killing people, voodoos and zombies, terrorists on planes) into something complex and interesting. With Nightmare on Elm Street he managed to prey on the fears of adults and children as well as offering ideas into dreams and reality. In Scream he gave his victims and killers modern sensibilities and repeatedly asked \"are movies responsible for our actions?\" He shot some beautiful scenes in Haiti for Serpent and the Rainbow and looked at the effects of religion governing politics.<br><br>So here he is with a movie about souls and fate. The plot sees a psychopath (Abel) with split personalities loose his grip on normality and go on a killing spree, ending with him dying (or did he?). On the night that he died, 7 children were born including his own son, Adam (do you notice the religious connotations there?) who had to be cut out of his dead mother's womb. Adam (Bug) and the 6 others enjoy a ritual every year to ward of the evil spirit that they think may still want to murder them for they might just be the souls of the victims of Abel's bad seed. Now at 16, Bug is suffering black outs, nausea and migraines and people are beginning to worry that he might have inherited his father's illness. It sure doesn't help that his older sister, Leah, spreads lies about him to the school out of spite for she feels her life was ruined the night that Bug was born. On the anniversary of the Ripper's death, one of the 7 is murdered and the 6 begin to worry that their souls may be tainted.<br><br>At 96 minutes, it is a longer than usual \"horror\" movie. Craven fills the daylight with musings of souls and inheritance and the night with murder and bloodshed. Craven side-steps the horror clich√©s to an extent, allowing his characters to fall prey to inevitability rather than silly choices. It's an interesting idea - imagine you had the soul of a murderer locked inside you and you weren't at all aware. As for the victims, knowing that you were meant to die in a repeat incident wouldn't be a comforting thought now, would it? Bug is different though. He seems to be a fractured soul, the good soul of his father who is gathering the pieces of souls from the victims, keeping them from truly dying. As I've said, interesting.<br><br>However, in amongst all the philosophy and social pariah fun, there are a heap of bad points. Firstly, there doesn't seem to be that much at stake. Bug's transformation from meek and innocent to strong and in charge isn't powerful enough to really get you behind him like you would Nancy or Sidney. The deaths of the students, although it's meant to be unfair that they were singled out from birth to die aren't shocking and you never really feel that they're fighting to live. Secondly, the set pieces aren't at all remarkable and apart from the discovery of one body beside a temple which results in the only real cat and mouse scene, there's nothing to really remember or go \"wow\" at. Horror needs location, it's integral to the feel. Fred Krueger's boiler room in dreamland; the town in Haiti; Stu's farmhouse with Hallowe'en playing on the telly; all were integral to the films. Finally, the movie is a bit confusing. The ideas are never fully explored, leaving audiences entirely at a loss to understand if it's a by the numbers slasher or something deeper. Bug's unique skill is barely hinted at(even if there are a lot of scenes involving him mimicking his friends) and it makes it hard to understand just what he's on about during his confrontation with the ripper. Oh, and the Asian dude gets it first.<br><br>But thankfully, Craven injects his film with his own unique ways. On scene involving a bird costume in a classroom is creepier than you'd expect thanks to Craven's expert directing skills. He's assembled a talented cast of young (YOUNG) actors. Brittany, Fang, Alex and Bug are well crafted characters who are played believably. The supporting cast of teens do well with their very limited dialogue and characters. He also delivers us a horrific bad guy who grunts more than Leatherface and murders just as violently. Some crackling dialogue between brother and sister and foster mother gives it the feeling of being more than just a horror movie (which is what you expect from Craven) and a lot of irreverent high school jinx give us some laughs before the carnage ensues.<br><br>Overall, not a bad movie but certainly a mediocre Craven one.","user":"A_Llama_Drama","rank":[43,58]},{"title":"I Can't Believe Wes Craven Made This Garbage","rating":2,"date":"9 October 2010","review":"Despite numerous warnings to avoid this film, I shelled out my money, including the ridiculous $3 extra for 3D glasses, figuring, it's Wes Craven, how bad can it be? Well, the answer is, extremely, horribly, atrociously bad. MSTT made Shocker look like Citizen Kane. I've seen better efforts at the After Dark Horrorfests and coming from The Asylum on SyFy.<br><br>MSTT had a script and dialog of the level of some fresh-out-of-some-two-bit-drama-school reject, not of a nearly 40-year veteran of filmmaking. Half the dialog made no sense whatsoever, and the emotions of the actors was usually misplaced.<br><br>While the story had promise, the execution failed completely. At first, the action seemed forced to get to the central elements Craven was looking for, then the resolution bogged down in complete incoherence.<br><br>Craven can't blame some one else's script or studio insistence on cuts, 'cause this atrocity was all his. If this is the best he can do, he should retire. He's proved he has nothing left to add to horror.<br><br>And if my negative comments still don't dissuade you from seeing this atrocity, make sure you at least seek out 2D instead of the extra money for 3D, because...<br><br>THERE WAS NO Discernible 3D IN THE FILM WHATSOEVER!!!! Scenes which should have popped out of the screen, such as the ambulance crash, DIDN'T! It's quite obvious the studio realized what a piece of crap MSTT was and how it would plummet in ticket sales once work of mouth got out, so they did post-filming 3D conversion to bilk the poor suckers who went to see it opening weekend out of a few dollars more.<br><br>The only reason I didn't rate this a 1 is because, sadly, I have seen worse. But this one should be avoided at all costs.<br><br>2/10","user":"indyj1","rank":[74,122]}]
