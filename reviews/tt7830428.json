Plot is stupid.","user":"ltrans-77218","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"Boring, terrible acting","rating":1,"date":"14 September 2019","review":"This movie made me waste an hour and thirty-minutes of my life. It could get quite boring at times. The acting is mediocre. You know it's sad when the youngest actor is the best one. Plot could get quite confusing sometimes and characters are forgettable. There are better Halloween movies out there. Don't waste your time on this one.","user":"agentkitty-09959","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Worst movie of 2018","rating":1,"date":"28 October 2019","review":"Awful acting; no relationship between the actors and therefore every line spoken falls flat. Terrible plot line which is completely pointless and the whole movie is boring. Do not waste your time with this because you will seriously regret it. It's basically just Kendall Vertes' desperate attempt to even come close to Maddie Ziegler's accomplishments in acting, which is embarrassing to watch. There are YouTube videos that have been made with better quality and production than this Trico Tri Happy Halloween.","user":"chrissygtv","rank":[2,2]}]
