[{"title":"A sci-fi Wizard of Oz from a kids perspective","rating":7,"date":"13 August 2002","review":"This is not a movie to be viewed from a serious perspective.  But even sci-fi aficionados seem to have been losing their sense of fun over the years, which may be why this remake has been panned so badly.  The whole movie is viewed from a young boy's dark imagination, right down to the ridiculous Mr. Potato head aliens.  Even the camera angles are taken from child's height.  And within the bizarre dream world of adolescent fears and disempowerment springs forth a really fun movie.  Within this context, the remake of Invaders from mars remains true to the 1950's genre with some tongue in cheek.  Relax, grab some popcorn, and warp back to the 50's, when your imagination didn't have to be fed with a spoon.","user":"dublin9","rank":[37,41]},{"title":"Good Remake of a Classic Sci-Fi Film","rating":7,"date":"28 November 2017","review":"The boy David Gardner (Hunter Carson) is the son of George Gardner (Timothy Bottoms) and Ellen Gardner (Laraine Newman).

What can they do to avoid the invasion?<br><br>\"Invaders from Mars\" is a good remake of the classic 1953 sci-fi film. The original movie was made a couple of years after the end of WWII when the army was the symbol of defense of the country. Tobe Hooper introduced more humor in the story and the result is very entertaining. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Invasores de Marte\" (\"Invaders from Mars\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Revenge of the 80's: The remake.","rating":9,"date":"15 October 2004","review":"Invaders from Mars (1986) was a remake of the 1950's science fiction classic. Tobe Hooper slightly reinvents the original and updates the storyline. The story revolves around a strange alien craft that lands in a field. A young boy spots the craft but no ones listens to him or takes him seriously. Soon everyone around him begins to act very cold and strange. What can be the cause of this? Maybe the strange spaceship that landed in the abandoned field is causing this? Well it was the 80's.<br><br>Tobe Hooper made a very surreal and cool film. The special effects are excellent and the direction is on par. The acting is somewhat uneven. But the dialog and photography makes up for it. I enjoyed this movie when I was in junior high school and I still enjoy it to this very day. Another great film from Tobe Hooper.<br><br>Just don't take it too seriously. The movie is part homage and part remake of the original film and others like it that were made during the fifties.<br><br>Highly recommended.<br><br>Karen Black co-stars as the school nurse who believes the kid.","user":"Captain_Couth","rank":[29,37]}]
