[{"title":"a few chuckles at how bad this is.........","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2019","review":"I only watched this because I knew it would be awful (it was) but was hoping to get a good laugh out of it, but unfortunately other then a few laughs at the preposterous dialogue and situations, this is not all that interesting. The acting is awful, the CGI is below mediocre and the end of the world never seemed so dull. Because they obviously couldn't afford to pay lots of actors, this is one of those movies where when an office building is about to collapse, 3 people run out. Los Angeles appears to have a population of 16 . There are long stretches of nonsense dialogue. Would anyone discuss burritos while running from mass destruction ? Or in this case not running but casually strolling away from mass destruction ? Why would anyone make this movie ?","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[23,23]},{"title":"Couldn't wait till the end of the movie.","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2019","review":"One thing that this movie has going for it is that it doesn't fail to surprise. With every single passing minute I just keep thinking \"it can't get worse than this, now can it?\" Oh, yes it can and it does so progressively.<br><br>If you start counting \"cinema sins\" you'd probably come the conclusion that this movie is a demon from hell.<br><br>Don't watch it. Just don't. There's nothing to gain and there are better bad movies to waste your time on.","user":"stansevostyanov","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Dont watch IT/ AVOID at all cost","rating":1,"date":"25 January 2019","review":"Terrible, WASTE of Time, toxic, bad acting, mediocre visual effects","user":"bendeagle-40956","rank":[21,23]}]
