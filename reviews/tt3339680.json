[{"title":"I enjoyed it","rating":8,"date":"3 October 2019","review":"DISTURBED_GUY, did you fall asleep with your girlfriend and just make up bits (at no point did the boat mount the shore and kill the daughter),\nIf you watched the film properly you would have noticed the child fell down the stairs banged her head and died) the rest you cannot put together as you did not understand it or as I suspect you did fall asleep with the girlfriend lol","user":"davismargo","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Glad I Checked It Out","rating":7,"date":"28 February 2019","review":"A father struggling with the death of his young daughter begins to believe he can change the past by a memory that becomes a reoccurring dream. Is it possible or is he simply losing his mind.<br><br>This film was decent. The actors played their characters with a lot of sincerity and the story was relatable. It felt a little slow at times and it would have been better with more depth invested into the individual characters and the way they interacted with one another. It's nothing that will blow you away but it was an entertaining watch.","user":"Foutainoflife","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Surprisingly well done............","rating":7,"date":"27 October 2018","review":"This movie is not necessarily anything very original in story, a couple haunted by a tragedy in their life, but what puts it above average is that on every level it is masterfully done. Melissa George stars with Stephen Dorff (kind of the very poor man's Ethan Hawke) and they are both exceptional in their roles as is every supporting actor. Ireland and the cinematography are gorgeous, the movie moves along and sweeps you up in it's story and although the outcome is not hard to guess at, it is still haunting. Well worth watching for being interesting , Stephen's outstanding performance as a tortured soul and for being so beautifully directed and expertly shot.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[20,27]}]
