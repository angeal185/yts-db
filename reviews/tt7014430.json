[{"title":"Disastrous from every point of view","rating":1,"date":"8 October 2018","review":"I can not believe they have 4 awards.<br><br>Bullets that do not make noise. Lack of ambient sound. Extras that move the mouth and there is not even a murmur. Jumps continuity in photography and in the bad script.<br><br>In the final escene, after a shooting where almost everyone dies, there is a most ridiculous dialogue. A wounded hunger invites a drink to a police officer who has just met.","user":"walter_f_d","rank":[35,48]},{"title":"Waste of time","rating":1,"date":"7 October 2018","review":"Really bad script and poor acting. I watched the first 10 mins and couldn't continue watching it. It's just a waste of time","user":"s-hafez55","rank":[30,43]},{"title":"A disjointed mess","rating":1,"date":"4 October 2018","review":"There is very little that makes sense and the acting is terrible apart from two actors who are acceptable but not great.There are some unusual edits here as well.","user":"glishteach","rank":[35,53]}]
