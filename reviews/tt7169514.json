Wonderfull drawing based on the style of the period and full of art deco. Interesting mix of pictures for the scenarios and drawings for the characters. Good music too. Very enjoyable and not just for kids!","user":"beamj-99044","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"Incredibly Charming","rating":6,"date":"10 April 2019","review":"First, I gave it a 6 because on my scale a 5 is a good watchable movie and a 10 is an all time masterpiece. Both the tiny character, Dilili and the film itself are incredibly charming. The little girl for her sense of wonder, amazement, inclusion, and resolve, and the film for it's airy and colorful atmosphere and the way it introduces kids to important historical artists and scientists. My first thought upon finishing it was that I need to show it to both my niece and nephew, but it's an entertaining distraction even for adults.","user":"fahdshakir","rank":[5,8]}]
