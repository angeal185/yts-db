[{"title":"Wonderful","rating":9,"date":"3 August 2019","review":"This movie is a Romantic Comedy with Kung Fu!\nI looooooved it. Some of the humor is Hong-Kong style slapstick, but I felt that it all worked quite well. I recommend this movie. It's both cute and cool.","user":"jliao27","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Good humor, Average kungfu fighting scenes, Bad CG","rating":7,"date":"28 December 2018","review":"I haven't seen for a while a good chinese comedy movie &amp; this movie is the answer for it.\nBut the CG is so bad, especially in last fight, compared with Stepen Chow's movies like Shaolin Soccer or Kungfu Hustle.","user":"andytanu7504","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"A good comedy and martial arts combo...","rating":6,"date":"5 November 2019","review":"\"Kung Fu League\" (aka \"Gong fu lian meng\") was a movie that I didn't even know about before now late in 2019. I was given the chance, and of course I did take it as I enjoy Asian cinema.<br><br>I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I was convinced that it would be a martial arts movie. I hadn't expected it to also be a funny movie, so it was a nice experience to sit down and watch the movie.<br><br>Sure, the storyline wasn't all that impressive, but still it was entertaining enough, and the fact that the comedy, the acting performances and the martial arts helped lift up the movie definitely made it all the more enjoyable to watch.<br><br>The movie is over-the-top, so you shouldn't sit down and watch this movie with an intention of watching a realistic martial arts movie - but then again, how many realistic martial arts movies make it out of the Chinese cinema?<br><br>What worked well in the movie, for me at least, was the acting performances by the good ensemble of casted actors and actresses that they had managed to get together for the movie. That and also the comedy elements that the movie had to it.<br><br>My rating of \"Kung Fu League\" is six out of ten stars.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[2,2]}]
