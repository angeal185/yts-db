[{"title":"Mediocre Schlock Horror Film","rating":3,"date":"14 December 2018","review":"\"Why Hide?\" or \"Christmas Presence\" is nothing more than your garden variety schlock horror film. The only original thing they did was make the characters all LGBT, but did absolutely nothing with it. The first act had a decent build, where it established the characters in a base line sense. The jokes are cringey and I think they may have implied the main character was a TERF, but nothing ever comes of it. Everything that followed got progressively worse. The antagonistic force in this is each characters worst fear. The group figures this out after a few incidents, but whenever they are targeted, they become oblivious again. The ending is a bad, confused twist, possibly to set up a sequel. Don't waste your time.","user":"DoubleDarkness","rank":[13,18]},{"title":"The horror shows up in the middle.","rating":6,"date":"20 December 2018","review":"I watched this on Shudder the other day. At first I was like, \"Where's the horror???.\" Then about half way through it shows up. I have to say the set up took a while but the acting was enjoyable so I kept watching all the while thinking, \"Okay, this is on Shudder. Just saw the original Maniac and Mandy which both bring it, so I know something twisted is about to happen. Lingerie party??? WTF??? Anyway, I have to say I am very hard to scare and nothing really scared me at all in film but the acting and pacing kept me watching. The production value is nice too!","user":"jesseknightfilms","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"mostly absent","rating":3,"date":"14 December 2018","review":"This is a mighty thin sliver of a holiday horror movie. It's set at Christmas, but its Christmasy part amounts to a group of friends getting drunk and modeling newly gifted underwear. And this is the movie's best sequence!<br><br>The rest is a sketchy, by-the-numbers mishmash of paganism, mean ghosts, and supernatural mind games, the confluence of which seems to have bored the writer, the director, and the cast. It didn't do much for me either.<br><br>I did like the chubby, cheese-making, shotgun-toting lesbian character. This role was well-written and the actress who played it seemed present when she came on screen. Everyone else seemed absent, as if their minds were elsewhere. Given this movie's uninspired plot, I can't much blame them.<br><br>All in all, despite having come all the way from the UK, this movie leaves little in its wake. It's as if it never fully arrived in the first place","user":"pseawrig","rank":[9,12]}]
