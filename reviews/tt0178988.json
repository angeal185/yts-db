[{"title":"Most people just don't get it...","rating":9,"date":"9 April 2006","review":"As I read reviews of this movie I just can't keep feeling like most of you just don't get it. I'm reading comments here on IMDb like \"white boys trying to act like they are black (c'mon that is terrible)\" or \"can someone say Wigger...\". You are missing the point. This movie is simply one big satire of young white teenagers who grow up in decent or rich environment (or Iowa) idolizing the ghetto life that they see on MTV and trying to mimic it. As a product of a large city public school system in the mid nineties I saw these kinds of kids every day. It's pretty depressing actually. Low self-esteem kids with terrible identity disorders trying so desperately to find themselves. Or not? Maybe most of them just don't know how to act. Whatever it is I'd have to say that this movie was on point with every aspect of this kind of lifestyle. For someone like me, who went to school with kids like this, Whiteboyz is a hilarious movie! Flip dog is just so incredibly lost in his gangster world, working out scenarios with Khalid before his talks to him, rapping in front of the mirror, etc. Khalid even tries to explain this to Flip and Flip is so lost he just doesn't understand what he is telling him. Khalid was probably the most normal kid in the movie. He respected his Mom, he has aspirations to go to college, and wasn't all about getting in trouble. What was the most revealing about what this movie was trying to do was the scene where James comes out of his \"gangster\" act and starts ranting racial slurs. Did James have multiple personalities? No. How could you miss the point after seeing that? There are plenty of people I'd like to show this movie to but sadly they won't get it. It's definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It was acted out perfectly and just down right hilarious. Unfortunately, most of the people just don't get it. Recommended as a wake up call to all you gangster white boys out there that grew up in a stable home.

It hits the nail on the head portraying suburban white kids trying to be thugs by imitating rappers from MTV. You tend to find more of these kids in backwoods towns and deep in the suburbs than in the inner city and this movie seems more like a non-fiction representation of that ridiculous subculture. They even address the fact that these kids weren't dressing the same years ago or listening to the same music. Basically, acting like these kids is similar to deciding to dress like a cowboy because you start to like country music.<br><br>Anyone who doesn't like or appreciate this movie - the joke's on you, thug life with a North Carolina jersey.","user":"mattb40000","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Great Idea, Poorly Executed","rating":5,"date":"27 May 2005","review":"Someone needed to make a movie like this, a commentary on how white suburban teenagers have latched onto hip-hop and \"ghetto\" culture, and made it part of their identity, when in reality they don't have a solitary clue of what it means to be Black in America. Someone needed to make a movie that made the point that white America's affinity for Black culture rarely translates into actual understanding of Black people as actual human beings, or into an understanding of their situation. Someone needed to make a movie that showed hip-hop-as-consumed-by-white-kids as what it is: a new version of a very old theme in American popular culture -- the Black man as dirty savage, cunning and dangerous, yet stupid and witless at the same time.<br><br>But \"Whiteboys\" is not this movie. The movie can't seem to decide if it's a comedy or a cutting social commentary, or both. So it fails as both. The central problem is that the main characters are stereotypes themselves, the East Coast-imagined version of what someone in Iowa is supposed to be like. It's impossible to believe that Flip and his gang are for real. Flip especially comes off as a delusional mental patient, not as a misguided, out-of-touch kid. The images of farm life were as cartoonish as the images of hip hop life the movie was mocking. Perhaps this was part of the point, but all of the overlapping of targets of parody just made the whole matter confusing.<br><br>The movie would have been much better off if had ditched the whole Iowa-farmer theme, stopped reveling in stupid images of kids rapping in farm fields, and instead focused on a group of kids in Any-Suburb USA, the kind of kids that we all have met -- privileged white kids who are drawn to the false glamor of ghetto life presented on TV, utterly oblivious to their own privileged station in life.","user":"davesteele-1","rank":[7,9]}]
