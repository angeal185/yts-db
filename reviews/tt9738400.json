[{"title":"One of the worst movies in recent memory","rating":20,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"Plot points that go nowhere. Terrible editing and pacing. Horrible acting and writing. It's like they ran out of money to finish the movie. Bad all they way around. Zero stars.","user":"jerrykernsh","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Not so good","rating":2,"date":"11 February 2020","review":"Promising start with snarky fitness gals chipping away at each other and setting up targets for future horror that you might want to see \"get theirs.\" But once we get to the horror part it's more horrible than horror. Mindless sadistic acts by slow moving dumb antagonist that's completely unrealistic and not horrorific only dumb, brutal and numbingly bad. Couldn't sit through it. Not worth it.","user":"michaelseither","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"its so bad that its bad...","rating":2,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"\"im disappointed. still havent met anyone up to my standards... my level. come on. better than me... faster than me... stronger than me.\"\nsays the antagonist to her victim.\nwhat is this? Highlander?\nyou're expecting some crazy muscular guy with long hair, giant warhammer, studded leather bracers and choker. barbarian class character.\nbut nope. just an crazy middle aged lady with a mallet. whats her motivation to be the master of the universe? maybe they did explain it but i didnt bother to pay attention because the film is so bad.\nat the point that the antagonist reveal her intentions, no one thinks its a good idea to punch her in the face and run away. victims are so dumb, its frustrating to watch.\n2 stars for effort.","user":"lukesix","rank":[1,1]}]
