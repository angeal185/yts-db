[{"title":"small indie","rating":5,"date":"27 February 2020","review":"Abigail (Christina Ricci) is meeting her friend Kate at a bar. It's actually a setup for a blind date with Benjamin Conway (Hamish Linklater). He suggests making a list of ten things to do before they break up. It leads to an one-night stand and a pregnancy for the mother of two.<br><br>This is an indie. It's a relatively short indie. I don't sense the chemistry between Ricci and Linklater. They have some cute scenes but non of them achieve relationship takeoff. These are two good actors who are keeping their energy at a medium and that makes their relationship a bit at a medium. When a downturn happens, it doesn't have quite the shock value. The one truly off-putting scene is the best friend. I don't get her attitude. The scene crashes headlong into politics and I don't get it. I don't know anyone like this person. The movie is not fun enough. When it's edgy, it gets awkward. I love these two actors and it's not their problem. The title is fun but the ten things don't matter. This indie has a few interesting ideas and two good leads. It also has a few bad ideas and the leads aren't maximized. Even the closing text frustrated me. Maybe it would be better to have an actual scene to depict their relationship.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Awful...","rating":1,"date":"13 March 2020","review":"Am I the only one who was immediately put off that this divorcee with two kids and a previous abortion gets herself pregnant right off the bat with a total stranger with no real responsibilities (whom we find out a bit later was cheating on a girl friend)? Or that we have no idea throughout the whole movie exactly what either one of them does for a living (though she appears to be write books for kids, how original)? Or that they seem to have all the time in the world to fool with her kids? They don't show the kids' reaction to the pregnancy, but the kids do like him. He lets them all down, checks back in with the girlfriend, does not show up at the little girl's dance thing,. lies about where he's been. etc. Blah, blah, blah. He crashes, leaves, disappears. She has the kid on her own and she and the three kids \"continue to thrive.\" End of movie, credits run.","user":"murphyclm","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Explore intersting aspects","rating":7,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"10 things we should do before we break up is really interesting movie. i loved how this movie explore different and interesting aspects like life of single mother, divorce, friendship, relation with ex, love and of course unexpected pregnancy. movie not just make you see whats happening, it will force you to look inside the life of not only single mother but also a broken person.
