[{"title":"No prisoners, but a lot of casualties","rating":3,"date":"9 May 2013","review":"Of course this is not a real war, but since the word is being used in the title, you might as well use it for some puns. The movie itself does have some fair points and there is something to say about the general theme it tries to portray. There is a lot that one could've done with that theme. I'm not even going to blame the actors (I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and pretend it was the way they were directed), but the screenwriter could've done a better job (unless they didn't want him too, of course).<br><br>There is nudity and profanity, but you can check those boxes when you see the rating, so don't feel offended if you watch it and you think it's too racy (when it actually isn't that much, especially if you look at french cinema). Don't waste your time would be my advice, but with comedy it's tough to say, what makes people laugh ...","user":"kosmasp","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Dreadful","rating":1,"date":"13 January 2012","review":"Want to see a movie that gets less sexy the more naked women it has in it? That becomes more turgid the more the characters try to crack lame jokes? Then this is the movie for you.<br><br>Paul Sapiano apparently learned about filmmaking by watching nothing but pornos. The problem is that HSW isn't sexually appealing at all. Not only does it not contain any actual sex, but your average porno is a step up in terms of quality of writing, acting, and technical merit.<br><br>The plot? The bimbos form a club to teach women that they should bilk as much money out of men as possible without giving them any actual sex. The studs form a club to learn how to scam as much sex out of the women without actually giving them any money. That's it. That is the plot. If it sounds amazingly inept, it is. If all the characters sound repellent, even the pretty naked girls, THEY ARE. This is one of the most incompetent movies I've ever seen. Avoid at all costs.","user":"L.

It is outrageously written and directed by out- there Paul Sapiano, and deals with sparing a group of nerdy guys under the tutelage of Johnny Eyelash (Mario Diaz, best known for 'Adam and Steve', 'Killer Drag Queens on Dope', etc) - Dominique Purdy, Richard Blair, Nicholas Cooper - who learn how to be players, against a group of women who have banded together by Big Wendy (Jenae Alt) and Little Wendy (Eli Jane) to learn how to get what they want form men without the clutter of a relationship.<br><br>Basically this film is a parody on the far edges of men and women in the dating spectrum. Sapiano manages to expose and take a long look at dating and drugs, big city life, plastic surgery, fetishes, all with the accompaniment of a lot of exposed huge mammary glands and naughty talk. If that sort of thing entertains then this is one film that is sure to please. it is high class, big budget sleaze (if there is such a thing). Buyer beware! <br><br>Grady Harp","user":"gradyharp","rank":[10,17]}]
