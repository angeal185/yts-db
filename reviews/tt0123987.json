[{"title":"Good girl","rating":9,"date":"30 July 1998","review":"Sitting through \"Madeline\" was like a cool breeze on a hot day. Hatty Jones is talented enough to carry the movie, Frances McDormand makes a hell of a nun, and the supporting cast was fine also.  I would rather sit through this movie again than ever see most of the summertime garbage we are 'treated' to.  The opening and closing credits were beautiful, too.  Being a thirtysomething guy, I was unfamiliar with the \"Madeline\" books,  but I have a feeling the movie captured the spirit of the books. A job well done; I loved every minute of it.","user":"Boyo-2","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Madeline, the movie, is as charming as it's heroine","rating":5,"date":"5 July 2003","review":"Taken from the classic books by Ludwig Bemelmans, Madeline is the darling story of 12 little girls who live in a boarding school.  The woman in charge of the home is a nun, Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand). Red-headed Madeline is the smallest of the girls but is, nevertheless, fearless and curious.  The film follows Madeline's escapades as she has her appendix out, clashes with Pepito (the boy next door), falls in the river and more.  There is a subplot concerning the approaching sale of the school and what it will mean to the girls who live there.  Is it possible to have a happy ending?<br><br>This extremely watchable movie for children is a wonderful addition to the repertoire of good children's films.  Hatty Jones is a delight as Madeline and the other little girls are fun and expressive.  The leap from book to movie is smooth and successful; the film includes many of the books' key elements and will thus be appreciated by Bemelmans' fans. There is more than enough action and humor to keep children interested from start to finish.  Adults will be charmed by the film as well.  Recommended for families who are looking for quality alternatives to Disney, Beethoven the dog, Charlotte's Web, etc.","user":"inkblot11","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"Lively, endearing and sweet; what a Children's film SHOULD BE!","rating":9,"date":"17 April 1999","review":"Whether or not this film was critically acclaimed by the \"so-called\" experts or not, is irrelevant. The REAL experts are the children who watch, are captivated and endeared by Madeline's well casted characters. Every child I know (including my own) that has seen this film loved it and has begged for it on video.<br><br>Parents may not see this as a daring, frolicking action adventure; but rather as a sweet and funny children's film, which is after all, what is was designed to be.<br><br>There are so few films that really MEET a parent's expectations for what they WANT their children to see and can TRUST to not be \"profane\" (many older children's films that were \"G-rated\" are being remade now as \"PG\" under the guises that parents will \"want\" to watch them to; but do the kids really need the addition of bad language and sexual innuendo?).<br><br>Madeline, the movie, is true to the author's original story-line and keeps its poetical, lyrical style and flavor. The children and adults in the cast are true to what the author's characterizations were intended to be.. rather than a so-called \"modern version\" of it.<br><br>It is childhood at its best and its worst, with \"realistic\" villains (instead of the monstrous or far-fetched) and more of the genuine fun and whimsy that childhood is supposed to possess.<br><br>Children everywhere adore this film! As an adult, I appreciate it and APPLAUD it. I wish filmakers would TAKE NOTE and produce MORE films like this... TRULY for Children and SOLIDLY \"G-rated\". After all... children are the best experts on what they like.. and they LOVE THIS... so do I.","user":"Jill-36","rank":[18,22]}]
