[{"title":"Early exploitation to Exorcist with scary images , eerie events and creepy ending","rating":5,"date":"26 January 2011","review":"Suspense, mystery, shocks and grisly horror is this middling terror film . It results to be a creepy movie plenty of horrible and disgusting images . This filthy and spooky movie concerns about Grace Mills ( a Linda Blair character lookalike) , she's a young with unsettling problems , at the beginning she has a car crash in an accident along with her boyfriend and then she results wounded . Meanwhile, a satanic cult in the small village commits a series of ominous crimes that have the Police Inspector baffled , as there appears various head-spinning corpses . The dead hold spitting signs on their tombs as ¨Bitch¨ and ¨Son of bitch¨. Her mental problems and intervention an Anglican priest (Paul Naschy , a Father Karras-alike) lead to an act of possession . The mother ( the late Maria Perschy who worked for Howard Hawks and here plays as an Ellen Burstyn role-alike ) who has two daughters (Maria Kosti and Grace Mills)and another son adopted is worried and asks help for her small daughter, the latter is possessed and Naschy attempt to free her from possession by the devil suffering from the effects of being deeply harassed . She's throughly possessed and the Anglican tries to help the lass. An exorcism by the Father exorcist seems to be the only mean to heal the young . The priest suffering incredible risks trying to unravel mystery of demon living inside the daughter.<br><br>This terrifying exploitation picture displays eerie horror ,witchcraft, grisly killing, satanism and lots of blood . This is a fairly suspenseful and horrifying story, based on a supposedly true flick. This tale about a young girl who is possessed by a malevolent spirit begins well and grows more and more until the creepy and ghastly finale .Revolting, horrible scenes and nasty images take place on orgy scenes worshipping a rare idol . Mediocre performance of Paul Naschy or Jacinto Molina . The late Naschy was a good professional , writing, filmmaking and acting about hundred titles , mainly in terror genre. ¨Exorcismo¨ is written by Molina along with 21 screenplays as ¨Mark of Wolfman¨, ¨Night of Walpurgis¨, ¨Vengeance of the mummy¨, ¨Licantropo¨, among them . He directed 13 films as ¨The Cantabros¨, ¨Return of Wolfman¨, ¨The Beast and the magic sword¨ and several others.<br><br>¨Exorcismo¨is made in ¨The Exorcist¨ style , its an early exploitation , in fact in Spain was previously exhibited and as Jacinto Molina told was written three years before . The Exorcist spawned countless imitations and rip-offs, , as in Spain were made three at the same time , as ¨ Devil play¨ by Jorge Darnell (74), ¨Endemoniada ¨ by Amando De Ossorio(74) and ¨The Spiritist¨(1975) . ¨Exorcismo ¨ packs colorful scenarios filmed in England with a lush mansion and sinister and mysterious atmosphere with acceptable cinematography by Francisco Sanchez , though cheesy special effects on the levitation scenes. Creepy and frightening soundtrack fitting to terror scenes . Acceptable and scary make-up by Adolfo Ponte .The motion picture is regularly directed by Juan Bosch. He's a Spanish craftsman, working from the 70s in all kind of genres and B movies. Rating : 4, 5 , Average . Pretty grim but interesting for genre aficionados and Paul Naschy fans.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"The Exorcist with tits","rating":5,"date":"13 December 2009","review":"Something is wrong with Leila (Grace Mills) and Father Adrian Dunning (Paul Naschy) is called in to evaluate the situation.<br><br>Some may call this a ripoff of The Exorcist with Linda Blair, but I'd rather see the flesh displayed here than some special effects. The fact is that The Exorcist was not seen in Spain before this film came out.<br><br>Anyway, it's a Paul Naschy film, and I am a completest.<br><br>You won't see amazing special effects, because they didn't exist. So it looks fake at times, but it was a good story and an interesting film.<br><br>Paul Naschy stole the show. I wasn't his finest hour, but he was head and shoulders above the rest. The makeup was good, and one could ignore how the film seemed to go all over the place just to see Naschy.","user":"lastliberal","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Should I give it an extra star for the contact lenses?","rating":1,"date":"30 July 2006","review":"Nahhh! Leila (Grace Mills) is a teenager turned on to Satan (and LSD) by her archaeologist fiancé Richard. There's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle, where Leila and Richard drink blood, drop drugs, join in sex orgies, dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants, masks and capes and the women don't wear anything at all. Unfortunately, these kind of extracurricular activities have left Leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded \"spirit of evil.\" Leila also comes from a screwed up family, which doesn't help either. Her older brother John is a recluse who seems to be in love with her. Her mother Patricia (Maria Perschy) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father's death. To top it off, her sister (Maria Kosti) is a slutty semi pro golfer named (gasp!) Debbie Gibson. There's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time. Two maids (a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone), plus Udo (Luis Induni), a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on Leila changing clothes, takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit. Oh yeah and Borg, the pet German Shepherd.<br><br>Paul Naschy is Father Adrian Dunning, the doubting priest (zzzzz) who starts snooping around after John and Richard both have their heads twisted around backwards. Leila tells him \"They say I am perverse and I'm going to prove it is true!\" During her birthday party, she tells her guests \"You make me sick! I hate you all!\" and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches \"I don't want to see that fat ass!\" Debbie suggests they commit Leila to a \"sanitory,\" but Leila runs off and joins the cult again. She is rescued (again) and brought back home (for the third time).<br><br>By this point in the movie, there's only about ten minutes left to go and all we've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f-ed up their lives are and how Leila is acting weird. It's almost as agonizing to sit through as an Andy Milligan movie, minus the gore and laughs. But finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an EXORCIST-like possession flick. Unfortunately, the best part of it are the contact lenses Leila gets to wear. Some cheap time-lapse slashes appear on her arms, legs and face, she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles. She begins reeking of rotted flesh, spits up some clear gunk, starts speaking in her dead dad's voice, sneaks into her mom's bedroom, slaps her around a bit and calls her a \"filthy bitch of a whore.\" In comes Father Adrian, who now finally believes she is indeed possessed, fends off her attempts at seduction, hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses Leila with holy water. Doors open and close, a mirror breaks, there's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor. After she tackles Dunning and the two roll down the stairs, the spirit is out of her and into - guess who? Why, Borg the family pooch! The demon dog then turns on Adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker. Then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film. It's Leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self. But then there's ANOTHER time-lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body. It's so badly done, you really have no clue what to make of it, which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless POS.<br><br>Screw the contacts, 1 out of 10 it is.","user":"capkronos","rank":[14,18]}]
