[{"title":"Kinda weird but entertaining","rating":8,"date":"26 March 2017","review":"What is the matter with Gerald? This flick keeps you watching and you really don't know why. Maybe because it's good?<br><br>Gerald has issues and his boyfriend is tired of it. Gerald's got to fix himself before he looses everything. Will he do it? <br><br>The opening scene is perfect! Three girls talking about the 'hush fund baby'. You will find out who they are referring to and who's the talk of the money set.<br><br>Easy light entertainment without anything graphic to toss at you. No real message here, just Gerald's foolishness.","user":"cekadah","rank":[25,25]},{"title":"Very fresh and enjoyable","rating":8,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"Gay-themed movies are often hit or miss. I think this one is a hit. The story, though told before becomes very fresh through a Gay lens. The cast is very talented. Jacob York who plays Gerald is awesome. He's not the typical waxed and buffed character often adorning Gay films. He's the down to earth pudgy everyday guy and is incredible sexy as a result. Kathy Cash is hysterical. As with York, she comes across very natural, I simply came across this film by happenstance and watched it with a cautious critical eye. To my delight, it was an awesome film. I watched it a second time with my husband who also enjoyed the film. I hope everyone involved with this film continues to gift us with more of the same. I hope they go far!","user":"godzillabird","rank":[30,31]}]
