[{"title":"A genuinely crazy blaxploitation film","rating":6,"date":"3 March 2012","review":"The blaxploitation genre certainly produced some bizarre oddities that's for sure. Dolemite is firmly in this category. On a technical level its appalling, with bad camera work, acting, action and story. The boom mic is visible so often that it really deserves a mention in the credits. But these considerations are ultimately irrelevant. In fact, the sheer scale of the cinematic incompetence is certainly one of the actual joys of the movie. The film-makers just didn't care and seemingly knocked this one out with little concern for such matters.<br><br>The rough and ready style of Dolemite kind of seems appropriate though, given the nature of the central character, who is a super-shady bad mutha in a pimp suit. This character, Dolemite, spends most of the film swearing in creative ways. His routines are like proto-rap and seem to have influenced hip-hop culture. The movie is really a superb time-capsule flick. The insane fashions and jive talk are all almost alien in their bizarreness now. While the movie sports various other strange characters such as Reverend Gibbs, the mayor and the Hamburger Pimp. The latter of which actually appears to be out of his head on something or other â€“ I don't think this bloke was really acting! There's also an extended scene near the end in a nightclub that really has to be seen to be believed. It has a priceless performance from a soul act and a crazy dance routine with some guy battering hell out of a drum-kit, it then climaxes with Dolemite's swearing rap thing. It's strange, like the movie in general. This may be super-trashy but it's highly original. It's yet another example of why the 70's ruled when it came to movies.","user":"Red-Barracuda","rank":[34,35]},{"title":"Eddie brought me here","rating":6,"date":"3 November 2019","review":"Dolemite (Rudy Ray Moore) is a pimp and a pusher. He gets set up by the FBI and his rival Willie Green. In prison, he is given a second chance by the warden with mutual friends Queen Bee and the governor. Crime has risen despite Dolemite's incarceration. He is to go back into the community to root out the real crime lord.<br><br>After watching Eddie Murphy's Dolemite biopic, I had to see the real thing. The production is better than I expected. The acting is surely amateurish. Moore himself is a bit stiff on the screen but has some genuine charisma. Best of all, he knows who he is. The writing gets messier in the second half. There is fun in this blaxploitation. I love his rap comedy on the streets. It has a purity to the scene. I also love watching the real thing after watching the Eddie Murphy recreations. This is fun.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"No Disco Godfather, but still a winner","rating":2,"date":"22 April 2000","review":"\"Dolemite\" is the touching story of Dolemite (Gotta love blaxploitation film titles), an ex-con who probably should still be in jail.  He gets in trouble with cops, friends, drug dealers, women, prostitutes, and society in general.  He's just not that likable a guy.  Neither is the movie, though it's still hilarious and worth watching.<br><br>The flimsy premise is that Dolemite (played with as much enthusiasm as star Rudy Ray Moore can muster) is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit.  When a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down, the warden releases him to stop it, or help it, or just watch it.  Not very clear.  All I know is that I was unaware that the justice system frees convicts in order to allow them to prove their own innocence.  My ignorance, I guess.<br><br>The plot is convoluted and unimportant, basically Dolemite goes around killing people (Usually with very poorly choreographed karate), having sex, and cursing out people, sometimes even rhyming too.  The joys of the movie are its total incompetence, and its total indifference in the matter.<br><br>I stopped counting the number of times I saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration (about two minutes of film).  I stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where Dolemite was sitting, even after he stood up and walked around, when they cut back to the establishing shot and Dolemite was inexplicably sitting down again.  I stopped wondering why Dolemite dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change, because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly (read: normal) clothes the jail gave him.  And I stopped wondering where he learned karate when he jiggles his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open.  The only time I was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting, flabby white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a towel hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up.  You keep saying \"Cut away...cut away...cut away\" but by the time they do, you are already emotionally scarred.<br><br>The movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable.  Moore as Dolemite, is either funny, cool, or both.  If you're on the lookout for a bad movie, you have found it with \"Dolemite.\"","user":"Mr. Pulse","rank":[45,54]}]
