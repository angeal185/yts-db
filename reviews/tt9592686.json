Since then, we've been mesmerized. Stay Awesome, China!, a 3rd documentary, explores new locations not covered in the 1st &amp; 2nd (Conquering Northern China) documentaries. Several unique\nstories that are true &amp; have never been told in the West are at the heart of SAC! These stories engage the audience with feelings of acceptance &amp; happiness. My favorite director, Kurosawa, probably could appreciate the obstacles that were overcome while filming &amp; finding a unique style. Very entertaining.","user":"ttclapper","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Fascinating!","rating":10,"date":"23 February 2019","review":"A rare look into Chinese culture and subculture without the usual propaganda or biased views. Winston is a charming host, sincerely interested in China and its people.","user":"marcgriefer","rank":[9,10]}]
