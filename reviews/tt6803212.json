[{"title":"Why such bad reviews?","rating":7,"date":"30 August 2019","review":"I can't wrap my head around why so many people hate this movie. It's almost as if we saw two completely different films. While the writing was nothing to write home about, the delivery from the cast was rather well executed. The cinematography was fantastic. The soundtrack was wonderful. The premise was intriguing, albeit not all too original, and although it seemed quite rushed especially in the latter half of the film, it was still quite enjoyable. This film deserves more credit than it's receiving and I would hope any and all who may be reading this would give the film a chance before blowing it off based on all these bad reviews.","user":"anwar_in_murderland","rank":[79,93]},{"title":"Beautiful movie.

A Los Angeles police detective discovers the murder of his brother, sister-in-law, and niece. Shortly afterwards, he begins to receive phone calls from his dead niece. Is our hero crazy? Is he dreaming? Is he dead? I'm not going to spoil the ending, but this movie is absolutely incredible and definitely worth your time. It will keep you enthralled with its masterful storytelling and on the edge of your seat with psychological thrills. It's so unique and fascinating and unlike anything I've ever seen or read about. A definite must-see movie.","user":"DesertLight","rank":[61,95]}]
