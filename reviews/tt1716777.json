[{"title":"It's People Like All Of Us","rating":10,"date":"2 July 2012","review":"My wife and I saw this film without having any idea of what it is a about. All we knew was some guy's father died and he went through a life decision change. For all we knew that meant he could have become gay (he didn't, and it had nothing to do with that).<br><br>This is an adult family film. It's PG-13 rating is not for nudity, swearing, or violence. It is rated that because it is a mature look at dysfunctional family problems. So while little of that is shown, they are referred to through the dialog, thus making it a mature film for teens and up.<br><br>From the opening credits of Dreamworks, the artistry of the film was evident. Instead of the usual music for the kid fishing from the moon, we hear conversations in a recording studio. In our opinion, every actor and actress gave outstanding performances. While the topic could have had a heavy handed approach, it did not. It was deftly edited and paced.<br><br>In summation, this movie was art because the content was all heart. I have deliberately avoided talking about specifics because I want all viewers to be as surprised as we were in the viewing. I give it a ten, and intend to watch it again.","user":"editor-530","rank":[94,113]},{"title":"An Amazing Movie! The BEST Performances of the Year.","rating":6,"date":"6 July 2012","review":"This has to be under everyone's radar and that's a true shame. I can't recommend it enough if you're looking for a truly moving film about fractured families and fractured souls.<br><br>I was completely blown away by this movie and by every single performance. If I were an Academy member and I saw this film I would immediately place the names Chris Pine, Elizabeth Banks and Michelle Pfeiffer at the very top of my Oscar nominations lists. Honestly, everyone is just that good in these roles especially Banks. Hers is the best performance I've seen this year bar none. The movie itself is so wonderfully written and packs true emotional resonance. The plot may sound cliché but nothing is handled in a predictable or unreal fashion. Secrets are revealed and it sheds new life on family and the meaning of love. To paraphrase: what seems important now really isn't and what's may seem not important now really is there's a lot to digest about this film. One thing's for sure, if you \"lean in to it\" and give this movie your time and undivided attention you will not be sorry that you saw it.","user":"NORTHPOINTMJM","rank":[71,86]},{"title":"Secrets are revealed and it sheds new life on family and the meaning of love.","rating":8,"date":"1 July 2012","review":"Most of us like me have all found out about family secrets in our life, and when they are revealed many years later they surprise us and it does impact and affect our lives.
