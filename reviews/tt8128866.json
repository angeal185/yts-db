[{"title":"Not bad enough to be good","rating":3,"date":"9 June 2018","review":"This is such an obvious rip off of other movies, from the title to the enclosed environment similar to Deep Blue Sea. It lacks all the humour of the Sharknado type films and is ridiculously predictable with two dimensional characters being killed off in turn. The gore level is good, but it seems big savings were made in the dinosaur special effects, with them looking more like 1950s stop go animation than modern graphics.<br><br>Overall, probably worth a watch if there's nothing better on TV, but not worth going out of your way to see it.","user":"gwynmoses","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"This is not a B movie, it's a Z movie","rating":1,"date":"22 September 2018","review":"Sorry that i have to say this, but this movie is not worth watching. It is so bad that i am sorry for the people who payed more than 1 dime for it.","user":"knuffelbeertjuh","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Typical Asylum Junk.","rating":1,"date":"20 June 2018","review":"Did Asylum invent the \"camera shake\"? Or did they copy that as well? Maybe some day they will release original movies without riding on the coat tails of REAL movie releases. Stop naming their movies to trip up some people into being suckered into watching and releasing them same time as the REAL movies. I don't see how these guys make any money with these flicks. Maybe its just for a tax write off? I can sum up this movie (and all their other movies) in a few words. 1) Poor acting, 2) Poor story, 3) Little to no special effects (When in doubt, just shake the camera for action, horror or just low on budget.","user":"Max_Lucas","rank":[11,14]}]
