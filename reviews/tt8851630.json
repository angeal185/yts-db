[{"title":"all-female-cast movie reboot version of the classic Die Drei ???","rating":1,"date":"18 January 2020","review":"Die Drei Fragzezeichen(Question marks) ??? is a german classic. But this is a cheap reboot in which the 3 male kid-detectives have been replaced by 3 female kid detectives. I am disappointed that the gender madness wouldn't even stop at this old classic. In order to avoid copyright problems the question marks have been replaced by 3 exclamation marks. The 3 ??? have always been asking the right questions. Do the 3 !!! mean that the female detectives bicker and talk all the way through ? Do not find out for yourself, instead get the original.","user":"spacequazar","rank":[2,5]},{"title":"The best children-centered live action movie 2019 out of a established franchise","rating":10,"date":"13 February 2020","review":"I have to disagree with the one other review here on imdb: DIe Drei !!! is indeed a long thriving audio book series. While I'm not listing to the all female cast audio book, I watched this together with Benjamin Bl√ºmchen 2019 and TKKG 2019. I always was more of a TKKG Guy but personally I have to say that this production is *way better* than TKKG 2019.<br><br>The characters seem true to themselve (while I can't verify that since I do not listen to the original), I did get fouled by the dozend red herrings along the case and there were no real goofs involved (like in TKKG 2019 with basicley every actor being a goof once older than 19 except for Tim's mom)<br><br>\nIf you're fan of Die Drei !!! and like children-based crime stories, die Drei !!! is a must see.<br><br>Parents beware: There is one time a character said a foul world, but besides that, there is really nothing to be afraid of.<br><br>(I'm a soical worker in kindergarden)","user":"thefbiboy","rank":[1,2]}]
