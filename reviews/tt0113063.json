[{"title":"Fair to good B movie","rating":20,"date":"20 February 2004","review":"A classic B movie, or what used to be called a B movie. These days, a B movie is called `made for cable' and is often shot in Canada with American stars and Canadian supporting actors---like this one! In The Final Cut, Vancouver doubles for Seattle (clever, eh?). We've seen all the pieces before: Mad Bomber plants explosive devices in densely populated locations and stymies the police bomb squad. Rugged, hard-boiled, world-weary, careworn John Pierce (Sam Elliott), former head of the bomb squad, reluctantly allows himself to be pressed back into service to stop the Bomber. Of course, he is framed as the Bomber himself, and in the process of clearing himself and catching the real bad guy, he must face some of his own personal demons. Sam Elliott is always watchable and this film is also graced by the presence of three beautiful women: Anne Ramsay effects a complete reversal of her role as ditzy Lisa Stemple in Mad About You. She is great here as the athletic, gun-toting, resourceful chick cop. She is allowed to get covered in perspiration in scenes that don't involve sex; how often does that happen in films these days? (Contrast The Matrix, in which Carrie-Ann Moss does incredible acrobatics without so much as breaking a sweat.) The gorgeous Barbara Tyson comes in like a lioness but unexpectedly almost disappears from view after some very hot early scenes; I wonder if some of her scenes wound up on the cutting-room floor. Finally, the lissome Lisa Langlois, who seems to specialize in victim roles, has another one here, as a human bomb. At least this time she gets to survive rather than being slashed, dismembered or incinerated.<br><br>This movie is just good enough to hold your attention till the end. It's ideal for insomniacs who watch cable at 2 a.m. in order to get sleepy enough to go back to bed.","user":"Deep-Thought","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Prepare for the most out-of-shape actionhero you`ve ever seen","rating":14,"date":"14 June 2000","review":"Final Cut proved to be a viewable movie.  Not because it was a good movie, but because the hero(Sam Elliot) was a terrible actor and completely out-of-shape for his \"action-scenes\". The movie is about a mad bomber, who`s destroying many buildings in the town.  The city`s only hope is the retired bomb-expert Pierce(S. Elliot).<br><br>Sam Elliot is an unvoluntarily funny man.  His dialogue is mistimed, completely useless and therefor a great laugh.  He is also completely exhausted after running up some stairs and performing ONE kick.  All the money seems to have gone in to paying all the famous actors for their 5 minutes presence in this movie. I recommend you to take a closer look at Final Cut, even though I don`t give it a good score, but it is just too funny to miss. 1,5/10","user":"action-6","rank":[9,20]},{"title":"Targeting the Cutters","rating":10,"date":"12 March 2020","review":"Who's seeking to eliminate the cutters of the Bomb Squad in Seattle?<br><br>This is the mystery that baffles everybody and is at the heart of the story.\nAnd as You observe the Bomb Squad seeking to unravel this mystery, You will feel the tension building up and you lose track of time as you are sucked into the search for clues and culprits.<br><br>A gripping, nerve-wracking movie that keeps you on edge throughout.\nA sparkling gem worth looking at...if you get the chance!","user":"chakotay-70770","rank":[1,1]}]
