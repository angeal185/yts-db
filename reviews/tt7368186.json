[{"title":"Before Sunrise for the Millennial Generation","rating":10,"date":"22 May 2019","review":"I found this film completely by accident but I'm glad I watched it. I related to the characters and their opinions on modern dating so much (it's kinda scary lol). If you're a fan of Before Sunrise you'll probably really enjoy it. It's a lot of talking but it's very well-written and engaging. The actors had great chemistry. Hopefully more people get to check this out.","user":"eingelas","rank":[15,37]},{"title":"Boring","rating":1,"date":"1 August 2019","review":"How can somebody love this movie?? The WHOLE movie is about two people having a conversation inside the house. Boring, boring and boring! -100000000/10","user":"gabrijela_90","rank":[6,12]},{"title":"No doubt...","rating":4,"date":"11 August 2019","review":"This is a shallow film. I apprieciate the the Before Sunrise approach but it was really poorly written, the directing was head on terrible in my opinion, the actors felt forced to say what they had. The screenplay was juvenille and it recycled ideas that everyone has discussed in the same way when they were younger.<br><br>All of this makes this film a shallow one.\nAnd its a shame cause films like this can really shine. Imo the actors reflect the director so I wont blame them.<br><br>Lots of cringy and cliche moments aswell.<br><br>I would skip it.","user":"scotoner","rank":[3,5]}]
