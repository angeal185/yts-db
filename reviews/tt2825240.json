[{"title":"Totally Zero Acting Skills with a ridiculous script","rating":1,"date":"5 March 2020","review":"I would have given negative 5 rating, if IMDB have the option. Actors do not know how to act even the lead actors. Very bad acting, nobody was able to deliver a single sentence without their poor acting skills. Do not waste your 1 hour 2 mins.","user":"mayank-813-378681","rank":[0,1]}]
