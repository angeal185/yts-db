[{"title":"No budget, interesting premise, a solid effort.","rating":6,"date":"27 September 2018","review":"Let's begin with a caveat: rating this movie as 1/10 is beyond ludicrous. It's an atmospheric little ecothriller, with no budget and uneven acting, but it has its touching moments. It kept me interested all the way to the end.","user":"candidoberreta","rank":[20,29]},{"title":"impressive debut","rating":7,"date":"15 October 2018","review":"Despite being the debut for this director from Toronto, FLORA has an interesting story and honors the era of early horror literature (Agernon Blackwood, Weird Tales Magazine etc) and it's surprisingly well done, despite the limited budget. In 1929 a team of scientist discover a closed ecosystem with a strange kind of fungus that eliminates any kind of animal life (including humans) and their race for survival begins. For people with a true knowledge of the horror genre (and I mean those who prefer its roots in literature and not those looking for brainless blockbuster atrocities), this is a hidden little gem.","user":"arisp_cn","rank":[17,25]},{"title":"Imaginative Film, Out Of The Main Stream Thriller","rating":8,"date":"11 May 2019","review":"Not sure why all the low ratings on this very interesting low budget thriller out of Canada. Going in you should understand some of the production values are not going to be up to giant budget standards, no big CGI monsters swooping in, no perfection of the 1929 time period.\nThis is a movie that uses your brain to see what is happening, to think about the why of the scare and the danger. That is what the script offers and pulls off and what makes this a tight, imaginative thriller. The basic theme is nature versus man and how our group of young, intelligent students can figure out what is happening and why and finally how to survive.\nThere are moments that we have to overlook some of the scripts short comings - like when they sew their very nice survival suits out tent canvas. Overall The acting was good, with the best being those in the main roles. The directing was very good with the director working from his own scrip. Photography was excellent capturing the vastness of the wilderness as well as the claustrophobic feel you can have in the middle of such vastness.\nSure there are flaws, but this is a thriller that is imaginative and intelligent in its telling. Worth the time to watch.","user":"deager","rank":[5,6]}]
