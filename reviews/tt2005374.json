[{"title":"Just a good thriller","rating":7,"date":"3 November 2013","review":"An authentic thrilling atmosphere, a solid cast and script, a true story based movie. I need no more for entertainment. This is not a documentary and is not intended to be. The movie doesn't investigate the serial killer relationships, the background, nor try to explain the exceptional investigating work of the police. Most of the negative reviews I have read point on these shortcomings, but this is simply a thriller and it does what it has to do: it thrills you, from the beginning to the end. Considering what is being proposed usually as thriller, this is worth to be watched and it is entertaining. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is it a good movie? Yes.","user":"MrAlfa","rank":[76,85]},{"title":"Eerie, Subtle, Affecting: well worth your time","rating":8,"date":"25 August 2013","review":"This film hasn't received a lot of press or a wide distribution. Sadly, that's probably due to Nic Cage, which is a shame. First, he's very subdued and focused (there's no wild-man Nicholas Cage in this movie). In fact, he plays a deeply decent, dedicated Alaska State Trooper who becomes convinced that a serial killer (also very well played by a creepy John Cusack) is stalking women in Anchorage. The film downplays the gore, while showing the seedy and soul-crushing underworld where Cusack finds his victims. A very nice bonus is that almost all of the police officers shown in the film are hard-working people who want to catch this killer, but know they have to work within the law to ensure he doesn't escape them in the courts. Vanessa Hudgins turns in a very nice performance as one victim who escaped and was instrumental in identifying the killer. The director does a fine job of capturing the ghostly silences of the frozen north, where so many of the man's victims were buried. All in all, a fine, atmospheric film that is both thrilling and sad. Well worth your time.","user":"LordJiggy","rank":[114,137]},{"title":"Decent movie that only scratches the surface of Hansen's diabolical crime spree","rating":7,"date":"2 October 2013","review":"This is a decent movie, which ironically would best be viewed on the big screen given the visually arresting shots of the Alaskan landscape except that it had a very tiny release on the big screen, and has most certainly been seen more on-demand and now through the DVD format. In case a viewer of \"The Frozen Ground\" is left unsatisfied with the necessary compression of events, composite characters, etc. that are necessary to produce a movie of less than two hours in length, and want to learn more about the Hansen case that inspired the movie one could do worse then read \"Fair Game\" (http://tinyurl.com/mqssp5z) by Bernard DuClos that was recently republished. Reading it as a companion to the<br><br>movie will help the viewer of \"The Frozen Ground\" realize the liberties that were inevitably taken to make it suitable for the silver screen as well as understand elements of Hansen's life and killing spree that the picture did not have time to delve into such as more of Hansen's background (which early on indicated a propensity toward crime) and the back story of the whole oil pipeline boom that produced the mafia controlled prostitution/strip bar scene that Hudgen's character is entangled in.","user":"fredngraham","rank":[61,71]}]
