[{"title":"Respectable Effort, Flawed and Confused Result","rating":5,"date":"3 May 2019","review":"\"I Trapped the Devil\" is an ominous, art-house-like slow-burner with a visibly low budget. The trailer got me intrigued &amp; so did the review by Bloody Disgusting. Was I disappointed? A bit, for I wasn't expecting anything higher than 6/10.<br><br>Here's the good things about \"I Trapped The Devil\" - The atmosphere can be grim when it tries enough, the take on the devil was smart &amp; crafty for a low-budget flick, the little twist at the ending is, in my opinion, quite cool &amp; the performance by Scott Poythress is as good as the flawed script allows him to be.<br><br>And here's the slightly bigger amount of the not-so-good things about this flick - The middle portion of the movie is pure filler &amp; also the reason why people describe this movie as a borefest. Pacing is certainly one of the biggest issues here. One thing that caught my eye for one too many times is the lighting - either they went overboard with style or just were too amateur-ish about it. AJ Bowen, about whom I usually don't have any complaints, gave a questionable performance this time. Or maybe it was the stiff lines given to him by the writer. And, of course, the story - I usually like ominosity &amp; obscurism in horror movies, I also liked it about \"I Trapped the Devil\", but I have to question it for I still can't really put the plot together as the credits are rolling. I mean, it's all there, it's just that some things are not very logical.<br><br>Despite all the flaws, I enjoyed this flick. If you're a fan of low-budget indies, obscure art-house flicks or slow-burn horrors, give it a try. As I like all three of those things, I did get a kick out of \"I Trapped the Devil\". Will I re-watch it? No, most likely never. My rating: 5/10.","user":"TwistedContent","rank":[22,24]},{"title":"Let itself down at the last hurdle","rating":6,"date":"9 September 2019","review":"As a low-budget film, this set itself up brilliantly. The atmosphere was brilliant, and the \"hidden\" nature of the supposed evil influence was played well. Is it for real? Is it all one man's psychosis?\nBut, in the very final moment, for me at least, the whole story was let down by one ridiculously clumsy mistake: the impervious padlocks we've seen repeat throughout the film disappear without a key.\nA major feature of the film is that there is a heavily locked door. But, out of nowhere, a nameless character arrives and opens the door, despite never even attempting to find a key. It may sound minor, but it makes absolutely no sense within the context of the film, and no attempt was made to make it work. It just seems like\nThe filmmakers has decided on an ending, and wanted to include it whether or not it actually fit.\nOther than that. This was a fair and somewhat original attempt at a suspenseful horror. Ultimately though, some very badly considered plot points -including but not limited to the one already mentioned- stopped it living up to it's full potential.","user":"radirgynoah","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Tedious","rating":4,"date":"27 May 2019","review":"Some movies benefit from a nice slow burn to engross the viewer in the story - it doesn't work for this movie - it is so slow I nearly fell asleep a few times - so may be good for insomniacs.<br><br>This film could easily fit in 30 minutes with plenty of time to spare.<br><br>Not very good at all.","user":"mjsreg","rank":[21,27]}]
