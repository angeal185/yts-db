[{"title":"I wanted to like it :(","rating":1,"date":"27 March 2019","review":"I have this rule, that if a film is from the UK I will love it, and that formula has proven true until now. GRANTED the film was made with a mere 9000 pounds, sadly the production cost is not what ruins this film for me. The acting was the only real horror in this film, the \"demons\" were anything but remotely scary, and the story itself is confusing and fragmented. The ending is ridiculous, and when the demons speak, the computer distortion is so aggressive it's really even hard to understand what they are saying. Sadly this flick falls short in every aspect of what a film should be. Save yourself the time, by the end of the film I did feel like clawing out my own eyes.","user":"workoutsmurf","rank":[1,3]}]
