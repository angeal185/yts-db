[{"title":"A Sentimental Favorite","rating":9,"date":"5 October 2003","review":"I saw this movie when I was younger and for some reason it always stuck with me.  I'll always remember the music (the title song as well as the classical pieces used throughout), the vestibule of Mimi Roger's apartment palace, the scene of Tom Berenger having breakfast with his family, Lorraine Bracco's fiery performance as his wife, and the haunting opening aerial shots of NYC lit up at night.  I watched it again for the first time in probably nine or ten years and it was like visiting with an old friend or curling up with a good book you had read before.  You knew the story, but it was all fascinatingly interesting.  The plot here is pretty basic: working class cop has to babysit upper class babe who witnesses heinous murder.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how it all ends, but director Ridley Scott somehow manages to keep it compelling thanks to some great direction and wonderful performances from the cast.  Somewhere I saw this billed as an erotic thriller, which is way off base.  Scott keeps everything here extremely classy.  It's more of a romantic thriller and throwback to the noir films of the 1940's.  This may not be the best film you'll ever see, but it's one of the better thrillers of the 1980's, and a worthy testament to Ridley Scott's versatility as a director.  It's also nice to see Jerry Orbach in a supporting role that probably paved the way for his part in the never ending \"Law and Order\" TV series.","user":"WriterDave","rank":[44,50]},{"title":"average, but somehow very attractive","rating":8,"date":"24 April 2002","review":"This has been one of my favorite movies.  I admit that this is not something that might be recognized by academy people. There is nothing new and original about the story and situation and it is rather easy to guess what would happen next. But somehow it is an attractive movie (to me?) and I keep watching it over and over (I have a video).  Actors are good and the view of New York is wonderful in every part of the movie.  Most of all music is superb! Ever since I first saw this movie, \"Someone to watch over me\" has been my favorite jazz standard.  One more thing.  If somebody else directed this it might have been VERY boring.  Great touch by Ridley Scott.","user":"038onits","rank":[25,28]},{"title":"Looks great, but the story's not all that","rating":5,"date":"28 March 2016","review":"Ridley Scott's SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME had the misfortune to come out during a time when FATAL ATTRACTION was going to change the whole look of the psycho-thriller movie. Thus by comparison, this film feels very ponderous and dated. It's a mixed bag of a production, with some decent performances and a nice visual style, but it doesn't really do much we haven't seen before.<br><br>It's clear from the outset that Scott is most interested in the dark and brooding cinematography here, because this is a fine-looking movie. The plot, which is about a cop who has to protect a woman who witnessed a mob murder, is less intriguing and indeed rather predictable. Tom Berenger is an acceptable hero and Mimi Rogers is ever-intriguing as the object of his desire, but I can't help but think there's a little too much romance here and not enough thrills. Jerry Orbach props up the supporting cast, as in so many films.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[8,8]}]
