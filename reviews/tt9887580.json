[{"title":"Seriously?!?!?!?","rating":1,"date":"19 January 2020","review":"My guess would be that any positive reviews are created by people paid to promote the film. This thing was a complete waste of time. Not really a continuation of the previous movie. Stupid over the top characters and definitely wrong choices for leads. Poor acting.","user":"eandre-8-696515","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Not sure what went wrong","rating":4,"date":"11 January 2020","review":"This movie has lots of action, pretty good action too, and there are a lot of fun lines, even if they are mostly juvenile or misogynistic. I don't know why it doesn't work for me, it all just came off really flat. I can't even articulate why. It's not a total waste of time to watch, but don't be expecting the big laughs or any surprises.","user":"chompygator","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Great fun","rating":8,"date":"7 January 2020","review":"I was very sceptical before seeing this, but it is quite good... the production is great, special effects are great, the women are beautiful.. This movie is nothing like the first one though... This is very good, but also very different. The two main carachters on the poster really does not make you want to watch this, but i promise you will not regret it","user":"zathan-32848","rank":[4,8]}]
