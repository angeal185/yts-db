Some of the worst animation you will; which in this day and age is a feat in itself and the voices just do not gel with the characters.\nOverall it comes across as though a fringe set people somehow got money from a church and decided to spread the message; with the result being a fail.","user":"tussuck","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"Freaky","rating":1,"date":"30 November 2019","review":"My wife checked this out from the library. Now our kids are afraid of the Bible.<br><br>The animation is terrible. The writing is awful. Our kids think it's a comedy.","user":"adamwfoster","rank":[1,1]}]
