[{"title":"Shut Up and See This Movie!!","rating":9,"date":"29 July 2012","review":"If you are a fan of popular music, whether it's Rock or Post Punk or Club Music, I think you'll really enjoy this Rockumentary. I was woefully unaware of LCD Soundsystem until I saw the preview for \"Shut Up and Play The Hits\" about a month ago or so. I was intrigued, so I checked out some of their stuff online and was really amazed to discover songs that I could dance to ( more of a dance from the neck up for me, the rest of my moves are not terribly smooth) but at the same time these songs are funny, intelligent, cynical and emotional all at once. <br><br>At last, I saw the movie yesterday and it really floored me; Great cinematography, great insights into the meaning of Rock 'n Roll fandom, legend and lore, 20C. youth culture vs. 21C. youth culture, great odes to New York - both musical and visual. <br><br>What you realize about James Murphy, the driving force of LCD Soundsystem, is that he is first and foremost a Rock 'n' Roll devotee who then decided to have a go at it himself. Not only does he have a knack for the art form but he has a great perspective lyrically that has real heart and playfulness as well as a world weariness that is somehow very comforting. It's clear that Murphy is torn about his decision to stop performing, which leads to an interesting exchange between interviewer Chuck Klosterman and Murphy about life choices as one moves into mid life.<br><br>Please Go See This Movie EVEN if you are NOT familiar with LCD Soundsystem, - maybe check out a couple of their songs before hand for the fun of it - you'll definitely Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!!","user":"kool-breeze-435-944594","rank":[23,29]},{"title":"Time to say goodbye","rating":8,"date":"3 November 2013","review":"\"Hey\", Steve Albini wrote, \"breaking up is an idea that occurred to far too few groups\". However, it's definitely an idea that occurred to LCD Soundsystem, as frontman James Murphy decided to disband the group, not long after their third album was released, despite the fact that they were now at the peak of their fame and acclaim. Nothing bad had happened – there were no bust-ups between members, drug troubles or any other music clichés – Murphy simply wanted to wave goodbye to his dance-punk creation and respect should be given to him for that. He chose to go out with a bang, by staging the group's largest gig to date on the 2nd April 2011, in New York's Madison Square Garden to a crowd of nearly 20,000. That gig is chronicled in this excellent Will Lovelace-and-David Southern-directed documentary. The live footage on display here is superb, with an Arcade Fire-featuring rendition of 'North American Scum' and the emotional climactic performance of 'New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down' proving to be highlights.<br><br>However, 'Shut Up and Play the Hits' isn't strictly a concert movie, as it also features some backstage footage, an interview recorded a week before the gig and clips of Murphy rambling around New York, often with his little bulldog in tow. This may sound boring when compared to the palpable energy of the concert footage, but these intercuts are anything but. They're revealing and engaging as we are given a glimpse of Murphy leading up to the final gig and the day after it. In particular, the interview is the most interesting with Murphy offering an overview of LCD Soundsystem and refreshingly frank responses to the questions he is asked. <br><br>This film isn't just for LCD Soundsystem aficionados; it's one for anyone who enjoys music documentaries. And if you are a fan of James Murphy, I struggle to imagine any reason why you wouldn't like this. Its offstage clips are poignant, while its beautifully shot concert footage is absorbing. If this truly is the end of the group, then this is a terrific way to say farewell.","user":"DubhDoo","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"an insightful look inside the end of a band that called it quits in their prime and the last concert they shared with their fans","rating":9,"date":"19 July 2012","review":"In 2001, James Murphy formed LCD Soundsystem at the age of 31. After releasing their first full length album in 2005, and two more albums in 2007 and 2011, with countless songs that made music lovers fall in love with them, the music world was surprised to hear Murphy say that the band was stopping.<br><br>They weren't \"breaking up\" and there was no fight. The band was just stopping; ending; retiring. Just like that. Planning the end ahead of a tour, Murphy and LCD now had an exact end date looming ahead of them and as they built closer and closer to their final show at Madison Square Garden, writers, celebrities, and other musicians all wanted to be part of that final show. This final show, the days leading up to it, and the day after are all a part of the new documentary \"Shut Up and Play the Hits.\" Beginning with aerial shots and crowd views of the moments after the final show accompanied with deafening noise cutting out any on screen sound, we get the feel of the final moments of LCD Soundsystem before experiencing it ourselves. The energy, emotion, and passion seen in the fans and in the mess of the arena just scratches at the dynamic of this final show; a show that we will get to see much of.<br><br>Being that this final show was sold out, it is amazing for LCD Soundsystem fans that couldn't see the performance live to have the chance to see this documentary on a big scene. With beautifully shot scenes of Murphy and the band playing their hits for the last time and amazing sound editing and mixing, fans can feel like they were actually at that last show.<br><br>But this film is not just for LCD Soundsystem fans. It is for anyone who loves music. The doc, specifically the interview with Chuck Klosterman and the moments of Murphy in his private home and visiting friends, gives us a deeper understanding of the culture of the music. Klosterman brings it up in his interview with Murphy when he asks him if the music and performance is more important than the culture or if it needs to be a 50/50 split. Murphy replies how important it is to be 50/50 and how you can tell when you see a show if the band is into the music they are playing and that, among other parts of the concert going experience, plays a major factor into the enjoyment for fans.<br><br>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/shut-up-and-play-the-hits/","user":"tbmforclasstsar","rank":[9,12]}]
