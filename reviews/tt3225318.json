[{"title":"Tripe reviews","rating":1,"date":"25 September 2017","review":"Gave this 1 star just to help counteract the bogus 10-star \"I'm associated with the production team!\" ratings. Such \"reviews\" stand out like a sore thumb. They don't help the movie. They don't fool anyone. They're a waste-of-time annoyance that convinces some people to absolutely not waste their time watching this film. (If the reviews have to be fake to make the movie sound good, it's not worth watching.)<br><br>Some jokers never learn. If your movie can't stand on its own without posting fake ratings, you need to find a different line of work.","user":"Snootz","rank":[40,47]},{"title":"Low rent indie crime","rating":3,"date":"16 September 2017","review":"WOLF MOTHER is a low rent indie crime thriller featuring a femme fatale as the protagonist. The story sees her trying to solve a kidnapping case by teaming up with a two-bit thief along the way. This one's fairly well shot and has a small role for Hollywood star Tom Sizemore, but it lacks in memorable action and incident and it feels laughable at the times it tries to be serious.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[30,35]},{"title":"See all my review","rating":1,"date":"17 March 2017","review":"The words \"10 Star Review\" and \"Tom Sizemore\" just don't go together. I wish all those pathetic trolls who work on these wretched movies would find a better way to promote their misbegotten failures than to leave these bogus reviews on IMDb. Not that they are fooling anyone. At least take a few minutes to review a few other crappy movies so it is not so perfectly obvious to everyone that you are associated with the film. For the record, this is an unwatchable, make-it-up-as-they-go-along atrocity of a picture that makes typical crapola indie productions look like Gone with the Wind. You've been warned.","user":"jake_fantom","rank":[41,50]}]
