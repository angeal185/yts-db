[{"title":"A lovely little gem","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2017","review":"First of all I am not a native speaker.<br><br>Well. I must say I have fallen in love with this movie. It's one of those beautifully crafted little gems that have heart and depth and just make you smile and also cry a little bit. Sure, there are other (more ambitious) movies out there tackling the same theme - going through life, losing and finding and coping and surviving and not being alone - but I just love the simplicity and kind of raw honesty of this one.<br><br>Anyway, to sum it up - characters are quirky and lovable, dialogues smart and funny and I can only recommend this movie if you are in a mood for something slow yet uplifting.","user":"nomad-73","rank":[39,47]},{"title":"One should get a badge for mastering adult life skills.","rating":8,"date":"24 April 2017","review":"Hannah, after losing her twin brother 18 months ago, has moved into her mother's shed and has stubbornly refused to move on. She and her brother were very creative together and she continues her creative efforts by making videos of thumb puppets traveling in space which earns her constant criticism from her mother, who has taken a tough love approach to forcing Hannah to move on by forcing her to vacate the shed by her 30th birthday.<br><br>Hannah's mother, grandmother, suitor, and girlfriend are all delightfully quirky. If you like quirky, this movie is for you. These characters are not one dimensional, but all have strengths and flaws that are shown to us by a very gifted writer/director.<br><br>One explosion, no car chases, and no gratuitous violence make this a movie that does not waste ones time with formulaic nonsense for the brain dead. Instead it illustrates through actions the panic and struggle of letting go a loss so great that one thinks her life will never be the same, that it's impossible to move on. And the film illustrates the jolts of losing the precious things, one at a time, that keep her isolated and bound to her dead twin.<br><br>Yet there is nothing morbid or overly dramatic in this presentation. The film is full of humor. Hannah must look after a young boy whose mother is dying, knowing what he will face. Yet he's a young cowboy and his own quirkiness mirrors Hannah's, as does his journey. Hannah is pursued awkwardly by Brandon, a somewhat shy individual who manages to approach her at the worst times, like when she's peeing behind a boat. And her dead twin appears to her in snorkeling gear which may be a clue to his death, or just his sense of humor.<br><br>There's not a surprise ending to spoil. This movie is about the journey and not the outcome and like all good films, it's made up of moments which are captivating to watch and feel as well as some good laughs along the way. I highly recommend it.","user":"skyemail-79755","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"Impressive","rating":7,"date":"6 March 2017","review":"Started off kinda meekly, I was quickly losing interest when I thought I was about to waste my time on yet another childish portrayal of a delayed adulthood, shoulders stubbornly stuck in the vaginal walls of a happier past, a past that made sense -- whereas renting an apartment, paying bills etc, obviously doesn't.<br><br>Well. I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong. Wruh-uh-ong. This is a great little movie -- funny, lighthearted, and still, the dramatic elements are so strong and wonderfully structured, proving entirely capable of planting a lump in your throat the size of a goddamned walnut.<br><br>Nothing more to say. Watch this. It's good.","user":"pauliecorleone-72628","rank":[25,35]}]
