[{"title":"Richard Pryor And Gene Wilder Once Again Work Well Together","rating":23,"date":"23 October 2002","review":"In this 1991 Tristar Pictures release, Richard Pryor once again portrays a con man and once again Gene Wilder is his costar. Their fourth collaboration may most likely be their last as Pryor's increasing signs of multiple sclerosis made filming extremely difficult for him to get through. It's a real shame in the world of contemporary film comedy as Pryor's possible cinematic swan song (if you don't count his cameos in two 1996 films, \"Lost Highway\" and \"Trigger Happy\") turns out to be one of his funniest films and best performances. Pryor portrays Eddie Dash, a con man who has just been released from prison but still has to serve time for community service. He is assigned to be a public escort for a pathological liar (Wilder) who has just been released from a mental hospital. What Pryor doesn't initially know about Wilder is that he is the pawn in a scam to claim a brewery inheritance. The two of them eventually wind up running for their lives when some greedy businessmen decide that they want to cash in on the fortune. Plenty of funny moments from the always dependable duo of Pryor and Wilder.","user":"soranno","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Not the best plot, but great lines.","rating":6,"date":"7 March 1999","review":"Seeing that this movie only received an average vote of 4.3, I felt that I had to set the record straight; it deserves at least a 6. True, the plot isn't the best, but the lines are superb. Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder (a great double team) really work wonders together. So please, do yourself a favour and go rent this movie, it's worth it.","user":"Martin Jarborg","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"its funny despite what people said","rating":8,"date":"24 November 2003","review":"i liked another you since i was in the second grade and i laughed my ass off all the time when i saw this film. Wilder and Pyror are a hit again in this film about a scam artist(pyror) that takes in a con artist(wilder) and these two start trouble. Anywho, i know not many people and critics agree with this film, but i have liked it.","user":"departed07","rank":[13,21]}]
