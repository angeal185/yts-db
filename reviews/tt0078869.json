[{"title":"Ahead of Its Time","rating":8,"date":"21 May 2005","review":"With the advancement of movie technology today, I am awaiting a re-make of this film as I can see the enhancement of the Armageddon-like atmosphere of this movie.<br><br>Even though this film came out on the heels of Star Wars I feel that for its time and its budget it was awesome and very much overlooked. I think in this case, being a Disney film, didn't help its image either. As a kid this movie scared the pants off of me. It was dark and menacing and there was the big black hole staring me in the face the whole movie. (I can still recall the extent of the willies this movie game me).<br><br>While flawed I see this movie as an artistic and hard core science fiction classic. It uses many of what I see as key elements in science fiction - known science, theoretical science, possible futures, and our fear of the unknown (I personally think even with what we know, we still know very little about black holes).<br><br>This movie was made in the feel of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Moby Dick, with the mad, yet brilliant captain, sailing a state of the art ship, knowingly, into certain and utter doom in the name of some idealistic obsession. And as it usually goes you have your idealistic yet rational unwilling passengers who want to get off the ship and survive the mad man's nightmarish dreams.<br><br>The robots, while used in a highly symbolic fashion, were original in their concept and design. I particularly liked the way V.I.N.C.E.N.T. and B.O.B. were constructed as the \"avatars\" of humanity - completely man-made with human-like eyes and a \"soul\", that only allowed them to see the \"right\" side of things - as we see them. While on the other hand Maximilian was brilliant as the epitome of evil and twisted humanity in this movie - a man silently trapped and condemned to an inhuman fate as part of a mechanical nightmare.<br><br>Lastly, I feel that the space backdrops and the internal renderings of the space ship, which I feel have somewhat of an impressionistic flair, are awesome and were very well done for the period. If you passed on this movie the first time I recommend giving it a second chance. Take in the movie - see its symbolism, its social commentaries and far reaching vision. I think some of the issues the movie quietly addresses are still relative today.","user":"mwendel","rank":[157,211]},{"title":"Not for the little ones.","rating":14,"date":"14 August 2002","review":"I first saw the Black Hole when I was in college and I remembered just enough to know that I liked it.  Others here have commented on the movie in great enough detail, I can only say,\"Lighten Up!\"  Sure the effects are not perfect but they really are pretty good. The acting is acceptable, not oscar level but then neither is the script that they were given to work with. Many of the events depicted are not plausible, but how many movies really are? (Even non SF ones) The Black Hole is in some ways Captain Nemo in space.  The Elizabethan structure of the ship in particular.  Also Reinhart and Nemo are similar characters.  However, Nemo is not truly a villain.  His crew is composed of volunteers and they are very loyal to him whereas Reinhart must lobotomize his crew to retain their services.  Reinhart cares for no one but himself, but Nemo was concerned, though grudgingly, for the welfare of even his prisoners.  In short, Nemo is a sympathetic character, Reinhart is not. This brings me to the point of my review.  The mood of this movie is what really makes or breaks it.  I must credit my sister for defining it for me because I could not find the right word.  The word is CREEPY! There is a feeling of forboding that builds untill the action sequences are finished and our heroes enter the black hole.  After that it is just intensely weird and CREEPY. Having not seen this movie for twenty years and remembering only the cool effects and robots I allowed my 5 year old to watch it. Big mistake!  He was afraid to go to sleep, and it bothered him for about a week.  This kid has handled action and SF movies OK before, although I do not let him watch the more violent or intense stuff.  This movie is intense!  Star wars did not bother him at all, but the Black Hole . . . Parents of small children beware!  The Black Hole is CREEPY!","user":"dsayne","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"Light at the end of the tunnel....","rating":8,"date":"23 August 1999","review":"Back in 1979, when this first came out, this could be seen coming down Main Street as a \"Star Wars\" cash-in.  Even I could see that (being 14 at the time).<br><br>At the time, it was being hailed by everyone whom had not seen it as a return to cerebral, thought-provoking space opera, with the same kind of reverberations as \"2001\".  <br><br>Now, let me tell you the truth about \"The Black Hole\".<br><br>From a technical standpoint, the movie is impressive (moreso when you consider that Harrison and Peter Ellenshaw, virtuosos in matte paintings, did the background FX work).  The ships all fly as they should, you can BARELY see the robots flying about on their strings and the wonder and mystery of what a black hole really is (physically as well as metaphorically) are explored satisfactorily.<br><br>But if the FX are exemplary, the flesh and blood on display are not.  Each actor supplies their own black hole; empty, dark voids where there once was talent but now serve only to suck away all the life and energy surrounding it.  A shame, since actors like Forster, Mimieux, Schell, Perkins and even Roddy McDowell (in voice only) have all done good deeds on film prior and since.  In the acting sense, at least, this movie matches \"2001\".<br><br>But in the end, you see a movie like \"The Black Hole\" for the story itself. Is it worth watching?  In that respect, I think so.  What are the limits to which mankind can play God?  Are the mysteries of the universe for Man to explore?  Do black holes lead to anything?  We are left to draw our own conclusions, but at least the ending here allows us to think seriously about what really is out there.<br><br>Eight stars.  Not a classic, but not that vacuous.","user":"Mister-6","rank":[115,180]}]
