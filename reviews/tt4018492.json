[{"title":"Another disappointing Australian film","rating":4,"date":"16 July 2015","review":"Ruben Guthrie was yet another example of an Australian film which is lacking in substance. The character development was really poor overall, however particularly for the protagonist, Ruben Guthrie, a high-flying marketing whiz living it up in Sydney. Attempts are made to introduce us to some of Ruben's inner demons, however it is isolated almost solely to the commencement of the film, and unfortunately as a result of this 1-dimensional development, you can't really develop any sympathy for the character as he struggles with his alcoholism. As a female viewer, I also found the character's attitude to women particularly off-putting, and it doesn't inspire any empathy for his struggles with attempting to \"win back\" his supermodel fiancée, Zoya (Abbey Lee.)<br><br>The most convincing character in the whole film is Virginia, a typical contradictory Bondi hipster, who remains opposed to alcohol and drugs, consumes only organic food, yet continues to chuff away at cigarettes - portrayed by Harriet Dyer. As another user has said, Abbey Lee is a model, and her beauty is stunningly obvious in the film, however unfortunately her acting skills are somewhat lacking in her ability to portray genuine emotions - seeming more of a pretty cardboard cutout that speaks.<br><br>Ruben lacks a real character arc throughout the film - without giving too much away, you are left with the feeling that there isn't anything that has truly changed about the character in any aspect of his approach to life, despite the character's destination at the end of the film - though this is somewhat ambiguous.<br><br>Some important questions are raised briefly in the film - whether alcoholism is in fact a genetic inheritance from previous generations, and whether anonymous support groups are the true means to a successful recovery from addiction, however the themes are glossed over and not explored to the depth which would give the viewer more of a sense of meaning to the film, even if there was not a \"happy ending.\"<br><br>Overall the film appears to attempt to create an Australian \"Wolf of Wall Street\", yet lacks the essential elements of any true character \"journey\" throughout, and leaves the viewer with a feeling of blank disappointment at its conclusion.","user":"alexandra-grace-rees","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"not as bad a Canopy but close","rating":1,"date":"15 July 2015","review":"Boring, not funny, one dimensional characters. Robyn Nevin and Aaron Bertram must be given some credit for doing the best they could with such a poor script. Jack Thomson plays Jack Thomson. Abbey Lee is a model not an actress, too obvious in this film. Not sure if viewer was suppose to feel this way: But I wanted to throw 'Chet' (Brenton Thwaites) from the office balcony, character should have been hanging at a skate park, not working in a large Advertising Company. Alex Dimitriades played Alex Dimitriades. Not much more I could say but 'disappointed' in portrayal of a topic that many have had to deal with i.e.: alcoholics.","user":"m-z-de","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Entertaining and Thought Provoking Comedy With Bite","rating":8,"date":"24 September 2015","review":"'Ruben Guthrie' and the titular lead are, as the movie garishly opens, hard to like; but much to this viewer's surprise, by the end of the film, some empathy and affection are afforded them both. I have enjoyed Brendan Cowell's screen work on both big and small, and thought it an inspired piece of casting to have what seems like his doppelganger, Patrick Brammall in the central role. I guess it was more than enough to adapt your own stage play and direct the picture! He has cast an actor with either a brilliant ability to channel the writer/director's life force, or just maybe they are two peas in a pod, Brammall is really finding his position as one of the country's most versatile and likable actors; even here as the at times despicable title character. <br><br>The transposing from stage to screen feels fine to me; other than some at times overly heightened dialogue and performance; but I forgave those moments as being part and parcel of the over the top world of advertising and the spin off of partying and excess from the job. Has it been satirized here or made a cliché? Either way, it worked for me. I wondered how Cowell would trace the (anti) hero's journey and conclusion and along the way there are enough surprising moments to keep the viewer connected and rooting for the protagonist. Brammall chews the scenery and is equally adept in the screwball moments as the soberingly tender ones.<br><br>Robyn Nevin was fine, as ever, and especially her one to one with 'Ruben' at the bar was a truly uncomfortable scene,and reiteration of why Ms Nevin is one of the most respected and enduring actors in Australia. Harriet Dyer as the hippy chick with her own baggage, was the revelation for me; I was both intrigued and moved by her performance. It was; aside from Ruben, the most fully fleshed of the supporting players. I had a few issues with the writing and oddly pitched performance of the usually reliable Alex Dimitriades; as the gay bestie,but once on the 'Ruben Guthrie' conveyor belt, I was along for the ride; even with its occasional jarring ingredients. <br><br>This movie does have a lot to say about substance abuse and makes no easy answers or saccharine summaries to leave the viewer with. There is much texture here, and for me that is attributable to the writing and directing that Brendan Cowell delivers. It's not perfect; nor is the main character - but Patrick Brammall makes him human and flawed - just the way I like my leading characters on screen.","user":"david-rector-85092","rank":[5,7]}]
