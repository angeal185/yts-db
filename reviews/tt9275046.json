[{"title":"Underrated","rating":8,"date":"23 December 2019","review":"Really lovely little film. An honest and poignant portrayal of the reality of America and aging in America.","user":"juliawgriffin","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"An empathetic slice of cinema","rating":10,"date":"21 December 2019","review":"It brought tears to my eyes. It's firing on all cylinders and all facets of the cinematic process. There's such confidence in this work. Such pinpoint concentration without feeling cold whatsoever. It's grownup stuff. Not in terms of audience, but in terms of craft. It just feels authoritative. The voice is consistent. The world is lush. There's just so much to love. Allen and Gross are so perfectly cast in terms of performance and physicality. They're cinematic doppelgangers of the Bergman variety. We need films like this now more than ever.","user":"michaelcjohnson-88715","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"A beautiful film","rating":10,"date":"7 January 2020","review":"A lovely, quiet look at rural America and how Community is built. In this age of \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\", Colewell delivers and shows us Neighborhood and the simple joys in everyday interactions at the local Post Office located in the home of Allen's character, Nora. The film asks and examines what happens when that local hub is threatened. It allows the viewer to watch as Nora struggles with the changes that are proposed as she examines how she came to be where she is today. Karen Allen gives an outstanding and honest performance.","user":"dquinn-53567","rank":[11,12]}]
