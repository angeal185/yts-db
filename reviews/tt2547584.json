[{"title":"A lie that tells a deeper truth","rating":8,"date":"9 December 2016","review":"If you are not addicted to entertainment motion picture and you prefer deeper meaning. This movie is in my point of view a must watch. Metascore rated this movie 60 whilst it should be 75 minimum. Watch and if I am wrong please tell me why.<br><br>Michael Fassbender just takes emotion to a very realistic place and portrays a man with fear , regrets , love. The decision he makes , as a man , we can relate to it. Alicia Vikander also takes you on a journey that helps you understand what being a parent mean and the sacrifices that comes along with it. <br><br>Rachel Weisz plays her role very well and together with the two main actors gives us some very emotional scene. I was touched by this movie and blow away by the acting. <br><br>Some beautiful shots are taken and really helps to get in the mood for something different , heartbreaking , questionable . The line between right and wrong can be difficult to see and this movie also decides not to give you what you expect. The narrative of the story is simple and yet very complicated once you try understand the reasons for certain decision. Without really realising you , as an audience you start to ask yourself , what would do , as a women , as a man. <br><br>Questions like this scares people unfortunately , but I think we should embrace those movies that challenges you emotionally. It is part of who we are.","user":"jay_daguy","rank":[60,67]},{"title":"A beautiful story about right and wrong, and everything in between","rating":26,"date":"26 January 2017","review":"This film tells the story of a married couple living in a remote lighthouse, who finds a drifting boat in the sea with a healthy baby and a dead man inside. They raise the baby as their own, but soon moral challenges arise and they find themselves at an important crossroad.<br><br>I'm impressed by how beautiful \"The Light Between Oceans\" is. The scenery is so beautiful that it makes me want to visit that place and feel its serenity. The pain of the couple and their reasons for making such a decision is well portrayed in the film, and I do feel for them for having live with the consequences of their wrongs. The story is really beautiful because it is a story of love, and paradoxically tells that sometimes the right thing to do may not be the right thing to do. It is so hard to determine what is right and what is wrong in this situation, thereby creating a conflict which keeps the film captivating. I'm deeply moved by both Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander's performances. The film haunts me after it finishes, and I'm still affected by it and ruminating about it.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[43,49]},{"title":"This is a beautifully shot and acted film","rating":10,"date":"21 November 2016","review":"When I read this on Wikidpedia I was amazed:<br><br>Critical Review The Light Between Oceans received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 59%, based on 133 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Light Between Oceans presents a well-acted and handsomely mounted adaptation of its bestselling source material, but ultimately tugs on the heartstrings too often to be effective.\"<br><br>This is a brilliantly acted film with some stunning scenery filmed in New Zealand. Both Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander put in two very strong performances, along with Rachel Weisz in a supporting role, and the film completely captures the period after the First World War. To me it seemed very much in the mode of 'The Piano' and equally as strong in terms of its dramatic dynamics and conflicts. <br><br>I saw this film with my wife who was equally impressed so I think it has an appeal for both a female and male audience. Definitely should be an Oscar contender and both actors deserve a gong for their performances.","user":"kinsmanivan","rank":[96,118]}]
