[{"title":"Vampire-Zombie-Like Creatures vs. Survivors","rating":6,"date":"16 September 2016","review":"Following to an outbreak that turned most of mankind into vampire- zombie-like creatures, the few survivors have to fight the creatures and marauders. When a group that is rescuing a girl is killed by pillagers, a young woman called Samantha \"Sam\" Sheridan is spared to be raped by the criminals. However, the lonely driver Thomas Rourke (Johnny Strong) kills the men and saves Sam. She offers ammunition, supplies, fuel and food if Rourke drives the girl and her to her hideout before the sunset. Rourke arrives in the dark but her group protects them from the creatures and Sam, Rourke and the girl arrive at the sanctuary in a former police station; but Rourke recognizes The Alpha (Whitlock Krzysztof Soszynski) that leads the creatures. The leaders Frank Hill (Lance Henriksen), his son Ethan Hill (Louis Mandylor) and the former police officer Chris (Hakeem Kae-Kazim) suspect of Rourke, but they promise to honor Sam's promise. He is locked in a cell but during the night, a strong creature breaks in the building while the survivors hear noises outside. In the morning, they find that the creatures gave pulled wrecked cars in front of their garage and their cars are trapped inside the building. Rourke convinces a small group to go with him to the hide- out of the creatures to destroy The Alpha. Why Rourke is obsessed to kill The Alpha? Will they succeed in their intent? <br><br>\"Daylight's End\" is another entertaining film in a post-apocalyptic world where survivors need to fight to stay alive. The monsters are a sort of vampire-like creatures like in Vincent Price's \"The Last Man on Earth\". The veteran Lance Henriksen has good performance in the role of a leader of survivors. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available.","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"Consider its budget!","rating":6,"date":"29 July 2016","review":"For a small budget production, this script was way over the number of pages you usually see. It had a plot, characters, ideas, good execution, good actors.<br><br>One of my favorites is Lance Henriksen, I simply adore the man. From his sci fi early work to the horror side he adopted lately, he is just great to see on the screen. One of the most underrated actors in my honest opinion. <br><br>And about the movie: you'll pretty much see full on action. A lot of gun power, some small hand to hand combats, and plenty of blood. Not gore, but blood. You'll see humanity, monsters, light and dark. It is a movie that will keep you going for sure. If you're into horror, or zombies and you wanna pass some time, this is a better way to do so. <br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[61,73]},{"title":"Great action and horror flick.","rating":9,"date":"22 August 2016","review":"This is an indie movie but it doesn't feel like an indie movie. It felt like the original Mad Max or 28 Days Later! Great action scenes and lots of quick scare shots.<br><br>Johnny Strong (Fast and the Furious, Black Hawk Down) delivers a great performance along with Lance Henriksen (Aliens, Aliens 3, Terminator). <br><br>The movie was directed by William Kauffman. He is a killer indie director that makes some great action films with limited budgets. Don't know how he pulls it off. Can't wait till he gets a real Hollywood budget. Chad Law wrote the script. They both did Sinners and Saints, which was another good movie.<br><br>Johnny Strong did the soundtrack to the film and it is really good!<br><br>The movie was filmed entirely in Texas. If you live in Dallas, you may recognize a few areas. I was surprised to find out that the movie was shot in Dallas at the old Police Station. It is in the same building the Lee Harvey Oswald was shot in. The sets and environments were awesome and made you feel like you were in the post apocalyptic world.","user":"itzaferg","rank":[31,39]}]
