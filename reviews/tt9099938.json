[{"title":"A Chinese historical movie made in Japanese ? You better believe it","rating":9,"date":"17 October 2019","review":"The long await live-action movie based on the famous manga of the same name KIngdom is finally here and as a fan of the manga, all I can say is \"Good fricking job director Shinsuke Sato because you just successfully bring life to another beloved property without heavily rely on the source material\". As far as a live-action adaptation can go Kingdom is very faithful to the source material from the characters to the events with some minor changes that I really appreciate it but the biggest disappointment I have with the movie is how tame it is in term of violence and carnage compare to the manga and if they want to continue the story they better jacked up the bloody meter because after the first big arc the next one gonna be an all-out Dynasty Warrior battle scale","user":"phanthinga","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Historical Epic at Its Finest!","rating":9,"date":"28 July 2019","review":"Xin (Kento Yamazaki) and Piao (Ryo Yoshizawa) are slave children in China in 255 BC, but both teach themselves swordfighting (using sticks) together and vow to become great generals, somehow. One day, a powerful lord comes to their farm and picks Piao to go with him to the palace, leaving Xin behind. Xin continues to train on his own, determined to catch up to Piao one day, but instead Piao returns to the farm, fatally wounded. It seems he was chosen simply because he looks exactly like the King of Qin, Yin Zheng (also Ryo Yoshizawa), and Piao was killed in place of the king by the king's evil younger brother, Cheng Jiao (Kanata Hongo), who has more royal blood than Zheng and therefore believes he has more right to the throne. Xin vows revenge and takes off on an adventure, which leads him straight to Zheng and more trouble than he'd ever imagined....<br><br>It's a bit odd that an historical Chinese epic has been made by the Japanese film director, Shinsuke Sato, based on a Japanese manga, but it works really well. Sato has been described as the Japanese Steven Spielberg, which is to say he knows how to stage epic fights, glorious spectacle and resonating themes of friendship, loyalty and the struggle against oppression. A bit long at 2 1/4 hours or so, but the motivations of the main characters and the arc of the story are never lost or bogged down in too much detail; I've left out a slew of characters (including a very important female character) in the above description, but really that's all you need to know. If you like epic battle scenes featuring lances and arrows and, especially, swords, you'll love this feature!","user":"alisonc-1","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"A boy supported Qin's unification behind the history.","rating":7,"date":"3 June 2019","review":"Takao Osawa's performance was wonderful! It was so weird! (just compliment)\nAfter watching this, how do I see him? What should I think of my memory that I cried a lot like a child in old drama? He was suited a bronze pike better than a 'Shield of Straw.'<br><br>This movie is based on a historical fiction comic that depicts Qin's unification of China in 221 BCE. It's already been about 3 years since I wanted to read it. I didn't expect I watched the movie before reading! Although I dislike Japanese movies, I went to a theator with my mother who was crazy for Ryo Yoshizawa.<br><br>From the last half, I was so excited! At first, to be honest I felt boring because of Japanese unique elements : CG, the overacting and etc...\nBut the development of the last half gave me heat up like a manga for boys! What controls people is also people.<br><br>I felt it like a digest of TV dramas. I felt the wipes of scenes worse. Thus it had some holes that threw a wet blanket on the story. But actually I just enjoyed it so much because I watched it without spoiler.<br><br>Now, the golden week( a national long holiday in Japan) has finished and the kingdom week has begun...!","user":"Aoi_kdr","rank":[8,12]}]
