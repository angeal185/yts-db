[{"title":"The Professional 2. He's back but he should not have!","rating":3,"date":"19 May 2019","review":"Beautiful winter landscapes, at the edge of an isolated lake in the great North American. Here are the positives! Otherwise: the dialogues are ridiculous, the ending is predictable, the script is pathetically not credible and was obviously written with a hangover. What a boring movie that will probably disappear from the movie theaters within one week, two at most. So if you want to waste 90 minutes, hurry up!","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[82,102]},{"title":"No ending...","rating":3,"date":"12 September 2019","review":"My first review but I had to, Reno did his part very good and scenes with him are great but, there is no ending which was very disappointing having good story not having conclusion. And other characters were developing good until last quarter than they all become pointless. Wasting of time","user":"zangloma","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Beautiful Scenery dire story","rating":2,"date":"6 July 2019","review":"The tundra was stunning, but the story lacked any answers. Very disappointed with the script and ending. 2 hrs of my life I will never get back.","user":"derekjohnson-brown","rank":[48,75]}]
