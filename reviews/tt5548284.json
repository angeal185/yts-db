[{"title":"Nice Homage to Classic Horror Films","rating":10,"date":"10 May 2016","review":"Lego Scooby-Doo: Haunted Hollywood (2016) <br><br>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br><br>After bringing down the Sea Creature, Scooby and the gang head to Hollywood for a vacation. They end up at a famous movie studio known for their classic horror movies and before long a zombie, a mummy and a headless horseman are running loose.<br><br>LEGO SCOOBY-DOO: HAUNTED Hollywood has a lot of very good stuff in it but it also has some weak stuff that keeps it from being a lot better. I will say that as a classic horror film fan it was great seeing the various homages made to the old movies. The studio here is obviously meant to be Universal with one of the main characters meant to be Lon Chaney while the name is a wink to Boris Karloff. Even the posters shown here are copied from famous movie posters. The Son of Zombie film poster here is the same as that for SON OF FRANKENSTEIN.<br><br>That stuff is all fun but the mystery itself is rather bland and even at just 75 minutes the film seems long at times. There's a running gag dealing with Daphnie wanting to be a \"star\" and it's rather boring and gets very few laughs. I'd also argue that overall the film lacks many good laughs. The animation and vocal work is nice but as a whole there's just something missing.","user":"Michael_Elliott","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Shameless Cash Grab","rating":3,"date":"3 May 2016","review":"The Plot to any scooby doo movie is simple, there is a mystery and the gang solve it in the last few minutes in a monster of the week style.<br><br>The mystery here is that a movie studio seems to be haunted and classical horror monsters like the mummy and Dracula pop up and scare the staff away. The Twist is that everything is awesome, everything is cool when you're part of a team! (ok so everything is lego but I just couldn't resist)<br><br>Plot is simple, graphics are beautiful.... that's about all that's good here, the characters could have been any random group as they had no distinct personality let alone the personality of the beloved Scooby doo and the mystery Inc gang! When your stars get out shined by a random person in the movie who you won't see again (Drella Diabolique voiced by Cassandra Peterson) even though Shaggy AND Scooby are both standing right there then you know you have a problem!<br><br>Another big issue is the writing, breaking the fourth wall and going meta in a heavily processed way (yeah found footage movies are sooooo in! add that to the movie!) mocking the old show (pft, catch phrases! using shaggy and scooby as live bait because they'll do it for a scooby snack,,,etc) and reminding us over and over this is a movie... as if it's saying hey don't be too hard us, it's all fun and games...<br><br>The Mystery Inc. Gang was never mean spirited, they did not place Shaggy and Scooby in danger on purpose so they'd be live bait (and actually told them that's their function in the team, to be live bait).<br><br>The one smart thing here is the use of legos in the world to their advantage but the same joke is used again and again in the movie so after the 1st time it's already worn out (taking their hair off and throwing it as a weapon!).<br><br>Not sure who this is made for, It's Banking on the fact that you saw the original so not small kids. too simple for adults that grew up with the show. My guess it was made for people who eat legos, they'd probably like it..... <br><br>over all it's harmless so if you have little kids,,, show them something from the original first then take them to see this! Don't let this one be their first Scooby movie!","user":"hjalsayegh","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Better than expected","rating":3,"date":"8 August 2018","review":"You can't expect much from a direct-to-video, CGI, Lego movie. And it seems almost appalling that Warner bros. would allow a film like this to be made or that someone would even conjure up the idea for this movie in the first place.<br><br>But surprisingly enough, I didn't hate it. I mean don't get me wrong, it's not a good movie, but its not nearly as bad as the premise led me to believe.<br><br>First of all, they did manage to get the official voice cast together to make this. That alone improves the film. The movie also has a pretty classic Scooby-Doo plot that is executed fairly well. On top of that, they managed to pull off the comedy. The jokes were good and they even had some pretty clever Lego-inspired gags throughout.<br><br>But of course, this movie does fall short in a lot of areas. Besides the funny bits, the script was poorly written. The supporting characters were throw-away consisting of an unsettling and unappealing tour guide, an off-brand Elvira, and not one, but two generic J Jonah Jameson ripoffs.<br><br>The ending was also completely predictable, they didn't give Velma anything to do throughout the film, and they mis-characterized Daphne by giving her a craving for fame. A trait I don't recall from any of the other movies/TV shows.<br><br>In the end, this movie obviously isn't great, but also isn't a train-wreck and I'm sure your kid will love it if they like Scooby-Doo and have a weird thing for Legos.","user":"EnemyPavement","rank":[2,2]}]
