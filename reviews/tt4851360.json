[{"title":"Indie mish-mash","rating":2,"date":"20 December 2018","review":"DEMONIA UNDERTAKER is your usual kind of indie science fiction movie.

It's overlong, too.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Utter Crap!!!!!!","rating":1,"date":"21 December 2018","review":"I've seen better acting and special effects on the 1960's version of Thunderbirds TV series and those actors were wooden puppets","user":"pubquiz","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Time waster","rating":1,"date":"28 December 2018","review":"I can't believe stuff like this actually gets made.
