[{"title":"An insightful documentary for any Linklater / Benning fans","rating":8,"date":"10 August 2014","review":"Double Play is a film that delves into the themes and methods of two great contemporary filmmakers; Richard Linklater and James Benning. It charts their professional relationship, and the various thematic similarities that link their work. This is done through clips of their films, archive footage, and primarily an in-depth conversation between the two as they play tennis and baseball on Linklater's country-side property. This film would lack context if you were not already familiar with at least one, if not both, of these filmmakers - having said that, fans will be thoroughly engaged by the insightful exploration into the philosophical and stylistic approach of these two wonderful artists. Not a long film, but one that will satisfy and inspire filmmakers and fans alike.","user":"Albert_Orr","rank":[0,1]}]
