Although she has done something wrong, I just wanna to say that the movie is pretty bad on its own and I hate the song especially Everything I Need. Also,the fight scenes are very boring ,just like real people fighting in front of you.The actors and director are the pits. I need another glass of wine.","user":"Seb-Alexander","rank":[16,17]}]
