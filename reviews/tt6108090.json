[{"title":"Simple but powerfully acted, sweet but not syrupy.","rating":10,"date":"19 October 2017","review":"Saw this first day in a theater with my family. Aamir once again proves he is one of the few finest actors in Bollywood today. Very convincingly n nicely he fits into every character he plays, no matter the screen time. He is magnificent, but he does not carry the weight of this film on his own. A slue of other fine actors give absolutely divine performances, especially Zaira Wasim. The story centers around a 15 year old girl. The film highlights her talents while also showing the painful problems that comes with being a female in a patriarchal society. Beautifully acted, sweet but not syrupy and perfect for a break from all the holiday madness, Secret Superstar is a true gem.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[48,59]},{"title":"Delicious slice of life","rating":8,"date":"19 October 2017","review":"Mr. Advait Chandan has done very fine work as a writer and director. Every minute detail is taken care but it makes film slow sometimes, especially in first half. Without being violent, this film smarty and effectively tackles, sensitive issues like domestic violence and female feticide. Story was very clear but screenplay and dialogues induce life in it. Characterization is very intelligently conceived. Initially old grad mother seems filler but when she tells Insiya, about her mother's plight, you feel that no one could have been better than her to do it. Younger brother also looks just added to show a family but when his gift secret got reveled to her sister, it was very touching which clearly established family bonding. Due to clear cut vision of characterization and details, film became lively. Like teacher giving home tuition while peeling peas. Undertone love track starts with very abrupt note but till end you feel its cute, worthy and fresh. Insia couldn't able to sing in studio her first song, where lots of oomph was asked, which again balances her character because she was in restrict upbringing. Her point of view to music director showcases her character intelligence while realizing and accepting her point of view, established soft side of rude music director, it leads great bonding between them. In very first scene of mother and daughter, covered bruise mark on mother's eye, establishes, three main characters, mother, daughter and father, smartly. First half is good but slow at places, second half is very good with lots of emotional quotient. Performance wise Amir Khan is brilliant. He has been sculpting characters in the way that in future performance lovers will take inspiration and reference. This character was out of his comfort zone but he achieved it. Zaira Wasim as Insia is first rate. She is cute, fiery yet vulnerable. In climax or when parting away from friend, her lines and expression make your eyes moist. Meher Vij as his mother is impressive. Her chemistry is so good that you feel that she is real mother and wife. Raj Arjun as her father Farookh, is mind blowing. In his first scene, he puts eye drops and squeezes his nostril, like it happens in real life. He will terrorize you without a word. Kabir Sajid as Guddu and Tirth Sharma as Chintan's performances, are cute and endearing. 'Nachdi Phira' and 'O Re Manwa' tracks are melodious. Credit goes to music director Amit Trivedi and lyricist Kausar Munir.","user":"dineshprakash","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"Secret Superstar..
