[{"title":"Dialogue laughable...Dancing beyond incredible","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2008","review":"As with the last user who commented, the reason for this score was purely the dancing. Now, to be fair, the acting abilities of the two main characters was average...even above average at times...though not stellar. However, their dancing was freaking SICK. I've seen a lot, and some of this freestyle was off the charts incredible. The only reason that I went to see this movie, in fact.<br><br>Briana Evigan (Andie) is an amazingly talented dancer. Her acting was actually not that bad, I was pleased. Robert Hoffman (Chase) was the typical charming, blond-haired and privileged pretty-boy...with an edge. His dancing was phenomenal, they were both exciting to watch. Their chemistry together was enough to make it hard to tear my eyes from the screen. If the trailers entertain you, and you're a fan of dance see this movie. Though the plot is weak, and the dialogue laughable, the dancing is enough to make spending your $8 on the ticket more than worth it.","user":"LikeAn_Angel","rank":[111,131]},{"title":"Dancing Makes The Movie","rating":6,"date":"16 February 2008","review":"I actually thought that the movie was pretty good. It's not as bad as the reviews that it's getting, just don't go in expecting to get an Oscar performance. The storyline was a little all over the place. Typical teen dance movie. BUT the dancing is amazing couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Robert Hoffman did a decent job, he really lays the charm in throughout the whole movie. The dance scenes make the entire movie. Ethnically, it is such a diverse cast of people, there is someone for everyone to identify with. The soundtrack is insanely good also. By the end of it you will be quoting lines and wanting to dance for sure.","user":"GibMart7","rank":[76,102]},{"title":"See it for the dancing!!","rating":7,"date":"23 February 2008","review":"The story lacks substance, but I did not see the movie for story... I saw it for the dancing and the dancing was great. I love all dance movies though. This was definitely the movie with the best dancing, but not necessarily the best storyline. Take the Lead was a better story, but the dancing could not compare. The new characters were cool too. They had pretty good chemistry. The movie kept me totally entertained the whole time even though it was totally predictable. Like I said the dancing was what I wanted to see and I was not at all disappointed. The last 15 minutes of the movie made it definitely worth an hour and a half of my time. If you like dancing you'll love it... if you don't then you won't!","user":"debikal","rank":[51,67]}]
