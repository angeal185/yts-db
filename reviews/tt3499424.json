[{"title":"A crime against the film industry","rating":2,"date":"28 July 2014","review":"If that drunk idiot can call himself Hercules, I can call myself Emma Watson. This movie is only fun if you hate films. <br><br>I really believe that even the actor's parents are ashamed of this garbage. I have no words for the acting, because yes, it is that bad. <br><br>Even the large, very large, amount of blood couldn't save it. It was ketchup and I swear I saw jam once or twice. <br><br>It can't come as a surprise that, besides the actors and special effects, the movie is historically incorrect. The clothes are ancient roman, not ancient Greek. With the amount of make-up used it's like they weren't even trying.<br><br>If you want to lose 2 hours of your life, I recommend this movie. If not: RUN. LIKE. HELL.","user":"emma_jlp","rank":[49,55]},{"title":"not even a parody","rating":21,"date":"21 July 2014","review":"One of the worst movies i have ever watched, knowing Greek mythology this has nothing to do with anything Greek, after troy , 300 and Alexander the great this is the worst parody i ever watched, some people must go first to school and then to try to make a movie that contains mythology, is the least tragic! the names...the story.... the clothes....the place....nothing Greek! 1.Hercules was not an alcoholic as he is presented 2.the names in the movie are totally wrong 3.the city looks more like Jewish than Greek 4. Greece is not a desert like in the movie 5. the suits in the movie are from ancient rome not Greece 6. not even the weapons!!! really don't waste your time to see this, better watch the smurfs are more realistic than this monstrosity.","user":"socrates-sr","rank":[48,54]},{"title":"stop this so called movies","rating":1,"date":"2 August 2014","review":"this is not a movie, it's a bad joke.<br><br>shame on the producers, director, cast and all involved.<br><br>blood and sex don't always work, desperate ones.<br><br>bad characters, awful script... the acting... it's not acting, it's ... nothing, why would you create something like that? i understand money is always welcome, but, come on, guys, you have your names all over the internet, aren't you feeling a little bit nasty when you wake up in the morning? or, do you really think this is the way to success? I pity you...<br><br>One of the worst movies ever made, with interest. Stop doing that, be true to yourself guys... or, maybe, these is who you are and in that case... I pity you again. And again to make the 10 lines that are a must for this review, but I feel I already spent too much time on your nothing...","user":"gabi-tache","rank":[38,45]}]
