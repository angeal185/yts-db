[{"title":"This movie is all over the place...","rating":3,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"I didn't find this to be a slow burn as some have sugggested, but I found it to be very disjointed and didn't pace well. Too many things are happening that you don't know what the story is, until toward the latter half, and even then it was still all over the place. It is like a ghost movie, no wait its a possession movie, no wait its a witch movie, no its a revenge movie.....sigh. It is like it didn't know where to go with all of the activity...oh yeah there is poltergeist activity too. Good grief this was difficult to watch and try to stay focused.","user":"sherripadgitt-55536","rank":[24,27]},{"title":"It doesn't really work on any level.","rating":3,"date":"24 November 2019","review":"I've tried to look for some positives in this film, and not to simply just say it's a poor film, but in reality it's just a poor film. It's tagged as a horror, it isn't, or if it is, then those behind it have very different views on what makes a good horror movie. It is agonisingly slow, the pacing is the main issue, you keep wanting something to happen, for it to spark into life, but that moment never comes. The story was all over the place, it made no sense.<br><br>If you can reach the end, you're a trooper. I was just bored. 3/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Creepy but Predictable","rating":6,"date":"21 December 2019","review":"The nurse Alicia (Manuela Vellés) is summoned by her sister Sara (Maggie Civantos) and returns to the dark house of her mother Victoria (Emma Suárez) with her husband, the unemployed electrician Mikel (Alain Hernández), and their ten year-old daughter Nora (Claudia Placer).

The atmosphere is dark and gruesome, the performances are great but the story becomes predictable when the lawyer reads the testament. The screenplay could be better but the underrated \"La influencia\" is a good horror film. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[8,10]}]
