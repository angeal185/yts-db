[{"title":"May This Be A Lesson To American Studios","rating":22,"date":"22 April 2019","review":"Do not remake stuff you do not understand. Seriously. Just because you work in the cash/treasury department at a Hollywood production company doesn't mean you need to commission a remake of every Japanese story that has sold a few tickets.<br><br>May this be a lesson for those who want to remake Kimi No Na Wa. Prepare for failure. If we want to watch it..... WE WILL WATCH THE ORIGINAL!","user":"papadum-singh-desi","rank":[246,282]},{"title":"Unattractive Mary Sue Whitewashes...","rating":22,"date":"22 April 2019","review":"This money seeking product has been homogenized, pasteurized and sterilized by the Hollywood Lack of Originality Machine for the pickpocketing of the stupid. The end result is a product that is totally Americanized without any Japanese nutritional value but it contains a Japanese mother nonetheless. Acting ability is not a requirement.","user":"bronsencollins","rank":[200,235]},{"title":"I remember when film critics used to give bad reviews for silly scripts","rating":2,"date":"12 May 2019","review":"I just felt like the remake was unnecessary especially since it is far too bad to be taken seriously. I personally didn't watch the original and just went for the DVD to be entertained by a story. Instead Scarlet Johansson looks out of place, the wrong race and frankly is annoying. Serves up a good lesson that big budget is not always quality.","user":"leibygreyson","rank":[185,222]}]
