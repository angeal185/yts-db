[{"title":"Awful, awful movie with the combination of the worst humor types.","rating":4,"date":"28 March 2016","review":"I feel like even giving it 4 is too much, this cartoon left me with nothing but a headache and reassurance that Chinese and Russian cartoons are the worst thing, with a few exceptions, of course. But most of the time any computer made cartoons by China in the recent years was bland and plain unfunny clich√© moments that just make you cringe.<br><br>I am Russian, and this movie was advertised a lot, and it was executed so badly that i'd wish i could turn time back to never see this.<br><br>Such a disappointment! And this was allowed for kids, too? The jokes about pixels and sizes (especially in the Russian version) is no way near child friendly.<br><br>Avoid like plague, unless you like very bland Chinese/Russian humor.","user":"xkren","rank":[15,23]},{"title":"We liked it!","rating":9,"date":"10 May 2016","review":"I went to watch this cartoon with my son who is 9 years old. From my point of view I want to say that the script is not completely clear, there is a the lack of details, for example I didn't understand how characters appear in particular places and the ending seems rushed. Also slang used in the dialogues sometimes is too hard for kids. But my son didn't pay attention to it cause he doesn't use these words :) As for grown ups these jokes are very funny. I believe that such weaknesses and excesses are noticed only by adults. Kids, first of all, focus attention on a beautiful picture, and a fascinating story. They absolutely don't care about how elaborated the script is and the suitability of actors voices, whether they like it or dislike it. And my son liked it, the plot is quite simple and understandable even for 4-5 years old kids, moreover adults won't be bored watching this cartoon, cause it is high quality movie with great 3D so you can really feel yourself inside the frame. There are several plot lines which are going in parallel: enmity, friendship and love, each of them exists as an independent and as an entire story. My son told me that everything was clear and interesting for him. During the watching I've seen him excited and captured by the movie so he couldn't take his eyes off the screen. Overall we both liked it! And I think minuses are always everywhere and we can talk a lot about it, but, though I'm not an expert, I suppose to create a cartoon of a such level and quality is very difficult.","user":"kseniat","rank":[11,18]},{"title":"Completely quackers","rating":4,"date":"1 October 2017","review":"Love animation (films like 'Beauty and the Beast', 'Pinocchio', 'The Lion King', 'Bambi', 'Sleeping Beauty', 'Snow White', 'Aladdin', 'The Little Mermaid, the 'Toy Story' trilogy, 'Inside Out' 'The Secret of NIMH' 'Watership Down', 'The Prince of Egypt', 'The Iron Giant' and many of Studio Ghibli films are among my favourites), always have, always will. Russian animation fascinates me, especially the older, traditional animation from Soyuzmultfilm.<br><br>There are certainly far worse animated films out there than 'Quackerz', as strange a film it is it actually looks like effort was put into it and not an amateurish hack job. It is however sadly a case of an interesting concept executed weirdly and blandly. There are good points certainly. Apart from the mediocre work on the humans, the animation is very good. Very vibrant in colour with colours that leap out of the screen and rich and meticulous in detail.<br><br>While not exactly incredible, the voice cast (that doesn't rely on celebrity voices and didn't need to) do bring energy and soul to their roles. The soundtrack is infectiously peppy. There are a few amusing jokes and the sparring leaders and dim-witted thieves provide a little entertainment value.<br><br>Most successful is the romance between Erica and Longway. That had wit and heart and the characters have chemistry and are likable and confident, regardless of it being a very familiar story trope.<br><br>However, 'Quackerz' is a very strange film. Not just in the bizarrely confusing mishmash of accents that make what seemed to be a very clear setting initially increasingly more ambiguous. But also in elements like the steam-punk style that seems to be there for no reason and the gramophone/duck break dance scene that come over as out of place, bizarre and takes one out of the film.<br><br>Although the writing has its moments, a lot of it is awkward and some of it is culturally insensitive in a way that's not for the easily offended. It often sounded like a very clumsy attempt to appeal to international audiences. The story execution underwhelms outside of the romance. It has too many familiar elements done with little freshness and its most original element, the legend of the sun duck plot, is under-cooked and may confuse younger audiences. The ending is rushed. There are a few nice lessons and values but they're lost amidst the strong aroma of strangeness.<br><br>Characters-wise, while Erica and Longway are likable and the thieves and leaders have some entertainment value, the others are a mix of bland and annoying. The villain is a very superficial one who isn't particularly entertaining or memorable let alone menacing. As mentioned, the human character animation is mediocre at best.<br><br>In summary, okay but completely quackers (admittedly very bad pun intended). 4/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[4,5]}]
