[{"title":"Creepy and Gruesome Version of Alien in an Irish Farm","rating":7,"date":"12 November 2008","review":"The broken farmer Dan (John Lynch) rents his farm for the scientist John (Marcel Iures) from the Bovine Genetics Technology that is researching genetic modifications of cattle to increase its fertilization. The veterinarian Orla (Essie Davis) is bitten by the calf while helping the cow to deliver, and she feels that something went wrong with the experiment. During the night, the cow has a narrow passage for the calf, and Dan asks the young couple Jamie (Sean Harris) and Mary (Ruth Negga) that is parked in a trailer in front of his farm's entrance to help him in the delivery. When the offspring is born, it bites Dan; Orla arrives later and realizes that it is a genetic anomaly and she sacrifices the calf. During the autopsy of the animal, she discovers that the fetus is pregnant and she destroys the freak hybrids. However, one of them escapes and attacks a cow first and Jamie later. When John arrives in the farm, he discovers that there is the danger of infection of human beings and decides to quarantine the spot. But one offspring is alive and need to be captured.<br><br>\"Isolation\" is a creepy and gruesome version of Alien in an Irish farm. The cinematography is very dark like the story that is simple but works, and the locations are indeed repugnant. But the direction and the cast make the difference with excellent work highlighting the always excellent John Lynch. The special effects are great and the open conclusion gives a perfect ending to this movie. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Quarentena\" (\"Quarantine\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[34,43]},{"title":"Experiments gone awry on a desolate farm have deadly results.","rating":8,"date":"23 March 2006","review":"Billy O'Brien pulls no punches and avoids no arm-in-bum shots in this tension-filled, dark film. The first portion of the movie, the viewer is left in a fog of confusion, constantly trying decipher exactly what's happening on the farm. The high level of confusion felt by the viewer perfectly parallels that of the protagonist--Dan, played adequately by John Lynch. Though exactly what \"went wrong\" is never truly established, its effects certainly are and lead to a horrible series of events.<br><br>Marcel Iures played John, the conductor of said experiments. His performance pushes the film towards its climax. He provides a dark and knowing force in the film albeit a somewhat typical mad scientist mold that he fits into.<br><br>O'Brien's greatest achievement is the reality in which he creates his film. His frequent use of a hand-held camera lends it a voyeuristic, documentary type of feel. He also utilizes a number of point of view shots to keep the viewer as close to the unappetizing going-ons as possible. That along with the low-key acting creates a very realistic portrait of farm life. Still, a threat found on a bovine farm can only be so terrifying. And though the idea is refreshingly original, the writing is still average at best. The characters share too many traits and seem to lack interests or goals outside of mere survival.","user":"stslack","rank":[49,67]},{"title":"Not as bad as all that","rating":8,"date":"28 June 2006","review":"I think that the other review of this film is a bit unfair. Yes it is a quiet movie which moves with a very deliberate pace. No there is not a huge monster nor do we see it overly much. The important thing in kind of indie horror film is to establish tension then retain and gain it. The film was quite effective there. There are a number of moments which are very uncomfortable indeed in this film. By not showing too much of the creature they were using the \"Cat People\" dodge which is that if you don't have the money or resources for a big scary beast then let the audience imagine it. If they had shown something one wonders if the prior reviewer would have trashed them for that as well.","user":"christian_zabriskie","rank":[47,65]}]
