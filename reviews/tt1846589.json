If you liked Olympus has fallen , you will like this one.","user":"mtsocalis","rank":[48,59]},{"title":"Much better than I expected! Why all the hate?","rating":9,"date":"19 December 2018","review":"I'm guessing all the hate is from all the political nuts reading into a film who simply can't just stop to enjoy a movie that's meant to entertain. Then there's all the wannabe critics slamming a \"typical cliched and predictable\" film. I'd like to see those geniuses come up with something new... I'm pretty sure there's not much left in original concept films.<br><br>A submarine film has been long overdue, and this one was surprisingly very satisfying. It was well directed by novice Donovan Marsh. Newcomer writers Arne Schmidt and Jamie Moss did a fantastic job with the screenplay. Gerard Butler and Gary Oldman nailed their roles and the rest of the cast were also on point. At 122 mins length, the pacing was excellent with the non-stop action and suspense, that time flew by. The Visuals and SFX were outstanding.<br><br>My only beef with this film was the sound editing - just terrible. From scene to scene the dialogue was either fine, or overshadowed by the loud score so much, that I could barely understand what anyone was saying. A huge flaw for a production this grand.<br><br>Nevertheless, it's an 8.5/10 rounded up to 9 from me. Don't listen to the negative reviews, no film production this big and so well cast deserves 1's. It's well worth the watch.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[394,569]}]
