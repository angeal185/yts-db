[{"title":"A heartwarming film, but at times a bit too sunny","rating":6,"date":"25 July 2017","review":"I was excited about how the Neko Atsume game would be transformed into a cute, uplifting story about a struggling writer. In general, I liked the high-key, slightly out- of-focus feel to the whole film. There were an abundance of elegant zooms, close-ups mixed with slow-motion, and other stylistic choices that I felt were unique and contributed well to the uplifting concept of the film. Yet, at times, the acting and humor was too fake and I think the director tried too hard to make everyone seem happy - moments that were supposed to be touching often just felt overdone. The plot fell a bit flat and was easily forgettable. All in all, a beautiful film but it lacked that little something.","user":"wanghui138138","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"SOOO BORING. Cat videos on youtube is way more entertaining.","rating":2,"date":"17 July 2019","review":"If you love cats, you will be so disappointed with this movie. Even if you don't care about cats, the movie is so boring. The whole cat thing is a bait gimmick.<br><br>The story is more about a dude having writer's block, but the cat part supposedly inspiring him to write better is extremely weak and boring to watch.<br><br>The way the whole film is shot, especially with the cats is so amateurish student film like you're just seeing random cats being shot as opposed to having some thought to the scene.<br><br>When the movie was first announced, I was excited, but thank god I didn't waste money or time to go see this in theaters. EXTREMELY boring. Skip it.<br><br>A better Japanese cat movie is \"Cats Don't Come When You Call\"","user":"pinokiyo","rank":[0,0]}]
