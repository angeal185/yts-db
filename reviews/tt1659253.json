[{"title":"Pretty damn good but it isn't Scott and Baily","rating":8,"date":"25 March 2015","review":"A few reviewers here have rated this as a 1 which I really don't understand. The performances from the actors are first rate and the direction is superb for a TV series. If you compare it with Luther which, don't get me wrong, is wonderful, it's far more believable and better acted. Alright, it has the annoying tendency of all British cop shows to have a \"damaged\" police officer as the main protagonist, and yes, the procedures aren't exactly accurate, but this is a TV series, not a documentary. If it followed a police officer's role to the letter it would be pretty damn boring. If you want to see something like that then the nearest you'll get to it is the excellent Scott and Baily. Everybody in this show shines. It even has the superb Eddie Marsen in it! I suspect that followers of the books will be a little miffed but as I haven't read the books I couldn't give a monkey's. It might be worth bearing in mind that a book and a TV series are two different things. As for me, I'm gutted they decided not to make more series.","user":"dalescotbates","rank":[21,30]},{"title":"British Policing Cannot be this Inept","rating":4,"date":"8 May 2017","review":"I can suspend disbelief for any movie to a point. But a movie that is supposed to represent gritty police work can push me only so far. Why would a cop left to guard a witness go into a panic when she realized an intruder was in another room? Do they really carry no weapons at all?? I am neglecting to mention that she had just been doing cocaine in the bathroom. All she had for defense was a phone?? Really, it was all just too much to take. It was like the Keystone Kops but with British accents. And that was only one of the events I found unbelievable. Performances were fine. Just terrible writing.","user":"evmcelroy","rank":[11,17]},{"title":"Thorne In The Side","rating":2,"date":"10 September 2018","review":"Dull, plodding, poorly written, wooden acting, unrealistic character performance, etc., etc., etc.. As others have said, what is with the psuedo-psycho, guilt ridden cop genre that has cropped up, especially in Britain? I walked away from the story for a while, came back and had not missed one beat of the story (if it even had one, that is!).<br><br>An especially idiotic scene has the head detective interrogating a suspect from the front seat of a car, the suspect in the back seat, while swerving across the road trying to get him to confess, when his partner in the back seat attacks the suspect,...and they get rammed by another motorist, crashing the car. Amazingly, being hit on the passenger side where the suspect was sitting, HE is the who gets out, while the so called detectives are trapped inside the car!<br><br>That was enough for me.","user":"tom_downing","rank":[7,11]}]
