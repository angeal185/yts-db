[{"title":"Cheering for the Robins - All the Way!","rating":10,"date":"26 November 2013","review":"What a fabulous film. Great novel that's been well produced for the big screen. <br><br>Set in the 1970s, Season of Miracles weaves a story of friendship that develops between little league captain Zack and The Robins' new secret weapon Rafer, an autistic boy who can hit the fire out of a baseball. <br><br>The team rallies around him to stop the taunting and bullying from their ravels the Hawks. And in the process, learn a valuable lesson that comes by accepting those who at first may seem a little different, but truly have wonderful gifts they can share with all. <br><br>Highly recommended for the entire family.","user":"TwoLakes","rank":[20,28]},{"title":"The Robins Are Champions On and Off The Field","rating":10,"date":"8 November 2013","review":"Season of Miracles has a lot going for it. After all, who doesn't love baseball. And the 70s. But at the heart of this indie gem, is the story of how a young team grew up one magical season when they encountered a boy with autism who changed their lives forward. <br><br>Grayson Russell is wonderful as the autistic, baseball crushing, Rafer. John Schneider is a caring coach who not only teaches the game of baseball, but the more important game of life. Rusty Whitener plays Rafer's bitter father with depth and emotion. Music is fun and keeps the story moving. A classic American tale worthy of family night in anyone's household.","user":"WillGrove","rank":[19,28]},{"title":"Everyone Has A Gift To Share","rating":9,"date":"29 October 2013","review":"This film gives a voice to the autistic community as unique as those affected by the impairment. Not everyone communicates the same way, but everyone has a gift to share. <br><br>Children, especially those who don't communicate in the traditional sense, should be nurtured and accepted for the talents and gifts they possess.<br><br>\"Season of Miracles\" celebrates that. In a time when bullying is such an issue, this film promotes friendship and camaraderie in kids through their love of baseball.<br><br>Don't miss this film, both for its entertainment quality and teachable moments.","user":"jgshores","rank":[20,33]}]
