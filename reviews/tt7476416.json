[{"title":"No words ...","rating":30,"date":"30 June 2018","review":"No words can describe how awful this movie really is. The acting and music are terrible. The fighting is so cheesy and the special effects aren't so special. It has nothing to do with the dark web. I highly recommend watching anything else but this ..\nCan't even give it one star...","user":"mrsjacktownvalowamboldfranco","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Good for a Laugh","rating":4,"date":"28 June 2018","review":"Let's get one thing straight: this isn't a horror movie, nor does it actually have very much to do with the dark web. It's just a compilation of laughable scenes with horrid acting. If you want a real film regarding the dark web, don't watch this. If you want to laugh at some garbage, it's somewhat enjoyable.","user":"rcwinkhart","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Spectacular","rating":1,"date":"3 September 2018","review":"Would recommend this movie to anyone. Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Acting was oscar worthy..","user":"xxmontyy","rank":[2,4]}]
