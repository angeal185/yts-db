[{"title":"Compelling time capsule of the turbulent 1960's","rating":8,"date":"13 August 2018","review":"Police chiefs from all over America gather together for an annual conference held in Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Hawaii in October, 1968. The police chiefs talk about the Black Panther Party and the riots at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, Illinois as well as check out the latest weapons designed to help the police with crowd control. Directors Richard Leacock and Noel E. Parmentel Jr. don't pass judgement on the police chiefs; instead they merely observe how the are and let the viewers draw their own conclusions on what to think about them. Moreover, this documentary astutely captures a strong sense of unease that the police at the time felt because of the general chaos going on in the late 1960's (the police chiefs come across as quite sincere in their need to maintain some kind of order in a troubled world). In addition, the police aren't depicted as fascist monsters; they are shown marching and singing together in a choir. An interesting little documentary.","user":"Woodyanders","rank":[1,1]}]
