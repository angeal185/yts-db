[{"title":"Little one loves this!","rating":9,"date":"9 March 2020","review":"Although it's not my fave of all the Curious George movies, it is my kids. The silly antics of typical George vs the stuffy royal monkey makes my kiddo giggle. Princesses and castle also a fave! Story is cute and sweet. Wish it had more humor on the royal money side but overall still great family entertainment!","user":"wingodsaysso","rank":[0,0]}]
