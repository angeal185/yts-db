[{"title":"Put it on loop, and drive yourself loony.","rating":9,"date":"19 October 2000","review":"I worked at a Video -rental shop when this movie came out on PAL-VHS, and as we were only allowed to show PG rated films (Sorry I dont know the US rating) Anyway, I slapped this film on to see what it was like. I had trouble serving customers, I was laughing that much! I put the film on loop for my whole 12 hour shift, and nearly drove myself loopy. I sang along to \"He holds the whole world...\" and later found my self talking to my socks.<br><br>I don't work there any more...","user":"Aelfy","rank":[53,64]},{"title":"Icht schlicken dokken, lug dee lug......","rating":10,"date":"10 December 1999","review":"I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard during a movie. Harland Williams is a genius.  \"C'mon all you Chinese.....\"  Who comes up with this stuff???  I got the feeling that the directors and writers just told Williams to work around the script and improvise whatever he wanted?  Some of this stuff is so off the wall, you wonder just how much was scripted. And this is not your typical Jerry Lewis slapstick. Williams has a great deal of pure talent.  Anyway watch it and just enjoy the wonderful absurdity that is Rocket Man.","user":"Dave-79","rank":[43,55]},{"title":"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen, if not the funniest.","rating":12,"date":"12 November 2002","review":"The first time I saw this movie I couldn't stop laughing. I happened to see it again a couple nights ago, and it was the same, only it seemed even funnier. I just ordered it from Amazon, I've got to have this movie available when I need a good laugh. I can understand why some people don't like it, you have to be 10 years old at heart to get it. What I don't understand is why I haven't seen more of Harlen Williams, he was a riot in this movie.","user":"horsegoggles","rank":[37,50]}]
