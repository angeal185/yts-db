[{"title":"don't let crappy reviews make you miss it","rating":7,"date":"20 July 2013","review":"I've never reviewed a movie here before, but I'm doing it because most of what I've seen online and in my local paper were at best tepid, if not downright negative. Frankly, it is a much better comedy of manners than \"Bridesmaids\" was-- that one relied far too heavily on the Judd Apatow gross-out factor. (As if proving that women could be as stupid as men is some kind of feminist triumph.) Wiig's skill-- and the terrific Annette Bening's, as well-- is to tread the fine line between comic sketch exaggeration and the rueful comedy in the human condition. One of the better comedies I've seen in awhile, and deserves spreading the good word.","user":"kategowen","rank":[60,75]},{"title":"Quirky But Interesting Comedy","rating":6,"date":"22 July 2013","review":"I saw \"Girl Most Likely\", starring Kristen Wiig-SNL-t.v., Bridesmaids; Annette Bening-Open Range, Mars Attacks!; Matt Dillon-Old Dogs, Wild Things and Darren Criss-Glee-t.v., A Very Potter Musical.<br><br>This is a low budget independent comedy that has a quirky tone to it. Kristen is a 30 year old failed playwright that is living in New York. She looses her fianc√©' and her job, all in the same day, which leads to a little breakdown and she ends up staying with her mother, Annette, in New Jersey. Her mother has a gambling addiction, as well as a new, younger boyfriend, Matt. Kristen lost her father at an early age, or so she thought, until she finds out that he may still be alive. Oh, and Matt claims to be a C.I.A. operative that goes by the name of George Boosch-he can't tell them his real name because... well, he is a top secret operative for the C.I.A. Darren plays a young wanabe singer-he sings in a Backstreet Boys tribute band-living in her old bedroom that her mother rented out. Kristen's 29 year old little brother-still living at home with Annette-raises and sells crabs, and even made his own crustacean shell to wear, for protection-protection from what? I don't know. Anyway, as you can see, it is the very definition of a dysfunctional family. It's rated \"PG-13\" for sexual content-no nudity-and language and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 43 minutes. It is not a laugh-out-loud comedy but it was interesting enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.","user":"stevendbeard","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"Don't Miss It - Quite the Surprise!","rating":10,"date":"5 January 2014","review":"After watching this film, my girlfriend said, \"ya know, thebest way to enjoy a movie is to go into it with no expectations.<br><br>Well, that's how we viewed this. It was a late rental, from a kiosk, and we picked it based on the box figuring it would be \"something light and fun\" because it had Kristen Wig. Oddly, it got too late to watch anything until the next day, and boy I'm glad we waited.<br><br>Much of the description is in the synopsis of this film. I call it a \"film\" because it is just that - it's not your typical Hollywood comedy of breakup, or heartache, or going for cheap laughs. Nor is it a tug on your heartstrings predictable drama. Instead this film has the perfect mix, and warm story of an independent film, with some, but not too many quirky family relationships, and real, flawed love story, with family, friendships...some hope, some heartache.<br><br>I'm used to seeing Kristin Wig in silly comedic roles - in this, Wig, Benning, Matt Dylan, et. al are all outstanding...just watch it. Warm, warm film.","user":"djbuddy97","rank":[25,32]}]
