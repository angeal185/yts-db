[{"title":"Forget what you saw","rating":5,"date":"12 August 2019","review":"Mia Daisy Hoffman (Darcie Lincoln) witnesses a police murder, developed PTSD and then dropped it from her memory. She is being chased by imaginary people and goes to Life Coach Franklin Splitz (Sandy Batchelor) for help. His methods are unorthodox and he seems to have his own issues.<br><br>The film is a different type of psychological thriller, falling short of Hitchcock which isn't bad. The main issue is the actors were not as engaging as the imaginary characters.<br><br>Guide: F-word. Near shower nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"my review","rating":1,"date":"30 January 2020","review":"Thriller only!!! It should be Drama only, a lot of irrelevant Drama 100%, I skipped through the boring crap, PTSD problem which is a boring storyline, very drawn out slow going, total garbage, its like watching paint dry","user":"keithstanier","rank":[1,2]}]
