[{"title":"very enjoyable semi-black comedy","rating":11,"date":"11 April 2002","review":"Maybe I'm just stupid, but I love this movie.  I still remember when it came out and maybe it's just nostalgia because I watched it so many times when I was nine years old, but I still enjoy watching it.  It does a pretty good job at catching the look and feel of the late 80s.  All the hairstyles and clothing are pretty dated but to me, that's all part of the fun. <br><br>\nIt all starts when our guys, Richard and Larry, discover a $2 million insurance fraud scam in their company.  When they report it to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser) he seems grateful and invites them to his beach house for labor day weekend.  As it turns out, Bernie is the one doing the scamming and has hired a mob hitman to take them out.  Little does Bernie know, that the mob has decided that Bernie has been a little too careless and they have decided to take him out instead.  So, by the time Richard and Larry reach the island, they discover that Bernie is dead from what looks like a drug-overdose.  Instead of calling the cops, the less than bright Larry, decides it better to pretend that he didn't die.  This will work since all of the island partyers are pretty self-absorbed and clueless. This is where it starts getting funny.<br><br>Since the hitman is still on the island, he keeps seeing Bernie, who he thought he killed and keeps re-killing him. It's hilarious, because the boys really don't have a clue that the hitman is even around.  Watching them lug a dead corpse around, making him look alive, is one of the highlights.  The fact that all of the islanders believe he's alive is even funnier.  One of my favorite parts of the movie was Andrew McCarthy's performance as Larry. His slacker part killed me and he has some really funny lines.  What ever happened to him?  Jonathan Silverman also does a great job with an underwritten part.  He plays the ulcer-bound Richard who SO tries to be the moral center of the situation.  Terry Kiser is incredible, as always and he plays a dead guy VERY well.  Some of the stuff that he has to do, I really can't see anyone else pulling off as well.  My favorite scenes came when Bernie was alive.  The guy is such an unbelievable jerk, he's actually fun to hate.  <br><br>Ignore the other comments on here, and go get this one.  It's great for some laughs and I STILL get a lot out of it everytime I watch it.  A great semi-black comedy.  Go pick it up and look for the sequel.  I enjoyed it as well, although not quite as much.","user":"billybrown41","rank":[73,82]},{"title":"Under rated comedy blast.","rating":8,"date":"8 August 2000","review":"Weekend at Bernies! Sure it is dumb. But the comedy is so smartly done that it makes it hilarious. I for one laugh my butt off every time I watch this movie. It is one of those movies that cheers you up if you are having a bad day. The duo of McCarthy and Silverman is almost flawless. They are wonderful to watch. Together they almost remind me of classic pairs like Laurel &amp; Hardy or Abbot &amp; Costello. If you just sit back and relax this movie can really tickle your funny bone. It even might make you `drop dead from laughing'. Oh.was that to corny.sorry. But honestly, this is a good film. Give it a try someday when you have nothing else to do or are having a party. (But beware just rent this one. The second one, although it has its moments, doesn't meet up to the original)","user":"actingeric","rank":[57,69]},{"title":"Hilarious","rating":10,"date":"30 December 2001","review":"This is one of the funniest films ever made. Sure, it's stupid, and it could never really happen, but it is hilarious. The 3 main actors are great, esp. Terry Kiser (Bernie). The boat scene is the best. Anyone with a sense of humor will love this movie.","user":"Rose-35","rank":[65,80]}]
