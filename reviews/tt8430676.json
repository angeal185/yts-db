[{"title":"A basic deranged killer feature","rating":5,"date":"12 March 2020","review":"Nothing is missing, and nothing is particularly special.\nThe redeeming feature of this movie is it's appropriate run time of 71 minutes, in the ago of overlong, dull \"thrillers\".","user":"ivan_dmitriev","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"alright","rating":5,"date":"13 March 2020","review":"Nothing spectacular about the movie though the actors all played their part well.....simple storyline but the ending made me rate it a bit less, there were so many endings that I liked honestly that could have happened but it is what it is and I gave it a 5/10......watch at your own convenience...","user":"lifelinespublishing","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Last 15min. Left The Movie Took A Deep Plunge","rating":3,"date":"12 March 2020","review":"For a low budget movie I was impressed with the writing, cinematography; the actors timing was off a smidge. Was ready to give high kudos/rating but the last 15min. ruined everything!","user":"zac-68274","rank":[1,1]}]
