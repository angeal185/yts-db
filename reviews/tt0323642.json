[{"title":"Endearing!","rating":25,"date":"25 April 2004","review":"This movie has captivated not only my almost three-year-old's attention, but the hearts of our entire family!  This movie is sweet, charming, and chock-full of reminders of how we should value and treat our precious friendships! Being the \"tiny voice\" in the group, Piglet and his kindnesses are often overlooked, leaving him feeling alone and insignificant...how many of us can relate to that, especially our children?!  Piglet's friends reminisce and slowly figure out that their precious friend is a priceless treasure!  I know my children have thought twice about how they are treating their friends after having seen this movie! The very best part is the music!  Carly Simon has written the sweetest lyrics and melodies that my three-year-old insists I sing to him before bed each night.  Songs include, \"A Few Good Friends\", \"A Mother's Intuition\", and Simon's own, softer version of Pooh's theme song.<br><br>Don't miss this delightfully enchanting film...you'll be \"singing\" its praises too!!","user":"Cornwells5","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Pooh kicks Barney's butt!","rating":8,"date":"19 April 2006","review":"Pooh rocks! This film is great just like the others. I nearly cried when Pooh lost Piglet's scrap-book. This film is cute just like all the others and I have a friend who thinks Pooh cares more about his honey than his friends, which this movie prooves is false.<br><br>Piglet feels left out because of his size and runs away. Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Roo and Rabbit are concerned and look for him using his scrap book. Along the way they learn that Piglet is a big part in their lives and that they took advantage of him. In the end Pooh is almost killed, but Piglet saves him. This film is good and is underrated just like all the Pooh films!Plus, Carly Simon ain't half bad at singing the songs.<br><br>POOH ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","user":"americandragonfreak","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Sweet children's movie","rating":7,"date":"10 October 2009","review":"Piglet's Big Movie is a sweet children's movie, though I don't think it is as good as the Tigger Movie. There are flaws with the movie, the characters due to the voice actors changing have drastically changed, Rabbit especially. The plot is a little unfocused, it is nice that adorable Piglet has his own movie, but only the last quarter of or so of the film was dedicated completely to Piglet, there were parts when it was suggestive of an extended TV episode. And it is rather short, so the limitations in script and plot are glaring sadly. However, the voice acting is very good, Jim Cummings is marvellous as Tigger and Pooh, and John Fiedler voices Piglet beautifully. The art work, while not as good as the animation in the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, is still decent, and the songs by Carly Simon, especially the stirring Sing Ho For the Life of the Bear are surprisingly memorable. All in all, sweet. 7/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[8,9]}]
