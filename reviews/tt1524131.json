[{"title":"A Great, Feel Good, Family Movie","rating":10,"date":"1 December 2010","review":"I actually have never heard of WWE Productions prior to watching this movie and I am not a wrestling fan in any way shape or form. I watched the movie on the recommendation of a friend.<br><br>This movie is just a fun, funny, feel good movie that is suitable for the whole family. It is a good, heartwarming movie. There are a few profanities and mild violence, but really suitable for pretty much anyone.<br><br>The actors were great. Though the main actor is apparently a wrestler, he is quite a talented actor. His ability to show a huge range of emotions is as good as most well paid, well known actors. <br><br>This probably isn't a critics movie. But if you can sit around and enjoy a movie without digging into originality and critically analyzing everything about it, you will enjoy. <br><br>This is just a great film to be able to get the family together and everyone enjoy the movie. I highly recommend it.","user":"sixleggedfreak","rank":[11,16]},{"title":"A wonderful comedy for the family on the weekend!","rating":10,"date":"7 November 2010","review":"I just finished watching Knucklehead and I absolutely loved it. It is hilarious most of the time and very sad at times, and I really love the funny and sad twists. I was expecting it to be just another time-wasting movie that will depend entirely on its main actor's fame, but it definitely surpassed my expectations.<br><br>All the actors in the movie were great. Mark Feuerstein and Merola Hardin really hit the spot and play their characters perfectly, and so did all the other actors in the movie.<br><br>Paul Wight \"The Big Show\" surprisingly is a brilliant actor. He is hilarious and portrays his character's emotions flawlessly. I'd go as much as saying he's a much better actor than he is a wrestler.<br><br>Critics and people who are into movies like The Godfather should avoid this movie and not start criticizing and nominating it for worst movie in history as this is just a comedy for the family.<br><br>So buy/rent it for the weekend, sit on the couch with your family, get your pop corn ready, and prepare to start laughing at a giant acting like a 12 year old! <br><br>Gotta love Knucklehead!","user":"tarek-elsakka","rank":[21,35]},{"title":"Felt like a Remake Nacho Libre","rating":6,"date":"6 November 2010","review":"I wasn't expecting much from this movie a typical comedy with a famous wrestling star. It Felt like a remake Nacho Libre. What did surprise me was The Big Shows performance, His emotions in it really felt sincere this chap CAN actually act in fact i would go as far as saying he would make a better actor than one of his wrestling performance acts. its not a side splitting movie but does have its moments. In all, The actors did a good job, The cast was good. The comedy was funny in parts, the story wasn't anything new though. in all a well acted fun family movie not just aimed at wrestling fans as in fact there is not actually a lot of wrestling in it which i am actually glad of as when there was wrestling scenes it was the poorest performance of acting in the movie. You certainly wouldn't think of big show as a professional wrestler, yes the scenes were that bad!. Move over Mr Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) there's a new wrestling actor in town.<br><br>I would rate @ 6.5","user":"i-nemesis","rank":[13,21]}]
