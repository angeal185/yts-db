[{"title":"This Is a Terrible Movie","rating":2,"date":"4 October 2016","review":"I amazed at the rating given by some people on here, this movie is absolutely abysmal - the acting is dire, the script is pathetic, the story-line completely unbelievable and there were several occasions where if my remote control was nearer to me - I would have switched it off and gone to bed - and I can normally veg out and watch anything, I'm not even super critical. <br><br>Listen to my advice and avoid it like the plague, you will thank me for it - its 1 1/2 hours of your life you will never get back and believe me when I say it feels like at least 3 hours if not more.<br><br>If you are looking for a compelling reason why wrestling companies and professional wrestlers should not go into the movie business - look no further, your quest is over!","user":"neil-43355","rank":[14,27]},{"title":"The movie did have a twist at the end that made sitting through the entire movie worth it.","rating":5,"date":"16 September 2016","review":"\"If you know what you're looking for you can prevent it all from ever happening.\" Lucas Nolan (Copeland) is the best interrogator in the city. After a terror plot is uncovered it is up to him to find out where and when. The suspect they have knows the answers but won't give them up easy. The only choice him and his team have is to play along with his games in hopes of finally uncovering the truth. This is a movie where you pretty much get what you expect. A type of 12 rounds sequel that tries to be much more than that. The acting is what you would expect from a WWE movie and the tenseness comes across as forced and a little cheesy at times. The suspect he is interrogating is written to convey a pretty in your face message which wouldn't be so bad but the fact that his dialog is just a series of clich√©s it weakens his impact. All that said, the movie did have a twist at the end that made sitting through the entire movie worth it. Overall, a very mediocre movie that is saved by the end, only because I didn't see it coming, but it also could have been that I wasn't really paying that close attention to it. I give this a C.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[8,14]},{"title":"Surprised","rating":9,"date":"8 September 2016","review":"This movie had me guessing where it was going. Yes it's a \"WWE\" film which comes attached with a certain stigma so people will judge it without giving it the time.<br><br>The acting is good not great but that's not to say that certain actors outshine the rest in particular the interactions between \"Edge\" and the antagonist which is more philosophical than we get in most \"Hollywood\" movies these days.<br><br>The production values are decent not over the top and the story is solid. It's more than just a run of the mill action movie. I would say if you have the time give this movie a chance you might actually enjoy it more than you think.","user":"vyper-kaos","rank":[12,28]}]
