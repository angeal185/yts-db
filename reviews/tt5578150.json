[{"title":"Dull and predictable.","rating":2,"date":"13 March 2018","review":"I only watched this because I like Amy Acker and David Arquette and that's really the only reason to watch it, and sadly, is not enough. The script is boring and lifeless. I don't even know why it's listed as a romantic COMEDY because there is zero attempts at humor (beyond naming the Donkey Quxiote). But more than just dull the script is predictable. Once you find out David is playing a writer if you predict that his first book was very successful but that he's struggled since then and after moping around the whole movie it will conclude with him finding a fresh perspective on life and re-committing himself to his writing, then you're right. It's not a spoiler to say that's what happens because it's so clear from the start that that is what is going to happen. That's how the whole movie goes. She'll be temped to cheat on him, he'll make a big romantic gesture, blah blah blah. Just google \"romantic comedy tropes\" and go down the checklist if you bother to watch this. <br><br>I wish these two charming actors would be in a movie I could endorse but this movie is just a complete waste of everyone's time.

Wife wants to spent more time with hotter guy she \"finds\" on the trip and tells husband to get over everything. Wife doesn't unstand husbands great discomfort at this idea.","user":"nogu-06346","rank":[2,2]}]
