[{"title":"Not your ordinary road trip","rating":10,"date":"26 March 2005","review":"Truly one of the funniest, most original films of the mid 90's. The casting is truly inspired-Anne Meara gives a knockout performance as an overbearing, but well-meaning suburban mother; Hope Davis is marvelous (as usual) as an optimistic, sort of numb wife on a mission to see if her husband is indeed cheating on her; Liev Schreiber is wonderful as the superb Parker Posey's aspiring writer boyfriend; Campbell Scott steals the movie as a lusty writer Eddie; and of course Stanley Tucci turns in another great performance as the catalyst character in the film. His screen time is brief, but he shines brightly. Marcia Gay Harden's cameo as a neurotic party guest had me practically on the floor laughing. The story unfolds naturally, taking the viewer on the same emotional journey as the characters. There's never a dull moment, and the film is an indie classic filled with thought-provoking dialogue and terrific character sketches.","user":"Snoopymichele","rank":[25,26]},{"title":"A small film that is easy to miss but should be seen","rating":8,"date":"9 November 2003","review":"While I've been meaning to see this film for years, (I think the trailer was on the Reservoir Dogs VHS that I wore out before I bought it on DVD) it was one of probably hundreds of films that I put on my back burner.  So when I recently saw it was on a pay channel I jumped on it, and am very glad that I did finally see this gem.<br><br>The Daytrippers involves a woman (Davis) whose resolve that she is happily married is tested when she finds an excerpt from a love poem that fell from her husband's (Tucci) clothes.  She elects to go to her mother (Meara) for advice and ends up going on a day trip to NYC to ask her husband about it. Along for the ride is her father, (McNamara) her sister, (Posey) and her sister's boyfriend (Schrieber).  Of course, if they were able to simply confront her husband it would be easy; unfortunately he is no where to be found, so they willingly engage in amateur sleuthing to put together the story while they drive around the city looking for him.<br><br>The plot is a fairly simple one, but the character development is the true star of the film.  While Parker Posey is known best for playing `quirky yet intelligent' characters, her role seems more of a natural addition in this film rather than a run-of-the-mill portrayal for her.  Meara is nearly maddening as a meddling mother, and McNamara, a well established character actor is heartbreakingly sweet as the weary father.  Davis and Tucci are both fantastic as usual, and while Tucci's role is a small one, he exhibits his usual passion that makes him an exciting actor.  Davis gives her character a palpable fragility that just barely makes room for the modicum of strength that is holding her together.  In my opinion, the true breakout star of the film is Schrieber as Carl Petrovic, `the boyfriend'.  His character has so many facets to his personality and becomes such a complex study that is so rare in a supporting character.  And Schrieber's portrayal is brilliant and both comedic and heart-breaking in it's subtle profundity. Schreiber has been on my radar since I saw him in RKO 281 brilliantly portraying one of my personal heroes, Orson Welles, and after viewing this performance I plan to seek out more of his work.  <br><br>The Daytrippers has been an independent film darling for years now and I can see why.  It is an intelligent, emotional and well-written and acted film that will hold an appeal for most who take the time to view it. <br><br>\n--Shelly","user":"FilmOtaku","rank":[28,30]},{"title":"highly satisfying","rating":4,"date":"4 November 1998","review":"A Long Island woman finds a love letter in her house and suspects her husband of cheating.  Her over-protective (and very pro-active) family convinces her to confront her husband at his workplace in Manhattan.  They all (wife, mom, dad, sister and sister's boyfriend) pile into the station wagon to hunt down the scoundrel.  In their efforts to find him they meet a bunch of interesting characters and learn a little bit more about their own feelings for one another.<br><br>This movie is so sweet in its examination of family loyalty and so honest in its examination of long-failed relationships in denial that I feel it is easily one of the most satisfying video rentals I've ever experienced. There's enough comedy throughout to provide laughs (especially any and all jokes at the expense of Liev Schreiber's pretentious novelist) and the realistic sisterly affection shared by Parker Posey and Hope Davis is genuinely touching.<br><br>Also provides a subtle examination of the Long Islander's relationship to Manhattan - the latter acting as an unfamiliar, answerless maze through which the family has to pass in order to find the truth.","user":"K8-2","rank":[13,15]}]
