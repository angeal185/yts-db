[{"title":"Unfriended Dark Web: Vast improvement","rating":8,"date":"26 November 2018","review":"Considering that the original movie was a huge commercial success and made back 65 times it's budget I wasn't shocked to hear a sequel was being made, I didn't expect it to be so much better though.<br><br>Don't get me wrong I think the first film had some great ideas and I like the cpu screen method of filming but it was lacking in a lot of areas and my final score for it was a very disappointing 4/10.<br><br>This sequel goes in a new direction altogether. It maintains the same appearance but the supernatural element is out the window for a more modern stylish smart approach and it works wonders.<br><br>Yet another group of 20 somethings are sat in front of their cpu's skyping away not realising their night is about to take a very dark turn.<br><br>A sleek clever little film I walked away from this considerably happier than I expected to. It's unpredictible, looks great and the cast do a solid job at stressing just how much the situation is spiralling out of their control.<br><br>Absolutely well worth a watch even if you didn't like the first movie, this is a very different creature and makes me now want this franchise to really blossom.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Looks great<br><br>Really quite clever<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>All the video and audio distortions get annoying<br><br>I think it could have used a bit of additional time<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>Han shot first!<br><br>Someone shrunk Gal Gadot","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[49,63]},{"title":"Exactly what you're looking for.","rating":9,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"If you've opted to see this, you'll get what you're looking for and then some. It's pretty horrifying in its real world implications and it keeps you engrossed start to finish. Disturbing, jarring, if you want to forget about literally anything else in the world for 92 minutes, watch it. You'll get what you came for and won't be disappointed.","user":"hnhnyc","rank":[117,161]},{"title":"Creative and Effective Scary Movie Concept","rating":7,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"Following up the original from 2015, 'Unfriended: Dark Web' is technically a sequel, though an untethered one since none of the characters from the first film appear in it (if you've seen the first film, you understand why). This sequel makes use of the same inventive storytelling device, taking place entirely on one character's laptop screen. <br><br>We view everything through the protagonist's eyes (Matias) as he constantly toggles back and forth between Facebook chat, Wikipedia, Spotify and a Skype session with his closest friends on game night. This technique creates an authentic computer experience to which we can all relate. The beginning of the film wisely commits time to developing all the characters, making them all real, empathetic and just vague enough that we can superimpose our own friends on these avatars. A crucial seed is planted-we've all had nights begin this way. This could happen to any of us.<br><br>Debut director Stephen Susco (a veteran of horror writing) opts to open with a relaxing atmosphere for viewers to meet the friends. In this first act before anything scary is introduced, the characters reveal themselves to be interesting and worth caring about, which is not the case in most horror films. It's a strength in this one.<br><br>But what starts out as a pleasant evening, quickly grows worse. Matias reveals that he stole the laptop from the lost and found at the caf√© where he works. The owner wants it back-seems reasonable. When Matias doesn't immediately acquiesce, the laptop's owner messages him, hacks his screen and threatens the life of him and all his friends-seems a little less reasonable.<br><br>This laptop owner, a seriously skilled hacker, is no joke. He operates on the dark web, a crime-riddled corner of the internet that exchanges heinous acts and millions in cryptocurrencies. <br><br>Suspense and anxiety build through Matias's frantic multi-tasking and breathless pauses as he stares at the three bubbles on Facebook chat, waiting for a response-an experience we have all had, though presumably with much lower stakes. <br><br>Once the online threats transition into real-life attacks, negative space on each friend's webcam easily lends itself to opportunities for someone to approach silently from behind. The computer screen-only viewing experience does nothing to limit the scares. If anything, the events unfolding become more terrifying because they feel contained and personal. <br><br>'Dark Web' exploits our fears about the internet-everything we do could be watched by someone else, someone we wouldn't want watching. We're vulnerable when we're online. Despite the risks, we knowingly share an enormous amount of information about ourselves with the world.<br><br>This knowledge makes all the events we witness in this movie feel plausible, even if a few of the hacker's tech tricks feel like convenient storytelling devices. The filmmakers are undoubtedly gambling that most viewers will not notice them amidst the escalating chaos that ensues. It's not a bad bet.<br><br>The film's greatest flaw in an otherwise strong movie, is that it's too bleak and too grim. Once we see the level of control the nefarious forces have over the Skyping friends, we cannot help but feel hopeless. It seems as though the outcome is never uncertain-it's only a matter of how and how long. <br><br>Nevertheless, this is a well-made and creative scary movie. It succeeds in being a movie that we need right now without ever blatantly declaring that's what it wants to be. <br><br>We should all probably be more careful online. Also, don't steal! This whole fiasco could have been avoided.","user":"Jared_Andrews","rank":[100,138]}]
