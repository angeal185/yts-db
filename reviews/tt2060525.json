[{"title":"Another Astron-6 instant classic","rating":9,"date":"17 February 2013","review":"This film has a quality which allows you to transcend the usual role of audience, and makes you feel like you are with friends, albeit very weird (possibly deranged) friends who have a green screen. Based on those brilliant b-movies of our childhood, Manborg follows the adventures of a group of misfits who are valiantly fighting off the Nazi-vampire hordes from hell. With the likes of Number One Man and Justice on the team, there is never a dull moment. It had me on the edge of my seat throughout, and left me hungry for more. Expect excitement, chaos, unrequited love, science, stop-motion monsters, hover boards and so much more. It is funny, it's fantastic, it is gory and it is glorious. Possibly not for the feint of heart, but definitely one I would recommend (and have been). It's never too late... To be a hero.","user":"elspeth87","rank":[18,25]},{"title":"The ultimate homage to bad movies!","rating":10,"date":"3 March 2013","review":"I can not honestly think of anything that I disliked about this movie. Right from the beginning it had me in hysterics and continued to keep me in a state of laughter for the full hour run time. What makes this film so funny is not necessarily the jokes (the case with comedies), but is in fact because the acting, voice acting, storyline, animations etc are so purposely bad that it's easily clear they are making fun of their own film. And with this, you end up laughing like a hyena for the entire duration. It's clear that the writers of this film knew exactly what made old bad sci-fi films so bad and used this knowledge to create a genius script. In conclusion,If you were a fan of the old bad sci-fi films... You'll love this<br><br>If you are a fan of films which really aren't serious... You'll love this<br><br>If you are a human with a beating heart...You'll love this","user":"imgothamsreckoning-623-394990","rank":[22,35]},{"title":"I shall keep my review for Manborg short and sweet.","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2013","review":"If you are like me, and you're a fan of action movies, video games like Mortal Kombat, and movies in the vain of those churned out by Troma, then you need to see this film immediately as it is an ode to 80s brilliance and is utterly brilliant itself - if you remember a time when movies were fun, where you cheered at the screen, munched on popcorn and didn't have to worry about jaded pseudo-film critic friends making snide commentaries in an attempt to ruin your enjoyment; when you just enjoyed fun for fun's sake, then this movie is for you. If you love Cyborgs, laughs and excitement, this movie is not to be missed. I'll leave the rest up to you, pick up a copy &amp; defy Draculon today! You can thank me later. And don't forget to scream Manborg at the top of your lungs.","user":"ShamyClothStrikesBack","rank":[20,33]}]
