[{"title":"An Asylum movie","rating":1,"date":"29 July 2017","review":"Asylum movies like this one only exist to piggyback off the popularity of more popular movies and trick gift-givers into buying the wrong movie come Christmas. They take a big-budget movie, such as Christopher Nolan's \"Dunkirk\", which they know is coming out soon and churn out a movie with a kind of similar plot and a very similar name, but with horrible acting, atrocious writing etc. for near no money at all. It's nothing but a cynical, pseudo-plagiarist con. <br><br>Don't watch this joke, watch the real \"Dunkirk\" instead.","user":"Emma-M-V","rank":[180,181]},{"title":"Absolutely Unreal","rating":1,"date":"1 August 2017","review":"This is one of the worst WW2 movies I have ever seen and I have seen dozens. Totally unreal, the costumes/uniforms on both English and German sides were pathetic, as was the acting, as was the apparent unlimited ammunition and tactics. Bizarre is another word to describe it.<br><br>Not worth the time or money.","user":"maverell","rank":[75,75]},{"title":"Absolutely Terrible. Avoid like it's a nasty viral infection.","rating":3,"date":"3 August 2017","review":"the 'It's an Asylum movie' says it all. Thanks, Emma.<br><br>As she said, the Asylum company bank quite literally on rapidly releasing slapstick movies that piggyback on the big releases. Most big ticket movies have an associated asylum movies. This is no exception.<br><br>Not worth anyone's time. Don't help them make another one. Don't rent it.","user":"thehorsetowater","rank":[69,70]}]
