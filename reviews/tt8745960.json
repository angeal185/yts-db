[{"title":"I was expecting a boring movie considering the ridiculous low ratings from some ignorant reviewers.","rating":7,"date":"16 February 2020","review":"Rating this movie with the lowest score possible is just ridiculous. People should think a bit about it before rating movies, as a one star movie is just awful, almost unwatchable, and in this case Daniel Isn't Real is certainly watchable. I get it that not everybody will love it but just rate it honestly. If you like movies like Donnie Darko (2001) or Split (2016) you should enjoy this one as well. The other two mentioned are way better, no doubt about that, but Daniel Isn't Real has some good moments. The acting was good, really can't say anything bad about that even if I tried my best, the story is certainly entertaining to follow, the cinematography was way better than I expected it to be. Just do me a favor and rate your movies correctly, stop with those perfect tens for average movies, and certainly stop with insulting one star ratings for movies like this one.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[17,24]},{"title":"Like him (or not)","rating":8,"date":"31 October 2019","review":"The movie will fall or rise in your viewing experience (pleasure?), according to how you feel about the main actors/characters. They are quite despicable to a degree and you don't exactly know what is going on most of the time. The title gives us a clue, but there is so much more to it.<br><br>There is enough tension to fill the whole movie and you will care at least for some of the characters on display. Cleverly assembled and edited, this can be a favorite for some people while not reaching others at all. But that is what tastes are for - and movies are made for","user":"kosmasp","rank":[21,31]},{"title":"underrated psychological movie","rating":8,"date":"1 December 2019","review":"I accidentally come across this little gem.. Its psychological with horror element mix. About how we fight our own inner demons. Either we let the Demon take over ourselves or fight it till death..","user":"anwaralhussaini","rank":[13,18]}]
