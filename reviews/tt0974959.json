[{"title":"Doesn't live up to the American Pie name, except for the sex","rating":2,"date":"3 June 2009","review":"American Pie: Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes. On the other hand, it's porno that's a tad too soft-core to actually turn on any viewers. Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others just lame attempts at humor - with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness. The characters are barely even two-dimensional, most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile, and the \"important\" plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story.<br><br>In all fairness, I did not go into this movie without expectations. I liked the original three American Pie movies, and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were solid rentals. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, and so when I saw that some of the same characters were returning for Beta House, I was excited to see this installment. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in multiple forms. And I was fine with it, because in the past, these scenes were backed by the story and were well integrated into the plot. In Beta House, however, it's almost as if the writers forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked. They spent too much energy working in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story.<br><br>This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a one-dollar rental. The jokes are lame, the story is non-existent, and the porno-aspect is too tame if that's all you really care about seeing.","user":"BlinkFlame","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"Not worthy of the name","rating":3,"date":"6 December 2007","review":"Although it's an R rated movie, I really doubt that you'll really enjoy it unless you're a teenager<br><br>Why? Because there's no real plot, no character development,no funny jokes. <br><br>The only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity. Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks (pretty nice ones I might add) to feast your eyes on.<br><br>I really can't understand why this movie has the American Pie title since it's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them.<br><br>My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks, but you're too shy to rent/buy an erotic movie. <br><br>Gave it 1/10 for the 2 smiles i had in the entire movie and another 2/10 for the nice chicks","user":"isbasoiuvlad","rank":[121,191]},{"title":"\"Lion with small penis must compensate with mighty roar.\"","rating":7,"date":"6 December 2007","review":"I have to hand it to the creative team behind these \"American Pie\" movies. \"Direct To DVD\" typically is synonymous with cheap, incompetent film-making. Yet last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself thoroughly enjoying the DVD sequel \"The Naked Mile\". The filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy, yet funny little film. This year they offer up the followup, \"Beta House\". This is the honest truth, \"Beta House\" makes the first few \"American Pie\" movies look like \"The Little Mermaid\".<br><br>This is no holds barred, tasteless, laugh-out loud fun. Sure, the story is a bit thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. Within the first 10 minutes we're introduced to the all the main characters, the new supporting characters, get a handful of raunchy gags, meet the villains, and establish the general plot-line. With all that out of the way, the movie becomes a no-limits ride. The gags are a plenty, and they DID NOT hold back in this one. I'm talking male semen, urine, dildos, chicks-with-dicks, sex with sheep, female orgazim sprays, and plenty more. Not to mention the fact that not a minute goes by without boobs or a sex scene.<br><br>Returning from \"The Naked Mile\" are John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley, and Eugene Levy (in a similar supporting role as the last few films). The entire cast does fine work. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), in particular, has a great energy and screen presence. I predict good things for him. The film is also loaded with great movie references for those who keep their eyes open. By far the biggest laugh of the film for me was \"The Deerhunter\" parody. Classic.<br><br>The bottom line is, if you're a fan of the series, you'll feel right at home with \"Beta House\". It really pushes the limits of good taste, but in the end is pretty damn funny.","user":"Slickflix","rank":[73,121]}]
