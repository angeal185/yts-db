[{"title":"It is what it is","rating":6,"date":"5 March 2018","review":"Movie is by no means terrible, not great... But not syfy original bad.<br><br>Action scenes are pretty dope, kinda comedic at some points with the slow mo but they also use slow mo quite artistically. Character interactions are fine, sometimes humorous. Acting though isn't half bad, act pretty darn good. <br><br>If you're looking for a quick action movie with little plot and just tons of shooting then this is totally it. No regrets in watching it, even if it wasn't all that great.","user":"itsachriskimmel","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"I Was Rooting for the Drone","rating":1,"date":"17 March 2018","review":"Too many tough guy cliches. This is the kind of film where I want the heroes to die. I was rooting for the drones.","user":"tclark55","rank":[21,27]},{"title":"Battle Drone: A HUGE surprise","rating":8,"date":"30 March 2019","review":"Battle Drone, with a title like that you have to assume the worst right? Based on the cast and plot outline the film sounded like a rather run of the mill Scyfy Original type and I guess it is, but an oddly good one.<br><br>It tells the story of an elite mercenary team tasked with a mission in Chernobyl. Once they arrive however they come under attack from an unstoppable unknown force that pushes their skills to the limit.<br><br>I'm not a big action movie fan and Scyfy originals though charming are usually seven shades of awful so Battle Drone never really stood a chance. So why have I rated it so high?<br><br>The reason, well because it's suspiciously enjoyable. The cast are familiar faces who you'll likely recognize but not put a name to, they demonstrate why you remember them in the first place and are a bunch of decent character actors. The SFX are well above par, this is not your usual Scyfy Adobe Aftereffects ugliness. The plot is very enjoyable, the cinematography is stylish and it's just all put together nicely.<br><br>Sure this isn't even a B-Movie, it's C, it's made for television stuff but it shows what people with competence can do despite the little resources they have at their disposal.<br><br>I really enjoyed Battle Drone and can confidently say I'm shocked at that fact. The very definition of take your brain out entertainment, this was a lot of fun.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Stylish<br><br>Memorable moments<br><br>Competently made<br><br>Good soundtrack<br><br>Interesting characters<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Bit goofy a couple of times","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[11,13]}]
