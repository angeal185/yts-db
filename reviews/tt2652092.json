[{"title":"One of the few films that made me cry..... more than once.","rating":10,"date":"17 October 2014","review":"I literally just got home from the movie right now and this is the very first thing I do. Rate 10 and write this review.<br><br>The movie premiered today in my country, Cambodia. And guess how many people had show up??? 1. It was me.... Lol. I honestly sit the entire movie theatre alone. Yes, I am a horror films fan and that creep me out very much. However, this is the very good opportunity for me to enjoy the film alone without those annoying cinema's rat people. I can laugh, cry loudly without worrying nobody. My country's people is not a drama fan... They probably squeezing each other at the comedy's and action's section.<br><br>Oh right.... the film is a masterpiece. The storyline and scenery, the cast and everything about the film is just wonderful. It's like one of the most beautiful film I have ever seen since Blackswan. This film should win an Oscar just for its existing. The storyline was beautiful. And the fact that it is real made me cry even more. At the beginning of the film it was so so touching and sad, and then it made me laugh somewhere in the middle, and it ended with me crying like a baby alone in the theatre. Like literally. The cast performance is wonderful. They should probably need to win some awards or i'll hate everyone.<br><br>The film ended, and I walk out alone from the entire theatre, with red eyes, tear all over my face and every single cinema's employees stare at me like what wrong with this guy LOL. And I drove home thinking about the movie and cry some more. And yes, just like after Blackswan, it took me at least a few hours for me to recover from the film's effects.","user":"Unemployedartist","rank":[84,102]},{"title":"Great film, trailer misguiding","rating":10,"date":"8 September 2014","review":"The Good Lie, it's a great movie about humanity and values. It's not a documentary about the civil war in Sudan. The trailer is very misguiding, letting the viewer thinking of a cliché' comedy which is not. Nor it's an informative guide about the who and why of a civil war. What I've found interesting, listening to the Q&amp;A at the Tiff, is that the writer took ten years to build this story mixing the life real event of few Sudanese refugees. During the first part of the movie, I was expecting more blood, more extreme violence. But then, the more the movie was going, the more I understood that skipping graphic brutality was a choice, and the whole product was becoming more poetic at moments without losing that neorealism characteristic of Philippe Falardeau's work. At times, I felt like when I was watching for the first time Benigni's \"Life is Beautiful\" or the work of a modern De Sica. Acting wise, Whiterspoon's work is great in this movie, realistic and never overwhelming and so Corey Stoll does a great job.<br><br>But I was greatly pleased with the excellent performance of Arnold Oceng, all the Sudanese actors in the movie, all former refugees, and the stunning newbie Kuoth Wiel.<br><br>Overall, I'd suggest to bring your preteens to watch this movie: it would set an example on how family and value should never be forgotten no matter how hard life gets.<br><br>Thank you.","user":"sanderllc","rank":[63,78]},{"title":"heartwarming, engaging and inspiring","rating":9,"date":"8 September 2014","review":"A beautiful movie, taken out of the pages of recent events. The inspiring and true story of the \"The Lost Boys\" trekking hundreds of miles across Africa to save their lives. The photography of the African scenes is great. A story of dedication, loyalty and the deepest meaning of family and friendship. It is well acted, engaging, and funny as well as surprising. While dancing at the edge of some clichés, it manages to stay fresh. The ending really took me by surprise. Sadly the movie is still very relevant. There is a continuing genocide in Sudan and part of the intent of the movie is to raise awareness about what is happening right now, it is succeeds in doing that, it will have done what few movies do: it might save lives.","user":"lieblingm","rank":[53,67]}]
