[{"title":"One of the worst NZ films, ever!","rating":1,"date":"28 December 2019","review":"Bad acting, incredibly miscast, unrealistic characters and scenarios, chauvinistic archetypes with borderline sexual assault and coercion themes, pointless story that seemed like a bunch of middle aged mates desperately trying to relive their 20s through a movie.","user":"OpinionatedKiwi","rank":[3,3]}]
