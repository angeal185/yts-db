It's very funny and the writing is super clever and unpredictable. Ed Asner is remarkable...if anything, he is getting better with age. He was so freaking funny and his facial expressions were hysterical! Sean Young rarely gets cast in a comedy, which makes it all the more fun to see a completely different side of her as billionaire Asner's scheming third wife. But who isn't scheming here? The only question is who will come out on top! The writing and the acting put this one a big cut above other low-budget comedies.","user":"meezerfan123","rank":[6,15]},{"title":"Wow Bad","rating":1,"date":"30 March 2020","review":"Ever notice that all these actors from back in the day turn out to be socialists in their old age. Same with news reporters. Makes you wonder if McCarthy wasnt right.<br><br>Anyway socialist Answer stumbles through his role. I watched it to see what Sean looks like and if she's still taking her meds. She's lost her looks. And Ansner can barely speak. In truth he looks like a puppet.\nThe film is really bad. And sad to watch.<br><br><br><br>The writing is horrible.","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[3,6]}]
