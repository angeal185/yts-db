[{"title":"Refreshingly satisfying.","rating":10,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"In the case of COLD BROOK, home is where we find our peace, and the proverbial \"heart\" dwells at home, in nature, and among friends. At least, that's the message I got from this precious gem of a film.<br><br>When two co-workers discover a lost soul, it is in helping the stranger that they unearth their rooted humanity, despite dire consequences.<br><br>Scenes of a tentative marriage are revealed, but when the stakes become searingly present at a do-or-die moment, trust and united strength prevail.<br><br>Some sympathy is evoked for the antagonist, a security guard who takes his job a bit too seriously (think wannabe cop) over his actual duties of keeping \"do not touch\" and visitor closing times, per art museum rules and regulations. When his albeit imagined authority is of no consideration, after an actual violation occurs, I couldn't help but think, \"aww, poor thing.\"<br><br>The direction is clear, the actors are exquisite, and the photography is idyllic; above all, the story engagingly unfolds without beating us over the head with a lot of flash and noise.","user":"mcewen88","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Feel Good Movie","rating":7,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"Slow start but hang in there,worth the watch,you'll be glad you did","user":"wanderer15701","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"2 great love stories!","rating":10,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"I saw this movie at the Woodstock Film Festival and it was the BEST movie there and Best movie I have seen all year!\nWilliam Fichtner did an amazing job on both sides of the camera and Kym Coates and he work together so well!\nA truly heart warming story that everyone in the family will enjoy!","user":"micky993-584-301146","rank":[23,36]}]
