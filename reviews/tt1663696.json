[{"title":"Torturous to watch","rating":1,"date":"11 April 2014","review":"It is ironic that Torture Chamber contains the word I felt most in tune  with while viewing  torture. The new horror film from writer/director  Dante Tomaselli (Satan's Playground) was so bad it was torturous to  watch through 93 minutes.   The film opens with our introduction to 13-year-old Jimmy (Carmen  LoPorto). For reasons to be explained later, Jimmy's first appearance  on screen has him bound in an animal cage. His face appears burned and  scared making his blue eyes all that more piercing and ominous. A  Catholic priest is present but Jimmy is possessed by an extreme evil  and his powers lead to his escape. Jimmy then recruits an army of  children who follow his instruction on a murderous rampage on teachers,  doctors.just about anyone who ever looked at Jimmy in his past. The  victims are dragged to an abandoned hideout where they are tortured  until death.   The above synopsis may sound like a film full of fun, blood and satanic  overtones, but Torture Chamber is handled so ineptly that you can't  help but think that being a victim of Jimmy would be less painful than  trying to squeeze any drip of entertainment value out of Tomaselli's  effort.   Most of the faults can be found in the screenplay and the unmotivated  actors that were hired to play out Tomasell's script. None of the cast  comes out smelling like roses but its Soprano's star Vincent Pastore  who has the most egg on his face as Dr. Fiore. The actor says his lines  as if he was acting in a high school play without the benefit of a  rehearsal. Most of his dialogue sounded as if he was just winging it   forced and awkward. It's been a long time since I have been embarrassed  for an actor involved with a paying project, but poor Pastore was in my  prayers after screening.   When it comes to the horror genre, you can sometimes mask bad acting, a  bad script and any misdirection if you have the gore to help you  overlook the faults. Not here. Torture Chamber's gore is ridiculously  bad. Hardly any blood. Hardly any ingenuity when it comes to the ritual  killings. Hardly any fun.   All this makes Torture Chamber one of the worst films of the year. A  zero out of five stars. That's not to say that we won't have interest  to see Tomaselli's next effort, but this one needs to be put in a  plastic bag with spray paint fumes and burned.","user":"gregsrants","rank":[44,55]},{"title":"Torture Chamber: Worse than I even feared","rating":2,"date":"5 November 2017","review":"With a title like Torture Chamber I assumed this was a torture porn effort but it's something even worse.<br><br>Torture Chamber tells the fragmented story of a horribly burnt child who his mother claims is pure evil.

Even if you feel tempted. I suggest you don't. You will be disappointed","rating":1,"date":"16 September 2014","review":"To begin with I will say that I have never written a movie review in my life but I made an account here just to warn others of the 'horrors' they are about to see - mind the pun.<br><br>Upon reading the description for this film I thought it would be a great horror movie to watch. What I got was in fact a movie that was horrible to watch. <br><br>From the terrible dialogue to the ridiculous title (for the movie).Also, I'm pretty sure I could get a group of my mates together and we could play out some scenes with better acting than the lot they hired for this film. With no acting experience at all. Dead set horrible.<br><br>This movie was made in 2013 and I'm sure directors could have made a better horror film in the 70's. The special effects were off putting enough for me to turn it off but since I payed $5 to see this I thought I may as well watch it. I just wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this movie. I do not have a clue how this movie can have a rating of 4.1/10. I don't even know how it made it to DVD in the first place. To anyone wanting to watch this movie - Just don't it may sound tempting but it is really not worth an hour and a half of your life. <br><br>All in all this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and anyone who says it is even half decent is more than likely involved in the production or is one of the actors in this movie.","user":"drunken_wombat7","rank":[18,24]}]
