[{"title":"funny flick","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2006","review":"This was humorous, entertaining, and refreshingly new in its Scooby tradition. The names are interesting, the mystery keeps you going, and the only complaint I had was that it was relatively easy to figure out.<br><br>There were a lot of elements to the story and it is well drawn. It is a good pick if you like the newer stories, and the voices are well done as well as the graphics and sound. <br><br>The kids and I laughed over the names, \"Tikki Hikki Wikki\" and had a great time with this one! Like many other scooby stories, it was sort of educational for the kids on old mythology as well.<br><br>We recommend this one!","user":"kristin_electra","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"I liked this a lot!","rating":7,"date":"10 July 2005","review":"Since Warners revamped the Scooby-Doo franchise in 1998, feature length mysteries have been inconsistent. The first few had real monsters, with no rubber masks, but far too many disgustingly PC mommies in America complained and the Brothers Warner folded and went back to the \"guy in a suit to scare away the locals\" stories. A shame.<br><br>What a surprise then that Scooby's latest adventure is actually quite good, despite its PC shortcomings. This time around the Mystery Inc. gang are in Hawaii, catching some rays and relaxation. Typically, this is the exact moment the local volcano starts brewing over and a big monster called the Wiki-Tiki rears its ugly head, scaring away all of the surfers from the Hunahana resort and kidnapping a local babe. If you are incredibly sad, like me, you will realise this is too much like the 1970 episode, A Tiki Scare Is No Fair.<br><br>The usual long list of suspects includes a sleazy real estate agent, an ambitious mayor and an eccentric holiday rep (Adam West). And just as soon as their mystery-solving begins, the real culprit is immediately noticeable. It's a poorly written whodunit, but what saves it are crazy set pieces and a varied atmosphere, which keep the mystery interesting, if obvious. Or, at least, obvious to a 24-year-old. It may well come as a surprise to an eight-year-old.<br><br>Locations, such as the beach, the deep jungle, the catacombs and Auntie Mahina's cabin, are beautifully animated. The best thing about the modern Scooby is that production values are a zillion times what the original 1969 series was. Aloha, Scooby-Doo looks incredibly slick and the eye-popping colour schemes would keep you interested no matter how poor the mystery was.<br><br>One could accuse the film of being slightly xenophobic and somewhat stereotypical in regards to its Hawaiian setting. But it's no worse than the unrealistic Scotland seen in last year's Scooby-Doo And The Loch Ness Monster.<br><br>I was also surprised at how little of it actually relies on Scooby (voiced by Frank Welker, who also does Fred). He barely gets a chance to do his thang. Most of the laughs come from the rest of the gang. But, as it is, Aloha, Scooby-Doo is still loads of fun and proves that while the story quality of modern Scoobys remains inconsistent, the animation just gets better and better.","user":"CuriosityKilledShawn","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Falls Flat.","rating":5,"date":"17 April 2015","review":"Daphne gets a great opportunity in Hawaii. Unfortunately for her and the gang, that opportunity might be thwarted by Tiki demons. I'll watch anything Scooby related. I'm a kid at heart, and I've always loved Scooby Doo. The villains are always predictable, but it's Scooby, so I'm able to put it aside. Sadly, this movie is pretty average for Scooby's standards. Maybe it was the Hawaii setting, or perhaps it was that it lacks the entertainment and laughs that I'm used to. The Tiki's aren't very threatening. Watching the Tiki on a big surfboard wasn't very suspenseful, nor was it that entertaining. Even the gags aren't that great in this one. Scooby and Shaggy's antics usually save it, but not this time. Some Scooby fans may feel differently, but I didn't care for it.<br><br>5.2/10","user":"callanvass","rank":[2,2]}]
