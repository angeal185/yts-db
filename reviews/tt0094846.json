[{"title":"Pleasant, light entertainment","rating":30,"date":"30 November 2001","review":"Movies like this never win awards, never top lists, are never hot topics around the water cooler (do people ever have powwows around water coolers in real life?).  This is the kind of movie critics like to cite as evidence of the decline of Western Civilization, because they make easy targets:  they don't change lives, and they have few defenders.  But, leaving aside Western Civilization for a moment, I want to say a word for the underdog.  I watched the tape today, and was struck again by my happy mood after watching it. The story is featherweight, the acting likable if sitcom-ish, and the ending is as sweet as you could ask.  Andrew Dice Clay's performance is indeed surprisingly good, and the occasional forays into real dialogue about \"the mating game\" touch on real issues.  \"Casual Sex?\" won't change your life, but it's a pleasant way to spend a few hours.  If you care what the snobs think, just don't tell them.","user":"budikavlan","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Cute, sexy, and Andrew Dice Clay actually being FUNNY!","rating":20,"date":"20 February 2003","review":"This Woody Allen-esque exploration of sex through the eyes of two female friends (Lea Thompson and Victoria Jackson) is a pretty entertaining little sleeper.  The two discuss their sexual experiences, past relationships and societal attitudes, each taking turns talking to the audience.  Eventually they travel to a spa where they encounter lust, rejection, love and, of course, sex, sex and more sex.  Andrew Dice Clay actually turns in a great comic performance as an obnoxious spa patron who has the hots for Thompson, and Mary Gross adds a few laughs with her usual soft-spoken schtick. Jackson is cute, though a tad wooden, but Thompson's performance is right on the mark.  As an added bonus, the two venture to a nude beach in one scene, so we get a nice long look at their bare bottoms (Jackson's cute buns make two extra appearances as well).  Overall, there's really not much here, but what there is is pretty entertaining, and worth the price of a rental.","user":"squeezebox","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"When sex is anything BUT casual!","rating":25,"date":"25 July 2003","review":"Near the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, Stacy (Lea Thompson) and Melissa (Victoria Jackson) plan a vacation at a health spa to find a \"safe\" guy to date and/or marry.  Stacy has, as they say, \"been around\"; Melissa is more of a novice in the world of men.  Right away, they run into obnoxious Vinny, who displeases them both and makes them doubt if they are going about things the right way.  Things improve. In between classes of exercise, Stacy hooks up with Nick, a spa employee who sings at the social gatherings.  Melissa, too, earns the attention of good guy Jamie, a massage therapist.  Will there be any obstacles on the path to true love?  Of course!<br><br>This is a genuinely funny movie about sex, told from a woman's viewpoint. There are some great speeches about the mysterious ways of men and women, offered by Stacy and Melissa.  Scenes at the spa are both entertaining and lovely to look upon.  Then, too, Andrew Dice Clay, as Vinny, gives a performance that sizzles and surprises with its ever-growing sincerity.  Viewers who think they've seen every decent romantic comedy will have missed something special if they pass this one by. Hopefully, video stores and libraries will still have a copy of this nice film in stock.","user":"inkblot11","rank":[17,21]}]
