[{"title":"Enjoyable Christmas movie for families.","rating":9,"date":"9 December 2018","review":"My 11 year old daughter and I watched it together. She loved it. I enjoyed it too. It can be hard to find films that families can watch together and all like. This film accomplishes that goal. It is cute and funny.","user":"dlcwm","rank":[61,65]},{"title":"Kids review","rating":10,"date":"7 December 2018","review":"1. 13 yo= I like it, it has a good story line.

And it doesn't get sappy until the end, after a few hours of funniness. I think the filmmakers did a good job of making it something that literally the whole family can watch. There are jokes for kids, and jokes for adults that kids wouldn't get (not dirty or anything). Like a joke about Clark Gable that would make anyone over 40 laugh, but little kids would go \"huh?\"<br><br>Mainly, the cast is uniformly good throughout. A few unknown actors, and a lot of actors where you go \"Oh, I've seen them before.\" It's nice to see them getting to shine.","user":"VanceFan","rank":[68,73]}]
