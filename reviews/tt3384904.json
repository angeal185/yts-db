[{"title":"Apocalypse brain damage","rating":23,"date":"23 February 2014","review":"Oh My God I have seen some bad films in my 65 years of life, but this has to be the worst I have ever encountered. The acting was so wooden and the dialogue is brain damaging indeed. It is like been written by a ten year old kid and then directed by his ten year old friend. Why oh why spend money on making such crap I will never know. It feels like the two ten year olds woke up one morning and said let's make a disaster movie. No joke folks. The directors name is now embedded in my mind and I will for a while avoid anything directed by him. I feel like grabbing the writers, directors and producer by the neck and shaking them. Please please please do not bother with this crap. I actually forced myself to watch the first 25 minutes thinking that it cannot get any worse and it has to improve. Guess what? It got steadily worse until my brain screamed at me to stop watching.","user":"wnourallah","rank":[62,77]},{"title":"Ouch !!","rating":1,"date":"25 February 2014","review":"I just created an account to make sure no one else watches this movie. Anyone involved in the creation of this failtrocity, from the director to the catering company, should feel ashamed. I'm ashamed that I've watched the whole thing. The \"special effects\" are awful, the acting is horrendous, the story plot is inexistent, overall I have absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. After the movie I had to look at my calendar to make sure we were still in 2014. With all the technologies available nowadays, I was hoping that at least the lava and the explosions would somewhat look real and cool, but this was not the case at all. Poking your eyes with a fork for 86 minutes will bring you greater entertainment than watching this movie.

No development of the characters at all. Imagine volcano fumes that on one hand kill by-passers on the spot, but on the other hand are stopped by a glass&amp;lead door. Imagine parents who take their daughter to a bus-trip to a volcano mountain, that is obviously waking up. Imagine all sorts of ridiculous things, e.g. a man going to a sort of job interview, coincidentally having with him 2 satellite telephones... Last but not least, imagine few busty slim cute chicks running away from a disastrous hot gases etc. And that would be the summon of evil of this movie :)","user":"k-eijeriks","rank":[41,50]}]
