[{"title":"A tight no-nonsense thriller with excellent acting","rating":10,"date":"22 May 2018","review":"Raazi does what very few Bollywood movies do right. It pulls off a tight script with good acting, and a realistic believable storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat for two hours. The film also manages to maintain a tight pace while building up towards an impactful climax. In particular, I think three things made it unforgettable: <br><br>Firstly, the acting was on point, and made the movie what it turned out to be. Alia Bhatt is turning out to be an absolute genius, and has come a long way from her 'student of the year' days. There are very few in her peer-group that can do justice to these kinds of roles. Vicky Kaushal was good as the beguiled husband, and his restrained yet emotional male character (supporting a powerful female lead) is a Bollywood rarity, and was thoroughly enjoyable. The others are on point too, with minor actors like Jaideep Ahlawat and Rajit Kapoor delivering strong performances. <br><br>Secondly, the movie turned out to be tight and on point, with no melodramatic displays of emotion or sappy songs. The good old premises of a bride departing to her husband's household for (presumably) good, the arranged marriage with a virtually unknown man, and eventual marriage consummation were all present, in theory. These are all typically perfect opportunities to inject unnecessary bridal parting songs, lengthy wedding song and dance sequences (boy's side, girl's side, etc.) and the worst of all - a song balancing sleaze with \"Indian culture\" (read: censor board mandated restraint) that plays when the marriage is consummated (this is typically a couple kissing and rolling around in a bed, carefully clothing their privates with velvet or satin sheets). But Raazi eliminates all of this fluff and more, leaving you wishing more movies would do away with the crap in favor of keeping the pace of the plot. <br><br>Lastly, and most importantly, Raazi does justice to the complexity of the India-Pakistan conflict. The countries have a shared history which makes the war painfully more unique (e.g. Abdul, the oldest and most faithful caretaker in the Pakistani household is of Indian origin). The movie takes no sides, and shows you that humanity and ruthlessness exist on both sides. This is a significant departure from the patriotic films of yesteryear - we are habituated to seeing a good vs evil theme, and having Pakistanis depicted as soulless warmongers. And so, you are simply not prepared to empathize with Iqbal's (Vicky Kaushal's) gentle persona, and when you do, it his vulnerable humanity hits you like a truck. Conversely, the hardened Indian intelligence agent Mir is many things during the movie, but 'human' he is not. <br><br>I walked away from the theater understanding better the nature of such wars, and that the real conflict is not over Kashmir, or between two sides, or between ideologies. The real conflict is always fought within the human heart: between the ruthless imperatives of duty, and the very human urges of gentleness, mercy and love.","user":"bharaths-435-14892","rank":[79,92]},{"title":"The director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat's shoes......top notch acting n direction.","rating":9,"date":"17 May 2018","review":"This is how Indian movies shud be made without the usual bollywood nonsense. \nSet during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the film concerns an Indian female spy Sehmat married to a Pakistani military man. I haven't read the book but I still thoroughly enjoyed this film.\nThe director did a masterful technique of placing the audience in Sehmat's shoes, the audience is privy to the information as she receives n passes on to the Intelligence bureau. Alia Bhatt as Sehmat did a terrific job n Vicky Kaushal as her husband was an icing on the cake. The scene of the marriage consummation is aptly placed.\nI am really surprised n happy that for the first time Bollywood hasn't demonized enemy soldiers.\nIt is a slow burner, this is neither an Akshay/Salman/Sunny Deol movie.\nThere are no action sequences or intense shootouts. Most of the film is shot in the house.\nThis is entirely unglamorous, but the film does have an underlying tension n relies on the impending sense of dread which hangs over Sehmat's entire investigation.\nTher r two scenes wher Sehmat is almost exposed n the reaction n facial expression of Alia during those two scenes were amazing.\nMy only cribbing is why on earth the servant has to run or keep on running rather than alarm other people. Nevertheless a very solid n different Indian spy thriller.\nHappy Ramadan. Fasting is anti cancer.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[49,62]},{"title":"Brutal all the way! Bollywood at its best.","rating":10,"date":"24 July 2018","review":"A great movie! What's surprising is, Raazi doesn't dwell into traditional bollywood subplots. It doesn't have any dance numbers, nor does it have any melodramatic romance. It stays true to what it sets out to do right from the beginning. The lead actor Alia Bhatt manages to get into skin of the character so comfortably that you forget that you are watching a movie, instead you feel the pain she is emoting. <br><br>What is brilliant about the film is that you keep expecting that every scene is leading you to a traditional Indo-Pak friendship kind of an ending with a stong social message. But what astonishes here is that the movie manages to remain a BRUTAL story of spy carrying out its mission through out. An out and out hardcore spy thriller with a women protagonist, so beautifully crafted that you are left spellbound. <br><br>Meghna Gulzar captures the simplicity of characters with so much depth that you are bound to sympathize with every character. Take a bow!<br><br>All actors are at par. Direction is superb. Camera work is crisp. Background score is perfect. This movie is a gem.","user":"gbhuvnesh","rank":[21,27]}]
