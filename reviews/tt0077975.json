[{"title":"Often imitated, never duplicated.","rating":10,"date":"25 May 1999","review":"You'll have to excuse me and some of the other proponents of 'National Lampoon's Animal House' if we seem a little defensive about the movie. That's because it's often not recognized as the superior comedy classic that it is.  Instead, too often it is lumped in with the multitude of inferior films that it inspired, which is totally unfair.<br><br>Some of the conventional wisdom about 'Animal House' is absolutely right, though. John Belushi does give a bravura performance that is reminiscent of the great comics before him like Chaplin, Keaton (Buster, not Michael), the Marx Brothers, etc., and he does it with a wonderful economy of words. His character of \"Bluto\" Blutarsky is often emulated and imitated but many times the persons doing so have no idea what it was that made him and his performance so great.<br><br>Tim Matheson as \"Otter\" and his other frat house buddies were also prototypes that were much imitated too, and again often without success. Otter was the quintessential smooth talker, always working an angle on everybody, especially the ladies. When a woman tells him that his lovemaking wasn't that great, he cocks his head, points a finger at himself and mouths the words, \"not great?\" in mock disbelief. Before Tom Hanks got \"Big\" he made a career out of playing this character. Also John Vernon set a standard for straight men with his portrayal of the beleaguered Dean Wormer, plagued by his \"zoo fraternity.\"<br><br>Not all of the movie's humor aims low, by any means; some of it is quite sophisticated. (Yes, you read it right.) The screenwriters and director John Landis did a great job evoking Kennedy-era America and they found a lot to laugh at. This comedy is an unqualified classic by the simplest definition-- it makes you laugh, long and loud.","user":"Hermit C-2","rank":[141,170]},{"title":"What started it all- and still the best","rating":10,"date":"3 June 2000","review":"This is the best college comedy ever made. Nothing has ever come close to comedic perfection, and never will again. The early bird director John Landis directs this film into greatness bringing stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, Tom Hulce, Mark Metcalf and Donald Sutherland to the screen in brilliance. True, this film is just about a bunch of misfits defying authority in a campus of 1962, but that's what makes it so good, and original. Belushi, Metcalf, and others bring many of the laughs here, but it is mainly it's reputation that brings this film into hilarity. A landmark in cinema comedy. By the way, screenwriters Harold Ramis and Chris Miller originally were going to make this a film about Charles Manson called Laser Orgy Girls, so thank god Douglas Kenney came in and straightened this out to the right part.","user":"Quinoa1984","rank":[97,124]},{"title":"Maybe Can't Really Be Appreciated Anymore","rating":11,"date":"11 November 2002","review":"If you have only seen this movie on TV, you have not really seen this movie. One of the best movie experiences of my life was seeing this movie in the theater with a full house of college students.  I have never heard an audience laugh so hard, and I was laughing with them.  That experience can never be recaptured.  I don't know why this movie doesn't make the midnight movie tour in college towns.  That way it might have some of the same impact.  Also when it came out in 1978 it is hard to explain how big John Belushi was unless you were there and saw it first hand.  It's still funny on the small screen, but only if you see it uncut.  Never watch it on a network, they cut out most of the jokes!","user":"pattersonsmith","rank":[75,100]}]
