[{"title":"A blaxploitation classic! Possibly Pam Grier's best movie.","rating":5,"date":"5 March 2003","review":"Pam Grier made many movies in the 1970s, but 'Coffy' as much as anything, is the one role on which her reputation as the Queen of blaxploitation rests. After a bit part in a Russ Meyer movie (his classic 'Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls'), Jack Hill, former Roger Corman protege and director of the creepy cult favourite 'Spider Baby', \"discovered\" her and gave her two strong roles in his popular chicks-in-chains movies 'The Big Doll House' and 'The Big Bird Cage'. Then Hill wrote and directed 'Coffy', a hugely entertaining revenge thriller that really showcases Pam Grier's talent and charisma to the max. The movie was hugely successful and made Grier an exploitation superstar. Instead of a female James Bond character like Cleopatra Jones, Hill made Coffy a regular working class black woman (a nurse as a matter of fact), who must use her brains and looks to achieve her goal - revenge for the drug addiction of her kid sister. The movie crosses elements seen in the male blaxploitation classics of the period like 'Superfly' and 'Shaft' with the vigilante genre which would really kick off with the success of 'Death Wish' the following year (yup, 'Coffy' PREDATES 'Death Wish', so let's get that straight). Grier is sensational in this movie. She can act, she's tough, she pulls off the action scenes with credibility, and of course she looks great, and there is a fair bit of nudity. Grier went on to movies like 'The Arena', 'Sheba, Baby' and 'Drum' before the blaxploitation boom burst, but it's a pity that she only made one more movie with Jack Hill ('Foxy Brown') because they were a dynamite team bringing out the best in each other. 'Coffy' has some interesting supporting cast members including Allan Arbus (best know to fans of TV's 'M.A.S.H.') as Mob boss Vitroni, future 'Robocop' actor Robert DoQui as flamboyant pimp King George, and the brilliant Sid Haig as the sleazy Omar. Haig was a regular Grier co-star throughout the 1970s and Jack Hill's favourite actor ever since his breakthrough role in 'Spider Baby'. If you really want to understand why so many movie buffs from Quentin Tarantino on down worship Pam Grier then 'Coffy' is THE movie to watch. Arguably her best movie, it's a blaxploitation classic and still great viewing thirty years later! Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in 1970s exploitation or crime movies.","user":"Infofreak","rank":[42,44]},{"title":"Pam Brier is a sensation!","rating":8,"date":"8 October 2003","review":"By 1973 AIP had struck paydirt many times over with Black Caesar and its sequel, the two Slaughter films, several black/horror hybrids like Blacula, and of course the jungle prison sleazies, and now their first black superchick flick Coffy went into production.  Jack Hill (The Big Doll House, The Big Bird Cage) was at the helm again, along with the tried-and-tested formula of Pam Grier and Sid Haig.  Coffy is a nurse by day and avenging angel at night, tracking down the dealers who got her sister hooked on the Big H. She opens the film blowing the head off a dealer with a shotgun, then follows the trail of dead bodies to a bald hood named Omar and her crooked politician boyfriend, who she shoots in the balls.  \"Revenge is a virtue\", the soundtrack blares; critics applauded the liberated ballsy lead character while decrying the level of sex and sadism.  As revenge actioners go, Coffy don't come better.  Grier in her first lead role is a sensation.  Little wonder Tarantino tailor-made a film for her.","user":"El-Stumpo","rank":[22,24]},{"title":"the best Pam Grier movie!","rating":12,"date":"12 December 2002","review":"if you've always wondered what was so great about Pam Grier, and haven't seen any of her movies from the seventies, look no further than Coffy. Coffy has it all, violence, pimps, drugs, nudity, sex, and it's served up with some severe camp and crazy dialogue.  what sets this movie apart from other blaxploitaion movies is the excellent story and powerful performance of Miss Grier.  I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off, and despite the low budget ambiance and feeling the movie took about a couple of weeks to make, Grier gives a performance worthy of her cult reverence.<br><br>the movie is a typical revenge story, with a not so typical hero-a black woman.  Coffy's sister is hooked on smack and Coffy vows to herself to destroy the people responsible.  Coffy works as a nurse by day, and prowls the clubs by night looking for the pusher who destroyed her sister's mind with drugs.  Her search leads her to a pimp, a mobster, the cops, and a politician.  In the end, she takes care of them all using her brains as well as her body, and damn do she have a body!  Pam Grier makes this movie believable despite the obvious flaws of the low budget production.  Her character never shows the weak side of femininity and fall into the ethos that women are at some point weaker than men.  Coffy never breaks down to cry for help, waiting for a man or anyone else to help her-she does it all on her own.  she kicks ass all over, and no other movie has done that with a female character, at least not anything credible.  Coffy makes Thelma and Louise look like Laverne and Shirley.<br><br>Pam went on to make more movies of this ilk, but none were as popular nor as good as Coffy.   what about Foxy Brown you ask?  despite a better title, it doesn't compare to Coffy in either performance or content.  Coffy served to bring Pam Grier into the main stream, as much as any black actress could be, and make her a star.  all i can say is, thank you Quentin Tarentino for making Jackie Brown and proving her power and presence as an actress.  See this movie, then see Jackie Brown,  you'll see why Tarentino made it.","user":"batzu","rank":[22,24]}]
