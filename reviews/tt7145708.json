[{"title":"Fun indie comedy","rating":8,"date":"28 January 2020","review":"As someone that's worked in small start-ups, I definitely get where this film is coming from. I found it quite funny and pretty true-to-form.","user":"bpinchuk","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"A fantastic, lighthearted movie","rating":10,"date":"28 January 2020","review":"It's rare to watch a movie that keeps you smiling, but Appiness delivers on that front.\nThis is a creative, quirky and cute take on our technology-driven society and our strange social dynamics, and all the characters are truly relatable.\nStrong acting, punchy writing, and the pacing was just right.\nWell done!!","user":"ericengels","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Couldn't get past the first minutes!","rating":2,"date":"29 January 2020","review":"Am I missing something here? This film starts off so bad , like a badly acted children's movie, it just didn't make me want to waste any more time with it! I apologise if it got better but I rate a movie by the opening stanzas - if they are bad I don't hold much hope for the rest of the movie!","user":"tocanepauli","rank":[4,6]}]
