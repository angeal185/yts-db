[{"title":"This is not a good movie","rating":2,"date":"20 May 2013","review":"You know how sometimes you are watching a movie and you are wondering, how did someone involved with the production not see that there are significant shortcomings. This is one such movie. The cast isn't all bad, Elliott Gould is excellent of course, Lainie Kazan has seen better days, Nadia Bjorlin has something weird going on with her eyes (apparently she is from Days of our Lives), Maeve Quinlan and Robin Riker (both from The Bold and The Beautiful according to IMDb) look and act like soapie actors.<br><br>Jonathan Bennett in the lead as Michael is all over the place. Andrea Bowen (Julie from Desperate Housewives) is quite good, and Keith Robinson as Michael's best friend is probably the best in the movie. The wonderful Richard Kind has a very small but good part. I should mention Jamie-Lynn Sigler, she is very good, but her character is not likable, and the presentation she is giving early in the movie in a college lecture room is ridiculously banal. Embarrassingly so.<br><br>Stuff just doesn't make sense, the internal logic (even for a rom-com, and we like rom-coms) is in tatters, and the script is very poor indeed. On the plus side, the movie is well shot - at least it looks professional.<br><br>But, it just isn't any good. I can only give it 2/10.","user":"cliff314","rank":[24,39]},{"title":"Remake of Tollywood Movie (INDIA)","rating":10,"date":"10 March 2015","review":"This move was already released in India in the year 1997 here is the link. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS933AdoREE.<br><br>But this is very good movie which explains about the Indian culture, where divorce after marriage is not possible. This also explains about how much importance and impossible to break the bond once you are married.<br><br>But you can still understand this movie without subtitles in Indian language. In India this is a dramatic movie. feel good. I was a child when i watched this movie in the Indian theater. The director is from India and he always takes the family oriented movies. I really love this director movies","user":"manchala1023","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Good romantic comedy","rating":8,"date":"26 May 2013","review":"The movie has good romantic comedy and sentiment. I liked the movie very much. The story is closer to everyone's life after few years of married life. We should encourage upcoming actors with the best stories like this. everyone acted very well. I recommend to watch the movie. Jonathan Bennett, Nadia Bjorlin acted very well. I liked Jamie-Lynn Sigler acting also. Only thing I didn't like is the college time love story. The characters replaced with someone else. They would have taken with same actors. They look same age, not much age difference with current age but replaced with different people which I felt little weird. I don't see in many theaters but my feeling is it should run in more theaters.","user":"qaz-ram","rank":[21,40]}]
