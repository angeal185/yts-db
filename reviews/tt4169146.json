[{"title":"A Day in the Life of....","rating":2,"date":"12 September 2019","review":"Looking at all of the positive reviews, I feel mean to dislike this movie. It is about different kinds of people helping different kinds of people, and that's nice. But that alone does not a good movie make.<br><br>It's the sort of movie where you have a song every once in a while, by Russian senior citizens, or a disabled guy, or some young black men, or an aspiring opera singer. It feels very unscripted, with a lot of repetition of dialog by non-professional actors.<br><br>The movie was reasonably cohesive through the road trip, but then the movie goes on and on and on. Watch these people open a jar of sauerkraut for several minutes. Watch these guys move a couch for several minutes. And so on.<br><br>On the very positive side, Lauren Spencer as the young woman was excellent.","user":"reidandgenene","rank":[31,45]},{"title":"At your service!","rating":7,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"Vic is of Russian origin and a medical transport driver in Milwaukee. A tiny problem: he is excessively adorable! He wants to please everyone and he is desperately unable to say 'no' even when it's the only correct answer. So, as riots erupt in the city, his day will quickly become nightmarish.<br><br>The actors <a href=\"/name/nm10129349/\">Lauren 'Lolo' Spencer</a> (Tracy), <a href=\"/name/nm10288838/\">Chris Galust</a> (Vic) and <a href=\"/name/nm6244217/\">Maxim Stoyanov</a> (Dima) are unknown (from me at least) but excellent. The director <a href=\"/name/nm1699715/\">Kirill Mikhanovsky</a> shows a deeply moving humanism with regard to these outcasts. An excellent Russian-American surprise!","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[19,29]},{"title":"An all-satisfying film about the struggle to survive and remain human in the USA","rating":16,"date":"16 August 2019","review":"This film is about listening to your own voice, your conscience, to remain human. Shot with a dynamic documentary camera and authentic, but non-professional actors, it has a feeling of hyper realism, even though it is a fiction film. It might be overwhelming to watch it till the end, as there are a lot of characters and storylines, but isn't it America in it's essence - the land of immigrants, who have to work hard to reach the American dream? In this day and night struggle you might be in denial about your roots, but you're always free to choose your own destiny.","user":"svishchenkov","rank":[13,22]}]
