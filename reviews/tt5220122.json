She just had to call Grandma afterward to tell her all about it.","user":"zeenahspirit","rank":[110,156]},{"title":"The best of the franchise","rating":10,"date":"20 July 2018","review":"Hotel Transylvania is not one of my favorite animated sagas and the first two were funny and entertaining, but completely average. And my expectations for this one weren't too high.<br><br>But then I realized that I started laughing hard within the first 5 minutes of it, and I was more surprised every minute of how good it was. The characters are lovely and the script is very well done and heart-warming, and it keeps you laughing all the time.<br><br>I never thought I would enjoy this movie so much. I highly recommend it to watch it with your family and kids, and if you're an adult you'll love it as well. Totally worth of your time.<br><br>Enjoy!<br><br>10/10","user":"maurodc","rank":[109,160]},{"title":"El Macarena","rating":10,"date":"2 July 2018","review":"I watched this movie on June 30th, Amazon Prime Member. My kids and myself. Enjoyed this movie. A very cute summer movie. I believe this movie is just for kids and adults! Kids humor were they understand. I heard so many kids laughter and engaged to the movie. Not even a cry, not even loud remarks or playing with some sort of toy/phone. I will be back to watch this on the 14th of July!. It's a good movie for the whole family. Bleh Bleh Bleh!","user":"hott_kitty_moew","rank":[106,158]}]
