[{"title":"The Psychic was hilarious","rating":2,"date":"31 October 2019","review":"It would be a 1 star bad acting, bad plot etc, but the psychic made me laugh so I gave it 2 stars.","user":"matthewgreenan","rank":[24,32]},{"title":"Not that bad!","rating":3,"date":"25 November 2019","review":"A family is on hard times, having to move to a new town, find new work and a new school for their special needs son before they're haunted by a group of evil spirits that they accidentally release after finding a mysterious door on a hike. Can a shaman aid them in saving heir child and sending the entities back to the spirit world forever?<br><br>This is the first full movie for writer/director Billy Chase Goforth. CJ Jones, who plays the deaf shaman Uriah, is pretty good in this, as well.<br><br>While the film doesn't break any new ground, it's still pretty entertaining. If you like Ouija boards and ghosts speaking through mediums and having to make bargains with the great unknown, you'll enjoy yourself.","user":"BandSAboutMovies","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"not as bad as expected","rating":4,"date":"15 November 2019","review":"Although this is lower quality movie, and looks fake like most horrors, it obviously made effort in effects, story, acting, convincing. Psychic was the best. Perfect end for such fairytale. It definitely could be much better, show us more, but at least story has end and is explained unlike in worst horror movies. Not the worst. Good idea, story, and graphics. But not the movie I would wish to rewatch, and definitely not so scary. Too empty and passive, could be filled with more content.","user":"asocialis","rank":[6,7]}]
