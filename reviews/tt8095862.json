[{"title":"Poor","rating":1,"date":"10 November 2019","review":"Just balancing the reviews. Poor film, Poor acting, poor script. The film starts well with the whole devil worshipping etc but when it moves to present day it really falls short. No real plot to the story. I really cant be bothered going though all the wrongs in the film. I like a good horror and dont mind watching B rated movies but this one was just rubbish. The ending made me write this review. With the old janitor turning out to be the boy who burnt down the house was obvious but needing to explain the whole movie in the last 2 mins really shows how poor it all was. I could go on but hopefully you will get the idea and not watch this garbage.","user":"grahammuirhead","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Ghostly and ghastly","rating":1,"date":"7 December 2019","review":"Are you looking for a title with an unoriginal boring script with loads of plot holes, no real story, uninteresting characters that nobody can root for, wooden acting, poor camera work etc... then you should definitely watch this.<br><br>It certainly looks like a college kid's failed attempt at his first draft of a movie making project and it's certainly not scary at all if that's your thing.","user":"bcansevgisi","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Not so great film","rating":2,"date":"3 November 2019","review":"This movie was not so great. It had been given some very good ratings so I continued to watch it afraid I would miss something if I turned it off. Basically the movie was a rip off of scenes and themes of I don't know how many other movies. I like the actor Dean Cain but he was basically in the movie for the first 10 minutes except for some movie clip of him they kept playing and playing. It was not what I expected. It was almost like a spoof of horror movies.","user":"l_boester","rank":[12,14]}]
