[{"title":"Important to go in with the right mind-set","rating":6,"date":"6 July 2017","review":"I can see why 'Approaching the Unknown' would not be to everyone's liking. It's very much a slow-burner of a film and is really more of a character study than anything else. With space movies I think people have come to expect drama filled, save-the-world type films and this is simply not that. This is the story of a man who has embarked on a mission that very few people on Earth would be brave enough to do, and the struggle he consequently went through.<br><br>I actually quite enjoyed it for the most part. A film with basically only one character is never going to be the most exhilarating watch, however the pacing of the film doesn't feel overly slow. Mark Strong in the lead role does a good job of being just interesting enough in what would have been a very tough role to take on.<br><br>As mentioned, this won't be for everyone. People who go into this expecting an 'Armegeddon' or even 'Gravity' type film are going to be let down and I suspect that is a lot of the reason why this film has not been received very well. However if you go in simply expecting a solid exploration of astronaut life and the challenges they can go through mentally, I think you will find yourself quite enjoying this one.","user":"jtindahouse","rank":[42,46]},{"title":"Not great, but certainly not terrible","rating":5,"date":"2 October 2017","review":"There are a lot of people saying this movie is absolute garbage. And I can understand that some, or many, people might feel they just wasted their time. <br><br>For it is a slow movie, and there are very few actual happenings. But this is a psychological movie, more so a thriller than anything else. The film didn't need any more character development or action, as it was just supposed to be a relatively short movie with just the bare minimum of most devices. <br><br>It shows us what we need to know (SPOILERS): A desperate man on a mission to experience something new. He knows what is on Earth, and wants one moment of pure wonder as he ventures into space and eventually Mars. Furthermore, he is actually psychotic in this need to experience, as he completely disregards Houston's orders and his friend Skinny's advice and efforts to help when his water generator breaks. <br><br>He was, however, scared to be completely alone, like he will be since his colleague Maddox had to turn around. The movie ends abruptly, and we have no idea on whether he can fix his water supply or if he will just wither away and die.","user":"Daggyy","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Zen-spirit atmosphere space movie","rating":8,"date":"8 June 2016","review":"This movie is good. I honestly understand the bad rating, because its not mainstream and you need to understand the \"zen-spirit\" of it.You need to have sensitivity and some wisdom to appreciate a movie like this.Its atmospheric and poetic.Lets you experience space from an angle of basic reality and not heroism nor action.<br><br>The slow descend into madness, his monologues, it is good.<br><br>A good story isn't about a lot of action, a lot of events, it lies in the subtleties and how they come together.<br><br>Just a good movie. I guess, blade runner also had a bad reception when it was released. This movie is perhaps not meant for this generation of action spoiled viewers. I really hope this will get some appreciation along the line, so that we may see more of this quality. Real sci-fi fans will love this movie for what it is.","user":"Johndemontaigne-32806","rank":[103,142]}]
