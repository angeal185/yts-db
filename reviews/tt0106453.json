[{"title":"Madonna does what she does","rating":7,"date":"18 June 2011","review":"Certainly not a great film, but not as bad as it has been made out to be. Madonna's acting is OK, and I suspect the \"woodenness\" of her performance was largely what the director wanted. Her character's passion was limited to the bedroom (and elevator, and stairs, and parking garage, etc.) and never extended to her daily life. And, by the way, I had forgotten how pretty she could be back then. Anne Archer looked awfully good as well, even while being weepy and not completely hinged. The rest of the cast put in good work, with a special commendation for Julianne Moore. Frank Langella was suitably creepy, and Joe Mantegna suitably industrious. Some of the dialog didn't completely work, but if you watch this without preconceptions, you'll find it OK.","user":"smatysia","rank":[21,26]},{"title":"Why does this film get so much slack? It's not that bad at all!!","rating":9,"date":"23 January 2000","review":"It's been a while since Body of Evidence was released to theaters and rejected by critics and the public.  But I'm not at all ashamed to admit that I still get kicks out of popping this film into the vcr and getting completely entangled in the story.  It's thought provoking.  Can someone literally be, umm, sexed to death?<br><br>And why do people think Madonna did such a bad job in this film?  She was perfect in doing exactly what she needed to in order to develop her character--the sultry Rebecca Carlson.  I mean, come on! Who else could look so sexy as the mega bad girl delivering a line like \"I f***--that's what I do.\"  Madonna is superb and I think she really proved critics wrong when she won a golden globe for Evita a few years after Body of Evidence was released.<br><br>The plot of this movie is one of the most interesting story lines I have ever known.  Is Rebecca a out of control dominatrix who really did sex her much older lover to death?  That's what the prosecution tries to prove as they charge her for murder after her wealthy older lover is found dead. Throughout the film, the plot thickens and you're not sure if Rebecca is a murderous bitch or not.  And the sex scenes in this are highly erotic! Madonna, come my way with that candle wax any day of the week!  And the look in her eyes as she teases her lawyer by shoving her fingers down her panties---Geez, that look is classic!<br><br>Body of Evidence may not be Oscar caliber, but hell, was Titanic?  I don't think so.  But if you're in for a sinful delight, you should go rent Body of Evidence right now.","user":"mitchel6","rank":[58,80]},{"title":"Bodily Harm","rating":7,"date":"10 December 2003","review":"It was only a matter of time that by 1993 Modonna one of the worlds most recognized woman and #1 sex symbol was to showcase her enormous and natural talents on the big screen for all to see.<br><br>\"Body of Evidence\" is a story about greed lust murder and betrayal where Madonna, Rebecca Carlson, is accused of murdering her rich and elderly lover with the most potent and deadly weapon at her disposal, her body. The lurid and sensational trial that followed left the quiet and sleepy little city of Portland Oregon so shook up that it still hasn't recovered from the shock that hit it after all these years. <br><br>Portland Millionaire Andrew Marsh, Michael Forrest, is found dead of a heart attack in his mansion with his hands tied to the bed and a video tape of him and Rebecca Carlson having sex still playing on the VCR. Before long the DA has Miss. Carlson indited for his murder and the evidence against her is almost air-tight and a conviction seems like a forgone conclusion.Miss Carlson was to inherit $8,00,000.00 from Marsh after his death. Attorney Frank Dulaney, Willam Dafoe, takes the case for Carlson's defense and it turned out the be the biggest mistake that he ever made in his entire life.<br><br>The movie goes from the ridiculous to the sublime and every thing else in between and by the time the movie is over you feel like you went over Niagara Falls on a surf board. You have to say one thing about \"Body of Evidence\" it's not at all boring and Madonna dose have acting talents with her very effective portrayal of the sexy and over the top Rebecca Carlson, even though she was obviously playing herself. Willam Defoe was very good as Rebecca's lawyer who was manipulated by her like all the men that she manipulated in the movie; you couldn't fault him for that once she turned it on the poor man was a goner. <br><br>Anne Archer, Joanne Braslow, was tragic as well as sympathetic as Rebecca's rival for the dead millionaire Andrew Marsh's affections as well as money whom to no one's surprise lost out to. Joe Mantegna was as good as ever as the hard driving DA, Robert Garrett out to convict Rebecca for Marsh's murder. <br><br>The movie has a number of shocking and explosive surprises that will keep you guessing until the final credits start to roll and is much better then you would expect from all the negative comments that it got at the time of it's release. Madonna's acting surprisingly evoking sympathy as well as outrage during the entire movie, Madonna was very good in the scene where she was on the witness stand, that even rival her scenes in the buff, which was the real reason for most people seeing the film, that gives the audience and extra bonus.","user":"sol-kay","rank":[23,32]}]
