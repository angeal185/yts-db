[{"title":"A movie that lingers, in a good way","rating":9,"date":"27 November 2011","review":"The concept of this movie is almost impossible to sell (two dudes talking in a room) if that is an automatic switch off for you then give this a miss, have a good evening.<br><br>It almost was for me but as the two dudes in question are Tommy Lee and Samuel L, I thought I would give it a shot; glad I did as I was instantly gripped and before I realised it the end credits were rolling.<br><br>The two perform an elegant dance of dialogue, Samuel's character from the slant of a straight shooting, Southern ex-con who has found Jesus and Tommy as the depressed, over educated nihilist.<br><br>There is nothing groundbreakingly new here. The discussion follows paths we have all considered, is there a god? could anyone bare living forever? But the two are masters at their trade.<br><br>This is an excellent film, if you insist on car chases and explosions to enjoy a movie (nothing wrong with that) then steer well clear. Otherwise give this a go. It won't change your life but will definitely affect your week.","user":"thekarmicnomad","rank":[66,75]},{"title":"The Sunset is not Limited","rating":10,"date":"12 February 2011","review":"Two men trapped in a room with their opposing beliefs. The words of Cormac McCarthy. The direction of Tommy Lee Jones. The powerhouse combination of Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. Two actors. One room. Big Ideas. Emotions run high. The essence of Drama is Conflict. <br><br>This 90 minute look at two men's opposing beliefs is strong and will resonate with the viewer long after it is over. It's the story of a man who wants to end his life and another man who wants to save it. What rings true is the direction of Tommy Lee Jones. It gels so well with the words of Cormac McCarthy. <br><br>These two actors gel even better making it all the richer. Jackson has the flashier role where Jones plays his complexly understated. If any actor could raise your heart rate by talking it's Sam Jackson. His character's belief in God is sincere and matched with Jones's dark, realistic view of the world.<br><br>Speaking of realistic-Don't go looking for a neat ending. This film stays true to it's subject matter and these actors stay even truer to their characters. Jones, as a student of theater and literature, knows as a director to let the words live and breathe. Because he does Jackson and him make a monument out of two chairs and a table in a small room. This sunset is anything but limited.","user":"darrendebari","rank":[144,174]},{"title":"Wow!!!","rating":10,"date":"13 February 2011","review":"I've never felt so compelled to write in on how I feel about a movie until I had experienced \"The Sunset Limited\" last night on HBO. <br><br>I was really moved. I actually burst into tears at one point. <br><br>Two men having a philosophical debate about life and death and the idea that knowledge is a burden, and the more we know, the more miserable we become is one point of debate in this powerful film. Some of the best writing and acting I've seen, anywhere.<br><br>Multiple viewings may be required for most to fully absorb the impact. A real punch in the gut. <br><br>I actually felt like dusting off my old Bible and thumbing through it for a while when the movie ended.<br><br>I don't know what else to say about this movie except that if you have not seen it yet, you MUST. It makes so much sense and it is a real eye opener.<br><br>McCarthy is genius. I love all is work and this is just an absolute masterpiece of writing. <br><br>Tommy Lee Jones and my man Sammy L. are absolutely mesmerizing. I have not seen acting this good in a long time.<br><br>There is so much I want to tell you about this film, but words just cannot do it justice. <br><br>I loved every second of this film, and I hope you do to.<br><br>P.S.- I NEVER give a movie 10 stars because I like to reserve that honor for something that is truly special. This is truly special.","user":"JFarrar697","rank":[223,277]}]
