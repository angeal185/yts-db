[{"title":"I loved this film!","rating":10,"date":"8 December 2012","review":"It's sweet. It's about real life. Is well acted. The script is great. I had a wonderful time while watching it. Excellent performance of the late Ernest Borgnine! Beautiful music! It's about life, it's simple and profound at the same time, the kind of film that were missed very much in these modern current days... It has a delicate and original humor sense. It's romantic, it's funny, it's sweet, it's sad. It has a very intelligent way to mix the Latin community, its music, its principles, with a real spaghetti wester! An emotional beautiful movie which everyone, for sure, will enjoy watching and remember for a long time afterward...!","user":"dafneyagu","rank":[14,21]}]
