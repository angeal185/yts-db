[{"title":"Warm story","rating":8,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"I was deeply touched with this warm film. The background music is perfectly fit in the story. Its not a commercial film but it tells the story very well. Will watch it again","user":"zhaoyusee","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"Deeper Story","rating":9,"date":"27 October 2019","review":"I loved Balto but this movie gives you even more of the back story. A touching film of what parents will do to save their kids. I knew how it ended but I was still on the edge of my seat.","user":"bethlafave","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"An Incredible Story","rating":9,"date":"1 November 2019","review":"This movie is based on true events that happened in Nome, AK at the start of the 20th Century. It was great to hear some of the details I'd not known, such as Togo being the lead dog that travelled the greatest distance of all the teams that traversed the distance and extreme temperatures to get the serum to Nome. The story is more focused on the people than the dogs, which is a nice change (and I love dogs). A very warm, heartfelt story and it's family friendly - a nice bonus! It's not filmed in the Hollywood glossy style but it tells the story it intends. One less star because some of the story comes across a little disjointed.","user":"saander","rank":[8,10]}]
