[{"title":"Screw the reviews, I liked it.","rating":7,"date":"10 September 2019","review":"I dunno, I really liked this movie. I cried all the way through. I dunno if it's cause it's that time of the month or what ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚ But it just got to me. Im glad I watched it. As a white chick I realise that I can never learn enough about racism. I feel like we all need to be learning and understanding one another on this issue until the day we die.","user":"sophiahwright","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Unexpected winner (don't believe other reviews)","rating":10,"date":"7 September 2019","review":"I never review movies, but I loved this movie so much and can't believe the other reviews. Strong acting, compelling plot, and real dialogue make this a fresh take on the story of race and romance. I expected a Hallmark-type drama or PSA on discrimination, but found something different - a compelling narrative intertwined with modern themes. Unlike other teen dramas, they don't force slang here or stereotypical teen tropes. Instead, you see positive role models for youth. I recommend this film for all. It's family friendly but not boring.","user":"sandyellen","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"LOVED IT","rating":10,"date":"13 September 2019","review":"This movie was so great. I cried through 99% of it. I expected a cheesy movie but it kept me drawn the whole time.","user":"takoerigelsia","rank":[10,12]}]
