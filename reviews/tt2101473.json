[{"title":"Well shot and acted, not very true to the original story.","rating":9,"date":"24 August 2015","review":"While this movie is well acted and beautifully shot, there are so many departures from the original story that I couldn't help feeling a little let down. It's true that to include everything written by Noah Gordon would require a mini-series (which would have been a good idea) , there are a number of things that gave the story more depth that could easily have been included. An accurate account of where Rob J Cole was born would have been a good start.<br><br>Despite these omissions The Physician is still a good watch.<br><br>For those who question the truth of this title, it's fiction, total fiction.","user":"alchemist-714-680589","rank":[23,26]},{"title":"Beautiful movie, historically inaccurate","rating":10,"date":"18 May 2014","review":"All things considered I recommend this movie, It's picturesque and captivating. The music is very beautiful as well. And hands down to Ben Kinsly as always! It is a beautiful movie. The actors are brilliant and the story is very captivating. For once I didn't feel wretched when foreign cinema has tried to show Persia. At least Persians were speaking Persian even though they looked like Arabs. The illustrations that were used as the school material were the exact replicas of what remains from Ibn Sina and what you can see in his great book. That said the movie is very wrong in historical facts. What was supposed to be Isfahan looked nothing like it, but I suppose that's too much to expect. First the whole time line is wrong, Ibn Sina lived during the ruling of Saljugi dynasty and was caught up in their wars. He had to be on the run all the time for most of his life. The most important blunder of the movie which was quite central to the storyline is that Ibn Sina did not practice autopsy! He did! It was considered a sin so he had to steel corpses during the night. It is one of the reasons why people didn't like him. I have not read the book, I am talking about real documented history about him so maybe this blunder can be blamed on the book. I don't know!","user":"azadeh-tafreshiha","rank":[33,42]},{"title":"A good entertaining adventure movie made in the classical way","rating":9,"date":"6 January 2014","review":"I am lucky I didn't read the book. In fact, the book and film of any story is always very different from each other and should be rated separately without comparing them. It is a 2:30 hours movie and it isn't boring at any moment. From the beginning till the end you are entertained by the story and the action. It is a big production, one of those you have to see in the theater due to the imagine, the landscapes, the special effects. And talking about the special effect; there are enough, but for once this movie is not an \"ONLY and overloaded action\" movie. Lately, most of the films are possible to see on the screen at home, because the imagine is not of that type a cine-screen is needed. This production is made like the classical big productions, like Lawrence of Arabia or The English Patient. So, enough action, not boring, entertaining and you can leave the theater in a relax status and not tired of all the car chases.<br><br>Tom Payne, Mr Kingsley and Skarsgard make a very good act. <br><br>Negative parts ?! Missing some link in the voyage between England and the Orient. Some unexplainable jumps in the story, which for sure are treated well in the book. But, it is not disturbing and quiet normal in a big story as this one.","user":"kriddirk","rank":[137,194]}]
