[{"title":"Not the worst film ever but it could be better.","rating":6,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"This film is crucial to the extended universe that DC is trying to build, but it feels highly derivative of better stories and continues to demonstrate the misuse of the iconic characters mentioned in the title. Plus Jesse Eisenberg feels wildly mis-casted.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[47,52]},{"title":"Watch Extended cut, not theatrical","rating":10,"date":"14 July 2017","review":"The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well.","user":"whitnale","rank":[156,189]},{"title":"Best comic book movie since watchmen","rating":10,"date":"23 August 2018","review":"Zack Snyder not only understands the characters but he also understands how to craft a real amazing movie for fans - honestly blew me away (extended cut) <br><br>Brilliant!<br><br>Don't believe what the internet is telling you to think - take this from a person who has worked in the comic book industry - this is amazing!","user":"simitchellart","rank":[18,19]}]
