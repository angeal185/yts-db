[{"title":"Wonderful movie","rating":10,"date":"9 June 2018","review":"This movie hit all the bases of emotion for the entire sold out audience at the Prescott Film Festival. Well worth seeing and spreading the word. The director and writer, Cameron Nugent did a superb job in capturing the subtleties of the main characters as well as the story line. The excellent script was written with humor throughout. The director of Photography, John Garrett, captured the bleakness of the landscape but also captured the warmth of the family and townspeople. JK Simmons as well as Julian as the \"boy called Sailboat\" and his parents should get a nod for their acting abilities. A film Well Done...","user":"janhezzel","rank":[27,37]},{"title":"A true gem","rating":10,"date":"20 August 2018","review":"It only happens not so often that you stumble upon a movie, book, song or any other (still obviously hidden?) gem so beautiful and fulfilling, still hidden and unknown that takes you and carries you to the sky of joy, happiness and positive emotions... We carry all what we need with us. A bedtime lifetime story. Movie full of beautiful photos and music, amazing characters, a fantasy that makes you feel better.. A true must see","user":"papataza","rank":[22,34]},{"title":"One of the loveliest films I've watched in a long time","rating":9,"date":"17 April 2019","review":"It may well be one of the loveliest films I've watched in a long time, and yet I have no idea what it is about. I mean I know it's about a little boy who writes a song that we never hear but which makes the whole world happy but, I have no idea what it's about.\nIt's kind of like David Lynch meets Disney.\nThe direction and pace is superb, the photography is stunning, the acting is immense for what it is, and I've never seen a 7 year old boy hold an entire movie from beginning to end.\nThis is an amazing watch.","user":"Boristhemoggy","rank":[8,11]}]
