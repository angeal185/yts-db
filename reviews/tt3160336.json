[{"title":"It never ends with these rehashed WW2 movie stories","rating":1,"date":"4 October 2019","review":"Hollywood please stop remaking the same movies, Come up with fresh ideas.","user":"Warhammer40K","rank":[28,56]},{"title":"Has good points but the 4.8 rating is fair","rating":5,"date":"29 January 2020","review":"Another film where it's hard to make sense of polarised viewers giving it very high or very low ratings. I always attend a Holocaust Memorial Day screening a local cinema, so I was disposed to give it a chance and make up my own mind. On the plus side, there's striking photography (as some reviews have stated); some originality in the Norwegian location; and interesting themes in relation to how people there responded to the Nazi occupation.<br><br>But as another reviewer says, it has: \"An interesting premise plagued by implausible plot elements... \". Within minutes, I wondered if I'd misunderstood that Esther is supposed to be 14, as she looked far too old. IMDB indicates she was 28 when it was filmed. It doesn't matter that she's a good actress - a 28 year old won't be credible as a 14 year old child, so why cast her! We soon see a succession of scenes that are impossible to take seriously, or ramp up the melodrama far too high. In fact there's so much going on in the central family - in relation to their internal conflicts and their attempts to 'manage' relations with their occupiers - that the film might have worked better and more coherently without Esther even being in it!<br><br>A shame, though, because if someone had refined the screenplay, and the director has reined in some of the more ridiculous moments, it could potentially have been a very good film.","user":"adrianw-16","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Very beautiful film, about a dark period in History","rating":9,"date":"5 October 2019","review":"I totally watched this movie on a whim without having heard anything about it, or read any reviews. I loved it! I absolutely love films about WW2. There are soooo many different stories that are yet to be told, so I get excited when I see a new film/ a new perspective of this absolutely devastating time in history. I think it's so important that these stories be told, as sad and tragic as they may be.\nI thought the cinematography was beautiful and the lead actress did a fantastic job- I will keep my eye on her in other films.\nI was really surprised by the low rating, so I gave it a 9/10 because I thoroughly enjoyed watching and engaged the entire length of the film, and hope more people watch this tragic but beautiful story.","user":"heatherbendall","rank":[12,23]}]
