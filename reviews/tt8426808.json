[{"title":"Beautiful and astonishing.","rating":10,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"This is singlehandedly the best piece of media ever created. After watching this, you will have no need for any other film, anywhere, ever. You will only need Space Explorers™ (2018). This is better than Citizen Kane. This is better than Avengers Endgame. Others may tell you that you are wrong, that this is a poorly made cashgrab created by some unknown company within three days and with less than one dollar as their budget, but they are the wrong ones. You only need Space Explorers™ (2018). You will become one with Space Explorers™ (2018).","user":"willowthewisp-45261","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"The Woooooorst","rating":1,"date":"26 October 2018","review":"This movie is complete and total garbage. Awful animation, really bad unfunny jokes and voices, worst story and writing I think I've ever seen even in a kids movie. Garbage.","user":"MisterKevin","rank":[1,4]}]
