[{"title":"not a bad movie but lacks certain things","rating":5,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"The movie is interesting, the script is good but the main male actor seems a bit weak in his acting ..and the climax could have been better..but can be watched as a one time movie","user":"yamahapic","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Dark and fascinating story about returning to your roots","rating":7,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"Darkness Visible mostly takes place in India, with stunning establishing shots and displays of the beautiful architecture. India also serves as the backdrop to the horrifying and gruesome events happening in the film and it fits with its dark and gritty tone. The horror and suspense are fantastic, but what strikes me the most is the character of Ronnie and his journey as he goes to his roots and learns more about who he is. This movie is far from a story about someone re-discovering themselves after returning to their hometown in a traditional sense, but the core of the story is about just that. Ronnie has been cut out completely from his dark and troubling past and he is now forced to confront it. He learns more about his family and how he is connected to his hometown in more ways than he thought. The way that the supernatural is connected to that idea of going back to your roots is extremely unique and unlike anything I have ever seen before.","user":"jordanthom","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Where Do These Reviewers Come From???","rating":2,"date":"15 March 2019","review":"#1 Not Scary #2 Just drawn Out..
