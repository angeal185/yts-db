[{"title":"I want my money back","rating":1,"date":"13 October 2014","review":"This movie was simply AWFUL. Really, really bad. And to those who are going to argue that the reason why this movie is rated so low is because people are becoming \"anti- Christian\", NO. The acting was terrible, the script was horrendous, seriously. A group of high school kids in drama club could do better. It was deathly boring, i thought I was in there for more than three hours. <br><br>Worst of all is the message its trying to send. Isn't it curious that the movie tried so hard to portray all of those that were left as bad messed up people? So is that supposed to mean that those who don't believe in the Christian God are all either cheaters, flirts, gamblers, thieves, drug addicts and just generally messed up? Because that's what I saw. Don't think I wouldn't catch that. I get that its a Christian movie but its still a pretty offensive way of showing off your faith. <br><br>Even in the Philippines, which is predominantly made up of believers, people in the theatre couldn't help but laugh at how absolutely ridiculous everything was. Worst movie EVER","user":"louisafontelera","rank":[514,672]},{"title":"Cage Left Behind by good movies","rating":1,"date":"23 October 2014","review":"Was it the money? Did he owe someone a favour? Cage why are you in this terrible movie ? Left Behind is even worse than the Kirk Cameron version ,which also sucked. The book I am sure is better, since many have read it. This movie is a career killer ...it is sad to see Cage left behind by Hollywood. The acting is bad , Cage tries hard to make work out of a script that was seemingly penned by 8 year old's . I mean the dialogue is terrible. Why waste your money making a film that is just bad. Cage needs to really rethink his career . Honestly I felt ashamed for Nick . Wild at Heart , Leaving Las Vegas, and Oscar winner... My God man have you no self respect? Nick you are better than this.","user":"celt007","rank":[316,423]},{"title":"When some other people walked out, we 'left behind' them.","rating":1,"date":"13 October 2014","review":"This movie epitomizes the problem with religion in general.<br><br>It starts with a conclusion, so it's tediously predictable &amp; boring boring boring, strictly by-the-numbers fluff for the easily entertained.<br><br>As demonstrated the featured review, the only people who will like this dog are those who take a creepy satisfaction in their belief that they alone will get sucked up to heaven while everybody else fries in hell.<br><br>As a result, it's aimed at a narrow audience of knee-jerk true believers who would like it no matter how awful it is.<br><br>And this was awful, folks. The script falls so flat I even lost my taste for popcorn. Even my daughter, who wanted to see it, got bored pretty quickly. <br><br>So when some other people walked out, we 'left behind' them.","user":"media-dtv","rank":[443,606]}]
