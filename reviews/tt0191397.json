[{"title":"Unoriginal but hilarious","rating":8,"date":"7 December 2000","review":"Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).<br><br>All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.<br><br>Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.<br><br>The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.<br><br>There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers' imitation was misplaced.<br><br>This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg' Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.<br><br>This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut.","user":"FlickJunkie-2","rank":[72,82]},{"title":"Expected storyline, but completely unexpected hilarity","rating":10,"date":"30 July 2000","review":"To work, comedy has to be unexpected. And that is just what makes \"The Replacements\" work so well. Oh, not that the storyline is unexpected, for from it. But the actual comedy embedded in that plot is often delightfully quirky and quite unusual in this extremely good-natured and entertaining film. The very first scene, for example, takes place in a completely unexpected setting and proceeds in a really odd-ball way.<br><br>As it is most times, Keanu Reeves acting is subtle.  In this film you have to watch those eyes that are so eloquent when he's discouraged and listen to those little expelled breaths that convey so well (and so humorously) his state of mind when he's near the girl he's finds attractive.  It's all there, and more, if you watch closely.  Reeves is completely believable as a man who needs a second chance to do something he loves--play football. It's like he's a different person on and off the field--and that's exactly what the movie was trying to convey.  The development (redemption is only too slightly strong a word) of Reeves' character is excellently portrayed. That struggle to overcome provides a good solid center around which all the hilarity revolves and becomes funnier in contrast.<br><br>Gene Hackman and the rest of this ensemble cast did a great job--everyone has his or her moments.  If the movie has a weakness, it's the romance. Not that Brook Langton and Reeves aren't good in the clinches--they have a definite chemistry. But it seems like there should have just been one scene between them with some real substance.<br><br>\"The Replacements\" also succeeds well as a football movie.  The great photography and sound; the inventiveness of the script in dreaming up unusual and funny, yet still plausible, game events; and the evident attention to training for and depicting the physical moves, all add up to a movie which sports fans will relish. And yet, the football plays, are presented so clearly that even someone who's not a knowledgeable football fan can understand everything that's happening, even the first time.<br><br>Comedy is tough--it's quite an achievement to have folks in the theater laughing for most of two hours. And that's certainly what the audience did when I saw \"The Replacements.\" As well as cheering out loud for the \"home team,\" clapping at the end, and coming out feeling like dancing to \"I Will Survive\" like they did in the movie.  As well as feeling like we can survive and be ourselves--just like those scrappy, eccentric replacements.","user":"wrygrass","rank":[44,54]},{"title":"\"There is no tomorrow for you, and that makes you very dangerous people.\"","rating":30,"date":"30 June 2001","review":"Those are the words of coach (Hackman) before the final regular season game for the \"replacement\" players, filling in for the striking regulars.  The \"never-been\" QB (Keanu Reeves) must try to lead them to victory.<br><br>\"The Replacements\" is primarily a good screwball comedy, in the vein of, but significantly better than, \"Best of Show\" and \"The Waterboy.\" Some may even take a \"message\" away, about the importance of teamwork, belief in oneself, true love (QB and the head cheerleader). But that is all secondary.<br><br>I rate this one highly for pure escapism entertainment, but also with good acting by Reeves and Hackman, and some almost-believable football action, heavily interlaced with goofiness.  The lap-dancers turned cheerleaders, who totally distract the opposing team. The tag-team vomiting during the huddle, after the Japanese sumo wrestler eats too many eggs before the game (\"I gotta beef up!\") The cop who, like in the \"Waterboy\", can get enraged (Coach says, \"I want you to get me the ball,\" and he does.) The Welsh kicker who is \"wirr-rrry strong\" and smokes a cigarette while kicking. The \"I will survive\" dance in jail, after the barroom brawl with the 'regulars.'<br><br>To make a good screwball comedy, the writer and director have to walk a fine line and here they do it well.  John Madden and Pat Summerall, playing announcers, are genuinely funny. The DVD picture, and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, are up to standards.","user":"TxMike","rank":[32,39]}]
