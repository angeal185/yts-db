[{"title":"Jerry Lewis show with his particular talent as a botcher young who falls in love with a rich girl","rating":6,"date":"8 September 2012","review":"Norman Phiffier (Jerry Lewis) is a bungler young whose previous jobs include that of caddy , TV repairman, and Paramount Theater usher. Barbara (Jill St. John) is a very rich girl posing as an elevator-girl and falls in love with Norman . He now works as a store clerk in a large department store. Clumsy and inept, he set loose in store and can't do anything right . Boy are they in trouble . But , Barbara's mother (Agnes Morehead) doesn't want her daughter to marry such a poor man.<br><br>Amusing and spasmodic comedy with the genius comic Jerry Lewis acting in his stereotyped role by relinquishing creative control and concentrating on humor based on destruction and wreak havoc , nice inventive bits , skilfully combining the entertainment with the amusement. It features quick editing , wild and outrageous gags , and extremely odd angles. Enjoyable film with characters genuine and sympathetic , it is plenty of humor , tongue-in-cheek , side-splitting sight gags and amusement . Director Frank Tashlin introduces cinematic especial techniques in animated cartoon style , such as odd camera angles, montage and quickly paced editing , as some shots lasting only five frames long . Jerry Lewis is top-notch playing a botcher and meek store clerk ; Jerry played similar character as a bumbling idiot in other films such as a caddy in ¨The Caddy¨ and a TV repairman in both ¨Rock-a-Bye Baby¨ and ¨It's Only Money¨. The co-starring role stands out Jill St. John , surely the most gorgeous girl any clerk ever had . Excellent support cast formed by likable secondaries as Ray Walston as Mr. Quimby , John McGiver as Mr. John P. Tuttle and special mention to Agnes Moorehead as Mrs. Phoebe Tuttle . Furthermore , watch rapidly to veteran Kathleen Freeman . Colorful and shimmer cinematography in Technicolor by Wallace Kelley and catching musical score .<br><br>The motion picture was well directed by Frank Tashlin , one of the few directors to successfully make the transition from animation to live-action , as he directed his cartoons like live-action films and his live-action films like cartoons . He directed various vehicles for Jerry Lewis as ¨The Geisha boy¨, ¨Hollywood or Bust¨ , ¨Rock-a-Bye Baby¨ , ¨Cinderfella¨ and for Bob Hope as ¨The son of Paleface¨ . Who's minding the store ? is considered to be one of his best films . Rating : 6,5 . Entertaining and amusing movie that it will appeal to Jerry Lewis fans . Worthwhile watching .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"A Great Film","rating":12,"date":"12 May 2004","review":"This is one of the funniest films in the career of Jerry Lewis. This film can pretty much be seen as a series of vignettes as Norman bounces around from department to department as he tries to earn enough money to marry the woman he loves. Also, the rest of the cast give solid performances especially John McGiver, Ray Walston and Agnes Moorehead. Walston is great as the weasel of a store manager who does everything he can to break Norman. McGiver is outstanding as Mr. Tuttle who in the process of the film turns from a milquetoast to a tiger as he finally stands up to his wife, Phoebe. However, Agnes Moorehead is perfect as Phoebe Tuttle and she pretty much plays a mortal version of Endorra, the character she would play less than a year later on \"Bewitched\". <br><br>However, the one negative criticism of the film that I have is the fact that like what a couple of other commentators said was the fact that this film is pretty much takes great joy in bashing women.  Other than that this is a great film.","user":"Sargebri","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"JERRY LEWIS AT HIS ZANY BEST!!!","rating":10,"date":"10 September 2000","review":"Who's Minding the store is Jerry Lewis at his very best! Frank Tashlin directing, and with Tashlin directing Lewis, you know it's going to be a CLASSIC. One moment after another in this 1963 film, Jerry Lewis leads the audience into one madcap nutfilled scene after another, from the scene where Jerry's supposed to be selling gourmet \"De-Lights\" food, being forced to eat Fried ants in a scent free sauce, to trying to sell shoes to a 300 Lb. Female Wrestler, who's actually been hired to make Jerry want to quit... Well this film is as funny as any film of the 1960's, included are the Pink Panther, Shot in the Dark and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World....<br><br>This is also one film of Jerry's that you really don't have to be a fan of Jerry's to appreciate...with an awesome supporting comedy cast of Agnes Moorehead, John McGiver, Ray Walston Jill St. John, this film in my opinion is Jerry Lewis FINEST, without Dean Martin, and maybe his best of all-time. (But that would take alot of doing.) My advice, If you get the opportunity to see \"Who's Minding the Store?\" See it, if you don't find it utterly hilarious, it's time to make an appointment with the undertaker.","user":"Robbo62","rank":[15,19]}]
