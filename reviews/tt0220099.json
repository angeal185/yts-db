[{"title":"For family","rating":8,"date":"22 July 2001","review":"This movie is truly enjoyable. I can watch it may times. My wife and I are great fans of Winnie the Pooh and particularly Tigger. He can bounces and can talk really fast. The way that Tigger was looking for his family made it really fun!<br><br>I recommend that movie to everybody that have babies and/or toddlers.","user":"coolkev","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"A Fun Movie With A Great Message About Family","rating":9,"date":"31 August 2009","review":"Starting with a lament from Tigger that all the Winnie the Pooh movies are about - well - Winnie the Pooh, this movie goes on to meet his complaint and crafts a story about Tigger, who suddenly decides that being the only one isn't the most wonderful thing about Tiggers. Frustrated because he can't get any of his friends to go bouncing with him, Tigger becomes convinced that there must be a whole family of tiggers somewhere out there in the Hundred Acre woods, and he sets out to find them, leading to a series of adventures for all the gang and disappointment for Tigger, until he suddenly realizes that he didn't need to go looking for his family - they were right there all the time. Having adopted my daughter from China a few years ago (at 5, she loves this movie, by the way) I thought the message was so important: Pooh and Eeyore and Roo and Kanga and Owl and Piglet and Rabbit were Tigger's family - because family doesn't have to look like you or even be the same as you. Family are the ones who care about you and love you, no matter what. <br><br>The movie includes some nice songs and a few laughs (although it isn't really \"funny\" and also includes a few sad scenes as well.) It's fun for kids and pleasant viewing for adults, too. 9/10","user":"sddavis63","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Cool movie.","rating":6,"date":"15 July 2001","review":"But it should have been a bit longer. 77 minutes is not enough. I have always loved Disney's animation of the Winnie the Pooh TV show and I was way excited when I first learned of this movie. 100 acre wood looks as magical as it always has done and is presented very well in this feature.<br><br>\nThe story itself is a bit childish but still manages to have balls when it has Tigger FAIL to find his family. Although I would have liked him too I respect the ending they went for.<br><br>Although this film isn't to everyone's tastes (I know it seems a little fruity a guy of 20 can like this film) I say you should see this movie, preferably with kids. It's perfect child fodder and good entertainment. Not just family entertainment. Should be longer though.","user":"CuriosityKilledShawn","rank":[8,8]}]
