[{"title":"Better Than Expected","rating":8,"date":"13 May 2017","review":"As the summary/title implies I didn't think this was going to be that great, and I was pleasantly surprised. I think what sold me on it was the fact that the two main characters, i.e., the individuals who made up the interracial couple, wound up together. I didn't expect that.<br><br>The film was a combination of the predictable and the unpredictable, the above being an example of the latter. As these two characters endeavored to be together, to have their relationship despite the predictable obstacles you'd expect in the 1941 South, they encountered typical racist people and their behaviors. <br><br>But the plot and the film were uplifted by the \"true Christian\" character played by Margo Martindale, and by the ending in which the sympathetic black friend/employee (played by Lorraine Touissant) had an encounter with the racist \"Christian\" woman. In this encounter, happily and to my surprise, no one got shot, though there was a gun, and no one even got hurt. In fact,the happy ending of the couple going off together resulted from this encounter. The very end, of course, is bittersweet where the couple is together, but in a Japanese internment camp, which, somehow because of their ongoing love, doesn't seem quite so terrible.<br><br>I really enjoyed the acting of all four main characters. I also thought they were well cast, as visually their faces are all unique and engaging in their own ways.","user":"Moviegoer19","rank":[14,14]},{"title":"Beautiful film, wonderful acting - gorgeous movie!","rating":10,"date":"15 February 2017","review":"\"Sophie and the Rising Sun\" is a beautifully filmed movie with excellent acting - Margo Martindale and Lorraine Toussaint are particularly strong and give outstanding performances. Visually the film is gorgeous. Wolfgang Held brings magic to the screen with his incredible rich and intense cinematography. Though the story is set in a different time period it vibrates with relevance to today. Sophie comes to us at a time when we can only benefit by the questions it raises. You leave the film with the sad recognition that what was once still exists today. Prejudice and bigotry remains.","user":"agbartholomew","rank":[35,48]},{"title":"Totally enjoyable, full of emotion, and intrigue","rating":10,"date":"17 June 2017","review":"This movie was a winner for me. I enjoy true to life stories. I knew it was a winner within the first 10 minutes. Gripping, tantalizing and oh.... so romantic. The characters kept my attention. The emotion they emit is so sweet. The story is interesting and held my attention. I wanted more and did not want to stop watching it. So happy to share. I don't find many movies that are 10 stars for me and hope you enjoy it also. This is for true romantics.","user":"funndsunxoxo","rank":[15,20]}]
