[{"title":"A waste of time and effort and talent! - Awful film of an excellent book","rating":2,"date":"16 September 2017","review":"This is a film adaptation of a really quite excellent book - sorry to say that the film did not meet expectations at all. It was disjointed, had no conclusion and was mostly just plain muddled. <br><br>The only positives are that it was well acted and shot nicely. <br><br>I'm unsure what the screenwriter was doing really though - to mash an excellent book up that way and regurgitate it into this mess seems a travesty.<br><br>A waste of time and effort and talent!","user":"reviewerartb","rank":[44,55]},{"title":"Ghastly","rating":1,"date":"13 November 2017","review":"I stuck it through to the end, mainly because the cast are so great. Normally. But nothing could save this film. The script and over-talking and intercutting made it all a jumbled mess.<br><br>There was no one to root for. And the ending? It's like it ran out of steam and subdural ideas and appalling dialogue. <br><br>A killing at the end might have saved it. But I was beyond caring.<br><br>Fisticuffs among bros, I've seen too much of that lately in more films and series than I can count.<br><br>Spare me.<br><br>1/10","user":"wisewebwoman","rank":[39,52]},{"title":"Utterly enthralling","rating":9,"date":"6 May 2017","review":"I was totally captivated by this film. All the cast were excellent, all of them favorites of mine, with Steve Coogan's depiction of mental imbalance especially brilliant. Some of the audience at my showing seem to be baffled by the unorthodox ending, but I thought it a fitting end. Will see whatever Moverman does in the future.","user":"rhallnj","rank":[100,160]}]
