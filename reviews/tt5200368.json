[{"title":"From someone who knows","rating":10,"date":"26 April 2018","review":"An excellent movie about a very sad and disturbing subject.\nOrlando Bloom's performance was so well done I believed every look and sound of his character.\nThere are so many people who are in need of help in this world. \nMy hope is that this movie will help make a change, somewhere.","user":"c-bevan","rank":[24,26]},{"title":"Powerful watch","rating":21,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"I watched this film while in Poland and was unexpectedly blown away. Orlando Bloom gives the performance of his career with another sterling supporting performance from Alex Ferns. At times this film is challenging to watch as the lead character is dealing with the repercussions of sexual abuse, however it is a subject matter that begs to be addressed and is dealt with exceptionally well.","user":"rorynolan","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"See it for Orlando Bloom's performance","rating":8,"date":"16 August 2018","review":"It must be awful to be an actor and get offered one silly Hollywood project after another. Most Hollywood drivel doesn't even seem to require any real acting, so to watch this small movie, filled with excellent performances and to watch Orlando Bloom give an Oscar worthy performance was a real treat, even though the film itself , dealing with the subject of child sexual abuse is not an easy subject to watch. The film is not perfect, but the performances are top notch and Bloom is flawless as the tortured soul dealing with what his life has become. He is not someone I usually watch since he makes movies that don't interest me, but his performance is outstanding , completely believable and heartbreaking. There is not one moment in which he appears to be acting. A very well done movie, but a must see for anyone who loves top-notch acting.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[11,14]}]
