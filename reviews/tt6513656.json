[{"title":"Disappointing sequel to a decent escape movie","rating":3,"date":"15 June 2018","review":"I was a little bit worried when I learned that it will skip a theatrical release, but still looked forward to it. I really liked the first one and thought that the cast in this one was decent. Sadly, almost nothing about it works. <br><br>The script is disastrously bad. The plot and pace are all over the place, making an 85 minute movie feel long. The cinematography is horrendous. The movie is filled with neon lights that are almost headache inducing. The fight scenes are banal and are there just for the sake of it.There are Sci-Fi elements that serve little purpose and don't really fit. Oh, and Stallone and Batista are secondary characters. This would not be a problem if the leads were interesting, charismatic or well written, but they unfortunately are none of those things.<br><br>I enjoy B movies. For me, everything can be forgiven if the movie is fun. But this is just boring.","user":"Navzar","rank":[239,295]},{"title":"this is just horrible","rating":1,"date":"14 June 2018","review":"The acting is mediocre at best. The cinematography is just terrible. most of the movie is filmed with a handheld camera and the cameraman has parkinsons.\nImdb has not listed any budget for this movie and that is because there is no budget. CGI is awful, explosions and gunfire is so fake that there are no words to describe how bad it is. There is one cool scene and that is the barfight. Other than that there is nothing good about this movie. One of the worst sequels in history.","user":"zathan-32848","rank":[266,343]},{"title":"I managed to escape.","rating":1,"date":"15 June 2018","review":"I very much enjoyed the original movie and so was looking forward to seeing this. I watch about 30 minutes before I just stopped. Plot jumps all over the place and there is zero flow to the movie. You have no interest in the characters and the whole feel is just hollow and pointless.<br><br>Do yourself a favor and spend the 30 minutes I wasted doing something else.","user":"chainshotuk","rank":[240,313]}]
