[{"title":"Very Sad Film to Watch","rating":8,"date":"8 March 2017","review":"BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THAT PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 Christmas MOVIES. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM FARE ABOUT THESE FILMS. <br><br>The Heart of Christmas is a 2011 American Christian drama feature film directed by Gary Wheeler. It stars Candace Cameron Bure, Erin Bethea, Jeanne Neilson, Eric Jay Beck, George Newbern and Matthew West in his film debut. It is based on a true story. It involves a woman's encounter with a family caring for a child with acute leukemia and how it transforms her faith and her attitude about her own family.<br><br>Megan Walsh is a successful businesswoman who does not seem to have enough time for her husband and two children. While taking her children trick-or-treating during Halloween, she encounters a confusing situation in which many families are decorating for Christmas (which is nearly two months away). Their explanation is that they are trying to provide one last Christmas for Dax Locke, a toddler in their neighborhood who is dying of a rare form of leukemia. Curious, Megan reads Dax's mother Julie's blog and learns about the Lockes' journey. Inspired, Megan examines her own life and priorities<br><br>This family theme film is well made and I enjoyed the film. ***SPOILERS Ahead***. In this film a family is doing everything it can save their child from dying of leukemia. They spend months and months at St Joseph but the child loses his fight. <br><br>Now I loved the way they did this film. It was a different approach and that we see the film through the eyes of a person who is reading a blog about the family dealing with a child with cancer. <br><br>If you lost a child please don't watch this. The ending is uplifting however it is still \"A True Story\" and my heart just breaks when I think of this film. <br><br>This film is very good! Its just that watching not only a child suffering but watching a family feeling hopeless is also very hard. If you don't cry watching this film then you are not human.","user":"Christmas-Reviewer","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Great Movie","rating":10,"date":"14 December 2011","review":"All the actors were great. Extremely liked Austin and his dad and mom. Hope to see them in other movie's! This movie will make you move on the inside with emotions. I am not an emontional person but watching what they all went thru and to see a mom and dad be so strong with the child of a disease the true parents if they are this strong God has to be with them.I hope that this movie will be one that the family looks forward to seeing every Christmas. I also believe that this movie should be viewed at youth detention centers. Maybe it would help the children who think they have a problem realize that they really don't. I pastor a church and have told my members to watch this movie with their children.","user":"bobbyreddin","rank":[28,38]},{"title":"Not a Late Night Infomercial!!!!","rating":10,"date":"11 December 2012","review":"Hey TravelJunkie23, have a heart and think of someone else that is need this Christmas!! Their are so many kids with cancer that may not have a Christmas this year or next, their are so many families that can not afford the treatment for their child that has cancer, and so many families that have may other needs! Anyone that would not be affected by this movie in some degree doesn't have a heart! I am sorry to that that, but it's true! I am guilty of getting a little selfish sometimes and I need something like this movie to remind that their are so many that need us! As for me, I will think of those that are in need this Christmas! I thought this movie had the perfect message, that it's not about what WE are going to get for Christmas, or if we didn't receive that special thing that we wanted for Christmas! It's about thinking of others that may be in need and helping them! I give this movie a rating of ten and we need more movies like this! Keep them coming!","user":"drthdve","rank":[13,20]}]
