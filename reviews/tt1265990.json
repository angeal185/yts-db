[{"title":"they told the wrong story! **CONTAINS A FEW SPOILERS! You've BEEN WARNED**","rating":2,"date":"5 February 2011","review":"I realize that today's major cinema generally lacks creativity and innovation and indie is the way to go, but I can't resist a cheap thriller. Once in a great while I will be impressed by a film or at least not be furious I spent ten bucks on it. Unfortunately with \"The Roommate\" I felt like I'd wasted both my money and my time. The story is unoriginal, but even with recycled plots writers can tell them from new angles. This movie was told from the completely wrong angle. The main character goes to college and basically finds out her roommate is crazy and obsessed with her. The huge mistake? The story should've been about the 'crazy' girl and not about the girl who finds out the 'crazy' girl is obsessed with her etc. I'm frankly also insulted at how they depict mental illness in this movie, putting across the message that if a person has emotional problems/mental issues etc they're obviously dangerous. First of all her problems throughout the movie appear to be pretty severe, so why is she not under regular psychological care? At a visit to the the crazy girl's house, her parents seem almost afraid of her and make a comment about her medication. Various scenes in the girl's hometown make it clear that something serious has happened with this girl in the past. The script wants the viewer to hate this character and find her dangerous and sympathize with the roommate, but I find myself sympathizing with the crazy girl and curious about her backstory and what's really going on with her. The movie fails at getting me to see the girl as the antagonist and root against her, instead I pitied her and was concerned about her. I didn't really care about the main character at all. In short, Hollywood recycles plots all the time, and that's fine but they could at least pick a new angle to tell the story through that would captivate the viewer. The Roommate, is a huge fail and if I were you I'd skip this one in the box office.","user":"ifwejustbelieved","rank":[88,114]},{"title":"A decent thriller...","rating":5,"date":"6 February 2011","review":"The Roommate is one of those films, that when you first the trailer, you think to yourself, \"This is gonna suck\". But only when you actually see the film do you realize that you were only partly wrong. The Roommate's premise is simple enough. A young pretty girl is being stalked and obsessed with by her roommate. The film revolves around Sarah (Minka Kelly) who is on her own, going to college and learning new things. Little does she know that she has a stalker roommate, Rebecca (Leighton Meester). As soon as Rebecca and Sarah become closer to each other, strange events begin to occur. Each of Sarah's close friends or allies becomes hurt, or sometimes even killed. I wonder who could've done this? <br><br>The good thing about The Roommate is that it is a pretty decent thriller. Even though it doesn't even come close to meeting the standards of a horror movie, it still delivers some chills and even some cheap jump scares. The acting is good as well. With the exception of Minka Kelly. Cam Gigandet delivers a solid sometimes annoying performance as Sarah's new beau. Even though he is not in the film for long, he lifts our spirits when things are going rough, which is pretty much every 10 minutes. But the real scene stealer here is Leighton Meester as the crazed roommate. Meester delivers a believable potent performance, psychotic one moment and sweet the next. <br><br>The bad things about the film are that in the very beginning it moves far too fast. Jumping from one thing to the next in the blink of an eye. Also, the writing really could've used a makeover. I mean, the dialogue in this film is ridiculous. All in all, the film is at times stupid and the deaths aren't very well executed, if executed at all. But the acting and characters keep you around for the show. Overall, The Roommate is a film I would recommend, but only to open-minded movie watchers.","user":"shaunpiersonx","rank":[49,66]},{"title":"Unoriginal Thriller of Obsession","rating":5,"date":"6 March 2014","review":"The college student Sara Matthews (Minka Kelly) travels from Des Moines, Iowa, to Los Angeles to study fashion design. She befriends Tracy Morgan (Aly Michalka) that invites her to a party, where she meets Stephen (Cam Gigandet) and dates him. When Sara returns to her room, she meets her roommate Rebecca Evans (Leighton Meester) and they become friends. Rebecca is a wealthy teenager that becomes obsessed with Sara and soon Tracy notes that something is wrong with Rebecca. But Rebecca threatens Tracy that moves to another house. Rebecca gets rid of anyone that stays between Sara and her, but when Sara finally observes her behavior, she is also threatened by the schizophrenic roommate. <br><br>\"The Roommate\" is an unoriginal thriller of obsession with a storyline that is a rip-off \"Single White Female\". This teen version has two sexy lead actresses, Minka Kelly and Leighton Meester, and may entertain viewers that are not choosy. My vote is five.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Colega de Quarto\" (\"Roommate\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[21,27]}]
