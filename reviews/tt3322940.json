[{"title":"Pitiful cash-grab.","rating":3,"date":"5 May 2015","review":"Horror is one of my favorite movie genres. I really wasn't expecting to hate this as much as I did but it is astonishingly terrible. Really. I loved The Conjuring - this is nothing like The Conjuring. At all. It's a blatant cash-grab and a terrible one at that.<br><br>There is zero tension throughout this movie. Zero suspense. Everything is reliant on close ups of the dolls face to \"creep\" us out and really long periods of time where NOTHING HAPPENS. Literally, it's about this couple that we do not care about and their stupid problems which we care even less about. I don't know if they were trying to build suspense in these scenes but in order to build suspense you actually have to care about the characters. Or at least have, you know, suspense; a lingering sense of danger. This had nothing. And holy hell that ending. <br><br>The positives of this movie: The lead girl is beautiful. She's easy to look at. The soundtrack is pretty cool too. That's it. The characters are horrendous and the acting is even worse. Seriously if you're going to make a movie this awful at least have the decency to take an acting lesson or two. It's a dreadful watch. Please, don't waste your time with this cash grab sh*t stain. Don't give them the satisfaction. Watch something good like Sinister or 1408 - haunting movies done right.","user":"lnvicta","rank":[167,221]},{"title":"She's like Chucky, only boring!","rating":2,"date":"5 October 2014","review":"There were only two, count em', two well constructed and (more importantly) scary sequences throughout this entire HORROR MOVIE (the home invasion part and the elevator bit). If that fact alone is enough to get one person not to watch \"Annabelle\", then I've done my job as a critic.<br><br>If you went into \"Annabelle\" wanting to see something along the lines of \"Child's Play\" or at the very least, a doll-centric horror movie where dolls are either animated in some fashion or at the very least, trip someone as they walk down the stairs, then you will be savagely disappointed. On the other hand, if you were a fan of the small snippet of Annabelle's story shown in \"The Conjuring\" and wanted a terrifying and in-depth origins story, then youÂ…will be disappointed as well.<br><br>Synopsis: With an engaging set up, set against the rampant cult-phobia of the 60's, \"Annabelle\" is the story of a couple living in California who begin to experience paranormal occurrences after the husband gifts his pregnant, doll-crazed wife a doll, that soaks up blood faster than a Bounty paper towel. After that, the plot falls pretty flat by turning its focus away from the scary doll element, as the story becomes 10% \"Rosemary's Baby\", 20% every single haunted house movie ever and 70% watered down scares.<br><br>Aside from the fact that not for one second did I care about any of the characters here, for the most part director John R. Leonetti (the director of photography of \"The Conjuring\") does a lazy job of \"conjuring\" up scares. For about 80 minutes of this 98 minute film, every single scare follows the ultra uncreative quiet, quiet, quiet, LOUD, formula. About 20 minutes in, it becomes obvious that Leonetti is either just going through the motions or doing a rather poor job of plagiarizing much scarier films.<br><br>Final Thought: Much like the countless throw away, straight to DVD Disney animated sequels to come out of late the 90's and early 2000's (Pocahontas 2: Journey to a New World, The Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea, Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True\") \"Annabelle\" (a prequel) is nothing more than a soulless money-grab from this particular production company, attempting to feed off the success of \"The Conjuring\". No mention of Ed and Lorraine Warren (real life paranormal investigators from \"The Conjuring\") no James Wan (the director of \"The Conjuring\") and not one doll-induced scare, all seemed to have a hand in making \"Annabelle\" a strikingly forgettable film. I mean, in \"The Conjuring\", the Annabelle doll is only used in all of three scenes, but due to some smart direction, those are some of the scariest potions of the movie. In \"Annabelle\", the titular doll is used throughout and it's not even a little bit creepy. What gives?","user":"ghost_dog86","rank":[113,175]},{"title":"Comparing to The Conjuring makes this feel like a disappointment. Still worth watching!","rating":6,"date":"14 January 2015","review":"Let me start off by stating that as a devout Horror fan with a special liking to ghost stories, haunts and exorcisms, I have really enjoyed The Conjuring. Therefore, my anticipation towards this pseudo- prequel is to be understood, as well as my disappointment...<br><br>Perhaps it was the fact that James Wan was only an executive producer of this film that has made it wreak of mediocrity, especially compared to the first. Most of this film's components are exactly that: mediocre. The acting lacked the charisma and screen presence of Patrick Wilson (Ed Warren in The Conjuring), though I must say that Alfre Woodard (Evelyn) and Tony Amendola (Father Perez) were certain light spots. The story feels like it came out of an automated template machine given the basic \"create me a mediocre haunting story\" order, and again, compared to The Conjuring simply doesn't make the cut.<br><br>So why the slightly generous rating? For a few reasons:<br><br>1) Say what you will, that doll is one of the scariest, creepiest and most horrifying things I have ever seen both on screen and in life. Whoever created that doll's exterior should be either given a reward for being a genius or committed to a mental ward for being sick in the head (and I say that with the utmost respect, that doll is a work of art). Unlike The Conjuring, Annabelle gives the doll a lot more well deserved screen time.<br><br>2) The cinematography is at its best with the quick shots, giving the audience sometimes less than a second to realize what they're seeing. Showing demons, ghosts and such evil presences in that manner really adds to the fear factor in my opinion, for Hollywood is yet to realize how to portrait a demon that is scary for those of us who aren't religious Christians (and I say that with no disrespect whatsoever to Christians or Christianity). I like to use Insidious (another Wanderful masterpiece, if you haven't seen it stop reading RIGHT NOW and go see it) as an example - the one thing really lowering that excellent film's level is the demon shown there. In Annabelle, demons are shown, but for a snap shot, leaving much to imagination which serves to add to the scare gauage.<br><br>3) Plot actually gets pretty intense towards the end, but only towards the end.<br><br>So all in all, perhaps had I watched this film before The Conjuring I would have been able to be more objective, but seeing as how I am unable to ignore it's shortcomings - I give it 6.5, meaning you should definitely watch it (especially if you liked The Conjuring) but you shouldn't expect it to meet The Conjuring's level.","user":"nitzanhavoc","rank":[39,57]}]
