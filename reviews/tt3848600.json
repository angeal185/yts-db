[{"title":"Strange movie but very entertaining","rating":8,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"Some of the most over the top characters I've ever watched outside of cartoons. A spoiler would ruin the experience so I won't divulge anything, but this is definitely worth a watch. There is romance, crime, revenge, action and gore, but also some good laughs. Very original script that could never come out of Hollywood.","user":"mrdogcare","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Funniest villain ever.","rating":1,"date":"26 November 2018","review":"A 70 plus Mr Patel with a Patelian accent is Carlos, A feared and dreaded killer for hire.
