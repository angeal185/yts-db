[{"title":"The Veil","rating":1,"date":"16 August 2017","review":"I could not begin to tell you a thing about this movie--other than I watched it. I don't know what it was about, could not decipher the good guys from the bad, what the ending meant, what the beginning meant, nor what the director's vision (if he had one) was. Could barely understand anything that was said, as it was another one of those pretentious twit movies where they'd have you think the fate of everyone and everything hinges on every whisper. <br><br>As you can tell, I didn't care much for it so I'll just leave it at that. Watch at your own risk because this is one 90-minute movie that goes absolutely nowhere. Unrated, but does have some violence.","user":"dcarsonhagy","rank":[31,33]},{"title":"an embarrassment","rating":1,"date":"31 August 2017","review":"This film, subsidized by the Oklahoma Film Rebate Commission or something similar, was a lame attempt. Neither the plot nor the characters were developed, the acting quality was sad, and the fight scenes were high school. The Kingdom appeared to comprise a village of 9 or 10 funky black tents and had a similar number of warriors, while the Dominion (opposing dark side) had a few buildings made out of stone and perhaps 20 or 30 warriors. One reviewer said it was better than expected. I would hate to think what it was that he was expecting. The Film Rebate Commission should get their rebate back.","user":"p-minnis","rank":[35,41]},{"title":"Fear is a Lie","rating":2,"date":"3 July 2017","review":"Two worlds are coming together. They are not exactly colliding, but doing a slow merge so forget what you learned in Physics 101. I had to rewind and re-watch the explanation scene several times and it took a while for it to sink in.<br><br>\"The Warrior\" we follow from childhood on the planet Dominion until mortally wounded with a sacred sword. He stumbles into the Moon-lunar world where some lady of the lake heals him... and there is a different sacred sword in the lake from a former king, but it didn't play a great role and they could have left the whole sword thing off except it helped the confused ending. Now on the moon he meets a tribe of truth and discovers his world is lies...or at least alternative facts. They need to learn how to fight to defend themselves against the Dominion who we know are bad because they dress in black. The moon people live in tent villages that are slightly less than level 1 elf tents in Elvenar. And PLOT SPOILER, Warrior has a plan to kill the Emperor by getting next to him by bringing him a princess to add to his collection...something clearly inspired by \"Death Race 2000.\" Warrior has flashbacks learning from his father and talking to the old king in dreams. The lake ending was unexpected and I am not certain what it meant, but was clearly the best thing about the film.<br><br>The plot wasn't easy to follow especially with the merging world thing. The was no clear reason for the wars, seems the worlds had a lot of space to expand. The acting was DOA and the dialogue was weak. The fight choreography left much to be desired.<br><br>Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[28,34]}]
