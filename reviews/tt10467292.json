[{"title":"Animation Was Fairly Good","rating":8,"date":"12 January 2020","review":"The main positive, contrary to the cover photo, is that the animation quality was 3D &amp; surprisingly fairly natural in expressions &amp; movement, also the exotic backgrounds were interesting &amp; colorful. Probably more for the older grade school &amp; up to adult level storytelling. Some may not want to expose children to the few scenes with buffoon nasties, but the concept of good over coming bad is a good message for kids.","user":"westsideschl","rank":[0,0]}]
