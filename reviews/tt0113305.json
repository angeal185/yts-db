[{"title":"Am I insane or . . .","rating":6,"date":"9 November 2003","review":"Maybe I'm crazy, but the exact things that everyone seems to find wrong with the movie are the things that I think makes it good.  Like everyone was saying that all of the white characters are bad and all of the black characters are good, when that is apparently not the case.  Why does Remy become a skinhead?  Because the black guys in his dorm rejected, humiliated, and belittled him.  In a way they drove him to it.  Who's to blame here? In no way does Singleton let the black characters off the hook here. Many of them are portrayed as violent and irrational.  Omar Epps's character is good example of where Singleton points out another dangerous attitude that has nothing to do with white people.  The character thought the world owed him a break because he was black and underprivileged and the teacher is the one to call him on it.  Or as someone in a another post pointed out, sorry to quote you, \"Black self-pity,\" which the film does not excuse, but rather addresses with the same skepticism as it does the more generic issues everyone else seems to be concentrating on (racism, neo-naziism, date rape, lesbian cults.) So ask yourself, did this film genuinely leave you with the impression that it glorifies the behvoir of certain characters based on their race?  Or is it maybe just that since the director is black you have a preconceived notion that he will be partial to the black characters?<br><br>So where a lot of people seem to think the message is black=good white=evil, I see it as It doesn't matter who's wrong and who's right because we need to put our differences aside and get along (almost equally clichee, I know, but still a different message entirely) Signed, white dude","user":"Molotov_Clocktail","rank":[127,154]},{"title":"Must have seen a different movie","rating":6,"date":"6 May 2002","review":"I must have been watching a different movie to most of the people adding comments. I didn't see it as a film portraying African Americans as good and whites as bad but as a film in which all the factions were shown to have good and bad sides. Even the guy who becomes the Nazi skinhead was portrayed sympathetically in as much as he is clearly out of his depth in a social situation and becomes a recruit because only the skinheads will accept him when no-one else will. Overall, the African Americans come out as the most sympathetic but not by much.<br><br>I agree there are some fairly silly stereotypes, especially Fishburne's character, but they work in the context of the movie. Most refreshing was the fact that an American college is portrayed as a place with real issues like racism and date rape and drunken behaviour. It's refreshing because colleges are usually shown as places where nice middle-class kids never have any problem bigger than being dumped by their boyfriends before everything is resolved in the last reel.<br><br>An overly maligned movie. Not perfect but better than a million other college movies. Loved the ending too.","user":"Basilisk-6","rank":[73,88]},{"title":"Forces you to form your own opinions","rating":8,"date":"21 September 2002","review":"I have read a lot of reviews for this movie where people accuse the film of promoting stereotypes, and that it portrays whites in a negative light.  I really think that those who wrote those reviews missed the point.<br><br>1)  There ARE stereotypes in this movie.  It's intentional.  Not every white character in this movie is portrayed as a skinhead, as some reviewers may have lead you to believe.  Not every black character in this movie is portrayed as a victim either.  In order for people to overcome racial stereotypes, we have to at least take a good look at what other races see when they look at us, and this movie does a good job of that.  There are also characters (both black and white) who try to persuade Omar Epps' character to not use his race as an excuse to \"play the victim,\" so I really don't see this movie as \"one sided\".<br><br>2)  The rape scene, where some reviewers complain that Kristy Swanson's character gave consent, wasn't supposed to be a clear cut, \"awful drunk bad-guy\" rape.  In order for people to understand the causes and effects of date rape, we need to take a closer look at where the line is between right and wrong, and this movie does a good job of asking the viewer where that line is.<br><br>There are other situations where characters choose violence and revenge rather than thinking of a better solution.  But - some of these situations seem justified, and others do not.  Once again, you as the viewer have to decide if what you're seeing is right or wrong.<br><br>I must admit that I was troubled by the portrayal of the campus security as being overly suspicious of blacks, and overly sympathetic towards whites.  But this movie is meant to ask questions; not suggest that ALL white security guards are this way.  The fact that I am troubled by this portrayal means that I was forced to think about what suspicions are justified, and which are not.  This movie is full of things that make you take a stand one way or another.  It's not meant to make you feel comfortable, or to decide for you...<br><br>If you like movies that overtly tell you what you're supposed to think, you may misinterpret this movie.  But if you want to see thought-provoking film that will make you ask yourself a lot of questions on where you stand, I recommend seeing this film.  Great performances by Epps, Swanson, and Michael Rappaport.  I was even pleasantly surprised by Tyra Banks performance.  8 out of 10 stars.","user":"beeohbeecrow","rank":[6,6]}]
