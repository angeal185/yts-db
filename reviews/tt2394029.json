[{"title":"Not your typical music documentary - A fast paced emotional roller coaster","rating":10,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"A fascinating watch even if you are not necessarily into this music scene. You are taken on fast paced and emotionally journey through James Lavelle's career. This is not your typical music documentary. It shows some quite raw and difficult to watch moments when Lavelle is at his lowest. The humour sprinkled throughout, especially from interviews with Josh Homme really make this film sparkle.","user":"lulabula","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Incredible film - one the most honest music documentaries I've ever seen","rating":10,"date":"10 September 2018","review":"I really loved this film - such an honest exploration of a unique part of music history and the mad rollercoaster that is James Lavelle's life - not your yourself artist promo pretending to be a documentary. There's some amazing home footage of DJ Shadow and some really funny interviews with all the different people Lavelle has worked with. If you happen to be fans of Joshua Homme, Thom Yorke, Ian Brown there's some great interviews and never before seen studio footage of them. Even if you don't know about the music or this era it's just a really honest and relatable, human story that makes you laugh and cry at different moments. There's also some great music that makes up the soundtrack - so I highly recommend this film to everyone.","user":"lee_h_99","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Excellent!","rating":9,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"Without a doubt, The Man From Mo'Wax is one of the best music documentaries I have ever watched. From start to finish, the movie is so well edited with so much great footage and gives a honest view on the ups and downs on the career of James Lavelle.","user":"non-grata","rank":[2,2]}]
