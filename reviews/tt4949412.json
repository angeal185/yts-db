I'm both. Right off the bat one can tell the movie is lower budget. The little girl is the Star here. Jason London looks alot older here. But it could be how he was dressed and made up for the role. In real life he owns and operates a Ranch and rides Horses.<br><br>As for the Fox? It's adorable. There is also a subplot involving two foreign Animal control people after our furry Friend. Plus a neighbor named Mrs. Crabtree. Dad also has a surprise. It's also been 2 years since Amanda's Mom died.<br><br>It's obvious the movie was made modestly. But the Fox is cute. And the actress playing Amanda isn't annoying like some kid actors can be. The movie is a bit all over the place. But it's a good clean movie. Nothing bad and no double innuendos.<br><br>I knew what I was signing up for buying a movie about an adorable Fox. Adults may not enjoy it. But kids and fans of clean movies will probably enjoy it. Runtime is about 62 minutes. Could've been a bit longer. But it's a good length given it's demographic.","user":"Forca84","rank":[1,1]}]
