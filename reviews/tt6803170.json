[{"title":"Amateurish Production and Poor Storytelling","rating":1,"date":"25 November 2018","review":"Even before we reach the end of the 30 minute exposition (which takes up 1/3 of the film) the way in which the film begins is cringey (to the point where it's almost unwatchable) and incredibly unengaging.<br><br>The dialogue is awkward and doesn't suit the characters, and the action was overexaggerated and unrealistic. The idea had merit, but the way in which it was told was beyond poor.<br><br>The editing on the film takes it into a whole other level of ridiculous (especially in one particular scene where they decided to slow down the footage for dramatic effect and throw terrible reaction shots into the sequence).<br><br>The acting wasn't particularly great but then again the cast was mainly comprised of children so I imagine the fault for the lies with the Director.<br><br>It looks like a middle school media club project.","user":"geenasharmasingh","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"terrible amateur movie","rating":1,"date":"26 February 2019","review":"Even heston couldn't save a movie like this....waste of my time","user":"lesliewhitlock","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Very poor","rating":3,"date":"17 December 2018","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this very amateurish production.
