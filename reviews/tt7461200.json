[{"title":"A rollercoaster ride","rating":21,"date":"21 October 2018","review":"The Oath is an example of a relatively new genre that I suppose we can expect to see more of: the political horror movie. The thumbnail describes it cheerfully as \"a man struggles to keep his politically divided family from falling apart over the Thanksgiving holiday.\" Nuh uh. It's actually a plausible scenario for a fascist takeover in America. Appropriately, it sneaks up on you. It starts out as a light comedy -- a good excuse to munch through a bucket of popcorn -- then seems to veer off course, becoming uncomfortably raw. And then things head south. Predictably some critics have called it out for inconsistency of tone -- missing the point. Billy Magnusson steals the show with a late appearance as an agent for the Citizens Protection Unit.","user":"mightythor47","rank":[75,111]},{"title":"Well i enjoyed it & I'm not American","rating":9,"date":"30 December 2018","review":"I'm assuming all the hate for this movie is from Trump supporters, even though it has nothing to do him &amp; nor is he even mentioned in the movie. I enjoyed it, a) because it's the kind of thing that I wouldn't be surprised happening in the US &amp; b) its very reminiscent of what I've directly seen happen to families &amp; friends over Brexit (Well apart from the CPU part of the movie)\nOk the acting is pretty naff in spots but overall, it's a good film &amp; it keeps you on edge watching it unfold.","user":"alfieosullivan","rank":[64,96]},{"title":"Pay close attention to the closing scene !!!","rating":10,"date":"5 January 2019","review":"Everything that happens in this story is as American as Apple Pie.<br><br>Thanksgiving is the setting. Giving thanks for what this country is suppose to be all about. You can divide the characters into three types of people -<br><br>1. Those that go along to get along.\n2. Those who think they own the truth.\n3. And those that will oppose oppression and blatant injustice despite the consequences.<br><br>This movie is so topical in every American generation; how other reviewers miss this is a mystery to me! It's worth multiple watching to see the passion Barinholtz brings to light.","user":"cekadah","rank":[41,60]}]
