[{"title":"Ok if you're not seeking innovation.","rating":6,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"I enjoyed this one but what holds it back is any sort of non paint by the numbers story. Noah Centineo plays \"Brooks Rattigan\" (come on guys come up with a real name) a good poor kid who has set his sites on Yale and the good life. While doing this he comes up with the idea for an app to be like a task rabbit for dating. (actually good idea). However, he soon finds that he is losing himself to pretending to be whomever for the app and some of his real life friends are getting tried of being stood up and ignored. My only thought on this was it didn't seem that Brooks was doing anything wrong per se. The script sort of had to twist itself around to have the \"dark moment\" and his friends came off a little selfish not to let him have this new thing in his life. Of course, he does learn that yearning after the good life and Yale has its drawbacks and isn't all it seems to be. There is a romance with Laura Marano \"Celia\" but it was definitely very BFF. I didn't get any sort of romantic vibe.","user":"LukeCustomer2","rank":[66,78]},{"title":"It is my own fault","rating":3,"date":"13 April 2019","review":"I can't believe I let myself watch another Netflix teen movie and so I should not be surprised that once again the credits have started to roll and I have wondered what I could have done with my life during the last 90mins that I have wasted. We do like that Noah Centineo plays another \"Noah Centineo\" character with his charming, adorkable smile but his almost non-existent romantic chemistry with Laura Marano had me hoping they'd just stay friends by the end of the film. Also, please stop with the pop-song-montage of scenes that took place during the movie, at the end of the film - I just watched the whole movie, I don't need to watch it again.","user":"kateb-19665","rank":[99,122]},{"title":"Predictable and Cliche but overall cute","rating":8,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"Aside from its obvious predictability i found this film to be cute and heartwarming.The actor who plays the protagonist often plays these kinds of roles but does so quite well. The awkward quirky eventual love interest is adorable at best. Gay black friend is a nice change from the usual token black guy however i found his acting somewhat weak and his part was rather small. Perhaps if he were given a back story and some more depth to his character the movie could have shown a little more meaning. Don't get me wrong the message was a nice one but maybe a little too basic and let's face it he still has some growing up to do. He mentioned he was 18 but learning 1 lesson does not maketh man.","user":"sketchpoetjon","rank":[32,37]}]
