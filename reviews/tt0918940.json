[{"title":"(heavy sigh) It's OK, but it could have been great","rating":7,"date":"10 July 2016","review":"The core Tarzan story is not only iconic, it speaks to something deep within us. It is at the same time the ultimate Romance and the ultimate Action tale. It is no coincidence that, almost a century ago, when young Hollywood looked to find a franchise for its new \"talkie\" motion pictures, they turned to the Tarzan tale, and spawned a franchise so successful that it literally outlived the shelf life of its star.<br><br>In my lifetime I have seen well over a dozen versions, retellings and re-imaginings of the Tarzan story. I have no doubt that after I am gone, producers and writers will continue to be attracted to it and continue to \"make their bones\" by bending it to their unique style.<br><br>That said, this one is not especially good. After a great opening scene, there is the filmic equivalent of \"dead air\" for about 35 minutes and when the script does finally get in gear it stumbles and falls, subject to a wildly disjointed narrative and equally bizarre editing.<br><br>Alexander Skarsg√•rd has been impressive in other films (a race driver, a superhero) and I think with different material and a different director he could have connected. Christoph Waltz and Sam Jackson remain two of the most over-exposed stars in Hollywood and, good as they are, they are running out of clever ways to play the same character over and over. And over. And over.","user":"A_Different_Drummer","rank":[57,83]},{"title":"It will have you screaming from the trees","rating":1,"date":"10 July 2016","review":"How, in this modern day, with such high standards of education and courses on script writing and film making, can a big budget film like this one be so bad? It was only because we watched in it Gold Class, in comfortable seats and with food service, that we didn't walk out.<br><br>After about fifteen minutes my partner leaned over to me and asked when anything was going to happen (in the movie that is). I couldn't help her.<br><br>In fact my seat was so comfortable, and the movie so bad, that I fell asleep three times.<br><br>When my partner told me she thought this was the worst movie ever, and that she was confused, I couldn't help her again - I'd been asleep.<br><br>I did however witness the butterfly land on Jane's shoulder, then fly off. What a beautiful CGI scene. Totally irrelevant to the plot or story, and I'm still not sure why it was included.<br><br>Then there was the scene when giant ostriches nearly trample Tarzan and his mate. At last, I thought, something is going to happen. Tarzan's mate asks Tarzan what did the Ostrich say. Tarzan replies something like - \"The Ostrich is telling you it can trample you.\" And then, the Ostriches run off. That's the last we see of them. Confused? I was.<br><br>The writers and director don't know whether Tarzan is Spider Man, Batman or some other action hero - but he certainly isn't Tarzan.<br><br>The poor old apes get a very bad rap here. They are huge, aggressive monsters with razor sharp teeth.<br><br>This movie is a showcase of when bad script writing, bad directing and masses of CGI meet.<br><br>I can only recommend this film to people watching it on late night TV, when they need to be put to sleep.<br><br>What would Tarzan say about this movie: AwwwwwwOaaaaaaaaWhaaaaaa<br><br>On a side note, it is interesting to see that people that rate this movie high, usually have only one review in their list - this one. This usually means that they have some connection to the film.<br><br>(Edit 2 days later) I rest my case. After posting this review, 6 positive reviews have been posted after mine, all saying this is the greatest movie ever, and 4 of the reviewers have only 1 review to their name - this movie, and the other two reviewers have 2 reviews to their name. With a ratio of 6 biased reviews to 1 honest review, no wonder it is getting so hard to trust the IMDb rating system anymore.","user":"jb07-660-944395","rank":[219,357]},{"title":"I've seen stencil graffiti with more depth than this","rating":3,"date":"7 July 2016","review":"If you want to see a painfully unoriginal and unengaging story of paint-by-number characters getting at it in the green room for 90% of the time, go see this movie.<br><br>The most deplorable thing about this movie - aside from the plot being an incoherent mess - is the way the villains are portrayed as caricatures, and the good guys as saints who can do no wrong. I don't know about you, but when the villains are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths with no real motive or character, I lose interest in the story.<br><br>tl;dr lots of CG, completely two-dimensional characters and a plot that could've been auto-generated with a smartphone app.","user":"fortheloveofcinema","rank":[249,419]}]
