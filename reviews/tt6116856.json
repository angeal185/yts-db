Brutal, gruesome, gritty, relentless action extravaganza.","rating":10,"date":"29 October 2018","review":"What an amazing action/horror film it is man.\nYes, u heard it rite. U can call it a horror film too. The amount of non stop kills, stabbings, brutal n insane violent scenes, the non stop splatter is far more than in any recent horror films.\nComing back to the action, the choreography of the fight scenes is top notch. It is a non stop action extravaganza for fans of the genre. There r too many brutal action scenes. The pool ball scene with the scalp attached to it may upset some viewers.\nWith Iko Uwais as the villain, Joe Taslim as the man seeking redemption, Julie Estelle as the badass femme fatale n Zack Lee as the strong n daring junkie, then u probably get a solid action film.\nHats off to Timo Tjahjanto (Macabre, segments from Vhs 2 n ABC's of death, Killers n Headshot).\nKill Bill, John Wick, Rambo n Expendables looks like kindergarten in front of this film.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[83,123]},{"title":"The Raid 3 in all but name!","rating":10,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"I was hugely disappointed when RAID director Gareth Evans revealed that THE RAID 3 was never going to happen, but I'm delighted to report that THE NIGHT COMES FOR US is the next best thing. It's another breakneck Indonesian action flick with a routine plot, good actors, and astonishing and lengthy action sequences. Joe Taslim - the SWAT team leader in THE RAID - plays the hero, a former assassin who leaves his old life but find it coming after him. Iko Uwais is unusually cast as the villain while Julie Estelle - THE RAID 2's Hammer Girl - appears as an assassin. This film boasts a series of incredibly violent martial arts fights that utilise all manner of props and weaponry in a bid to destroy and disable the human body in as many creative ways as possible. The fight choreography is crisp and clear, the actors obviously skilled at what they do, and the pulse-pounding mayhem never lets up; it's hard to pick a favourite fight when there are so many stand-out moments here. What I can say is that the bloodshed is incredibly explicit, making this by far the most gruesome action film I've ever watched. And I can't wait to see it again!","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[76,115]}]
