[{"title":"Good movie with good acting","rating":7,"date":"4 August 2018","review":"I didn't expect much when I watched that movie and I actually really liked it. Ok, I just love Kristen Bell so I might not be 100% objective here...\nHowever it's a cute story with true to life characters. Might not be original, and the (happy) ending was pretty obvious but I imagine that's what we need once in a while. I thought it was a simple story, not too cheesy with endearing characters that I could relate to. When reading some of the reviews I was really surprised to see how many people didn't like that film. Even if it's not the movie of the year, it doesn't deserve so much hatred. I guess it just depends on what you like. So if you enjoy comedy/drama movies, give it a try and make your own opinion.","user":"odree-50206","rank":[55,69]},{"title":"Enjoyable and touching.","rating":8,"date":"5 August 2018","review":"Kelsey Grammer and Kristen Bell have good chemistry.
