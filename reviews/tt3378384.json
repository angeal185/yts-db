[{"title":"Evangelical Christian-themed drama","rating":1,"date":"30 June 2019","review":"TAPESTRY is a Evangelical Christian-themed drama that repeats the plots of many other Evangelical Christian films: bad things happen to a very good Christian person and that person copes by adopting an Evangelical Christian worldview., These films comfort believers by buttressing their existing beliefs, whilst attempting to entice troubled non believers into adopting Evangelical Christianity as an answer to their problems. Producers, directors, and investors of these films, themselves Evangelical, focus on their messianic message whilst all other aspects of filmaking are given short shrift. This film no exception. Believers are comforted whilst others might come away disappointed as the film itself is so poorly executed. I should note here that Morman Church affiliated production companies put out scores of this genre promoting the Morman-Christian worldview, but with more money so production values are somewhat better.","user":"gsaint09","rank":[16,26]},{"title":"Tapestry is a heart-warming movie the entire family will love ...","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2019","review":"Tapestry touches on themes everyone can identify with - life, family, love, work, redemption - woven into a tapestry of story that everyone should see. It's a heart-warming drama that keeps you engaged from beginning to end. I highly recommend it.","user":"JeffreyMRose","rank":[8,19]},{"title":"Tapestry","rating":9,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"An in- depth exploration of complex family and business relationships in the face of an imminent death in the family and the pressures of 'pliable' corporate ethics.\nThe challenges of personal Faith are highlighted with strong performances by a sensitive cast.","user":"robinaldrich","rank":[5,11]}]
