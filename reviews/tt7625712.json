[{"title":"Don't blame the kids...","rating":2,"date":"9 November 2018","review":"KIds are often the weaker elements in movies, but not in this one.<br><br>The writing is so bad I had to check to see whether it was actually one of the teenage actors who'd written the movie. No, it's an adult. The dialog is stilted and facile, and the story alternates between weak and cliched.<br><br>The acting by the adults is appalling. Just because it's low-budget doesn't mean the acting has to be terrible. (See \"Primer\".)<br><br>And the cinematography and direction are terrible too.<br><br>This is a terrible movie - but don't blame the kids.","user":"TimBell","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Oh Dear","rating":1,"date":"12 November 2018","review":"It was embarrassing to watch.\nA total waste of time.","user":"g_y_t","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Don't review a movie if you've decided you're gonna hate it before starting!","rating":6,"date":"8 November 2018","review":"I only watched this because a flat headed reviewer decided that they were going to hate it as soon as they heard ' Teenage Secret Agents '.....!<br><br>No point in deciding against a visual experience based on 3 written words, you may as well make the choice not to watch it.<br><br>As it goes, not a bad movie at all! Good for a fun watch when there is nothing else.<br><br>If you are a young teen, you will enjoy it, If you are an adult you will accept it for what it is.","user":"interaxcontracts","rank":[7,14]}]
