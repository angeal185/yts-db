[{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2017","review":"I knew this was bad but had no idea that it will be that bad. So this movie was about a high school boy who tries to throw a college party. As the story primarily revolves around this so called party one might assume it will be an awesome party, but it is not it is plain and simply awful.<br><br>The script was poorly written, there were characters with no back story and a lot of unnecessary characters for no apparent reason. Story has no twist or big reveal either. Most of the times the writer will give a lame reason for the characters actions out of nowhere.<br><br>Acting was horrible. It looked like I was watching amateur homemade video with very bad lighting. Actors and actresses were delivering dialogues like a news reader mostly without any emotion. And the background sound work was also sloppy.<br><br>So my advice is to avoid this one.<br><br>NOT RECOMMENDED.","user":"niaz_islam","rank":[15,21]},{"title":"Surprisingly good","rating":10,"date":"18 April 2017","review":"i never expect much of movies these days as I've been burned so many times, so i always go in expecting the worse. This is a pretty decent film for what it is. The cast for the most part are likable (except the older sister who i couldn't stand), the locations while not outrageously exciting or exotic, provide just enough to make do. There's bits of nudity so cant complain there, the odd funny scene and wtf/awww yeah moment. That said there's some sound issues where the sound will just go skitzo, luckily this isn't a common occurrence so can be over looked. I think if this had a big budget it could be truly epic. So on that basis i give it a 10/10 based on it being a B-movie. There's way way worse to spend a couple of hours, believe me","user":"Callam_10","rank":[0,9]}]
