[{"title":"Give this film a try before watching J J Abrams Overlord.","rating":8,"date":"10 September 2018","review":"Got enticed into seeing this film after watching the trailer n found it to b a decent one time watch.\nFans of Outpost, Blood creek, Deathwatch, may like this low budget film.\nAs a fan of horror films set during the world war, especially dealing with the nazi occult n nazi experiments, i enjoyed this film. Much better than ur regular zombie/virus film.\nConsidering the budget, the movie has only a few zombie n gun shot violence scenes but brutal.\nThere is tension and a sense of dread throughout. The actors acted well n the best part is the music.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[51,57]},{"title":"The Bunker meets The Strain with a WWI twist.......","rating":6,"date":"17 September 2018","review":"Trench 11 borrows from films like The Bunker and mixes in elements of the TV series The Strain, in a WWI setting.<br><br>The best thing you can say about this upper end of the budgetary spectrum B grade film its is competently done. The sets are good, the special effects good and the acting is, well, good. <br><br>Sadly there is nothing that makes this film \"great\" or even a little special. Don't be surprised therefore, if a month or so from now you can't remember the title or much more than the general outline of the story. A watchable but forgettable rating of 6/10 from me.","user":"s3276169","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"worth a watch","rating":7,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"This film is well worth a watch, obviously low budget but well made..some reviewers take themselves too serious for me, lots more more films out there worst than this..give it a go..","user":"petepiano","rank":[23,29]}]
