[{"title":"Excellent MotoGP documentary, focuses on the great Valentino Rossi.","rating":28,"date":"28 October 2012","review":"The subject is motorcycle racing. A very specific kind, the worldwide MotoGP division which features the most expensive, highest power/weight ratio motorcycles. Imagine a 350 pound motorcycle with a motor that generates over 200 HP. Not only is that sort of motorcycle very fast, at times racing at over 220 MPH, but they are tricky and one mistake can throw the rider off and result in lots of damage. Damage to the rider and to the bike. But to win at that level the rider has to be riding \"on the edge\" almost all the time.<br><br>The film is narrated by Ewan McGregor and features quite a number of riders in its 1 hour 50 minutes running time. But most of the attention is on two riders, the great Valentino Rossi who has been the best for over a dozen years, and the newcomer, JorgÃ« Lorenzo, who seems to be destined to be the next \"great\" one.<br><br>The film is a good mix of interviews, practice sessions, exciting race footage, and spectacular crashes. Any fan of motorcycles and especially racing will enjoy this.","user":"TxMike","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Brilliant, even if you're not into motorcycling","rating":9,"date":"28 May 2018","review":"Brilliant documentary on MotoGP, in particular the career of Valentino Rossi. Does for MotoGP what the documentary \"Senna\" did for Formula 1 - it's that good. <br><br>I don't follow motorcycle racing, not that I mind it, but after this I wish I had, especially during some of Rossi's epic races. Details the struggle, pain and glory of MotoGP in unflinching detail.<br><br>Definitely worth watching, even if you aren't into motorcycling.","user":"grantss","rank":[1,1]}]
