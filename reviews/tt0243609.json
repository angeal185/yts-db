[{"title":"The powerful, true story of what REALLY happened on the River Kwai during WW2.","rating":24,"date":"24 April 2002","review":"THROUGH THE VALLEY OF THE KWAI, the story of British POW's forced to build the Japanese jungle railroad, was my favorite book when it came out in 1962. Thus I was a bit apprehensive at what filmmakers would do to it when I heard about TO END ALL WARS, the title itself being changed. The film is different in many ways from the book, but is so powerful that the addition (apparently for dramatic excitement) of fictional characters bent on staging an escape can be forgiven. Agnostic Ernest Gordon's story of his being nursed back from the brink of death by Christian friends, thereby starting him on the road to faith--and incredibly, understanding and then forgiveness of the harsh brutality of his Japanese captors--raises this film far above any other WW2 films that I have seen (except perhaps the under-rated THE THIN RED LINE, like TO END...also filled with philosophical questions and ruminations). Although the brutality of the Japanese bushito system is shown in all its horrific brutality, some of the Japanese, especially the young man who serves as interpreter, are depicted as having touch of humanity. The film's central thesis seems to depict the affects of clinging to anger and vengeance versus seeking to be able to forgive and reconcile. The latter is shown at the end of the film when, similar to the scene in SCHINDLER'S LIST, the real Capt. Ernest Gordon and Japanese interpreter Nagase, now old men, meet and shake hands in Thailand at a memorial to those who died building the railroad. The creativity of the men, forming a Jungle University where Plato and Shakespeare are taught, is celebrated, calling to mind the inspiring film of women POW's, PARADISE ROAD.<br><br> When this thought-inspiring film finally is released to theaters or video, don't miss it. It can serve as an antidote to the dozens of mindless, vengeance-based flicks cluttering up the screens of our cinemaplexes.","user":"mcnulty","rank":[52,57]},{"title":"powerful story","rating":8,"date":"6 March 2004","review":"In a Japanese POW camp, a Scottish band of soldiers learns about a very different culture - the hard way.  They also learn from the more refined and educated among them the meaning of serving each other and their enemies, to the point of self-sacrifice.  <br><br>The film begins rather slowly (and overly-sentimental) but becomes an incredible story with great acting and characters, powerful philosophy and imagery.  Many gripping moments of self-realization, facing reality and appreciation for life and death.  The depth of relationships, self-sacrifice and lessons learned leaves the audience with a lot to process.  Overall, very inspiring and well-made.","user":"FilmLabRat","rank":[37,41]},{"title":"Deeply absorbing tale of the power to forgive","rating":10,"date":"23 October 2005","review":"It was not until the end of the film that I discovered that this was a real life account of the horrors suffered by the allied POW's building the Burma railroad.<br><br>No film can ever show how terrible it was, despite the attempt to film in sequence with the actors dieting in order to lose weight as time went on. The actors would have had to do three years manual labor in the jungle heat for 18 hours a day on 1,000 (or less) calorie meatless slop, while suffering dysentery, beri beri, pellagra, tropical ulcers, regular beatings and other cruelty, all the time unaware of what was happening at home or how the war was going. They lived under the constant fear of being killed once they were no longer useful. By the time they were liberated the survivors were walking skeletons.<br><br>It is a credit to the filmmakers that this relatively low budget movie conveys this terrible period so well and the fo. This should be a \"must see\" in school history classes.","user":"emuir-1","rank":[31,34]}]
