[{"title":"Double Mac and Jackson please!","rating":7,"date":"25 January 2009","review":"Soul Man is was it is... crude, rude, and genuinely funny. It has two of the hardest working actors in showbiz - the late great Bernie Mac and Samuel L Jackson as two has been soul stars on a road trip to a funeral / tribute concert of the late great Marcus Hook (John Legend).<br><br>This is comedy at full speed, it makes no apologies and takes no prisoners - but is also genuinely full of laughs.<br><br>All in all I think Mac wouldn't mind this being his last movie - never a man for great subtlety here the pair look like they had a lot of fun making this and the best bits are the improv off-script rants.<br><br>It's no comedic masterpiece, and the plot is cheesy, and the whole thing is just a beer and pizza adventure - but you have to admire the energy and fun.<br><br>A fitting tribute to Bernie Mac who loved life and people and was a very very, very hard-working stand-up comic.","user":"intelearts","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078","rating":8,"date":"26 February 2013","review":"Soul Men was a film that was racked with problems right from the start. Originally the film kept getting pushed back because of a law suit by the R&amp;B group, Sam &amp; David, which claimed it to be a farce on their life story. The group also accused the producers of copyright infringement for using their style and the title of one of their songs, \"Soul Man\". The law suit was finally settled and the movie was released in 2008. Then, days before the films release, two of it's stars, Bernie Mac and Issac Hayes, died on back to back days, a tragedy that created a public relations nightmare. For those reasons, this film wasn't widely distributed or advertised, which is a shame because it was one terrific film. The story starts 30 years after a legendary R&amp;B group, Marcus Hooks &amp; The Real Deal, broke up. We see the remaining members, Samuel L. Jackson in trouble with the law, and Bernie Mac, living in a retirement community, when they learn about the sudden death of Hooks. Record executives, quick to capitalize on his death, organize a tribute show at the Apollo in New York, and invite the Real Deal to participate. This means that two men who hate each other and haven't performed in almost 30 years, need to get their act together in a hurry if they want the big pay day and a chance at a come back. The film is an absolute riot, with Mac as the old lonely man and Jackson as the bitter forgotten convict. Their chemistry was nothing short of amazing and the big surprise was that both men can actually sing and dance! Even though they must have said mother f'er about a thousand times, I found the film to be very clever, funny, and original. If it wasn't for all the problems it had, this movie would have done much better than it did and it is without a doubt, worth watching.","user":"Tss5078","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"A soulful comedy for all tastes","rating":10,"date":"7 November 2008","review":"I had a chance to see an advance screening of Soul Men and I must say it's a highly enjoyable comedy that's a true testament to the comedic skills of both Samuel L. Jackson and the late great Bernie Mac. The trailer pretty much explains the plot, so there's no need to go into detail here but I will say that more than music the film for me was about the friendship between the characters portrayed by Mac &amp; Jackson. Jackson who in my opinion has never handled lead comedic roles very well has a chance to shine here. As for Mac in his last role he's in top form and the comedic chemistry of the two is reminiscent of the Bill Cosby &amp; Sidney Poitter vehicles of the seventies. As for the supporting roles Affion Crockett has a few scene stealing moments and the lovely Sharon Leal continues to make a name for herself. The direction by Malcolm D. Lee is sharp and on par with his previous films Roll Bounce &amp; Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, while the script by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone is the duo's best script since 1999's Life. Watching the end credits of the film which is a heart warming tribute to Mac we given in a chance to look into a man who was more than a comic but an entertainer who loved his craft. Soul Men is a film filled with plenty of soul and is easily one of Mac's best films.","user":"DunnDeeDaGreat","rank":[26,31]}]
