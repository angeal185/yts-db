[{"title":"Halloween Parade","rating":29,"date":"29 September 2000","review":"I always loved watching this on CBS when I was a kid.  I even loved the commercials.  They were always either Dolly Madison or McDonald's commercials.  That seems like a strange thing to mention but I felt it added something extra to this special.  I loved the look of the show.  All the oranges and reds and other fall colors.  From the pumpkin carving opener, the pumpkin patch, Snoopy's fantasy World War I adventures as he makes his way across the French countryside, to the beautiful musical score, it all adds up to one great Halloween experience.  Taking you back to a simpler time when the world seemed more innocent.  We'll miss you Charlie Schultz.","user":"newnoir","rank":[38,42]},{"title":"20-something Ponders Childhood","rating":10,"date":"23 October 2004","review":"Although thousands of Halloween TV specials bombard us each October, one stands out as a can't-miss for anyone with children or anyone who ever was a child. The complete lack of scariness makes this the classic feel-good movie of the season. It is one film that is appropriate for children of every age, even very young children. It brings up the same nostalgic feelings that the Peanuts comic strip does, and gets me in the Halloween spirit every year. If you haven't seen it yet, spend some time this October to watch it with the children in your life. It's perfect with warm popcorn and orange candy corn. So for a change from the movies that give you nightmares, try the Halloween special that will give you sweet dreams of great pumpkins.","user":"ONUcoqui2001","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"Great Halloween feature!","rating":10,"date":"18 October 2003","review":"This is a very good animated feature! It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown is very funny and I am surprised it is still poplar today! If you get chance to watch it then do so because it is really a classic and great for Halloween!","user":"Movie Nuttball","rank":[16,18]}]
