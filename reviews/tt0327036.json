[{"title":"Criticize this...","rating":8,"date":"17 October 2011","review":"Martin Lawrence explains in the first few minutes of his comedy special dubbed Runteldat that he isn't waiting for E! True Hollywood to tell his s***, but is going to tell it in his own words and his own personal experiences. I normally say that some concert and stand-up films that go to theaters aren't really that special enough to go theatrical - but I think Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat posses a strong enough reason for such an honor.<br><br>\"Runteldat\" is a slang term for \"run and tell that.\" While it's not spoken throughout the whole film, it has a certain meaning to it which makes it worthy of the title choice. Lawrence is basically telling the audience members \"now that you know the true story, run and tell that!\" The special was shot at Constitution Hall in Washington D.C., and was directed by David Raynr. Raynr directed the seldom-seen Whatever it Takes which was truly a mixed bag of comedy and drama elements. Runteldat is also number eight on the list of films that uses the f word most frequently, clocking in at three-hundred and eleven uses. I, for one, am not offended by vulgarity if it is taken in a new and non-gratuitous manner. It may seem like nothing but unnecessary language, but once you get past it, the film becomes a pleasure and the vulgarity adds to the fun of the whole picture. After a while, you adapt and it becomes an unobtrusive quality.<br><br>Martin talks about every from sex, to drugs, to crime, to cops, to 9/11, the news, the media, and even the Cha Cha Slide and why he \"can't stand that f****** dance!\" The first seven minutes are devoted to a montage on Martin lashing out at the media. The message is unclear because I can't really see what they did wrong. They were reporting on him because he was arrested. Why is he getting mad? I don't know. The whole attack seems tiresome and drawn out, but once Martin gets a hold of the mic - anything goes.<br><br>When talking about critics, he says that can \"criticize deeeez nuts!\" When talking about the Cha Cha Slide he says \"STOP! Think about it.\" One of my favorite sketches is when he talks about the way blacks and whites react to getting pulled over. I'm white, and while I think I was supposed to be offended or insulted, I couldn't contain my laughter. When a film makes you think offensive material against yourself is hilarious - I can't help but give it the highest compliment I've given a comedy special.<br><br>I'm not easily offended because I feel that Martin isn't being racist as much as he is proving a point about how distant blacks and whites can be sometimes. If I found out he was being honest? I'd probably still laugh seeing as he has the gall to admit something like that. It's a win-win for him.<br><br>Another skit that was fabulous was when he discusses the differences between black and white parenting. He uses an example when a kid insults his mother, the mother sends him to timeout for \"emotional issues.\" He claims if you said that to a black mother, your timeout would be picking up your teeth, your molars, and getting your foot out of some place.<br><br>Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat is a comedy special of epic vulgar proportions. I can't sum it up to a solid degree. This isn't the raunchiest or best that I've seen, but since Lawrence has done a number of kid films it's nice to see him step up to the mic revealing his dirty side. I couldn't help but applaud at the end. The ambition and courage it took to get on the mic and say what he just said deserves some kind of award.<br><br>Performed by: Martin Lawrence. Directed by: David Raynr.","user":"StevePulaski","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Crude, basic and mostly unfunny show that will appeal to Lawrence's least demanding fan","rating":7,"date":"7 November 2006","review":"I had heard positive things about this concert film and had hear that even those unimpressed with Lawrence's films had to give him props. Although I have found his films to be puerile and unfunny more often than not I somehow find him personally to be pretty amusing in his delivery. So in a way I was quite looking forward to this film. Things didn't look that good early on as the film opens with a look back over the recent media controversy surrounding Lawrence and is essentially him putting two fingers up at all those who have, in his eyes, unfairly criticised and picked on him. It is embarrassing to watch as he seems to be telling us that the attention given him (as a global celebrity) is somehow unjustified.<br><br>I hoped this would just be the build-up under the credits and that the show would be a solid piece of stand up. Unfortunately he continues early on with him announcing he would tell his own story and so on but at least he soon got over it. But when his next topic was 9/11 I wished he had stayed where he was because in reality this section was nothing more than Lawrence racially attacking Muslims for all looking like Bin Laden and even a joke about how he had beaten up an Indian man behind stage just in case. He segues from this into the importance of beating your child (and indeed waiting for it outside the vagina so you can start kicking it then), material about sex after pregnancy (including a piece about \"titties\" that makes Benny Hill look like Oscar Wilde), bad drunks and the humour of domestic violence. Suffice to say that not of it is that funny and is about as basic as you can imagine.<br><br>By covering all this type of material Lawrence shows himself to be very much a base comedian in that his material appeals to an audience raised on sitcoms, swearing and who nod their heads and laugh uncontrollably at the most basic stereotypes and race clichés. His racist jibs are squarely aimed at every other culture apart from African-American, whereas with that group he seems to enjoy the failings of his culture. With people like Chris Rock and such you get it that they are critical of such things but with Lawrence he celebrates it. His material is predominately crude and tasteless, whether it is sexist, racist or just so broad that at times you sense he is close to losing some sections of the audience. Contrasting this with moments of trite insincerity just makes it even worse. There is no denying that he has good presence and runs the stage well but it is disappointing that he seems happy with such basic material.<br><br>Overall then a real disappointment of a show. The material is as basic as could be and rarely has any touch of invention or genuine wit across it. His audience mostly lap it up and I suppose those that have loved his recent films will love it  however the majority of us should not be taking their enjoyment as a recommendation. Crude and basic stuff throughout and only worth a look for those die-hard fans of Martin's brand of comedy.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[12,18]},{"title":"Truly Awful","rating":1,"date":"4 October 2008","review":"I saw this late at night on a minor channel and I put it on expecting a laugh or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I reckoned he might be a good stand-up comedian/actor in the style of Richard Pryor.<br><br>I couldn't have been more wrong. This concert was awful. It was full of racist comments directed at white people, Muslims and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same thing in Lawrence's narrow mind) and rambling, clichéd cod-philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist the urge to preach when given a platform. Do we really need a lecture on Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights struggle during a stand-up comedy show?). Then there were his fawning comments designed to ingratiate him with women, it made my skin crawl listening to him.<br><br>Worst of all, the show simply wasn't funny and I found it boring. I turned over halfway through and flipped back to find him either still preaching or going on and on and on about the birth of his child (there was no humour in the story of the birth of his child and it was self-indulgent on his part to bore us with the details. He clearly didn't have very much to say or he would have cut this section of the show out).<br><br>This show was rubbish: Runteldat!","user":"zofos","rank":[8,11]}]
