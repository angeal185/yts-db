[{"title":"Unbearable","rating":4,"date":"31 August 2010","review":"What can I say? This movie starts out good but after 45 minute it turns into a movie full of flaws. The camera-work was troublesome from the start but one could look over that since it's obviously a low budget film. The acting started out good, the tension was build up nicely, the plot was convincing but for some strange reason all kind of weird flaws popped up halfway trough. Main problem with the movie is botchy filmmaking. The viewer is pulled out of the movieworld and confronted with behind the scenes stuff like seeing some of the film-crew and inconsistent environments. This was totally preventable and shows how lazy this movie was put together. But that isn't the only problem: the plot also turns into laughable trash that is best suited as snooze material than an actual horror movie that pumps up the adrenaline. Maybe it was just me but I noticed that the actors involved couldn't squeeze out some of the absurd lines convincingly in the second half of he movie. This movie is not really interesting unless you're suffering from insomnia. 4/10","user":"IDTooLong","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"Unpleasant Characters in a Stupid Story","rating":2,"date":"18 November 2012","review":"In California, Nick (Brendan Michael Coughlin) decides to take a shortcut while driving his van to a steakhouse to celebrate his parents' anniversary with his girlfriend Christine (Katie Lowes), his estranged brother Sam (Patrick Scott Lewis) and his wife Liz (Mary Alexandra Stiefvater). Nick has a flat tire and a grizzly bear threatens the group but Sam discharges his pistol against it. When they are ready to go, the bear's mate attacks them capsizing their van. Along the night, they are trapped in the van and secrets are disclosed while they are attacked by the vengeful animal. <br><br>\"Bear\" is an awful movie with unpleasant characters and a stupid story. My first intention was to use the adjective unbearable, but then I noted that many reviews have already used it so I changed to awful. The most impressive is how a producer invests his money in such laughable story. My vote is two.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Perseguidos\" (\"Pursued\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"unbearable is an understatement","rating":1,"date":"4 December 2010","review":"This is my first review on here. I felt obligated to get an account to warn everyone I could about this. This ranks inï»¿ the top three worst movies of all time that I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. I seriously want my dollar back from Redbox. Go outside, lay down on the ground and play dead for 90 minutes, because it will be a lot more enjoyable than this was. A passing beetle will display better acting skills. I knew it was going to be low budget going in, but they could have at least made the fake bear stand in actually look like a bear. There didn't seem to be any attempt to make the bear's actions throughout the movie to be even halfway realistic. I don't know how I made it to the end, but if by some miracle you do ... be prepared for one of the most idiotic endings either.","user":"bornagain79","rank":[11,13]}]
