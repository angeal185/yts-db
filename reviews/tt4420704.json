[{"title":"Cool cats.","rating":12,"date":"12 March 2017","review":"\"Cats (unlike dogs) know that we're not God. They know we're just the middlemen.\" Interviewee <br><br>Let your inner cat take over and roam Istanbul with director Ceyda Torun as she produces a lovely documentary about the charmed lives of the 100,000 or more cats that benignly people the famous Turkish city. By focusing on the lives of seven cats, Torun effectively characterizes all those privileged felines.<br><br>Although this doc, Kedi (Turkish for \"cat\"), doesn't negate the generally accepted aloofness of cats or their notorious independence, it brings them alive as individual felines with attributes to make us love each one differently. Memorable are Psikopat (as in \"psychopath\"), a tough wife to a similar tuxedo, who fears her wrath, and Sari, an orange and white who cleverly forages for her beautiful brood.<br><br>As lovable as all the animal stars of this entertaining documentary are, the humans who take care of the cats (when they let them) are almost as affecting. The interviewees come forward with sayings and observations that are at times lovingly profound and at others just shy of New Age: \"I heal my wounds by healing theirs,\" says one cat lover after cooking 20 pounds of chicken for a daily entourage of appreciative strays.<br><br>This tone poem's veracity is slightly compromised by having minimal conflicts as the cats intrude multiple ways on Istanbul life. Kedi is a lyrical expression of love, but I've never heard of a city so pristine, virtually immaculate, while also having a robust street life that accommodates felines in such luxury. I guess I'll have to see for myself someday.<br><br>If you see Kedi, you will seek out boxes of kitties on street corners forever condemning you to cute and cool little beings never more alluring than on the streets of Istanbul.<br><br>\"Cats are the runes of beauty, invincibility, wonder, pride, freedom, coldness, self-sufficiency, and dainty individuality - the qualities of sensitive, enlightened, mentally developed, pagan, cynical, poetic, philosophic, dispassionate, reserved, independent, Nietzschean, unbroken, civilised, master-class men.\" H.

As the movie opens, we get a fabulous aerial view of the city, and then get to know a number of cats, starting with a female cat who is out hunting food on the streets, not for herself but as it turns out for her small kittens who are anxiously waiting her return. And that's just the start of this...<br><br>Couple of comments: if you don't care for cats, then by all means do yourself a favor and seek out another movie. If on the other hand you love cats, you are in for an absolutely delightful treat. Apparently as we learn in this film, Istanbul, itself a huge metropolis, is home to many street cats, and the city's population (at least for the most part) has taken upon itself to care for these cats, and to outright love them. The movie focuses on a handful of cats, all of them with their own personality (the \"fish thief\", the \"carefree\", the \"flirt\", etc.). A number of shots are filmed from the cat's perspective (i.e. close to ground level). Along the way, we get a fabulous look of what day-to-day life in Istanbul is like. At one point a woman comments \"it is difficult for women to express their femininity in this country, but the cats do it so gracefully\", a dig as to the social environment for women in Turkey, even in a cosmopolitan city like Istanbul. But in the end, it's all about the cats: they hunt, they play, they roam the streets, they fight, they climb, and along the way they steal your heart.<br><br>I had heard a glowing review of \"Kedi\" on NPR a week or two ago and when \"Kedi\" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening where I saw this at was PACKED, much to my surprise, and the audience absolutely LOVED the movie, laughing out loud many times throughout the movie. After the movie was over, I couldn't wait to get home, where I knew my beloved cat Mimic would be waiting for me ;-) If you love cats, you don't want to miss this, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. \"Kedi\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","user":"paul-allaer","rank":[84,92]},{"title":"Not Just for cat lovers","rating":10,"date":"21 July 2017","review":"This movie made me fall in love with my cats again. The beautiful cinematography and the limited story line was a treat to watch. I have always admired Turkey and after watching this I want to be there as quick as possible. Cat lovers are special people and we can see so many sweet people in there. I smiled so much looking at them with tears in my eyes. Thank you for this.","user":"irfanhussains","rank":[34,36]}]
