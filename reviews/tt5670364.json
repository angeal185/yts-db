[{"title":"Great story, OK film","rating":18,"date":"18 August 2019","review":"I love animal movies but this was just an average film (with great scenery and decent acting). Much of the film was hard to \"buy in to\" though. Jenna Ortega is a fine young actor and I'm confident she'll make better films in the future. Recommended, but don't go in with high expectations.","user":"gregorija","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"horrible abuse of these elephants","rating":1,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"Have Trunk Will Travel who supplied Tai and are now known as The Preserve.
