[{"title":"What was this???!","rating":1,"date":"13 September 2018","review":"Unfortunately I can't leave zero stars. Just awful! Acting was unbelievably ridiculous. Think I finished it cause I needed to kill time for the rest of my work shift. Do yourself a favor. Don't waste your time on this.","user":"karenkd","rank":[50,59]},{"title":"What?!","rating":1,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"They should have paid us for watching this poo!!!!\nThe acting was awful!! The teacher was a very muscular man, and he was unable to defend himself again a girl who couldn't weigh more than 100 lbs, truly. It was just awfulllllllllll &amp; terrible acting!!!!!","user":"Trasi-s28","rank":[32,37]},{"title":"So bad it's good","rating":4,"date":"23 November 2018","review":"This is one of those \"it's so bad it's good\" movies. Everything that happens is fairly predictable- the whole \"student falls in love with teacher and gets more and more insane throughout the movie\" trope- but still fun to watch. The acting actually isn't terrible. Give it a shot if you're in the mood for a cheesy suspense movie.","user":"aprilsfriendorin","rank":[14,15]}]
