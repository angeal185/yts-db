[{"title":"Before Britney, there was Steve.","rating":9,"date":"10 December 2001","review":"Privilege is one of those `lost' rarely screened masterpieces that always seem to end up on some critic's top-ten list, but you almost never know anyone who has seen the film. It is no wonder no one has seen this film  it has never been available on video (except for crummy bootlegs), it's not shown on television any longer and revival theatres have long since forgotten about it. Why?<br><br>Privilege has much more pertinence now than it did back in 1967. Paul Jones (lead singer of Manfred Mann) plays Steve Shorter, a British manufactured rock-n-roll icon, who is shaped and molded into a tool used to sell every product imaginable. In one humorous moment, the British Apple Growers Association, having harvested far too many apples to be sold, hire Steve to do a commercial convincing each British person to eat six apples a day.<br><br>\nTo the nation, Steve is a god. A symbol of everything that is pure and good. Steve can do no wrong. Unfortunately, Steve has no mind of his own and is easily led from concert-to-concert, commercial-to-commercial and meeting-to-meeting by his conniving, greedy managers. Everyone wants a piece of Steve. The mere mention of a product from Steve's lips will sway the entire nation's fashion sense  if Steve wears black, the whole country wears black. His managers know this and there is no organization they will not sell him out to.<br><br>`The Church', in an act to attract more young members into its congregation, hires Steve to convince the nation's youth to become God-fearing Christians. But, this does not sit well with Steve who is becoming more cognizant of his surroundings through the help of a young artist played by sixties supermodel, Jean Shrimpton. <br><br>Privilege, even though rarely shown, is a surreal motion picture every film fanatic and music historian should seek out. With teeny-bop stars like Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson and NSYNC sprouting up like so many invasive weeds, Privilege is very worthy of a second look. Hurry, please, before it is too late.","user":"gein","rank":[43,47]},{"title":"Seems (with the benefit of hindsight..) it was a prophetic film","rating":4,"date":"4 April 2004","review":"Corporate ownership of a rock star...hmm..Singing the message his corporate masters want him to sing...hmmm...Using pop songs to manipulate the ideas and thoughts of youth in the mold that is 'desirable' by 'those in charge'...hmmm  Naw, it'd never happen!!  Turns out this film was pre Beatles Apple (empire) and it turned out the idea was somewhat 'prophetic' I liked the film..I remember seeing it several times..bought the book, own two copies of the soundtrack.  (bought the Who's 'Who Sell Out' the same day...)  Neither Paul Jones and Jean Shrimpton were particularly brilliant actors, but they were able to convey the feelings of the time.  The late Michael Leanders music is still enjoyable and interesting..check out the film's version of 'Onward Christian Soldiers'  Overall, I would like to see this film again!","user":"feelthethunder","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"very interesting","rating":19,"date":"19 November 2004","review":"A film society at my school showed this movie for free in a lecture hall last night. Though nothing beats a free movie, the guy running the whole thing introduced it as one that had been totally panned by critics, never released on video, etc., which didn't make it sound very promising. They also showed the short film \"Lonely Boy\" just before \"Privilege\" (it's funny to hear Paul Anka's manager saying how no one will be as famous as Paul Anka ever again, knowing that only two short years later The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan). The film society also said that the director of \"Privilege\" watched \"Lonely Boy\" repeatedly, to get a feel for the mass hysteria and hero worship of teen idols.<br><br>\"Privilege\" is about pop star Steven Shorter, who has the teen population of Britain in the palm of his hand. Behind Steve, however, are the corporations and investors using him to control teens, which is pretty scary to think about, considering the same is very nearly true today. They decide everything for him: his appearance, what products he'll endorse, the songs he sings; and when he tries to break away and become an individual, that's it. The investors withdraw their support and the show's over. Steve controlled the public so well that with just one speech, he is able to turn the teens against himself.<br><br>I liked this movie. Perhaps the reason it did so poorly when originally released is because it didn't seem relevant. Today, it certainly is. The \"futuristic\" British society portrayed seems a bit of a stretch (at one point the crowds chant \"We must conform! We must conform!\"), but then, so does the society shown in 1984, in my opinion. Find this movie if you can, it's a great one and should be released on video!","user":"serois","rank":[25,28]}]
