[{"title":"Not enough horrific & thriller!","rating":3,"date":"3 August 2016","review":"As a big fan of horror films who has already watched more than 700 horror movies, I would say that this work was not good enough. I tell you why!<br><br>The movie was a story about a family; a couple with their little child. The husband was a priest who underwent possession. He thought to be bound to god and was commanded to sacrifice his kid for the god's sake as Abraham did. However, he was possessed by evil. His problem couldn't be solved by psychologist and exorcism until the end of the film.<br><br>As I realized. this movie was the first long film direction by Gus Krieger. I understand it was a cheap product but the story was not powerful and it didn't scare me at all. The movie did not have enough factors to thrill anybody. The movie, in fact, lack appropriate horrific music and characters. Josh Heisler, as the husband, was not a perfect option for this role and his action was weak and even Amy Gumenick as Sarah. It was better they could use a scary makeup for the husband. To this end, I gave 3/10. might be seen for only once but not definitely more!","user":"lion_month","rank":[17,47]},{"title":"He never came","rating":6,"date":"29 October 2017","review":"Sarah (Amy Gumenick) is married to reformed drinker and minister Bram (Josh Heisler). They just had a daughter. Bram gets visions and a voice from God that he must kill his daughter (binding of Abraham, Isaac etc.) to prevent the apocalypse...which is part of prophecy.<br><br>The story is a long drawn out drama of Sarah taking precautions to isolate the child while getting her husband professional help, talking to everyone including Stuart Pankin. While the ending proved interesting, it took too long to develop to get there.<br><br>This is a film religious people might enjoy more than the rest of us as it concerns tests of faith.<br><br>Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[2,4]},{"title":"Objectively, not a bad film","rating":6,"date":"6 October 2016","review":"If you're either very religious or not at all this film might find a way to offend you. Just the thought that God-fearing Christians would deliberate 'visions of commandments of sacrifice' would be offensive to both God-fearing Christians AND atheists. But regardless we have to admit this is how some people in the world would ACTUALLY behave, and more people than we like to admit.<br><br>Yet in the end I was not left with any religious impressions - mainly just a very strong one of parental love. In the end I could believe that the father had been through torture (psychological and/or divine) and chosen to save his beloved daughter. I was disappointed a bit by the ending I must admit, to think that the director would end with something as ridiculous as an actual prophesied apocalypse is nothing short of thick in this day and age, and somewhat demeans the whole parental love motif that was going on, but at the same time, perhaps it heightens it. I don't know, and for that alone (for who cares about cinematography, score and whatnot when there's controversy afoot) I give it 6 stars.<br><br>The father having made his sacrifice, one has to wonder at the look of fear in the mother's eyes at the end and think, would she have done the same, and what would she do now?","user":"cjs6547","rank":[2,6]}]
