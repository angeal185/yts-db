[{"title":"Original Concept/low budget","rating":6,"date":"18 November 2012","review":"This movie had a very original concept that could have taken it way farther. The problem begins with the film's low budget. 1 million (USD)is really not much now days for a movie. Even with it's limited budget production still looked professional. The actors are no names in my book but did fairly well given this. Instead of making a long drawn out review I will say it's worth a look (especially compared to other Horror releases), and I would say that it deserves higher than its current 4.4 score. Special effects were alright but story-line becomes a bit cheesy as it progresses when it starts off with such a COOL concept and history. I would say it's worth a look for sci-fi/horror buffs!","user":"imax3d","rank":[26,28]},{"title":"Watchable and engaging little yarn if you like a good simple plot","rating":7,"date":"14 November 2012","review":"This is a simple story revolving around three men, a love interest, and a mystical coffin.<br><br>The original title was \"Box of Shadows\", and if you think of coffins as just boxes, and deep latent desires as shadows, then the title is great. But I like the current title, The Ghostmaker, because it is more direct and relevant when presented with trailers or synopses.<br><br>The storyline revolves around a long lost coffin invented by a mad man centuries ago. It is soon uncovered by Kyle, a good looking college junkie who only cares about refurbishing used collectibles for resale to fund his addiction and his lavish lifestyle with girlfriend Julie. Joined by his two buddies -- Sutton, a wheelchair-bound college mate who generously sponsors his board and lodging, and Platt, a steady, down-to-earth intellectual -- Kyle uncovers hidden biomechanical contraptions while cleaning out the casket, and ropes them in to figure out the who's, whats and how-much of the treasure.<br><br>As it turns out, the contraption has mysterious powers that give the living \"occupant\" a taste of the afterlife for a few short minutes. As the story unfolds, we discover how these addictive escapades unleash the deepest, darkest shadows trapped inside the kids. But their wanton abuse of the ghostmaker carries a heavy price, as the trio soon discover and subsequently attempt to outwit.<br><br>The story plods along smoothly and at a comfortable pace, drawing the viewers into the scenes and engaging their empathy with the characters. The smooth continuity and flow helped me to enjoy my voyeuristic journey with Kyle, Sutton and Platt, to discover exactly what dark secrets and consequences lie beneath the ghostmaker. The elements of suspense and science fiction help to cast away our sense of logic and doubts, to just enjoy the movie for the simple premise that it offers: a glimpse of what is possible if we can affirm the existence of the afterlife; to experience extra-corporeal abilities; and to explore how such newfound powers can simultaneously inspire and corrupt our mortal consciousness.<br><br>Overall, this is not a high-budget flick, but it makes optimal use of limited resources to convey an interesting plot in a simple, engaging way. The possibilities of ghostmaking are broad enough that there is even some potential left for a sequel!","user":"Hardlok","rank":[29,34]},{"title":"Not a bad movie... Not at all...","rating":6,"date":"23 November 2012","review":"Considering the budget these guys were working with, they seemed to handle their own pretty well. A few unthoughtful lines from the characters, but overall, It was a flick that any horror fan wouldn't walk away from, (that disappointed) I'm no \"Movie Reviewer\" but I know what I like, and I'd like to think I know what's good. So, with that said, I gave this movie a strong 6, because I believe it deserves a higher rating than what it has right now.<br><br>Also keeping in mind the budget they had, made do with what they had, and seemed to me to have pulled it off rather well. The actors were well believed in the most part, except for a few lines here and there mostly from the paralyzed guy.<br><br>Good work guys.","user":"statiktroy","rank":[20,24]}]
