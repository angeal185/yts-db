[{"title":"Dreadful waste of time!","rating":2,"date":"4 May 2018","review":"Managed 40 minutes of this before I turned it off. Bad acting, terrible accents and definitely not funny. \nI normally like Tim Roth and Uma Thurman and Maggie Q was good in designated survivor, but this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.","user":"kmvhamilton","rank":[86,93]},{"title":"Just Awful.","rating":1,"date":"4 May 2018","review":"This is a complete train wreck of a movie. Great cast phoning in their performances, presumably for the money. It's taken three years since it was made for it to be released. They shouldn't have bothered.","user":"ericthemauve","rank":[76,85]},{"title":"Gawd Awful","rating":1,"date":"24 May 2018","review":"I can't figure out what the purpose of this movie was or what it was trying to do. I don't know if it was attempting to display overacting on purpose as a parody of itself or if they were actually trying to be serious. Whatever it was it failed miserably. The result was an awkward movie that I had a hard time watching. It was caught in between something and something else. Very strange that they would even release this the way it turned out. They should have saved themselves some embarrassment and just shoved this one into the archives. It was absolutely terrible on all fronts. Not one good thing I can even think to say about this movie (well maybe that every scene didn't have them smoking fake cigarettes like a lot of others are doing these days) and I'm being generous. This is Hollywood at it's worst but hey, they've been doing a lot of this kind of garbage lately so this is nothing new. This is one of those flicks that almost makes me want to stop wasting my time watching movies. Luckily there are still some decent ones around but this is not one of them. Now I need to go find some deodorizer to get rid of the stink that is still in my nose. What is that smell anyway?","user":"fbmike","rank":[52,59]}]
