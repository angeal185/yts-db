[{"title":"Awful acting.","rating":1,"date":"8 July 2018","review":"Turned it off after ten minutes as the acting is just awful.","user":"anouskasherriff","rank":[10,20]},{"title":"Give this one a very wide berth","rating":1,"date":"10 July 2018","review":"I have a very high tolerance for mediocre horror, so the fact that I literally could not bear to sit all the way through this one is a first. This cringe-fest has what I'd wager to say is some of the worst acting and script I've ever seen. At the time of this review the rating for this movie was 4.5 - which I imagine is only due to 10 ratings from people involved with the film, because that's way too good for this thing.<br><br>Please, if you even remotely like yourself, avoid this catastrophe.","user":"alexapher","rank":[8,16]},{"title":"Terrible Movie","rating":1,"date":"10 July 2018","review":"I couldn't get past the first seven minutes of it. The acting is horrendous, as well as the directing. My mouth hung open as I watched a whole seven minutes of it! Movies shouldn't have cool titles if they are this bad!!!","user":"cocherdumas","rank":[7,14]}]
