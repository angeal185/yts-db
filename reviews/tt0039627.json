[{"title":"Brilliant and thoughtful","rating":1,"date":"1 December 2004","review":"The first film to explore the use of lay practitioners in the Freudian theory, this film is so far ahead of its time as to be psychologically shocking. American Burgess Meredith's performance is one of the best of his career. The absolute certainty with which he portrays the uncertainty of the human psyche (his own as well as others') is the film's brilliance.<br><br>Torn with personal ambivalence, Felix is also torn with the knowledge that he is unable to save his worthwhile patient and his loving wife. A truly under-acknowledged and underestimated film, it deserves a viewing by all interested in film art, and in the development of psychoanalytic technique.","user":"smokeymirrors7","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"A Treasure","rating":10,"date":"9 February 2003","review":"Meredith shines in this underrated film that may be the finest depictions of the profession of psychotherapy ever made.  He is first-rate as he portrays a therapist struggling with his personal flaws and profound doubts as to his effectiveness with clients.  Exciting, well-written, superbly directed, and excellently filmed by cinematographer Freddie Francis, this will have a special significance to any counselor who has ever wondered if he or she was doing any good for themselves or anyone else.  I saw this film first as a young boy and while I did not appreciate the subtleties in the script at the time, I found myself drawn to the character of the therapist.  Eventually, I became one myself and perhaps this film planted the seed of interest in psychology and psychotherapy.  When a film has that sort of impact, it is nothing less than a treasure.","user":"jltmfti","rank":[22,24]},{"title":"A Mislaid Gem","rating":9,"date":"16 July 2014","review":"I have an impressive collection of 1940s movies on DVD but this one has hitherto eluded me.Full marks then to www.youtube.com for up-loading this missing gem of a film and thereby giving me a viewing pleasure.Yes I know that in the immediate post war years the fall out of physical and mental stress from combat affected returning servicemen and that apart from their physical wounds there was a need to treat their minds through psychiatry.Consequently the film industry produced quite a few movies portraying the recovery treatment to war veterans and civilians.Examples were \"Spellbound\"1946 \"The Seventh Veil\"1947 &amp; \"Since You Went Away \"1944.<br><br>Dulcie Gray is in her familiar role of a put upon wife (as she played in \"They Were Sisters\") but in this film she has more character &amp; strength of mind when clumsily supporting her lay-psychiatrist husband (Burgess Meredith).I first saw the attractive Barbara White in \"Quiet Weekend\" (1946),the sequel to \"Quiet Wedding\"(1940) and here she has a grown up part playing Molly Sinclair Lucian.Kieron Moore plays her ill-fated mentally distressed war veteran husband, Adam Lucian, who is the main patient of Burgess Meredith.Nigel Balchin wrote the novel on which this screenplay was based.Another intelligent novel by him produced into a film was \"The Small Back Room\" produced the same year as \"My Own Executioner\",(1947).<br><br>Definitely worth another viewing as long as it remains uploaded on www.youtube.com.I rated it highly 9/10 as one of Burgess Meredith's best films, especially as I noticed it had a rating of only a bit above 6/10.","user":"howardmorley","rank":[8,8]}]
