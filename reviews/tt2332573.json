[{"title":"Entertaining and touching","rating":8,"date":"12 August 2014","review":"I bumped into this movie on one of our cable programs, I started watching cause I lived in Prague for a year and started learning the language there. But the movie proved to be universally good, regardless of the place and language.<br><br>In short, it is a story about getting old, about friendship, and about passion. You know, the things pertaining to any of us.<br><br>Actors are brilliant (I somewhat disliked the dubbing stuff with the French (?) actors), although I knew none of them before. Photography is on par with any Hollywood big-production material, and direction is pretty good. The script is convincing. The only complaint I have is that at moments I felt the story dragging along and meandering too much, dedicating much time to peripheral characters (Oskar's daughter singing etc). The movie could have been a bit shorter, in that matter.<br><br>However, the movie fulfills, the ending is satisfying and emotional. I'm glad Czech still makes great movies, it's a pity that they are rarely aired, compared to the usual Hollywood crap.","user":"jablan","rank":[4,4]}]
