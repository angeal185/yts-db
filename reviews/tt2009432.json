[{"title":"Thought Provoking and Insightful","rating":8,"date":"8 July 2014","review":"This movie does a lot in its short time span. For a independent movie like this to accomplish as much as it does is a feat in itself. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is wonderful, and the screenplay is fantastic. There's a lot of complexities in the film that would require you to watch more than once to be able to take everything out of it. Overall, it was an enjoyable film. It's fair to say that Lily Rabe and LisaGay Hamiltons characters are the main driving force behind the film. Their constant repel/attract relationship keeps the momentum of the film going. If you're thinking of watching this movie, just do it, it might just have something special to say to you.","user":"jorrdanbarr","rank":[12,15]}]
