[{"title":"I couldn't disagree more, completely hilarious","rating":7,"date":"1 August 2005","review":"As my title suggests, I couldn't disagree more with the previous poster. It's entirely possible that the reviewer confused this picture with the previous Trinity outing, \"They Call Me Trinity\", which does not compare to the sequel whatsoever. With \"Trinity is Still My Name\" they were firing on all four cylinders. This film is the quintessential parody of the spaghetti western, with some of the dirtiest, filthiest ant-heroes ever depicted. When this film was in its original theatrical run in the early 70's, it created a *huge* stir...young and old came unglued equally over the many \"over-the-top\" versions of the classic western scene. The slapstick gags were spot on, and Terrence Hill moves from scene to scene with a rogue-ish charm that breathes life into the character of Trinity. Bud Spence's understated performance rounds out the cast, and his lethargic, deadpan delivery mixes well with Hill's enthusiasm. The two actors teamed in several films, but this would be their best work.<br><br>The film is highly visual, and Trinity himself is an extremely humorous character with his use of many outlandish contraptions such as the lounge-chair saddle.<br><br>The supporting cast also provide a good bit of the humor throughout. Characters such as the family with the \"windy\" baby, and the one bad guy who loses his mind after receiving one of Bambino's massive head blows come to mind. Scene after scene parodies many of the classic western clichés, from card games to gunfights, all including the trademark Trinity \"twist\".<br><br>This film is definitely not academy award material whatsoever, but if you're looking for good slapstick fun with plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor you won't be disappointed.","user":"Ben_Thayer_Dunnethaedt","rank":[29,38]},{"title":"Sequel in which Terence Hill and Bud Spencer team up again as the brave brothers","rating":6,"date":"21 August 2005","review":"This comedy/Western follow-up concerns about Terence Hill and Bud Spencer , two bandits half-brothers who attempt to rob a family but finish protecting them . They'll fight against shady baddies and corrupt landowners and will find shelter in a monastery where disguise themselves as friars. <br><br>The formula about ¨They call me Trinity¨ deals to enhance the comics remarks of the western/parody sub-genre originated on the 1960s decade with directors as Burt Kennedy and Andrew McLagen and adding the references to Spaghetti Western model that was in real decadence . The humor is continuous though sometimes grossed-out , laughters are based on physical differences and diverse personalities regarding both protagonists ; once upon terminated the Western formula is transfered to other genres as oriental adventures , policemen or action . The comedy is developed by means of successive struggles without blood , neither guts , nor cruel killings . The choreographic fights are slights and clean , no crude violence , nor gore , predominating the parody and irony . The film isn't always good , sometimes is fresh and diverting and on a couple of memorable occasions , it's frankly delicious . This fun , sympathetic movie is crammed of fist-fights , punches , kicks , knocks-outs , overwhelming stunt-work and lots of humor . Terence Hill plays as a rascal and likable gunslinger with fast-gun and Bud Spencer as a corpulent , grumpy and two-fisted hunk man but with good-heart , besides in the support cast appears the veteran Harry Carey Jr interpreting the daddy , he's regular of the maestro John Ford . This delightful spoof of the Spaghetti Western with our unlikely heroes achieved enough smash-hit , as well as the original film . And twenty and some years later was realized a third part : ¨The fight before Christmas¨ or ¨Troublemakers¨ but didn't obtain success and was a real flop . The 'Trinity and Bambino' times had passed and the 'Fagioli Western' sub-genre had deceased . Rating : Average but amusing and entertaining .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[23,32]},{"title":"yeah","rating":10,"date":"4 April 2003","review":"geez, this movie rules! I love Hill &amp; Spencer and this is one of their easiest to find films.  (Why are their movies so hard to find here in the US? it sucks)  This movie is great because not only is it really funny, but the dudes (H. &amp; S.) are good for any crowd, even kids, because they're against guns and are good natured.  This stuff had to influence so many later movies.  Terence is hilarious, a goofy, smooth ladies man, kind of a pre-Chevy Chase/Mel Gibson type,  and Bud Spencer is maybe even funnier, totally grumpy and rough, but with a good heart.  <br><br>This is probably one of my favorite comedies ever, it's great for any occasion, and always gives a lot of laughs.  There are so many great scenes, I crack up whenever they pig-out on beans!  Hill and Spencer totally rule! check out the barbarian brothers movie too for more good-natured, goofy buddy films.","user":"BWozniak","rank":[24,35]}]
