[{"title":"Why all the hate?","rating":9,"date":"29 July 2018","review":"I'm shocked at this low score. I guess you're either a fan of Melissa McCarthy or you're not, and seeing that I am, I really enjoyed this film. It was constant laughs and one scene where I can't remember laughing so hard for so long - I had to rewind that scene 3x I laughed so hard! The writing was cute and had a heartfelt story. The acting, directing and editing was all perfect. I really enjoyed this and am sure you will too. A well deserved 9/10 from me!","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[132,187]},{"title":"I don't understand all the bad reviews","rating":8,"date":"21 January 2019","review":"I usually don't review movies unless I have a strong opinion. I was just baffled at people being so critical. This isn't some work of film, it's a comedy. Yes it is far fetched and unrealistic, but it's not meant to be some cohesive masterpiece, it's just comedy.<br><br>I'm very critical of comedy, but laughed throughout this entire movie. Sometimes in new comedy the endless one-liners get kind of tiring, but this one I was dying. Also when I watched the preview I wasn't convince it would be funny, so that almost deterred me also.","user":"jameson129-848-491951","rank":[26,34]},{"title":"Cute Movie with Some Laughs","rating":8,"date":"22 January 2019","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a feel good movie with some genuine laughs. There is nothing new here but that doesn't make it a bad movie. Sometimes you just want a movie to entertain you and I believe this movie fits the bill perfectly. Also it helps that I would watch Maya Rudolph read a cereal box and find it amazing.","user":"deniselhightower","rank":[13,16]}]
