[{"title":"Embarrassing excuse for a horror film","rating":1,"date":"6 November 2019","review":"This movie is completely incoherent, poorly directed, edited, and acted. Has a confusing plot, leaves too many questions unanswered, and is utterly non-scary. A low budget is no excuse for lazy writing and shoddy execution. One of the worst films I have ever seen. Do not waste your time with it.","user":"LidijaD","rank":[22,26]},{"title":"The script and dialogue writers should just do the world a favour by cutting off their writing arm.","rating":1,"date":"6 November 2019","review":"I'm not going to use bad language(although that's what should be used).\nThe script and dialogue writers should just do the world a favour by cutting off their writing arm.\nI mean seriously, what the hell?\nYour money and effort may not be precious, but our time is............................\nSo next time you think of writing, just don't.","user":"josepaul-68510","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"Who's baby even is it?","rating":2,"date":"8 November 2019","review":"Wow! Not a good wow either!\nScenes start and end abruptly, the acting is nothing short of shocking (*see \"nobody messes with my baby)\nAnd for crying out loud... Who the hell does the baby belong to and why is it always in bed?\nDreadful film.","user":"jnndltn","rank":[21,28]}]
