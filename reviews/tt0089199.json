[{"title":"A Comedy Documentary on Cheech & Chong with Music Video Clips","rating":23,"date":"23 July 1999","review":"This movie is a mix of music video clips (some that were shown on TV at the time of it's creation) and interviews with the boys.The interviews are funny in a weird sort of way and very easy to lose the plot of. The clips are funny and inventive. The lyrics were good and the visual entertaining. Four songs are featured they are : \"Get out of my room\" - The clip has Cheech as a english rock star playing a guitar shaped like a bird, whilst he is wearing shoulder pads and a viking helmut with cow horns. The clip is inside a gym that is being used by an aerobics class and some basket-ballers at the same time as the two stars are doing the video. \"I'm not home right now\" is run on the joke that an answering machine can't be answered because of various actions happening on screen. \"Love is Strange\" features aliens watching the boys do silly things on screen. \"Born in East LA\" is the best of the four and has Cheech sent over the Mexican border and getting back.<br><br>Not a bad show but not really what you'd expect if you had wanted \"Up in Smoke\" or \"Nice Dreams\".","user":"TonyF","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Not for the pot-heads at heart, but a good and amusing show nevertheless","rating":6,"date":"15 May 2001","review":"Cheech and Chong's Get Out of My Room is the last thing the duo wrote, directed, produced and composed together (not acted though, they have teamed up in After Hours, Ferngully, Far Out Man, an episode of Nash Bridges and a very memorable and funny episode of South Park).  And while this is the type of film that might let down those C &amp; C fans that always toke up before the film (to say this critic does that would be incriminating, but just to save face I'll just say I know where you C &amp; C fans are coming from), it is still funny.  Sure not as funny as the triumphs Things Are Tough All Over, Nice Dreams, the uncompromising Up in Smoke and even the very worthy effort Next Movie, but it is still a trying and satirical approach to music videos that accomplishes it's task for all those about to watch.   Really big flaw is that it is a set-up to be made fun (actually, Beavis and Butt-head did that already).  Various stars make cameos in Spinal Tap style documentary between videos; Born In East L.A. is the definitive brainchild of Cheech.

Don't get me wrong, I liked 'Up In Smoke' a lot, and for me it's still the quintessential smoking film, but they pretty much plundered their albums for a lot of the material and I guess just kind of ran out of comedy mileage afterwards, since they didn't really produce anything else worth watching for the rest of their careers. Ok, maybe 'Things are Tough all Over' deserves another look, although those arabs got old real fast (and not in a Beetlejuice way, sadly), but 'Next Movie and Nice Dreams' are very mediocre and the abysmal non-movies 'Still Smokin' and 'The Corsican Brothers' (shudder) deserve only to be shown to convicted War Criminals.<br><br>This was the last project they wrote together, and it looks like the parting of the ways came not a moment too soon. Essentially it's a documentary style film of C&amp;C farting around on absolutely no budget (the studio execs were obviously getting a bit wary), interviews with some C&amp;C fans (a worrying lack of basic cognition here), and some truly dreadful music. The gimmicky 'Born in East LA' (which became the basis for a FILM ITSELF, my Godfathers) is the best song to be found, but be prepared to spin through Cheech's ever infurating Ian Rotten character and the truly, truly dire 'I'm not home right now', a strong contendor for both the worst song of the 1980's (and thats up against some pretty stiff competition) and the worst Music Video OF ALL TIME.
