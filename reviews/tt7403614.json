Why?!","rating":1,"date":"28 April 2019","review":"A truly horrendous animation movie, with zero to no sense, no comedy value, no anything. My mind boggles at the fact that this made it to the commercial circuit at all.<br><br>I am looking sideways at the fact that this has garnered an \"above average\" score on IMDB, as well as the fact that I rated it a 2* movie and a minute after posting, the average score went up by two-tenths. The score seems to be sustained by bots.<br><br>This is easily a movie for toddlers who react to loud noises, but are unable to understand a plot... because this has none. Animation is rubbish, the writing is simply out-of-this-world-terrible, sound editing the worst, and the soundtrack... Jeebus, there was a moment in the movie where they even played Boney M.<br><br>This truly is a *bad* movie.<br><br>I would advise parents who don't want to lobotomize their children via the 7th Art to stay away from this.","user":"pauldavidtaylor","rank":[33,43]},{"title":"Absolutely Pathetic","rating":1,"date":"20 June 2019","review":"Sitting here, 15 minutes in to this pathetic movie wondering if I can somehow get my money back.","user":"LissyK87","rank":[12,16]}]
