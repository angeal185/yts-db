[{"title":"No more please god no more!!!","rating":5,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"Resident Evil: The Final Chapter reprises Milla Jovovich as Alice in the fifth sequel of the franchise that Paul Anderson derived back in 2002. Ali Larter rejoins Milla along with Iain Glen to bring a ridicules plot to an end, hopefully. I couldn't stand the single camera action sequences, I felt like the camera was doing all the fighting and not the characters. Unlike the original where slow motion camera angles made the franchise famous, this one was made on the cheap. The franchise did become the single most successful horror movie series in history but this flick was less horror and more how did this whole storyline get started. You may skip this one but if you want t know the ending maybe check it out.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[36,41]},{"title":"Hands down the WORST editing in the history of filmmaking","rating":2,"date":"29 January 2017","review":"You are probably not going to see this film for riveting story-lines and in depth character studies. The RE series has about action and fun sequences. Leaving aside all the ridiculous plot points and lazy screen writing, the editing of this movie is going to become legendary for it's awfulness.<br><br>I've never seen a full budgeted movie get hacked up so poorly that the expensive action scenes are pretty much butchered to the max. This movie needs to be studied in film school for how NOT to edit a movie. Every single action is shot with countless shakes, moves, and camera switches. A simple action of, say, putting away your knife, takes 3- 4 camera edits. I was counting them by 15 minutes in per shot. It was insane. A fight sequence will be nothing but a countless series of quick edits form close up, medium and far away shots mashed together so it's impossible to follow what's going on. Shaky cam is one thing, but this is shaky cam plus strobe effect editing. Every single punch or shot requires 4-6 edits and quick cuts. It will give you a headache to figure out what's happening in any fight or sequence. Even mundane actions like people standing on top of a building looking down takes 5-6 edits and quick cuts? <br><br>Bring the puke bag.<br><br>I guess they tried to film some neat locations and the costumes are pretty and sets, but you wont even notice with the multiple edits jarring your eyes.","user":"edhuang-toronto","rank":[514,664]},{"title":"Who gave this guy money?","rating":1,"date":"6 March 2017","review":"If a hamster with ADHD was fed nothing but cocaine and Red Bull for a month and let loose in an editing room it would do a better job than Paul W.S. Anderson. Someone should really introduce him to the concept of shots not measured in milliseconds. I thought this seizure inducing train wreck was banned. Oh, sorry, that was a Pokemon episode. Not sure how I got confused, the Pokemon episode made more sense. But in all seriousness, over the course of the entire Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween series the three slashers made fewer cuts than Paul did in the first five minutes.","user":"omegaangel","rank":[254,346]}]
