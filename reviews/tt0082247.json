[{"title":"The True Story is Fascinating; The Movie is OK","rating":7,"date":"30 October 2002","review":"I have always been intrigued by this film, mostly because of the fantasy it suggests, and even obtained a VHS copy to look it over more closely. Using the  leads posted by other readers, I have been able to glean the following facts from  various Internet and library resources concerning the strange tale of The Mad  Trapper of Rat River, played in Death Hunt by Charles Bronson;<br><br>a] A man referring to himself as Albert Johnson [identified post mortem by associates as Albert Nelson, although that was also an assumed name] arrived in the Aklavik area and brought attention onto himself from a large purchase of  ammunition, a new shotgun, and an inexplicable refusal to get himself a trapper's license. Johnson ran afoul of a Constable Edgar Millen [Lee Marvin's  character] during the New Years season of 1931-32 after his apparent meddlings with the traps of some of the local types, who suggested that he had  gone bonkers in the isolation of the mountains.<br><br> b] Two posses did in fact make seperate trips to Johnson's handmade cabin [measuring 8 feet by 8 feet] and one of the Mounties did in fact have a brief  encounter with Johnson through an open window; The first time he simply wouldn't answer their knocks, and the second time he shot a Mountie through his closed door with a .38 automatic. A third posse, with Const. Millens, then  made the 80 mile dogsled trip and blew up Johnson's cabin after he again refused to acknowledge them.<br><br> c] After they blew up his cabin, Johnson did indeed jump up out of a foxhole he  had been hiding in, firing a sawed off shotgun and a .22 repeater with the stock  removed. The Mounties retreated, and Johnson slipped away in the darkness.<br><br> d] A resulting \"death hunt\" did indeed ensue, set entirely above the arctic circle,  and by the first-time ever use of wireless radios by law enforcement, kept the  public of Canada and America riveted with their newspaper and wire reports of  the two week long manhunt that was the O.J. Simpson crime case of it's day.<br><br> Johnson proved a remarkable adversary, using every trick in the book to confound his pursuers, and managed to survive the nightly -40 tempetures with  little or no supplies or survival gear. They did manage to corner him on one occasion; there was a gunfight, Constable Millens was killed, and Johnson escaped by climbing a sheer cliff with his bare hands in the dead of night during  a blizzard.<br><br> e] A bush pilot and former WW1 air ace became involved in the pursuit, not only  by resupplying the posse and flying out wounded men, but played an invaluable  role in tracking Johnson after he had made his initial escape, using another wireless radio to vector in the ground pursuit in another law enforcement first.  He damn near well almost escaped too, though he was finally cut down in a hail  of lead after keeping the authorities at bay for 48 days.<br><br> f] The whole case was dubbed \"The Mad Trapper of Rat River\" incident by the press owing to the locals' contention that Johnson had gone cabin happy. He was found to be carrying a $2400 bankroll when searched, and I have found two references to \"gold teeth\" or gold fillings; The natives of the area had a fable  about \"The Trapper who steals the gold from men's teeth\" that may have been attributed to Johnson after he was found to have some gold dental work in his  posession.<br><br> Whether they were his or someone else's is unknown, but their presence plus all that cash led to a rumor that he got rich by prying folks' gold fillings out. This  has never been substantiated, and the \"Mad Trapper\" name was pinned to him before these revelations came to light. To this very day, Johnson's actual identity  remains a complete mystery, and his bid for freedom one of the most remarkable examples of man surviving the elements.<br><br> NOW, with that in mind, Death Hunt's scriptwriters took a few liberties with the  facts to create a more romanticized tale;<br><br><ul><li>Bronson's Abert Johnson is now a decoarted war veteran trained in Special Ops, which accounts for his hardiness, comfort with weapons and wealth of survival skills.</li></ul><br><br> - The conflict with the locals is initiated by having Bronson break up a dog fight,  making his character sympathetic when compared to the dirt bags who pick a scrap with him afterwards.<br><br><ul><li>The dog is then killed to provide Bronson with an understandable motive to blow someone's head off and escalate the confrontation. Poor doggie...</li></ul><br><br> - William Beckamn's character of Old Bill is introduced to provide a way for Bronson's character to survive the film after Lee Marvin manages to blow Bill's  face off with a single slug. Nice shootin'.<br><br> - Lee Marvin's Sgt. Millens also survives and is credited with the man who killed  Albert Johnson. Maybe the producers though this was a way of paying homage to Millen's memory.<br><br> - The pilot is turned into a jerk to create a \"new world vs. old values\" conflict with  Marvin, then provided with a machine gun equipped biplane to he can gun down Apollo Creed and reinforce the senselessness of it all. The actual pilot. a  Capt. \"Wop\" May, was widely regarded as a hero for the role he played.<br><br> - The film was shot during the spring and summer thaw so that characters could  wander around in open jackets and sweaters. Much of the pursuing posse footage looks like it was filmed on a snowed over golf course somewhere; we never get a feel that these men are actually battling against the elements.<br><br> - The one scene that Bronson and Marvin share is so strangely shot and edited  as to suggest that the two actors were not on the set at the same time. Watch it  closely -- you can never see both men's faces in the same shot.<br><br> Yet I will always have a soft spot for Death Hunt -- it is probably the first R rated  film I ever saw. It would be interesting to see a more historically accurate account of the Mad Trapper comitted to film; think of this as the fanciful and  romanticized version.<br><br> If you have ever dreamed of taking a pack of supplies, a rifle and a dog up into  the mountains and saying To Hell With Civilization, this film was made for you.","user":"Squonkamatic","rank":[88,92]},{"title":"The Mounties get their man...or do they?","rating":16,"date":"16 April 2002","review":"This is an almost forgotten film, a status which is undeserved. Loosely based on a true story, it is the tale of a lone, mysterious trapper who irks some thugs in the Canadian wilderness, leading to a massive manhunt by the Mounties. Bronson (virtually silent throughout and thus quite effective) is a resourceful target, at once gentle and violent. Marvin is the grizzled head of the mounted police who has the task of tracking down and capturing a man with whom he can identify. Their unspoken understanding is fascinating to see. Marvin is aided by a wet-behind-the-ears, by-the-book officer played by Stevens. It would be hard to imagine a more adorable sight than fresh-scrubbed Stevens in his red uniform entering the grungy town where the police are stationed. He is gorgeous.....and quite a fine actor. It is a shame that he wasn't able to get to a better place with his acting career. The film is peppered with a ton of familiar (if dirty) faces from old westerns of TV and film. All of the lynch mob look like people who've been guest villain on \"Bonanza\" or \"The Big Valley\". One major drawback is Dickinson. It's hard to believe that someone can be miscast in a role as tiny as this one, but she is. Her anachronistic teased hair drains what little 1930's period flavor there is from the film and she is wooden in all her scenes. Apparently, she was stunt-cast because of her previous work with Marvin, but it failed miserably. There is a bit of a connection to \"Dances with Wolves\" in this film, Maury Chaykin and Tantoo Cardinal appear in both films and Bronson even develops a similar relationship with a vicious dog as Costner does with his wolf. The film is something like \"First Blood\" + \"The Fugitive\" x snow - 40 years. It is a great example of the \"Bronson versus the world\" type of film and offers a solid Marvin performance as well. There is more going on here than one might think. The final showdown is quite dramatic and suspenseful. The scenery is also great.","user":"Poseidon-3","rank":[44,46]},{"title":"Intriguing true story turned into an OK actioner","rating":18,"date":"18 November 2002","review":"Charles Bronson has less than fifty words of dialogue in this film, since he spends most of it running through the snow on his own pursued by the mounties, but it is still one of his better films from the late seventies and early eighties era.<br><br>He plays the real life character Albert Johnson, a fur trapper who killed some people in a dispute over dogs and went on the run in territory which had never been crossed during the ferocious Arctic winter. He successfully got away from them, despite the fact that they had many men, dogs and even an aeroplane to help them to track him down.<br><br>This movie version is simple blood and thunder stuff, with a starry cast, some strong language and a handful of sparkling action sequences. It has weak points too, such as the wasted character played by Angie Dickinson, and a few slow patches in terms of pacing. However, when you think that Bronson was mainly working on such dross as The Evil That Men Do, Death Wish II, and Ten to Midnight at this point in his career, this is at least a slightly above-average film worthy of his rugged talents.","user":"barnabyrudge","rank":[26,28]}]
