I happen to find it on a whim. In this crazy world, this movie helps you remember that there are still good people who truly care, who are selfless. Eddie Murphy deserves an Oscar and so does the movie. I wasn't familiar with the young lady who acted with him. The character Charlotte<br><br>showed acceptance, love, hope and friendship. What a true friend really is and should be. This movie sees past racial lines and shows love. Best movie I have seen this year. It pulls at your heart strings. It is a must see.","user":"sheldog-57864","rank":[134,151]},{"title":"Best Heartfelt Movie in a very long time","rating":10,"date":"22 October 2017","review":"Best heartfelt movie I have seen in a long time. Hollywood finally got it right. This is the kind of movie that hardworking people want to see. Not the trash at theater's now days. Great messages, one will experience all feelings and, yes, people can be friends. Eddie Murphy is excellent in this role.","user":"arizona-43561","rank":[27,28]}]
