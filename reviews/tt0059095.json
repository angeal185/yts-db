[{"title":"A magnificent piece of Pop Art","rating":16,"date":"16 August 2001","review":"To judge this film by \"today's standards\" misses the point--what are we comparing it to?  Armageddon?  Scream 3? This was the European 60s vision of the 'future'-- and why didn't it turn out that way?  An odd, cheeky little plot mixing romance, light sci-fi and gunplay is underscored by dazzling visuals in a similar style to The Prisoner series, or Alphaville (if it were in color). Piero Piccioni's score is pure 'Jazz 2001', and is available as an import reissue. Mastroianni is charming and Ursula Andress is at her sexiest, in an array of groovy ensembles. It all depends on what you're after, but personally I wish the WORLD LOOKED like this movie and that men's and women's fashion reflected this film's 'in the future, people will dress like this' style. Anchor Bay's DVD is a great addition to the collection of any 60s/European film fan.","user":"sinistre1111","rank":[40,45]},{"title":"A hidden gem...","rating":10,"date":"13 February 2001","review":"I normally don't feel compelled to write reviews for films, especially when similar views have already been presented.  However, after seeing a blatantly off-base review under the title of \"hopeless\" for \"The 10th Victim\", I had to make up for it.  That reviewer is obviously incapable of appreciating a film like this because it's not easily pigeonholed.  It's a fun, exciting comedy, drama, and farce rolled into one...  I really liked the interactions between Andress (who looks absolutely stunning in this film) and Mastroianni.  An interesting concept that is well executed... after viewing it for the first time, I knew it would remain an all-time favorite of mine for life...  I am thrilled that this is finally seeing the light of day on DVD (after a way-outdated VHS version that even had a photo of Andress from ten years later on the cover, instead of a proper still from the movie).  I'm buying this on DVD the second it's released...<br><br>Lest I forget... the soundtrack of this film is simply amazing...  Not a large amount of original music, but what a score it is...  by the Italian master Piero Piccioni.  Listen and love...","user":"carrienations","rank":[28,35]},{"title":"It's an Italian Sex Farce, really, but it's also a fine sci-fi and pop art fantasy","rating":9,"date":"11 August 2006","review":"The more serious you get about this movie, the more you are missing the point. It's an Italian Sex Farce, really, but it's also a fine pop art film, and a fine science-fiction romp that would be a great double feature with Blade Runner. The review \"A wonderful example of 60s pop art film-making,Italian-style\", by jisenhath from New York, New York USA, really nails the essence of this social-satire sci-fi. <br><br>Like the crocodile tears the sun worshippers cry for the setting sun (satire on religion, of course, though it's also close to the excesses of the 60's hippy-dippies doing nature \"for real\" in 65), the movie is best taken in the vapid, mondo gellato style it revels in.<br><br>From the novel by Robert Sheckley (still a great read, too), the \"shocking\" hunt takes a swipe at the media circus and boredom of excess, while visually reveling in it. The fashion, style and beauty of both Elsa Martinelli and Ursula Andress are a joy, while Marcello works his casual nonchalance and easy timing as the Italian sophisticate at ease with multiple meanings. That's come to pass, hasn't it, as we read from this computer on a network spanning the world. Is this a cult we are a part of? If so, don't cry, but laugh. Like this film does.<br><br>Cheesy one review says... no, cheesy is when the film attempts something and does not succeed through taste, budget or in-ineptitude. Opera is not cheesy, but it is ornate, over-the- top and hyper. So is this film. It's space opera in the operatic sense of La Scala.<br><br>It's spun gold, and a fine bookend to Marcello's 60's sex romps like Cassanova 70. (done in '65 too, a good year for vintage Marcello). Asti Spumante, anyone?","user":"dhermanson-1","rank":[26,33]}]
