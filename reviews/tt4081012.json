[{"title":"I liked it","rating":7,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"People have different tastes in movies and a lot of people won't like this movie. I really enjoyed it, unlike most movies, it kept me guessing. Most movies I know what's going to happen within the first twenty minutes of the movie. The acting was superb! I don't want to spoil the movie but after I figured out most of what was going on, it was a very emotional movie for me. You have to watch this when there are no distractions and pay attention to everything said and I think you will really be glad you watched.","user":"Dave_douell","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"Very good movie","rating":8,"date":"18 December 2018","review":"If you are looking for a typical \"horror\" movie, this is not the film for you. It is moody and dark, and you have to pay attention. It's more of a psychological thriller/suspense/drama. It gave me the same vibe as \"Jacob's Ladder\".<br><br>The acting is wonderful. Beautiful cinematography as well. As another reviewer said, you have to pay attention to the details.","user":"vegicat","rank":[20,26]},{"title":"It is a good film","rating":7,"date":"29 January 2019","review":"I am sure this film is not to everyone's taste, especially if expecting a flash bang Hollywood movie that needs no concentration.<br><br>For me, that was the charm. I had no idea what to expect, but I was pleased I watched it.<br><br>It is a bit of a slow burn, and you need to think about what is going on and pay attention. I really didn't know which way the story was going - which was it's charm.<br><br>When the end of the film happened it was a surprise. In retrospect I could see all the clues were there throughout the film.<br><br>The acting was superb, as was the production. This film deserves a much higher rating that given here.","user":"mjsreg","rank":[11,14]}]
