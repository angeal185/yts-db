[{"title":"Shutting down your brain in 10... 9... 8...","rating":3,"date":"20 November 2017","review":"Hollywood studio boss: \"Okay, folks, I want you to use everything that's been going through the global press for the last two years: Occupational disasters, storms, climate change. Just mix it together like a salad. And because my son has just turned twelve, I want this film to be dedicated only to twelve-year-old males. Okay, my son is not the brightest and he loves explosions and space ships - preferably exploding space ships - so make something he'll like for sure. Blow something up and stuff like that.\" <br><br>Submissive employee:\"But shouldn't we also involve women?\" Hollywood studio boss: \"Sure. The standard clich√©s will do fine: a little girl who is interested in electronics and science, although we all know that girls at this age are just sitting in front of Youtube, watching make-up videos. But hey, that's what people want to see. And something about a female special agent kicking balls. That came out pretty well in the' 80s, I'm sure it still works.\" <br><br>Submissive servant:\"Don't you think that we are mentally undercharging the audience and pretending that they're all mentally under-exposed?\"<br><br>Hollywood studio boss: \"Hell, they ARE. Oh - and because the whole world laughs at our President, I want the President of the United States to play a role that is better off than this living joke in the Oval Office. I want my son to believe that the President of the United States is smarter than Goofy. At least.\"","user":"mau-26","rank":[553,737]},{"title":"Before Watching, remove Brain and put on table","rating":3,"date":"31 May 2018","review":"All I can say is... WOW. I truly Hope Gerard Butler, Andy garcia, and Ed Harris were able to buy their additional vacation houses or pay off IRS with this CGI poopfest!! It reminded me of those cheesy 80's action flicks with the horrible one-liners, yet this lacked any of the charm. If you ARE going to watch this, I highly suggest watching it in a group, while you're all high, and straight Mystery's science Theather this thing!","user":"doc2120","rank":[120,153]},{"title":"Horrible!","rating":1,"date":"21 January 2019","review":"Bad science. Bad plot. Bad script. Bad acting. Why would anyone sign up to be a part of this disaster?","user":"artswan-77642","rank":[87,112]}]
