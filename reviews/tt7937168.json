[{"title":"The ditch we're all in","rating":8,"date":"28 February 2020","review":"This film is about a man who went into hiding when the Spanish Civil War started, and stayed there for 33 years. It's about living in a cave behind a cupboard, watching the world changing around you, and becoming afraid of the street life outdoors.\nIt's also about manliness: watching behind a crack in the cupboard while other men make a pass at your wife, how your only contribution to the family is to help your wife sewing, how your son, who grows up to be a socialist, accuses you of being a coward, hiding out while your comrades were fighting.\nIt's a great film with universal qualities.","user":"volvuspa","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"Excellent psychological analysis","rating":9,"date":"5 March 2020","review":"The film deals with multiple issues including the psychological effects of isolation, the relationship consequences, trauma of rape, and childhood problems as a result of parental illness. I was initially put off by the length of the film, but it needed this length in order to fully develop the themes. This is one of the few long films that I've seen in which the length of the film was justified.","user":"steve-brule","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"Sad truth of Franco's regime in past Spain","rating":10,"date":"1 March 2020","review":"Like all dictatorships, it comes with victims, beneficiaries, traitors and so on. This movie ignores most of that and instead it shows the suffering of a single family for over three decades, showing it well in a very intimate way. In times of today it is very hard to believe that this period actually wasn't so long ago.","user":"peter-61849","rank":[9,13]}]
