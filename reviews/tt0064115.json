[{"title":"Newman and Redford at Their Best","rating":9,"date":"31 July 2002","review":"\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest westerns ever made, although much of the movie takes place in South America.  It is a great look at two likeable outlaws, full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.<br><br>Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are two bank robbers, chased by the law.  The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do.  The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them.  There is really no connection all the way through, for the most part.<br><br>The story isn't about the plot, however.  It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It is a close look at two criminals, the talented Sundance Kid, and Butch Cassidy, the one who does all the thinking.  The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film.  Watching the two interact, with a superb script full of great dialogue, is what makes this movie so exciting.<br><br>See this movie if you are a fan of westerns, or just a fan of good movies. It is exciting, superbly made (with lots of interesting silent scenes to music and montages of photographs), but it also has a lot of depth.<br><br>**** out of ****","user":"kyle_c","rank":[80,92]},{"title":"Violent and bloody, but romanticized by the insouciant charm of Newman and Redford...","rating":9,"date":"20 November 2002","review":"George Roy Hill's film has its excitements and it claims the fashionable climactic bloodbath, but mostly it's played for fun <br><br>It's a highly individual Western; a triumph of style, in fact The style is dominant, intelligent, flowing with charm; the playful teasing, and Newman supplied with a hat on a bike, and the contemporary lyrical Bacharach pop tune It's a style that flowers in the Newman-Redford relationship, which is one of the most affecting in movies<br><br>All this gives it the feel and look of fanciful myth carried to a point unusually removed from reality... Backgrounds are sketched rather than etched You are never really moving toward the west in time and place... With belief suspended, feelings are only light1y involved<br><br>But it's derring-do at its most flamboyant and given a tangy taste by its essentially modern sense of humor... When Butch and Sundance ride back from relaxation to their Hole-in-the-Wall lair and find they have a mutiny on their handsHarvey Logan (Ted Cassidy) wants to take overButch doesn't quell it with bullets but with a boot up Logan's backside It's that kind of picture<br><br>Similarly, when too much dynamite scatters the haul from a rail hold-up, this is a moment for wry, amusing comment And when the posse pursues the pair this is one posse that 'heroes' can't easily shake off It's always there, cleverly made more irksome by long-shot, so that finally only a 'death defying leap' as the circuses say, can separate hunted from hunters. <br><br>\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" is undoubtedly a captivating tour de force Its flavor is preserved from cloying by just the right edge of wistfulness provided by Katharine Ross as the schoolteacher girl-friend who goes along and who suggests the transience of it all<br><br>Newman and Redford good-natured fellowship is felt from the opening to the final scene Sundance seems closer to the traditional Western character... He is strong, silent, willing to face confrontations and shoot it out Butch is an atypical outlaw, enormously charming and courteous, has never killed anyone, and tries to avoid showdowns <br><br>Throughout the film, Newman is engagingly spontaneous in his expressions, gestures and timing of dialogWhile Sundance is practical, Butch is a hopelessly ridiculous optimist and romantic dreamer While they flee the posse, he continually expresses optimism, but beneath is a child-like need for reassurance Small indications of his self-awareness emerge at other times, undercutting his casual exterior For instance, despite the naturalness of the ménage-à-trois, Butch is really the outsider, and he knows it In the lovely still-photo montage of their New York holiday, Butch watches with wistful longing as they dance, but then smilesaware of his isolation but content in their happiness <br><br>\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" earned seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture... It won four (Cinematography, Score, Song, and Original Screenplay).","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[65,81]},{"title":"One Of The All-Time Great Westerns","rating":10,"date":"15 June 2006","review":"One of the best and most-liked films of the 1960s, this is still a fun movie to watch today. When I saw this on DVD on a nice flat-screen set, I was amazed how good this looked. I had seen it several times before on VHS and hadn't realized how good this was photographed. I just discovered Conrad Hall was the cinematographer, which explains it. Few, if any, were better than him.<br><br>One remembers this western for several things: the two leads looking over their shoulders incredulous that their pursers seem to be always there; Paul Newman riding a bicycle to the tune of \"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,\" the beautiful Katharine Ross, the chemistry of Newman and Robert Redford as a two-man team, on and on. Those three lead actors, with the repartee between them, and the likability of each, make them fun to watch as they dominate this picture. <br><br>It's just solid entertainment and another example of good film-making that doesn't need a lot of R-rated material to make it successful. Photography-wise, the western scenery was great, there were some wonderful closeup shots and I really liked the tinted old-time footage inserted in here. <br><br>So, when you combine all the elements, it's no surprise this film won so many awards and endures so well.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[53,68]}]
