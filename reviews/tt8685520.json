[{"title":"\"A\" for effort, \"E\" for success!","rating":3,"date":"29 October 2019","review":"I so wanted to give this Midway a positive review but unfortunately, it sucked! The battle was Ill defined and unsatisfying throughout. The personal stories were plagued by poor dialogue and unending in their and my torture. The movie suffered for trying to focus on both storylines without doing justice to either. I am heartedly disappointed.","user":"robertdill","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"Boring story, lousy ending.","rating":2,"date":"16 September 2019","review":"What a waste of time. At no point did the movie manage to make me feel anything for the characters and what a terrible and totally disappointing ending, which I of course can't describe in any detail here without spoiling the story. Both my wife and I were very disappointed with this movie.","user":"moveng-1","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"100% Garbage","rating":29,"date":"29 December 2019","review":"If you can't make it right, then don't make it.
