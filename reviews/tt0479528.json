[{"title":"Finally A Top Notch Crocodile Film","rating":8,"date":"1 June 2008","review":"I thought this would be a real cheesy B movie but was in for a great surprise.<br><br>Starting with the cinematography and the initial town scenes I figured this may be half decent. Things picked up even more with the scenes on the boat introducing the characters. Small touches like the guy letting his loved ones ashes into the water and the photographer having a sly chow down on a hidden sandwich were really cool touches. Bigger budget films should take note! It got better from there, not showing too much of the croc and building suspense with good pacing and realistic reactions from the cast. The cinematography and editing on the river journey were great. After seeing this I almost want to go to the Northern Territories. Almost, but not after the Croc finally shows its face.<br><br>This is one primal beast. The film does a good job of keeping it under wraps for the early portion of the film but when it finally shows its face its a great moment. The visual fx are faultless and the croc acts in a very realistic manner.<br><br>In the second act the filmmakers do a great job at ratcheting up suspense, using a great set up involving the river. I wont spoil it here but its so simple but very effective.<br><br>I am a jaded monster film fan and this one had me wanting to see it for a second time straight away.<br><br>Crocs and Alligators seem to be the whipping boys of the film industry with so many comedy or low budget appearances. To finally to see one with real teeth and to give it a go with a good story and great fx is fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone after a monster night out.","user":"davek22","rank":[91,110]},{"title":"A tense and well-made Aussie monster movie","rating":7,"date":"25 November 2007","review":"Greg McLean is looking to be someone to watch out for. After scaring audiences witless with his Aussie outback shocker \"Wolf Creek\" and hurting the Australian Tourism Board immensely his back at it again. However, this time he replaces a serial killer with a 7 metre saltwater crocodile who's hungry for humans and luckily a boat full of them arrives at his doorstep.<br><br>McLean doesn't waste time with a huge story, it is very basic and to the point. Pete McKell is an American travel writer who travels the world and writes about the places he visits. He is sent to the Northern Territory to go on a river cruise which is lead by Kate Ryan (Radha Mitchell). On board there are plenty of other tourists waiting to become bait.<br><br>The movie starts off with some beautiful scenes of Australian outback, they are absolutely stunning. When the action starts, though, it never lets up. For the rest of the movie I was on the edge of my seat, McLean really knows how to racket up the tension. It helps that the river is murky and we don't see too much of our monster until the end. And when we do see our crocodile friend it is amazing. Part CG and part animatronics, the crocodile looks very good and very menacing.<br><br>The acting is good all round, although the characters aren't hugely deep, the actors do a good job of making us love them or hate them. Particularly good is John Jarret (of Wolf Creek fame) and Radha Mitchell (Silent Hill).<br><br>For those that like blood and gore you won't be too disappointed, there is some and it's nice and bloody when it comes.<br><br>3Â½/5","user":"LoneWolfAndCub","rank":[52,67]},{"title":"Croc rock","rating":7,"date":"18 January 2009","review":"Nothing wrong with yet another killer crocodile movie. especially one that keeps the beast hidden until the second half. A group of tourists on an Australian river is stranded on a tiny spit of sand after a croc attacks their boat. Trying to get from the spit of sand to the riverbank becomes the group's major challenge as the monster croc picks them off one by one, and their spit of sane begins to go underwater. Radha Mitchell is the tour boat captain and French-born actor Michael Vartan (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Luke Perry here) plays an American journalist. When we finally see the croc, it is huge and fearsome indeed. Vartan ends up in its lair and must face it down. Great CGI and physical special effects. Most of the movie was shot on sets and a back lot, but you'd never know it. A must-see for killer croc fans.","user":"ctomvelu-1","rank":[26,32]}]
