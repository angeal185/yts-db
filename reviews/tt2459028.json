[{"title":"Awful beginning to end.","rating":1,"date":"3 November 2013","review":"This \"film\" is simply dreadful. I won't drag this out. Terrible writing, directing, acting. Terrible scenes, production, makeup. They probably had terrible food on set too. There is not one single thing to like in this \"film\". I felt raped.<br><br>Pay attention to the reviews here. You'll see 2 or 3 blazing good reviews. If you notice they know people involved by their first names and it's obvious that the reviewers either worked on the \"film\" and/or are trolls.<br><br>This is one of the worst to come a long in a while. It's so bad that it can't even be made fun of for a laugh. It's bad enough to make you angry.","user":"palms-872-684706","rank":[55,65]},{"title":"Please stop, I can't take it any more.","rating":1,"date":"3 November 2013","review":"Two people go into the woods and of course meet some psychos who want to....<br><br>Wait, you say, haven't I seen this a thousand times before?<br><br>Yes you have, but never as bad as this crap made by people with no talent whatsoever.<br><br>This is one of those \"movies\" (I call it a \"movie\" but it's not really a \"movie\") where everybody involved really sucks.<br><br>There is absolutely NOTHING good about this epic fail.<br><br>It wouldn't even qualifiy for all the YouTube sites where they make fun of movies by commenting on their crappiness while watching them.","user":"Shizuka2008","rank":[35,40]},{"title":"Incomprehensible mess","rating":1,"date":"4 November 2013","review":"If you enjoy watching a lot of shots of the sun partially hidden by trees over and over this movie is for you! Lots and lots of the same shot repeating over and over.<br><br>There is no dramatic structure at all to this film. The filmmakers (if you can call them that) sprinkle in some actors running through the woods screaming, running into houses screaming, and driving their cars screaming. Yes this movie has a lot of sporadic yelling, dissolves, freeze frames, and I do not have a clue what it is all about.<br><br>It's got some really weird sound design, I think the sound editor fell in love with a 'pitch control' plug in.<br><br>I usually don't care for films that drive the narrative through dialogue, but the complete lack of narrative structure here is ridiculous. Visually it's a complete mess. The films of Stan Brackhage and Matthew Barney are more comprehensible. It's just a film with a bunch of actors covered in fake blood walking around the woods or bound to a tree, and did I say lots and lots of freeze frames, dissolves and the same shot of the sun hidden partially by trees? They also slapped in a disembodied voice saying 'Carl' over and over for good measure. <br><br>In stead of Horror it should have been categorized as just plain Horrible.","user":"William_Henry_Pratt","rank":[25,31]}]
