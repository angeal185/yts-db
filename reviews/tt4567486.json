[{"title":"Decent homage to 80's films, but the uneven acting really soured what could have been a special film","rating":5,"date":"9 August 2016","review":"As a child of the 80's, I grew up with these kinds of films; films about people with special powers and government cover-ups. This film does a great job of evoking that same feeling, with a decent script and a pretty decent SFX budget. The acting, however, was beyond hacky, and really marred the integrity of the film. Almost everyone involved in this movie was just awful, with overacting and poor delivery abundant in every scene. It was like watching a student film at times, with people who have no business being in front of a camera. With a more talented cast, this would have been a worthy addition to 80's horror films. As it stands, it is a decent film with some really bad talent attached to it. Watch it for the carnage and gore, but be advised, you will be rolling your eyes every time someone attempts to deliver their lines with a straight face.","user":"manuelasaez","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"Just like they used to make 'em!","rating":8,"date":"11 August 2016","review":"Fantastic, fun, low budget, daft horror film made for peanuts. Just the sorta thing we here at Plop Towers love watching.<br><br>Written and directed by Joe Begos who also done the cracking Almost Human.<br><br>If you ask me, the horror genre, and films in general, need chaps like young Begos. People who won't let the lack of budget get in the way of telling a story, and doing so well.<br><br>Same goes for anyone who reads this, if you want the world to hear your voice, do it now. Don't wait for external endorsement, sponsorship or someone to hold your hand, it won't happen. You'll probably fail, but what do you wan't to say when your ticket's punched? You tried your best, or you thought about it a lot?<br><br>Good luck.<br><br>(Originally at www.filmplop.blogspot.com)","user":"perkin2000","rank":[13,23]},{"title":"Rip off of Scanners","rating":3,"date":"5 July 2018","review":"Almost a competent film, there isn't an original thought in this movie. Whoever made it saw Scanners and said, Hey rather than do yet another low budget zombie movie, let's do Scanners. And that's what they did. It almost a paint by numbers recreation of Scanners right down to the mind off (face off) at the end. Not horrible. But not good either.","user":"mhorg2018","rank":[7,11]}]
