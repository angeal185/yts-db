[{"title":"The most accurate depiction of the punk scene ever in amovie","rating":28,"date":"28 October 1999","review":"I grew up in the early 80's hardcore punk scene in NYC and like most punks at the time had seen Penelope Spheeris' DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION (the best punk documentary ever made) and was impressed when SUBURBIA(later renamed The Wild Side) came out in a few theatres.  It was, and still is, the most accurate depiction of what being a hardcore punk was like.  Okay, as a film, the production was shoddy, the acting was sub par, and the story was weak.  But most of the actors were local punks. .  The depiction of the punks was right on the mark....the clothes, the attitude, the music, the just hanging out, etc. Unfortunately, all the new kids who just got into punk in the last decade think this movie is all wrong.  Even one of the commenters on this site mistakenly complained that this movie has it all wrong and punks aren't like that.  Well guess what kids?  The punks in this movie not only acted like real punks, most of them were real punks. (before you were) The scene has changed over the years.  This movie is accurately representative of what it was like back in the original (real) scene days during the Reagan administration.","user":"Brendan3","rank":[73,79]},{"title":"Takes me home","rating":10,"date":"9 July 2008","review":"I love this movie even more now then I did back then. I think this should be a mandatory watch before your first purchase at Hot Topic. This movie gives me an odd sense of comfort when I watch itsomething I can't find anymore. I wasn't a \"TR Kid\" (figuratively speaking), but I knew them all, I hung out at the \"TR House\"you were always welcome there. They were my friends, my family, they were as accepting of you as you of themsomeone always had your backanother thing you can't find anymore.<br><br>But enough reminiscing. I recommend this movie to anyone who was in the scene back thenbut you guys have seen it. I also recommend this movie to all the new school kids who think they get it. Punk isn't what you wear, punk is who you are.","user":"phorever","rank":[19,19]},{"title":"Welcome to the suburbs...the slums of the future. (spoilers)","rating":8,"date":"31 December 2004","review":"Penelope Spheeris, loyal punk film director, presents a starkly depressing tale about a handful of ostracized teenagers known as The Rejected Kids. They're a group of punks who left home, neglected in one way or another (except for the main character, Jack) and take up living in condemned housing in Los Angeles. Trouble seems to follow them wherever they go because they make easy targets.<br><br>This is a treat in several respects, despite being such a horribly depressing and, sadly, honest film. First, you get to see performances by old punk favorites, T.S.O.L., DI, and The Vandals. Second, Wade Watson (bass player for the US Bombs) and Flea (in his film debut) are casted as two of the delinquent teens. The instrumental soundtrack, too, is very good. And third, is the sheer honesty with the disappointment of the suburbs, which were once proclaimed as the future Utopia. What it turned out to be was a disaster of crass consumerism that denied too much human affection, replacing it instead with the satisfaction of consumption, so much so that in the end, the suburbs had their problems just like everyone else, only they did a better job of hiding it behind the imagery of white picket fences and perfect lawns. This film is one of many to make that point.","user":"vertigo_14","rank":[22,23]}]
