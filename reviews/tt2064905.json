[{"title":"Can we stop making movies with a hand-held camera now?","rating":18,"date":"18 June 2013","review":"You might like this movie if you enjoyed: The Last Excorcism (2010), Chronicle (2012)<br><br>Long Story Short: Three teens plan to take revenge on their bully and document their every move on camera to show the creation of an epic prank. But things get out of hand and soon a fun idea turns into a nightmare.<br><br>Review: Prank is entirely filmed with a hand-held camera. The goal of these movies is to work with a low budget but also to create a more authentic atmosphere. We all remember the mother of these movies – The Blair With Project (1998) – and how excited everyone was to see this \"real\" footage. But the reactions were different: many loved it, some got nauseas, while others got bored or fell asleep. I think End of Watch was the only documentary-style movie that succeeded in what it was trying to do, and Chronicle was okay, too. But as far as the shooting-style goes this movie failed. The concept of Prank is very interesting and shows how far things can actually go when bully victims strike back, but at some point the story was all over the place and became totally unrealistic, but then again, when I think about it, things like that could actually happen. Or not? The acting was decent, the dialogues probably,too, but the constant turning on and off of the camera got on my nerves and I was more annoyed than interested. They definitely should have worked more on the storyline, given the the characters more depth, and made a regular movie. If you like these kind of movies watch it, otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it.<br><br>Rating: 4.5/10<br><br>For more reviews please visit my blog and like my facebook page! http://www.simonsayswatchthis.wordpress.com http://www.facebook.com/simonsayswatchthis","user":"simon-d-cesair","rank":[24,39]},{"title":"More than just another dumb found footage film","rating":8,"date":"20 July 2013","review":"Funny to see that the one of the biggest gripes about this movie is that it's a found footage film. Yes there have been a slew of crap in the past few years that have tried to garner the success of the Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity series ilk, but it's unfair to lump this one in with the other hapless, pointless, and often boring as hell horror wannabes (have you seen The Devil Inside yet?) as this is a movie that actually tries to tackle a subject matter that is relevant to anyone who has ever struggled socially through high school. And it is not a feel-good story about how a kid gets bullied and he wins in the end. Oh no, you will be disappointed if you think you're in for a story that let's the underdog win. This is more like Hamlet, where your hero doesn't win, also known as a tragedy- no original Hollywood movie would ever let that happen so it should not surprise you that this is an independent film. <br><br>What makes this interesting and complex is that there are no good guys and that it does not depict bullying in the conventional sense. Yes there are stupid plans hatched by stupid kids and the portrayal of The Bully is nothing new- he's a smirking, white, jock type with very limited vocabulary and has an even dumber sidekick (Oh yes, there is a bitch cheerleader thrown in there too, with perhaps the best line in the film- something about being a blond cheerleader- watch for it). What makes this complex is the interaction of the two main kids as they themselves become no better than the jerks, and it is interesting to see each of their transformation as the situation spins out of control. It starts off a bit hokey after the opening scene but it moves quickly and is pretty entertaining so stick with it.<br><br>The real world doesn't seem to exist for these characters, which is accurate in how many teens can barely see beyond their self-centered existence and limited social circles. How else can they not see how ridiculous their \"brilliant plan\" and some of their actions are? But that is the point, isn't it? And they're annoying as hell too, which makes you kind of wish this was a slasher where Freddy Krueger eventually gets to all of them in some ways; however, if you pay attention, you'll see that this did try to be a movie with a message and that a smart theme exists.<br><br>I hope that kids who watch this get the bonus message that there is more to life than high- school. You just got to get through it first. Just try not to kill anyone or get killed in the process. <br><br>Don't let the DVD cover fool you- this movie is NOT about a killer clown with an iPhone.","user":"jackal12358","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Not bad","rating":6,"date":"30 June 2013","review":"For what it was... not a badly done movie. It suffers not from style/story/effects, but rather the way it was filmed. It is filmed entirely from the point of view of a camera held by the characters in the movie. A big problem with these types of movies is that you end up having characters talking into the camera to replace the dialogue to further the story. This ALWAYS ends up feeling like they're breaking the fourth wall and it takes you out of the situation. This style really needs to be done minimally in my eyes.<br><br>I didn't really feel for any of the characters since they are all either horrible or irritating as people go. This diminishes the effectiveness of the ending a bit for me. <br><br>If you're looking for a low budget movie to watch its definitely better than a lot, but nothing all that unique here. I felt the murder scenes were all done quite well and looked pretty good. For the most part the acting was adequate also.","user":"rosnor2000","rank":[9,14]}]
