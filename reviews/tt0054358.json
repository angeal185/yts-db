[{"title":"Swashbuckling , action , romance and dueling in this entertaining adventure movie","rating":6,"date":"28 July 2012","review":"Passable version based on the legendary character with spectacular fights and average production values . In 13th century England, Robin (Richard Greene) , the World's Most Renowned Swordsman , along with band of marauders as Nigel Green as Little John , Niall MacGinnis as Friar Tuck and Darren Nesbitt as Martin confront local corruption and lead an uprising against the Sheriff that will forever alter the balance of world power . Robin lives again , a hero of every villain , friend to those who have friends . The movie now opens with a man (Desmond Llewelyn as wounded fugitive) riding into the forest on horseback and his identity is never revealed . Robin and his men rescue an unnamed rider seriously wounded who is fleeing to Sherwood Forest on his horse , being chased by the Sheriff's men . Robin absolutely refuses to turn him over to the Sheriff who offers him a full pardon in exchange for the wounded . The sheriff of Nottingham (Peter Cushing) schemes to confiscate the estate of the Lord of Bortrey, who has deceased on Crusades . The Earl of Newark (Richard Pasco) takes an interest in Robin's skill with a arch and puts him through a number of proofs . The Archbishop of Canterbury speaks against this scheme , and the sheriff plans to eliminate him . Robin Hood pretends to avoid the killing of the Archbishop of Canterbury ,Hubert Walter (Jack G. Willim), who is blocking their plans to confiscate a dead nobleman's ownership in the shire for the schemers ; Maid Marion (Sara Branch), meeting him thinks him the leader of a gang of murderous , and leads him into a masquerade .<br><br>The movie has acceptable action sequences well staged with stylish and vitality , adventure , romance and is pretty entertaining ; however being realized in TV style . There are some nice action sequences including the battles in forests and the ending confrontation at the climax of the film . Richard Greene was the only actor to reprise his role from the TV series , the other roles were played by an entirely new set of actors. The series formed by 143 episodes were starred and mostly produced by Richard Greene . The movie was shot on natural sets and Irish woods , Ardmore Studios, Herbert Road, Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland and interior scenes in Powerscourt Estate, Enniskerry, County Wicklow, Ireland with functional production design by Joh Stoll who subsequently took in charge the settings of ¨Laurence of Arabia¨ and ¨The collector¨.<br><br>Robin Hood, also known Robin O'Locksley and the Earl of Huntingdom, is probably and sadly a creation of romantic imaginations . If Robin Hood did exist, it's almost certain that he was not a Saxon , though his enemies may well have been the Norman sheriff of Nottinghan and Prince and later king John Lackland.<br><br>The motion picture was professionally directed by Terence Fisher . He was an expert on terror genre for Hammer production , his best films were the following : \"So Long at the Fair\", Portrait from Life (1948), \"Dracula\", ¨The Revenge of Frankenstein¨ (1958), ¨The mommy¨ (1959), The Stranglers of Bombay (1959), \"Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll\", ¨The brides of Drácula¨ (1960), \"Curse of the Werewolf\", ¨The phantom of opera¨(1962), \"The Gorgon\", \"The Earth Dies Sceaming\", \"Dracula ,Prince of Darkness\" and \"Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed\".<br><br>Other versions about this famous personage are the following : ¨Robin Hoos and his Merrie men ¨(1952) by Ken Annakin with Richard Todd and Peter Finch ; ¨Robin Hood price of thieves (1991) ¨ by Kevin Reynolds with Kevin Costner , Alan Rickman and Morgan Freeman , the same year was exhibited ¨Robin Hood¨ by John Irvin with Patrick Bergin and Uma Thurman but was a flop though the critics considered best adaptation. The classic rendition is ¨The adventures of Robin Hood¨ by Michael Curtiz with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland and recent rendition Robin Hood by Ridley Scott with Russell Crowe , Oscar Isaac and Cate Blanchet.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[25,26]},{"title":"A Different Sort of Robin Hood Movie","rating":12,"date":"12 September 2011","review":"Hammer Film Productions delivered more than great horror. It produced this (short) movie based on the 1950's television series, \"The Adventures of Robin Hood.\" Most of the television cast were dumped. Richard Greene reprises his role as Robin Hood. Little John is Nigel Green and the Sheriff of Nottingham is Peter Cushing, looking weird in a mod wig. Maid Marian changed from a brunette on television to a blonde (Sarah Branch). The one television cast member who is missed is Alexander Gauge's Friar Tuck; he has been replaced by Niall MacGinnis.<br><br>Also of note in the cast are Richard Pasco, and a very young Oliver Reed. Reed plays such an effete character he even affects a lisp. Derrin Nesbitt, my favorite no. 2 from \"The Prisoner\", has a small but pivotal part in this movie as Martin of Eastwood.<br><br>The amazing thing is that this movie does not try to track Robin Hood's tale from his outlawry to the arrival of King Richard. This is just one incident in Robin's life. Robin has to secure a pardon for Martin of Eastwood so his family can inherit his lands. But the Sheriff of Nottingham wants the land to revert to himself. There is also a sub-plot, involving Richard Pasco and Oliver Reed, about an attempt to assassinate the Archbishop of Canterbury. For a movie of less than ninety minutes long, it has a lot going on.<br><br>Though it is not another life of Robin Hood \"Sword of Sherwood Forest\" does include the obligatory meeting with Marian. This time, she's bathing in a river (in a strangely exposed place).<br><br>But why \"Sword of Sherwood Forest\" when Robin's favorite weapon is the longbow? <br><br>If you are familiar with Richard Greene's Robin Hood, this movie is worth checking out. The color is gorgeous after all this time.","user":"aramis-112-804880","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Period charm","rating":7,"date":"18 March 2008","review":"This is not as bad as all that. Terence Fisher as ever does a competent job, there are reasonable production values and some rather fetching photography. I always thought Richard Greene a little too schoolmasterly for an outlaw, and he is here rather portly, but he can certainly handle a bow. Nigel Greene and Niall McGinnis are well cast as Little John and Tuck, Peter Cushing is an excellent Sheriff, and Richard Pasco does well as the ambiguous Lord Newark. Oliver Reed's camp henchman is perhaps less successful.<br><br>The conspiracy plot unfolds at a relaxed pace and resolves satisfyingly. The weakest element is the tacked on romance with Sarah Branch's rather bland Maid Marion.<br><br>All in all a rather charming period piece, that gets closer to the spirit of the original ballads than most versions.","user":"timsmith37","rank":[22,28]}]
