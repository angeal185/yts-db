Quickly gets sucked into the underworld, kills some dudes, sells some coke, rapidly climbs the ranks - gets cocky - gets the blonde - short-fuse and false notions of invincibility leads to inevitable death.<br><br>Only, Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer don't star in this movie..<br><br>\"First we take Brooklyn\" or \"Brooklyn Guns\" screams after-school special - but adds in cliche characterization - a terribly unoriginal and predictable script and cringe-worthy performances from all actors. It's just an awful film all around, even for independent crime-movie standards.","user":"objective_truth","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Actually quite an impressive and entertaining B-grade Indie crime/drama film","rating":8,"date":"20 February 2018","review":"I'm shocked at the low score for this film. I had low expectations going into this, but I was pleasantly impressed by this indie low budget B-grade film.<br><br>This film stars and was also produced by Danny A. Abeckaser, who made his directorial debut, and his second writing credit, shared with co-star Jon Carlo. Harvey Keitel played the perfect Russian mobster, and it was nice to see some eye candy that can act, Charlotte McKinney and primarily co-star beauty AnnaLynne McCord.<br><br>If anyone is expecting to see a huge big budget Hollywood produced gangster film, this is not it. But it achieves its goal in keeping the viewer submersed and entertained. The pace was perfect, the directing and screenplay on point, and the actors, although not all seasoned A-listers (except for Harvey Keitel of course), performed quite well and convincing in their roles.<br><br>It's a shame reviewers will slam this film by comparing it to Hollywood gangster films and expecting so much more from such a small indie production. I for one am impressed and give this a well deserved 7.5/10 rounded up to a 8.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[17,37]}]
