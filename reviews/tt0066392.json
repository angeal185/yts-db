[{"title":"My #1 Guilty Pleasure Movie of All Time","rating":10,"date":"19 May 2006","review":"This movie tickled me to the bone.<br><br>I can laugh decades later just thinking about Angela Lansbury greedily but daintily scarfing down strawberries.<br><br>Michael York is infinitely sexy and sinister at the same time. Just the memory of his performance gives me goosebumps.<br><br>Everyone in the cast is such a juicy distinctive being and such fun to watch.<br><br>It seems funny ranking this movie up there with Citizen Kane as one of the greatest movies of all time, but in terms of sheer enjoyment, for me, it ties with Cabaret (another Michael York movie) as #1.","user":"roedyg","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"One of the greatest rants ever recorded","rating":21,"date":"21 May 2010","review":"Thank god I had the good sense back in 1984 to video tape this movie. I got all but the last 2 minutes of it and I kick myself every-time for not adjusting the clock on my video recorder. I paid $750.00 for that VCR back in 1984 because it had fast forward, slow motion and freeze frame capabilities. Now, when I look at my $199.00 Sony HD video pocket camcorder I think back to how times have changed.<br><br>This movie is such a classic I am surprised that it is ignored by TCM, the Independent Film Channel and every other cable movie channel out there. It is just unbelievable what a mistake they are all making in not showing this movie. The rant by Angela Lansbury after the party is one of her greatest scenes and I show it to everyone young person who think they know all there is to know about her. It seems none of them have even heard of this movie. What a shame that fact is.","user":"brucito11","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"A Lansbury Pearl","rating":8,"date":"21 December 2006","review":"Angela Lansbury as a decadent noblewoman, glaring out into her shaky future is nothing short of sensational. One of the most entertaining performances ever put on film. She has to overcome two massive obstacles, wooden Michael York as a co-star and Broadway legend Harold Prince as her \"film\" director. She succeeds and overcomes both problems with the help of a scrumptious script and a personal zest that it's pure Lansbury. She has been, consistently, one of the most startling actresses to come out of Hollywood, she is, often, the only redeeming quality of some indifferent movies. Unfortunately, the enormous success of \"Murder She Wrote\" has overshadowed her powerful impact as an actress. To introduce her to a younger audience that knows her only as Jessica Fletcher is always a thrill. From \"Gaslight\" right up to \"Nanny McPhee\" As a piece of trivia...Did you know she was offered the part of Nurse Ratchet in \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\"?","user":"carlostallman","rank":[39,45]}]
