[{"title":"Smile for the sniper rifle","rating":10,"date":"10 August 2010","review":"A crazed sniper is killing prostitutes in Toronto. Using a camera mounted on the rifle, the victims are photographed as they're gunned down. Boyd (Richard Crenna) is a police sergeant who suspects high-level (but physically diminutive) pimp, Julius Kurtz (Paul Williams), of being behind the slayings. Harboring an intense distaste for Kurtz, Boyd would like nothing more than to lock him up and throw away the key, but are these cases ever that easy?<br><br>\"Stone Cold Dead\" is a grimy amalgamation of giallo, crime drama and exploitation archetypes. The sniper's appearance and M.O. are straight out of a giallo, as is the terrific music that pops up whenever they're in action. I also loved the scenes in the culprit's darkroom, whispering voices running rampantly through a damaged psyche. The addition of the camera mount to shoot pictures and bullets at the same time is certainly an inspired touch. Psychological aspect aside, it ensures that the various murder scenes lack a feeling of repetition.<br><br>The atmosphere of the film is one of grunge and decay. Lensed in a cold, distant style suiting the material, there's an ample amount of sleaze on display as we're treated to the underbelly of Toronto. Kurtz dealing with his girls and Boyd's quest to bring him down get as much screen time as the hunt for the killer.<br><br>Paul Williams gives a standout performance as Kurtz, a classy type who actually shows a level of compassion and respect for those under his employ. His character is supposed to be scum, yet I actually found him more likable than Crenna's hard-ass sergeant. Boyd isn't all bad, however, as he makes sure that his pet fish are taken care of when he's too busy to come home. How? By rigging up a contraption that feeds them when he calls his house. Genre favorite Michael Ironside shows up in one of the briefest roles ever as an ill-fated cop. Tease. I was going back and forth between two characters when it came to determining the sniper's identity. I managed to get it right about 15 minutes before the reveal. The revelation scene itself is a winner, as the individual playing the guilty party gives an impressive performance.<br><br>While it isn't perfect, this seldom-seen little cheapie has a lot going for it, especially if you're into gialli. It's also quite similar in overall feel to another seedy Canadian flick from the period, \"American Nightmare\", only this one's actually worth watching!","user":"Cujo108","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"Canadian Police Drama","rating":6,"date":"5 December 2003","review":"Contains Spoiler!!! Just to see Paul Williams, Julius Kurtz, playing a big time city pimp should make \"Stone Cold Dead\" worth watching. With the always reliable Richard Crenna, Sgt. Boyd as the Toronto cop with an obsession for putting Kurtz away and off the streets to make the city safe. <br><br>Some deranged sniper has been offing prostitutes and at the same time photographing them and sending the photos to the police to taunt them and make them feel helpless in catching him. Sgt. Boyd thinks that it's Kurtz that's the killer and is out to get the goods on him. You would wonder why Kurtz would kill his own employees and hurt his prostitution business? Does Boyd know something? <br><br>Fairly good whodunit with a surprising performance on the part of Paul Williams as the cool pimp with a heart of gold when it comes to taking good care of his \"ladies\" even though he can be rough some times but as everyone watching the movie knows Julie doesn't really mean it. <br><br>A very effective and sympathetic scene in the film is when Kurtz is at a funeral of one of his murdered \"ladies\" and Sgt. Boyd arrives uninvited hassling him. Kurtz then quietly tell him \"Can't you see that I'm here to pay my respects\". It just made me wonder who was the good guy and who was the bad guy in the movie. <br><br>Sgt. Boyd gets really involved in the murder case when one of the hookers murdered by the sniper turns out to be a woman undercover detective who's also a good friend of his and it all becomes very personal with him. The ending of the movie is made to shock and surprise and it does very convincingly with the audience not seeing it coming. <br><br>\"Stone Cold Dead\" has that rough and gritty look to it more because of it's small budget then it's filmmakers artistic talents in movie realism with better then average acting from it's supporting cast of Linda Sorenson, Monica Page, and Alberta Watson, Olivia Page, then you would usually see in a B-Movie.","user":"sol1218","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"Stone cold solid 80's thriller","rating":8,"date":"6 December 2012","review":"Another well plotted thriller, sees a prostitute hating nut taking out his victims with a fancy rifle, silencer attached. That's not all, our nut has a camera mounted on his rifle, so at the point of shot, he takes a series of photos until they are, as the title refers. Obviously typecast, is Sly's good mate, caring cop, Richard Crenna, out to bust this pimp, Kurtz, and awesome piece of acting from Paul Williams, who just outdoes the others. His women, including one of his favorites, are being taken out. Again this is a highly constructed thriller, where your guesses to to the killer will waiver from one to another. Some real American style violence, one scene with a disgruntled black pro who takes it in the neck, some blood cascading out, is a little sick. Her john, (a professor) staggered, trying to plug the flow of blood, apanic, becomes an informant for Crenna in the case, who keeps the poor guy's spit clean reputation intact. There are some scenes you don't expect to see in a film, like this. Still quite hot looking, 50's pro (Belinda Montgomery-great in the part) where time has worn her through this profession, becomes romantically involved with Crenna. She suggests to him \"Lets do something that I haven't done for ages\". They go ice skating, Crenna, not a good skater, by any means. Also we get to see the time activating gadget for feeding his fish which starts with a phonecall. Crenna's female friend, who's working undercover, to try and bust his arch rival, Kurtz, is fun too. She takes her undercover role a little too seriously, her demise near the end, came as quite a shock in it's first viewing. Stone Cold Dead is a solid rate thriller, that does tend to fall a bit into sleaze here and there. But we learn a little bit more about people in this flick. How many other films like this, do that. A must for psychological thriller fans, good performances, all round. The actress who plays Montgomery's daughter is creepy as.","user":"PeterMitchell-506-564364","rank":[5,6]}]
