[{"title":"The title's a misnomer","rating":1,"date":"2 August 2017","review":"SATANIC MEAT CLEAVER MASSACRE is a dreadful independent horror film that's nothing like the title would have you believe; there's no gore here at all, just long, drawn-out sequences of people chatting to fill up the running time. Watching these portly cast members sharing supposedly witty humour quickly becomes tiresome, and there's no real story to draw you in either. The end result? It's as boring as they come.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[8,9]}]
