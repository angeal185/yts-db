[{"title":"Song to the Siren","rating":10,"date":"31 December 2019","review":"What a darkly beautiful movie. The scenery is breathtaking with a mesmerizing story. The song that the siren sings what is it? Who sings it? Can I get it someplace? Its beyond breathtaking. I see Tom Kane is the composer but need more info. Deadly gorgeous.","user":"avacado-1","rank":[92,96]},{"title":"THE ISLE... A MUST WATCH!","rating":9,"date":"22 July 2019","review":"The Isle was a FANTASTIC watch, totally gripping and thrilling from start to finish with outstanding performances from Tori Buttler-Hart and Alex Hassell<br><br>The storytelling is fascinating and the merge of\nThriller/horror is truly edge of the seat stuff. It Was also amazing to hear the Directors vision first hand at a Q and A session in London and to have an insight of the up and down rollercoaster that was making this picture.","user":"lukedayhill","rank":[87,120]},{"title":"Beautiful filmmaking","rating":7,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"I cannot praise this movie enough. Ignore the haters, of which there are only a couple as they seem SERIOUSLY DELUDED, and rejoice in this visual poetry of a movie!<br><br>I don't like horror, and was made to watch this by my husband, and was blown away by it. That may be because it's not what I think of as horror, all blood and screaming, but a stunning work of filmmaking brilliance.<br><br>The acting is sublime, especially from the women, the direction and cinematography so well thought out and put together, and the sound and music is from another world.<br><br>This won't be for everyone. My kid brother is not going to want to watch it, but for those looking for something original, cerebral, subtle and haunting, this is going to blow your mind. Gently...<br><br>Highly recommended for those looking for a break from the norm.","user":"brycecherry","rank":[115,162]}]
