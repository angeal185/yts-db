[{"title":"Very enjoyable movie","rating":28,"date":"28 November 2013","review":"I went to watch this movie knowing it was a tale about hope, inspiration and people. I was not disappointed, enjoyed the characters and message from beginning to end. It is the absolute opposite from zombies, explosions, murder and mayhem, and is all the better for it. Not sure if the movie is true to every historical aspect of the time portrayed, but that is not the point. While the audience was small, there were applause at the end, and some folks wiping their eyes and not rushing to get out of the theater. Beware the onion ninjas when watching. Watch this movie with an appreciation for the human spirit and faith, you will not be disappointed and wish we had more movies like this to watch instead of the normal trashy Hollywood fare.","user":"tjclaus","rank":[31,36]},{"title":"A charming English Chistmas tale","rating":7,"date":"30 November 2016","review":"This modern Christmas movie is set in England shortly after the turn of the 20th Century. It's based on the 2013 novel of the same title by Max Lucado. The story takes place mostly in a fictitious English town somewhere in the rural countryside. Gladbury has a reputation, at least among some, of being the Christmas Candle town. It comes from a legend that every 25 years, an angel appears in the Haddington candle works and blesses a single candle. Whoever receives that candle, lights it and prays and their prayers are answered - many by miracles. This has been going on for a few generations, and some pretty convincing miracles of the past back up the story.<br><br>But now, a new vicar for the Cadbury church and parish comes to town. Hans Matheson plays Rev. David Richmond. While a man of faith, he doesn't believe in modern miracles. Halfway through the story we find out about a tragic loss in his life that rocked his faith. He's determined to end the superstitious tradition in the town. One can guess how this might end, and the screenplay is very good as the story unfolds. There's much in here about family, abut personal losses and suffering, and about healing, faith, hope and friendship. <br><br>This is a good Christmas movie in a nice setting. I don't think it's great, as some think. I noted some reviewers disliked it to the point of reviling it. I suspect they are people who have no religious faith or beliefs. Atheists and agnostics for the most part seldom seem to enjoy films of this nature. That's OK, of course. But, rather than their agonizing through the watching of such films, it should dawn on them in the first place not to watch something they won't enjoy. Most other viewers should find this movie enjoyable.<br><br>The rather extensive cast in this film all are quite good. Most of the production qualities are good. I always enjoy scenery shots in England. It truly is a garden country, with plants in bloom, it seems, at any time of year. <br><br>In one scene, Thomas Haddington (played by Sam Crane) pulls into town in a Stanley Steamer. Considering the yet rarity of automobiles at that time, I'm surprised that the director of this film didn't have several people staring at the car in amazement Instead, only Edward and Bea Haddington (played by Sylvester McCoy and Lesley Manville) watch their son's noisy arrival and comment on it. Thomas tells his parents, \"I had it sent over from America. It's a Stanley Steamer -- one of the first.\"<br><br>I wonder why though, this film was released in America a month before its release in England (Nov. 15 and Dec. 13, respectively). It's a thoroughly British production, set in and filmed in England. My hunch is that in the U.S. we've become so commercialized that we begin to celebrate a following holiday before we even observe the next one. I was in chain stores this year that were setting up Christmas displays in mid-October - a full month before Thanksgiving. But then, we don't usually buy gifts for Thanksgiving, do we? <br><br>\"The Christmas Candle\" is a film that the whole family should enjoy. It's a bit slow, but the mystique about the candle may be able to hold the attention of restless young ones. <br><br>Oh, yes! This may be of interest to some. I recently came across a Web site for Gladbury, \"located in the County of Gloomshire.\" Well, there is no county named Gloomshire, nor village named Gladbury. The Web site is a hoax, and the names should be a hint - they have \"gloom\" and \"glad\" in their titles. The Web site tries to look official, but beyond a cartoon style map it doesn't have any photos. It lists a town of 133,000 population. Another dead giveaway is its directory of services. It must list two to four dozen churches, a bunch of school, a dozen or most post offices, a hospital, several solicitors, but nary a single actual business - bakery, barber, carpenter, dentist, electrician, garage, plumber, etc. It's funny and must have been fun for someone to go to all the trouble to create a phony place, but for what purpose? Unless, someone watched this movie and was interested in trying to find the real town? Perhaps. Check it out for fun - but note that the town is not renowned for candles. Rather, a cloth industry in the past, and clock making that eventually went belly-up.","user":"SimonJack","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"A Fresh Breath of Christmas Air!","rating":10,"date":"28 November 2013","review":"If you like inspiring, hope-filled Christmas movies, then you'll definitely want to see \"The Christmas Candle.\" I was pleasantly surprised at how well the movie was made. It would definitely hold up to any mainstream movie in its genre. The acting was great overall, the costumes were beautiful and it was easy to get drawn into the story. I also really like how they introduced Susan Boyle's character. The characters in the movie deal with real, relatable hardships and disappointments as they all secretly hope for a Christmas miracle. This movie celebrates communities coming together, faith and the true meaning of Christmas. It leaves you with the warm, uplifted feeling you hope to have after watching a Christmas movie.","user":"CometDarner","rank":[24,32]}]
