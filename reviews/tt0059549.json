[{"title":"How the German V1 & 2 rockets where dealt with.","rating":7,"date":"7 June 2000","review":"Excellent suspense movie. This one probably \"disappeared among the \"Guns of Navarone\" imitators during the 60's. A pity, since it is worth having a look at. Some points in its favour: \"Unpredictable\" - characters who usually don't die in movies like this dies unexpectedly and in unexpected order (it doesn't follow the clichés). The spies sent on undercover missions into Germany are actually forced to speak German, and various ruses to cover up the accents have to be made. One negative aside though. At times it seems that two movies are being shown at the same time, a docu-drama about the actual bombings of England and a totally fictitious (albeit exciting) spy drama.","user":"thomas j-2","rank":[34,36]},{"title":"Could have been Bond in WWII","rating":7,"date":"26 May 2001","review":"Exciting WWII adventure spy thriller resembles Bond films of the sixties. Elaborate underground German rocket base reminds me of a Ken Adem set.<br><br>Sophia's early demise is a startling shock which adds credibility to the film as a thriller. The best of Peppards three war film trilogy. Also look for Anthony Quayle playing against type as a nazi out to stop Peppard. Great fun.","user":"louiss","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"Undeservingly ignored WWII spy-thriller","rating":8,"date":"11 January 2003","review":"I remember seeing  this movie as a kid and  pretty bored I was,  but having recently caught it on the BBC  I was surprised how good it really is.<br><br>\nMovie's basic outline concerns the development of the German V-1 and V-2 weapons and the subsequent  allied attempt  to infiltrate the underground factories at  Peenemünde, where most of these these so-called `Vergeltungswaffen' ('revenge' weapons) were assembled<br><br>Richard Anderson is the British government top official  who  puts  a team together- Peppard, Kemp and Courtenay- posing as Dutch engineers volunteering to work for the Reich.<br><br>As the spystory itself is undoubtedly heavily fictionalised the rest is pretty  historically accurate. Movie has an elaborate script featuring a plot full of twists and loopholes. instead of relying on big battle scenes or derring-do. Which is probably the reason  why it was a bit ignored by the public and critics alike on its release.  Moviegoers were expecting some straightforward   war epic as \"The battle of the Bulge\", \"The Heroes of Telemark\" or \"Von Ryan's Express\", all released in 1965, with plenty of action but seriously lacking in the historic credibility department.<br><br>(spoiler ahead) Actors are solid but watch out for Anthony Quayle as an unusually shrewd German counterintelligence officer and the fact that some of the main stars get killed halfway the movie. Special effects in recreating the V-weapons  and their subsequent effect on London are, definitly for that time, very well executed.<br><br>There are several subplots,  one involving Sophia Loren, but most interesting is the one with famous female  Nazi test-pilot Hannah Reitsch (Barbara Rütting), as what must be only time  she is personified on the big screen.  Movie claims she actually had to test flight the V1, which was a not more then a flying bomb but the Germans  first wanted to use it as some sort of semi-kamikaze contraption, with the pilot bailing out at the last minute.  After several killed pilots they wisely opted for a simple unmanned version.  These were launched en masse at London and other already liberated European cities. Incidentally, the biopic `The Glen Miller Story' (1954)  has  an important scene with Miller's orchestra playing while being under attack of several V1's. Quite another beast was the V2,  a real  ballistic missile  and a 'wonder' weapon  if there ever was one. It was  capable of going up in to the stratosphere and remained undetected by radar and reaching speeds of up to 2 mach and at that time impossible to detect and to shoot down.  A few hundreds were launched and did some important damage to major  supply lines (especially the vital Belgian port of Antwerp)  but never seriously endangered the allied offensives. The later ICBM's carrying nuclear warheads are all  based on the V2.<br><br>(major spoiler ahead) Finally the produces  must have realised they had tot put some action sequences in it to justify the star cast and budget resulting  in a  very Bondlike  action sequence trying to prevent, with the help of Bomber Command,  a test flight of an improved V2  capable of reaching New York (!).<br><br>The British actually bombed Peenemunde several times, which seriously delayed construction time and was instrumental in moving  almost the whole plant  underground (as most German heavy industry after 1943).<br><br>\nBritish Director Michael Anderson  is best-known for another WWII tale `The Dam Busters', also  the SF-epic `Logan's Run' and the TV-series `The Martian Chronicles'  He was active until 2000,still turning out the occasional TV-movie.<br><br>George Peppard and Jeremy Kemp would team up again next year in the spectacular `The Blue Max' this time not involving rockets  but WWI flying crates.<br><br>\nSee OC in its original Cinemascope format. Sadly the BBC choose to air in the so-called 'pan-and-scan'version,  seriously harming the colour and perspective.<br><br>If you like this try  `The battle of Britain'.<br><br>I gave it an 8.","user":"pete36","rank":[44,50]}]
