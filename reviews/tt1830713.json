A giant alien spider escapes from a military lab and rampage the city of Los Angeles . When a massive military (commanded by Major Braxton : Ray Wise and Lt. Karly Brant : Clare Kramer) strike fails , it is up to a team of scientists and one clever exterminator to kill the creature before the city is destroyed . Meanwhile , the bloodthirsty spider meet up local citizens and spontaneously catch them and begins to consume people . Later on , the gigantic spider over a skyscraper surrounded by planes shooting similarly to ¨King King¨ movie . The gigantesque spider rapidly multiplies and the protagonists confronting with them , being L. A. town devastated by the attacks . When Downtown Los Angeles , including City Hall , under attack , an eclectic bunch led by bug/pest exterminator Alex Mathis(starring \"Heroes\" alumni Greg Grunberg) along with a security agent called Jose Ramos (Lombardo Boyar) and Army Lieutenant (Clare Kramer) take on the evil spiders . <br><br>This monster/comedy film with medium budget packs thrills , some good action and funny moments . It's a hybrid of monster movies from the 50s such as 'Tarantula' and modern American production plenty of C.G.I. The thrilling screenplay is a bit yawn-inspiring but nifty special effects will keep you from dozing off , with nice creatures designers, created by means of Animatronics and computer visual effects . This is a suspenseful and amusing Sci-Fi/thriller/comedy especially at the amazing ending tableau when Greg Grunberg , Lombardo and Clare Kramer have to tackle the gigantic spider in the final . The picture was professionally directed by Mike Mendez (¨The killers¨, ¨The Conven,\" \"Masters of Horror\" ¨, ¨The Gravedancers¨) with rather too much camera movement and there are also lots of low-angle shots of people hanging around waiting to get bitten by the carnivorous spider . This Mike Mendez's newest film \"Big Ass Spider!\" for Epic Pictures premiered at the 2013 SXSW Film Festival and had a limited theatrical worldwide . Although nothing which haven't been seen before, this is not the picture to watch if you are scared of spiders , however the movie is quite entertaining . Utterly arachnophobia people must flee this film.<br><br>Other movies about this Spider sub-genre are the followings : ¨Tarantula (1955)¨ by Jack Arnold with John Agar ; ¨Tarantula: the deadly cargo (1977)¨ with Claude Akins ; ¨Kingdom of spiders (77)¨ by John Budd Cardos with William Shatner , ¨Arachnophobia(1990)¨ by Frank Marshall with John Goodman , ¨Arachnid¨ (2000) by Jack Sholder with Chris Potter , Jose Sancho , Neus Asensi and ¨Eight Legged Freaks¨ (2002) by Ellory Elkayem with Scarlett Johansson , Kari Wuhrer , and David Arquette .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"The Title Tells You All You Need To Know","rating":7,"date":"24 July 2013","review":"Alex (Greg Grunberg) is an exterminator working in Los Angeles, whose speciality is spiders – he can get inside their minds, you see. A minor spider bite sends him to the local emergency room, where he soon learns that something has infiltrated the place. Turns out there was a military \"accident\" and soon the hospital is taken over by a Special Forces Major (Ray Wise) and his crew, including lovely Carly (Clare Kramer). But it is up to Alex and his sidekick, hospital security guard Jose (Lombardo Boyar) to figure out how to save the day.... Really, a movie like this needs no description, as it says it all in the title – there's a Big-Ass Spider threatening downtown LA! Very funny, a little gory (but only very briefly), this film had rather more character development than I'd expect in an 85-minute popcorn movie – and it was a perfect film to see with the great FantAsia audience too!","user":"alisonc-1","rank":[26,52]}]
