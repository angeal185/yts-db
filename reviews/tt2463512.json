[{"title":"Loved 'Hateship Loveship'","rating":9,"date":"13 April 2014","review":"The storyline of 'Hateship Loveship' does not feel particularly revelatory or original on the surface but by the time the credits roll it proves itself to be something of great worth.<br><br>Kristen Wiig plays Johanna, a carer starting a new job looking after Nick Nolte and his rebellious granddaughter Sabitha. Wiig is devastating to watch. Her character has lead a sheltered life and looks on the verge of tears a lot of the time. She is very gentle and tentative, and able to express a multitude of emotions just from a tilt of the head or twitch of the mouth. <br><br>Her casting in this film could have fallen quite easily into the 'comedy actress trying to be serious in a movie' camp, but it rises above that in favour of something far more truthful. <br><br>Johanna's introversion is challenged when after falling victim to a prank she is paired together with Sabitha's recovering addict father Ken played by Guy Pearce. The combination of her complete innocence with his world weary, compulsive behaviour make for some fantastic moments of mundane realism, and bittersweet comedy. <br><br>The film contains themes of love across three generations, loss, and family responsibility, and although they are all sentimental ideas due to the high quality of acting and direction involved it never becomes mawkish about it. Uplifting without being preachy. I never felt like I was being told what to feel, but just being allowed to witness a set of very relatable, charming characters negotiating the situations they find themselves in.<br><br>Days later Kristen Wiig's performance is still lingering in my mind.","user":"clockwork_orange45","rank":[51,61]},{"title":"Unexpectedly beautiful","rating":9,"date":"16 March 2014","review":"I was able to view to this movie via PPV before it hits theaters. I had no prior knowledge of the movie, and honestly pretty low expectations based on the description given, but I thought wth, I'll give it a try. I am SO glad I did. This movie was an unexpected beauty. I loved seeing both Kristen Wiig and Guy Pearce in very different roles than they typically play. This film is understated, it's slow going yet the pace feels perfect. There may not be any HUGE moments, but there are a couple \"really good\" ones. This film starts out with an almost sad feeling, but totally goes in an unexpected direction, and is so much more than it's description. It offers amazing yet gentle insight into various relationships, real-life scenarios, and excellent acting. I loved Nick Nolte in this. All around, this film left a good feeling inside my heart. It's about embracing imperfection, loving people for who they are, yet showing them how much more than can be if someone believes in them. At least, that's what I took away from it. So much more than I expected, love it! I am quite picky about movies, especially slower-moving independent films..but this- I loved. Well worth the money and time. 9/10","user":"movie_mentality","rank":[54,66]},{"title":"So Glad I Finally Took This Movie Home","rating":8,"date":"17 September 2014","review":"Being funny on the screen seems effortless to Kristen Wiig. Her comedic clowning skills are on a par with Lucille Ball and Shelly Long. Sincerity, however, doesn't come as easily — especially when her character is plain and charmless.<br><br>HATESHIP LOVESHIP sat on the Thriftway DVD rental shelf for several weeks. I took note of its great cast: Wiig, supported by Guy Pierce, Nick Nolte, Hailee Steinfeld, Christine Lahti, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. What could go wrong there? My memories of GIRL MOST LIKELY (which was supposed to be a comedy, but whiffed miserably) prevented me from taking the chance. Wiig's performance as said GIRL lacked any charm whatsoever; she was drab, homely, and totally unappealing. So, what was she going to do with this, her first dramatic role? It didn't look promising at all.<br><br>Finally, I took HATESHIP LOVESHIP home. And, I'm so very glad I did. What a splendid collaboration between star, cast, screenwriter, director and crew in this adaptation of Alice Munro's short story. Ain't no heroes here. These are real, extremely flawed human beings. They might live next door to anyone. They might be anyone.<br><br>Wiig's Johanna is a caretaker. That's what makes her life make sense. And, that's her odd beauty. She also finds herself attracted to bad boy Ken (Pierce) a drug-addicted user with delusions of accomplishing something that will finally give him independence.<br><br>But no one in this story seems to feel entitled to anything. They've all been wounded. So they protect themselves.<br><br>No one is hanging from a cliff. No clock is ticking. No fuse is burning down. Yet, somehow watching Johanna scrub a long-neglected bathtub filled me with worry, hoping she wasn't setting herself up for disaster.<br><br>The sex scenes, while not showing any nudity, are luscious and beautiful. I hope to see more of Liza Johnson. She is one gifted and inspired director.<br><br>Yeah, maybe Ken will never change. But it won't be for Johanna's lack of patience, and devotion. The story leaves us rootin' for the dude — and loving her. The doormat has won his respect and admiration. And ours. She deserves it.","user":"randbish","rank":[26,32]}]
