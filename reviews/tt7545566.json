[{"title":"The skatepark version of Lady Bird","rating":9,"date":"16 July 2018","review":"//Revelation Film Festival Review//<br><br>Watching Skate Kitchen is like reconnecting with a group of friends you haven't seen for ages but upon meeting up its like not even a day has passed. It's a breezy, relentlessly entertaining coming of age story that's a delight to watch. <br><br>Set amongst the New York subculture, the story focuses on Camille (newcomer Rachelle Vinberg), an 18 year-old Long Island teen who runs away from home to join a female skateboarding posse called Skate Kitchen. Connecting with the group as a kindred spirit, Camille struggles to reconcile her strained relationship with her mother with her newfound sense of belonging. Much like this year's best picture nominee Lady Bird, Skate Kitchen will prove instantly relatable to anyone who struggled to fit in during their formative years.","user":"DJKwa","rank":[22,27]},{"title":"Not a Film That I Would Expect to Like, Yet I Did","rating":7,"date":"1 December 2018","review":"Successfully using non-professional actors at the time (with the exceptions of Elizabeth Rodriguez and Jaden Smith) this quasi-documentary centers on the NYC female skateboarding collective known as Skate Kitchen. It falls short at times, but overall I found it another fascinating film from director Crystal Moselle (The Wolfpack).<br><br>Although I'm way out of the intended demographic of the movie, I still was quite engaged and interested in the characters of the Skate Kitchen. With the exception of the lead here Camille (Rachelle Vinberg), we really don't find out a lot about the backgrounds or history of these teens. Thus, the movie is more about the portrayal of female friendship and bonding at this age, with the, at times, inevitable crossing paths with some male skateboarders.<br><br>Not a film that I would expect to like, yet I was taken in by the intimate portrayal of these teens, while trying not to judge their futures.","user":"larrys3","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"It's Just A Good Teen Story & That's Enough","rating":7,"date":"21 October 2018","review":"There is no message or lecture in this film. It's just a good teen female story &amp; that's enough.<br><br>I've seen several attempts at teen-realism movies in the past few years which fall flat on their... because of a heavy PC lecture element which really turns folk off. Thankfully Skate Kitchen does not do that &amp; that is one of the reasons for its success - it's just a good story.<br><br>'Teen-realism' is obviously tongue-in-cheek because no movie is ever realistic. But I like the world created by the writer/director here. It's harnessed a fairytale vibe which is no bad thing in a story of about young women. It allows the beauty/femininity of the characters to come through which allows the audience to empathise.<br><br>This un-PC man liked it.","user":"LouieInLove","rank":[8,9]}]
