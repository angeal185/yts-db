[{"title":"Boring film with very little scenes of non scary creatures who jus seems to make noises n nothing else.","rating":3,"date":"5 April 2018","review":"I saw this on a pirated dvd few days back. Got enticed due to the trailer. The only good thing about this film is the settings n for that i have been generous enuff to rate it 3 stars.\nTher is too much of chatting, too much of stupidity. Almost nothin happens till 70 mins. We dont even get to see the creature mayhem.\nThe creatures/vampires r laughable. In one scene during nite time, a couple is surrounded by creatures outside their tent n nothing happens.\nAfter that they outrun the creatures by spraying pepper spray n voila there is sunlight. \nAgain they try to go back n its night time.\nThe creatures/vampires seems to b more afraid. The ending was kinda meh.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"Irritated me...","rating":4,"date":"26 March 2018","review":"A couple go into the woods for a camping trip and are told to stay away from the gray zone areas and stick to the green zone. It's pretty simple, really, but you know how these things turn out - in a moment of stupidity and after being warned a couple of times the guy's like, \"Hey! I know, let's take a short cut!\"...Next thing you know they find themselves in vampire territory.<br><br>Very Low-budget horror where the fear is generated by a combination of over-acted emotions and creature screams. You don't see much of the creature and when you do they're extremely lame and cheap. The only thing that saved this for me was that it wasn't a found-footage film. I saw the 6/10 rating so I was expecting something good but I ended up very disappointed.","user":"michaelant555","rank":[21,29]},{"title":"Bad horror, bad actors","rating":1,"date":"26 March 2018","review":"Theres no plot, not anything of relevance happening.\nthe girl tends to tease her tits, but thats it.<br><br>just another student film, not even worth being called horror.<br><br>do yourself a favor and save the time","user":"allesmussnixkann","rank":[15,20]}]
