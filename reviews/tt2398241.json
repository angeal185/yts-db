[{"title":"This movie is the perfect Smurfs movie","rating":8,"date":"23 April 2017","review":"This has all the spirit of Peyo. The bad critics are unfair, because they do not see the fact that this is made for the children and the adults that has them in their childhood. This movie has develop Smurfette's personality and role in the movie; she is more than the pretty girl who has the attention of the rest of Smurfs boys. The new smurfs girls lived in the forbidden forest creating an own culture and tradition that resembles the cult of the natives, which I found it very pleasant. And to end my positive critic, I believe this should go to a new step and make a new TV series of the Smurfs","user":"MaximeLoonatic","rank":[37,42]},{"title":"A perfect family movie! I give it 100%!","rating":10,"date":"26 April 2017","review":"The artwork is amazing and the visuals are a feast for the eyes. Great movie for kids to encourage their imagination. The story is entertaining and brought a lot of laughter to the audience. By the way, 3D is really worth the money! <br><br>I have never enjoyed an animated movie so much since \"Finding Nemo\". Our family all loved the movie and we plan to watch it again! <br><br>If you have not enjoyed Peyo's Smurfs or the TV series Smurfs, please give Smurfs 3 a chance and see it. It is a huge improvement over all past Smurfs. You will love it!","user":"gembayang","rank":[27,30]},{"title":"I'm letting my child write the review (except he can't write yet)","rating":8,"date":"24 April 2017","review":"I don't know what people are expecting from a kids movie. Its the smurfs. Its not like they were going to come out and make a new take on a classic. My son, who just turned six, said he loved it. The animation was beautiful. There were parts that did seem truly original. I enjoyed it and Frank Welker did an awesome job as always. I don't want to spoil anything, but the end credits scene was really funny to me. None of the recent kids movies I've seen have been all that original except Kubo and it was special in its blend of traditional and CG animation. See the Smurfs, or rent it, your kids will love it.","user":"northfacingphotography","rank":[30,34]}]
