[{"title":"Indie with a TV movie feel","rating":2,"date":"17 September 2017","review":"PASSING FANCY is an indie thriller about a female serial killer wreaking revenge against the male species due to abuse suffered in the past. Half of the film is a police procedural following a detective as he closes in on her and her crimes. What surprised me most about this one is how much it feels like a typical TV movie with lots of women talking to progress the plot and not much contentious material, aside from an explicit body cavity search.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Unrealistic movie","rating":2,"date":"10 April 2020","review":"Typical unrealistic movie as how can a person falls in love with the one who is against you. It's plot lacks the contentious material.","user":"freddiebthompson","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Awesome!","rating":10,"date":"6 August 2006","review":"Ron Stone I applaud you.
