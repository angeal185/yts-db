[{"title":"Could've been good","rating":1,"date":"5 November 2018","review":"The movie could've been good because the theme was good but the acting was so terrible!","user":"conniewinterfell","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Another arrogant Christian film!","rating":1,"date":"2 November 2018","review":"There were five reviews posted prior to mine... all by the same 'critic', all with the same fake 'rating' and all with the same fake drooling love. I down-voted them all!<br><br>This latest entry into the already saturated Christian nonsense niche is just terrible.<br><br>Out of work fireman becomes a drunk while people around him get sick and die. Eventually (and only as the very last resort) He looks to a higher power to solve all his woes.<br><br>If this is your idea of entertainment, then go for it. Normal people will find this a morbidly repellent film with the redeeming qualities of the devil's own backside!","user":"khunkrumark","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Nice story AWFUL acting","rating":3,"date":"13 November 2018","review":"First, anyone giving this 9 or 10 stars, just ignore their review - they've either got a brain tumor or it's a fake review. There is no way anyone could honestly give this film a high rating. The best actors are the children. The doctor talks rubbish, when asked how girl got cancer he responds \"as with any form of cancer, it's unknown\" and the main actors are wooden to the point that they seem bored with their own poor acting.\nMostly the film is superficial in the dialogue and execution. The story itself is actually quite touching, and yes I like a feel good Christian movie. Because the theme is quite sad and story concept is ok, the film redeems itself from being 1 star. However the acting just grinds away at you making the whole thing difficult to get involved in.","user":"uberdonkey6","rank":[2,2]}]
