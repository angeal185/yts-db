[{"title":"Never Judge A Film By Its Cover","rating":5,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"Every Friday, my local dvd store in London (yeah I know!) gets in new releases. I can get 3 films for £6 / $7.50 for 2 nights. Ooh I thought, this looks good (looking at the cover only!) I'll add it to my two other dvds for the £6 deal...and urm...meh! I found this film a bit 'arty farty' if I'm honest. It's low budget with flash backs, stills and good old cardboard dialogue in places. I also thought some of the acting wasn't great. Twas for me, but hey, you may like it. 5/10","user":"thekingsdom","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Not great","rating":5,"date":"16 May 2019","review":"A movie that reminds you that it's best not to meet your hero's in real life cause you'll be disappointed","user":"wanderer15701","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"he was a super star then","rating":7,"date":"16 May 2019","review":"This is an biographical take on patches of steve mcqueens life and spirits, and the makers have made a point of his frantic search for the favourite of his of all cars in the world, the one he drove in the film bullitt, and he didnt stop chasing after that car until his death in 1980,a car he really never obtained.<br><br>the chosen male actor in this kinda bundle of strained storie ,are a pretty nice spittin' image of mcqueen, and his voice and demeanors are very well matching the culprit.. the other main cast do a fine job too , and some of the dialouges are excellently done<br><br>its a low budget production, but it barely never shows, and thats mostly due to a great filmography and editing, and the choice of locations are marvelous and at times a breathtaker.<br><br>if you want to know the whole story about a tough actor the go to the documentary world, but this is a good addition to it all. recommende by the grumpy old man","user":"ops-52535","rank":[8,12]}]
