[{"title":"Have some Kleenex handy for this marvelous short film!","rating":10,"date":"18 June 2015","review":"This short film alone is more than enough reason to go see Inside Out.<br><br>When I went to the theater to see Inside Out tonight, little did I realize that the best part of my evening would be when they showed the short, Lava, before the feature film. However, like Inside Out, I doubt if Lava will resonate very well with small children, as its intended audience appears to be adults.<br><br>The short is very simple--as you'd expect in a short film. It consists of the most adorable volcano in history singing a love song--hoping that perhaps a girl volcano will answer his call. Amazingly strange, I'll admit but the film works remarkably well because Disney Animation is clearly working at its best on this one. The CGI is breathtaking--working magnificently with the 3-D technology-- something that isn't true of most 3-D films. The story is lovely as well and will most likely have many of you reaching for your Kleenex. The bottom line is that this is one terrific short and more than reason enough to arrive at the theater with plenty of time to spare so you don't miss a moment of this lovely film.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[39,54]},{"title":"Amazing","rating":10,"date":"15 June 2015","review":"This is an Academy Award worthy short film. The music is amazing, the artistry was beautiful, and I may have even shed a tear or two. It is a must see for all. Pixar is a petri dish for animation geniuses. This is by far one of their best shorts yet. It is as good if not better than Paperman and Knick Knack . Not to mention it blows Frozen Fever out of the water despite the cute Snowgies. In fact I'd pay to see Inside Out again just for this short. My only complaints are that I have no where to download the song, and l have to wait for the next Pixar Short Films Collection. I give it a 10 star rating. But don't take my word for it go see it yourself.","user":"nuclearchildren","rank":[32,46]},{"title":"Cute, funny, sad, it has it all","rating":8,"date":"12 June 2015","review":"This was a cute little short that actually really surprised me in may ways. I had no idea whether it was going to be good or not and it was actually pretty damn good. Going into inside out i was trying to save my tears for that, i didn't expect i would be using them up in the short beforehand. This was similar to inside out in that it manages to take you from being very happy and enjoying it to the point of almost crying and welling up at the drop of a hat. The singing was also a great way of telling the story in a fun and uplifting manner. But in the end it was still a fun and cute little story that is very enjoyable. - 7.6","user":"stephendaxter","rank":[23,35]}]
