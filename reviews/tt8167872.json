[{"title":"West Virginia opioid epidemic is beginning to see hope.","rating":10,"date":"2 May 2018","review":"Elaine and Kerrin Sheldon's compassion for those suffering with substance use disorders in West Virginia is evident in their ongoing dedication to get the true story of struggle and perseverance out to the world. This documentary is visceral and a true portrayal of a group of men working to maintain sobriety and assist others with doing the same. Another amazing film; job well done!","user":"dougleech","rank":[9,14]},{"title":"Beautiful film on tough subject, offers hope","rating":10,"date":"13 June 2018","review":"I was incredibly impressed with the sensitivity of these filmmakers. Addiction is a difficult subject to address, particularly when it deals with young adults, yet Elaine and Kerrin's compassion and commitment to the truth shine through. If you want to understand America's opioid epidemic and how we can address it, watch this film.","user":"holleetemple","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"One View of Recovery In W.V.","rating":8,"date":"30 June 2018","review":"My heart is in West Virginia: I love the people, their traditional music and mores, AND, my son's best friend lives in Morgantown. <br><br>It's no secret that many of the small cities (and many large ones) that run from coast to coast in America have been decimated by hard drugs, limited work opportunities, and lack of entertainment options. <br><br>This documentary is set in a new treatment program, opened by a local doctor/businessman, based on farming and the 12 Steps. Participants stay 6 months, and are then moved to sober living. The film follows the five(?) initial participants through the early months of their recovery. <br><br>These sort of services are definitely needed (ideally privately funded), but the service providers sometimes worry about/work harder on the participants' lives than the participants do. (MY definition of \"enabling\"). Still, they're actually DOING something, and something GOOD.","user":"SusanLervold","rank":[4,7]}]
