[{"title":"not what I expected","rating":3,"date":"6 January 2020","review":"I read the book from Sophie Kinsella a couple times, and totally loved it. Also I love the lead actors, they're great, but in this movie it was just shallow and boring. They didn't have any chemistry. I hope they have better jobs than this. Or better directors or producers.\nI don't recommend for anybody.","user":"djmate-20985","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Three stars for Alexandra beautiful eyes","rating":3,"date":"15 September 2019","review":"It is boring, shallow, not important and not funny. There is no chemistry between the lead actors. Their secrets are ordinary and I am not interested in them.","user":"claire1345","rank":[79,101]},{"title":"Read the book","rating":5,"date":"13 September 2019","review":"The book is one of my absolute favorites. I read it a couple times a year so I expected to be disappointed with the movie just because they are rarely as good. That being said, even acknowledging my bias I have to say the movie came off rushed and shallow. Some of the comedic Elements just came across as flat and it felt like they couldn't decide if it was suppose to be American Pie raunchy or a sweet preteen rom com.<br><br>Just read the book. It's amazing. The movie? Don't spend money. Wait for Netflix","user":"kcanasta","rank":[42,52]}]
