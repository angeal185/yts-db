[{"title":"Something fishy is going on","rating":4,"date":"12 February 2017","review":"The concept was actually pretty good. The acting wasn't bad. The movie did suffer due to some of the dialogue, and I'm not expert on cinema, but I suspect the directing and budget hurt it as well. I was shocked to see Liotta and Martin Scorsese, then I realized that the director was Cathy Scorsese. I can only assume a family member decided to break into directing and Martin and Ray gave them a little help. Hey, that's cool. I would do the same for my kids. Everyone wants their kids to be successful. In any event, it's a weird ride that comes together at the end... well, as much as a low-budget mediocre movie can pull that off. It wasn't the worst way to spend a Sunday afternoon.","user":"bek-12","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Amateur Hour.. and 50 minutes!","rating":3,"date":"20 February 2017","review":"I will assume this movie was some sort of a school project, and given that Cathy Scorsese is Martin Scorsese's daughter, and god knows who Kenneth M. Waddell is, but he must be related to him as well, and that would explain why a few known actors, Ray Liotta and Mr. Scorsese himself, are all appearing in this amateur piece.<br><br>Though I will never know how Martin Scorsese could've read this script and not suggest any changes to it, it all starts with the weak script dealing with the theme of (SPOILERS: AI and being in a simulation :SPOILERS), something that has been done a million times before, but fails badly at this incarnation because of the weak script, with no tangible plot and lame characters.<br><br>Now comes the production, yes, it's shot on what looks like HDV, yes the production value is mediocre, but that's understandable with a small budget, but what is not excusable is the horrible editing, CGI, directing and sound production, this is the worst sound editing and mixing I've ever heard in my life in a \"professional\" project, I've seen YouTube videos with better production, and I've seen CGI done by kids that were miles ahead of the pathetic stuff done in this movie.","user":"MohamedFawzy","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"DO NOT WATCH","rating":1,"date":"2 May 2019","review":"At first this movie didn't look bad, then I saw the first minute and I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. It was filled with plot holes and bad acting. I would not recommend anyone to watch this.","user":"bradleycr","rank":[3,3]}]
