[{"title":"A must see documentary","rating":10,"date":"19 June 2015","review":"Hopefully this project will get the recognition that it deserves. It's an amazing glimpse into an unbearably difficult experience, but for those who are willing to share it the journey is well worthwhile. Your heart will break, but you will walk away inspired to live your life with purpose, reminded to cherish whatever time you are given here. Somehow, after watching what this poor family and lovely man had to endure, many/most of my \"problems\" just didn't seem that significant anymore. This is one of those rare documentaries that helps to put our often baffling existence into context. Kudos to both the family and the filmmakers for offering this to the world. For fans of Andy Whitfield, it's a must-see; everyone else will be a fan once they've seen it. Highly recommended!!!","user":"bestboygrip-45085","rank":[64,65]},{"title":"A genuinely astonishing project","rating":10,"date":"14 June 2015","review":"Most people who are drawn to this documentary are probably already familiar with the story of Andy Whitfield, the star of the television series Spartacus. All I can say is that knowing his story and experiencing it in this one-of-a-kind documentary are two completely different things. This movie will take you on a journey, but you should be prepared - it is not for the emotionally fainthearted. The viewer accompanies the Whitfield family in one the most harrowing ordeals imaginable, offering a unique and unflinching view of something that our society generally prefers to ignore, or to keep hidden. This movie is necessary, in other words. How often can we say that? We were fortunate enough to attend the premiere at the LA Film Fest, and I must say that it was a great honor to share that experience with the filmmakers and with the courageous Vashti Whitfield. My wife and I were both emotionally stricken and uplifted; it was a cathartic experience of the highest order. Hopefully this documentary will get the recognition that it clearly deserves. If fewer of us watched Jurassic Park 4 (which was also screening at the multiplex) and more of us experienced Be Here Now, our society would be greatly enriched.<br><br>I urge you all to see it.","user":"creationisalive","rank":[54,56]},{"title":"It gets you without you realising","rating":8,"date":"2 June 2016","review":"I read the reviews here before going in, not expecting the film to live up to them and leaving the cinema I thought it hadn't.<br><br>On the train home I thought it hadn't, The following few days I thought it hadn't and then I realised it was taking up all my spare brain space. I watched the midnight showing of the new star wars, even on the way home I had moved on from that. This never left, it was raw, it was emotional, even knowing the outcome you wished for it to be different. You cry for the family and because of the story and because of how they opened up their lives to show you something as personal as this. Live for the moment as you never know, if you can, go see this film!, Be Here Now!","user":"ben_arner","rank":[24,26]}]
