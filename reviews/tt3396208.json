[{"title":"Good performance by the lead","rating":6,"date":"19 November 2018","review":"The lead actor, is unrecognisable Sam Upton, who also wrote the script and directed. Now this is a low budget movie, with a script that needed improvement.\nThe whole cast is okay, although Mark Boone Junior could have done a little better, being the good actor he is. But then again the script, what can an actor do when the script is below par. And the budget was so low that some scenes suffered and made the movie less believable. Anyway, the lead is amazing. He really carries the whole movie, and is really the only one, besides some guys who beat him up, who is completely believable. He really did a tour de force. Jared Abrahamson did a descent job (as did Cassi Thomson, who plays his wife), and also was convincing, especially in the end. In other words this movie has some memorable scenes, it's about pain, and it does capture that. But it's not really clear in what it wants to say. But perhaps that does not matter, perhaps that could even be it's strength. A 6 for effort and the two lead actors.","user":"Madhu-Van-Paare","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Worth the watch","rating":7,"date":"24 November 2018","review":"When I started watching this movie I was not spell bound but after about half an hour the gritty filming and performance by Sam Upton I wasn't spellbound.\nA solid performance and story of overcoming your own demons that deserves much more than an average of 5.2","user":"jacquesdewit-159-856457","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self.","rating":7,"date":"4 December 2018","review":"It might not be Rocky but it's a worthy indipendant contender. There is a lot of great preformances in this film and they keep you invested in the characters and storyline. Give it a shot if you're a fan of the genre and you'll probably enjoy it.","user":"DeadMansTrousers","rank":[2,2]}]
