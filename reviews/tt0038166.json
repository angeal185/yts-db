[{"title":"A Historical Note","rating":7,"date":"28 October 2006","review":"Most everything about this neat little movie has been said by previous posters, except this.<br><br>The motivation for making it was, of all things, the US State Department! The US was deeply involved in fighting World War Two. At this point in time the average American knew almost NOTHING about South America, and the Nazi government was busy making business and political connections there, especially in Paraguay... there, transplanted Germans were a well established colony. They were aiding Hitler's war effort with the operation of industrial concerns, as well as providing espionage support.<br><br>South America promised to become a new battlefront if German successes and infiltration continued. The region produced vital strategic raw materials, key among them rubber.<br><br>Our strongest ally in the region was Brazil. The US Navy had a number of installations there, both sea and air. The Brazilian Navy worked closely with US forces in hunting U-boats in the Atlantic narrows; a number of US Navy vessels were transferred to them. American air bases (the largest of which was at Recife) provides home base for American aircraft, both fixed wing and lighter than air blimps, to provide air support coverage to trans Atlantic convoy operations.<br><br>The State department felt it would be a good idea to familiarize Americans with the land, people, and way of life of South America, and called on Disney to produce THE THREE CABALLEROS. The movie was, first and foremost, a TEACHING TOOL for both military forces and the general public during a global war.<br><br>BTW... I love the crazy little bird too! HE'S the best part of the film!<br><br>There are two other Disney films made for the Government that I'd LOVE to find copies of.<br><br>One is VICTORY THROUGH AIR POWER, another WW2 product.<br><br>The other is one that I saw back in Basic Training in the 1970s. Believe it or not, the Walt Disney studios produced a military training film on the prevention of VENEREAL DISEASE!!! The unfortunate Lady dispensing said commodity bore a VERY striking resemblance to Snow White! <br><br>Because of that film I can never view SNOW WHITE in quite the same way ever again!","user":"Gavno","rank":[25,26]},{"title":"Disney goes surrealist","rating":8,"date":"26 March 2007","review":"The Three Caballeros is a lot of fun, using a mix of live action and animation to bring Brazil and Mexico alive to birthday boy Donald Duck. As he's joined by Panchito and José he realises what he has been missing all these years, falls in love with Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen), learns to dance, and much more.<br><br>With eye-poppingly beautiful animation and lovely colours, it is no surprise that that was the one cartoon Disney veteran Ward Kimball claimed he was truly proud of. The idea of the three birds as international musketeers living the good life is inspired and the running time is just about right.","user":"didi-5","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"So, there I was, walking down Disneyland's Main Street along with some friends.","rating":8,"date":"8 June 2002","review":"It was a cold January Saturday evening. The park was beautifully lit. People were cheery. We could see the Matterhorn on our right hand side. Magical is the best description I could find.<br><br>Suddenly, I started singing...<br><br>\"Somos los tres carros, los Tres Caballeros, y nadie es igual a nosotros...\"<br><br>What do I know. My friends all knew the words. 4 guys, ranging from 27 to 31 years old, began forming a chrous line and singing off the top of our lungs...<br><br>I don't know how this happened. This is not, by any stretch of imagination, a popular or wildly succesful film. I guess it just touched us, the way Donald Duck had a mexican friend (Panchito), or the wild \"Piñata\" scene, or the strong latin flavour of the film.<br><br>Memories notwithstanding, we kept on singing... and singing... and singing.<br><br>People around us seemed to enjoy the show, too.<br><br>\"Valientes brillamos, como brilla un peso<br><br>-Quien dice?!?<br><br>NOSOTROS, LOS TRES CABALLEROS!\"","user":"fjhuerta-2","rank":[31,38]}]
