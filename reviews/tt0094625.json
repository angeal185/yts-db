[{"title":"It Is Violent","rating":8,"date":"30 July 2019","review":"So i love it! Not the usual.\nThe story is complex and condensed for the sake of the movie and as such hard to understand. I recommend reading the source material first. Imagine how bad an American remake would be if they messed up Ghost In The Shell that much!!","user":"kashtynandel","rank":[98,103]},{"title":"Scary.... American remakers That Is!","rating":8,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"Akira is great. I have been watching ot every years for 30 years or so and honestly it still holds up, One has to watch it more than once to get it. The ride is well worth it.\nScary part is the Hollywood remake machine has found it. I cannot wait for the toned down, dumbed down, gender switch, franchise standard one-liners and fat twerking tattooed American 'women' to make an Appearance. And I am an American!\nSigh!","user":"landreeshahid","rank":[144,161]},{"title":"Neo Tokyo Is Out of This World","rating":9,"date":"12 January 2020","review":"Akira is fun, intriguing, violent and original. Beyond that this anime is famously the first, and a very early example, of an animation with completely matching and synchronous mouth movements for all the characters, which is an achievement for the fictitious and full-length feature.\nThey are remaking this in Hollywood. I have owned a DVD of Akira for two decades and watch it every year. I will not be attending the American 'Akira.'","user":"roviovvsd","rank":[23,24]}]
