[{"title":"I enjoyed this movie","rating":8,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"This is a sumptuous historical epic drama that brings a famous Indian poem to life. This story is like a fairytale set in the dreamy past: a beautiful queen, a handsome king, a cruel enemy warlord, glorious costumes, and gorgeous settings. The love story between the couple is romantic, elegant and courageous. The cultural traditions attempt to reflect the ancient time period. The movie also includes lively dancing and singing scenes. The actors are quite adept in their roles and bring strong emotions to the tale. The skilled costume designers deserve many awards! The English translations are large and very easy to read. The movie is very engaging, and for a non-Hindi speaker, a good introduction to the fabulous \"Bollywood\" world of cinema.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[39,41]},{"title":"An eye candy movie; And its not the magnun opus of Sanjay Leela Bhansali","rating":5,"date":"25 January 2018","review":"From the very beginning, this movie will try to buy you out with its lavish sets, costumes and visual effects but as it proceeds futher it only seems like a show-off; how they have spent so much money. This movie is one dimensional like its characters and the writing is too lazy: both for the character developement and screenplay. The dialogues were pathetic, self-glorifying and at places they were quite absurd. Its quite funny actually when you see the close-ups come after a dialogue and these are apparently meant for you to clap or shout or blow whistles in the theatre. Amongst the lead trio, Shahid was pretty convincing but Ranveer's role was seemingly over stretched and Deepika had literaaly the same expression on her face throughout the movie. This movie was long and filled with shots showing the shallow depth of the background to make you notice its vastness. And don't forget some really good plot holes, and these are many in number too.<br><br>However, the cinematography was good. Some visuals were great but the dance nubers were the ones to rescue. They were very well choreographed and the music was great( These reminded me me of watching a Bhansali movie).<br><br>If you sum the movie all up, then its nothing more than a mediocre treatment to an epic tale and you will feel that showing great pieces of art on screen doesn't make it a great art itself.","user":"gputhal","rank":[82,127]},{"title":"Tediously prolix. A perfect example of an ethnocentric n regressive film.","rating":1,"date":"11 December 2019","review":"The editing is horrendous n the film is very boring. The action sequences r copied from Hollywood blockbusters but done in a very cheap fashion.

Khilji wasn't barbaric. In fact, he was the most suave n sophisticated ruler. There was no such thing as India during that time. The so called freedom from invaders is a big hoax. Wars were fought merely on the basis of territory.<br><br>Britishers abolished Sati n gave us education.<br><br>Look where v r inspite of the so called freedom. The lower caste fellas r totally neglected, the minorities r lynched in broad daylight, female infanticide n female foeticide is rampant. Look at the matrimonial columns. Sick people in India still wants fair colored brides. Adivasis r robbed of their homes.<br><br>Hate ethnocentric behavior n films.\nThe most detrimental effects of ethnocentrism resulting into genocide, apartheid, slavery, and many violent conflicts. Historical examples of these negative effects of ethnocentrism are The Holocaust, the Crusades, the Trail of Tears, and the internment of Japanese Americans.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[31,44]}]
