[{"title":"Very intriguing, but it missed a couple of things.","rating":7,"date":"11 March 2018","review":"I think this movie was extremely interesting and I also found myself being very invested in the characters' developments. I was really rooting for the prisoners and wanted to kick those guards' butts.<br><br>The thing that sort of annoyed me though, was that we never got to see how prisoner 8612 and 819 responded when they got released. I actually really wanted to know what their reaction was after they went outside and realised everything was an experiment (since they both started to doubt their sanity) and that they were free. I think it would have been very interesting to see that.","user":"Imme-van-Gorp","rank":[43,45]},{"title":"Chillingly bad science","rating":7,"date":"29 May 2016","review":"This film is a dramatization of a real psychological experiment that took place at the Stanford University in 1971. The motivation was to study the dynamics of individuals who were arbitrarily placed into roles as prisoners and guards at a simulated prison. Since none of the study participants were actual criminals or correction officers, the idea was to glean insight into the psychology of the power imbalance that arises from the situation, as opposed to the people involved.<br><br>Things famously degraded quickly and the experiment was terminated after only six days. Multiple guards displayed sadistic traits and performed acts of psychological and even (to a smaller degree) physical torture, all overseen, permitted, and arguably encouraged by \"superintendent\" Philip Zimbardo, the study's creator.<br><br>The conditions the participants were exposed to were reprehensible, but even worse is that ultimately this was simply bad science, making the whole endeavor a cruel waste of time. The experiment lacked much of the basic rigor required, as highlighted in the film by a verbatim repetition of an actual conversation Mr. Zimbardo had with a colleague who questioned some of the basic scientific methodologies being utilized in the study.<br><br>Zimbardo himself committed what I would consider borderline criminal acts such as initially denying \"prisoner\" participants the option to leave when requested (to instill in them the belief that their situation was, in fact, real), which came frighteningly close to converting the \"study\" into a criminal act of kidnapping in my opinion.<br><br>Zimbardo explains this as him getting \"to close\" to the experiment, but personally I'm not particularly sympathetic to that argument. When you watch the actual clips from the study and read the notes, I'm more inclined to think that Mr. Zambardo himself had a sadistic streak that he failed to control for a time. Honestly, I think the man should have faced criminal charges for his role in this fiasco.<br><br>In the end, some good did come out of this experiment in that it created a push for establishing standards and controls for psychological experiments in the future.<br><br>Despite knowing the actual outcome, I still felt anxious about the fates of the young men involved, a testament to the power of the acting and directing here. To me, this movie is a chilling and visceral reminder of how easy it is to create conditions that foster cruelty and dehumanization. A rewarding, if somewhat depressing, film to watch.","user":"ivko","rank":[53,62]},{"title":"Don't go in for a casual watch","rating":7,"date":"17 September 2016","review":"This was horrifying. Definitely not for everyone. Most horrifying thing is that this really happened. I don't even know where to start.<br><br>The movie is well made and told. It's really claustrophobic and it will get under your skin. How horrible humans can be. There's no violence here, but the verbal abuse and the way people are treated and at the same time being watched by people who could have stopped it, is what makes this story the more haunting.<br><br>The actors do a good job here. Those guards, man. This movie is gonna make you hate them and feel very sorry for the prisoners. It's all acting, but you really get a grudge against those guards. So, the movie did a good job on that. It gets you invested, but it at the end leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Nothing feel good about it. One thing it lacks is a main character. The first half is centered on Ezra Miller, but he disappears halfway through. I think it lost something when he was gone.<br><br>It's a though one to watch and I don't think I need to watch it again. No, once was good enough. Maybe it can do good and remind you of the cruelty of us humans, and help stop these things from happening. But, it's not an experience for everyone like I said and the cruelty is almost overboard at times and a little over the top. I think it was trying to chock people too much.<br><br>Horrifying, but well made and acted. It dwells too long on some of the most cruel moments and it's gonna make it hard to watch. So, don't go in for a casual watch. You gotta be prepared to watch it","user":"paulijcalderon","rank":[33,42]}]
