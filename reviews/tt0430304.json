[{"title":"Surprisingly funny","rating":7,"date":"5 August 2006","review":"First off, I definitely don't think this movie deserves to have such a low rating. Mind you, I thought this movie was going to reek to high heaven when I saw the trailers. My expectations were extremely, extremely low. I enjoyed the other films the Wayans Bros. did. There is no doubt that they are all talented comics. I just feel that they're a little overrated. Sometimes people seem to talk about the Wayans Bros. like they're the new Zucker brothers. I don't think they will EVER reach those heights in comedy. One of the things I feared about \"Little Man\" was most of the humor was going to consist of bathroom gags. The movie has its small share of bathroom humor, but never overdoes it. After seeing the previews for movies like \"The Pacifier,\" I was afraid there was going to be some joke involving diaper-changing. Stuff like that was funny back when \"Three Men and a Baby\" came out, but now it just makes me want to roll my eyes and cringe. \"Little Man\" didn't have one of those stupid gags, and that was a breath of fresh air for me. I found myself laughing through about 70% of the film, and the cast does a fine job. The only weak link was Tracy Morgan, who was funny on SNL, but the character he plays in this movie is just plain obnoxious. The gorgeous Brittany Daniel, who was also in \"White Chicks,\" provides some great eye candy. And the monotone-speaking comedian Fred Stoller provides some really funny, scene-stealing moments. Even Chazz Palminteri gets into the act, playing a gangster (I know, not exactly a stretch for him, but he adds some class to the film). Keep on the lookout for Rob Schneider, who has an amusing cameo. And last but not least, John Witherspoon never fails to please. Marlon Wayans's rubberfaced comedy style gets a little annoying at times, but I can't deny that the mere image of him as a midget is pretty damn hilarious. My advice is ignore the low rating and tons of bad reviews and give the film a chance. As I said before, I thought this was just going to be another brainless comedy","user":"guyfromjerzee","rank":[31,42]},{"title":"Hello","rating":9,"date":"3 August 2006","review":"The Wayans Brothers once again deliver a laugh out loud comedy. It was a little stupid, (sad to say because I LOVE the Wayans Bros) but it was still funny. Shawn Wayans stars as a husband who wants to start a family. When he hears that his wife is not ready to have a child, Derry (Shawn) gets disappointed. Meanwhile, a baby sized criminal and his partner in crime steal an expenzive diamond, and end up hiding it in Derryl's wife's purse. To retrive his diamon, Calvin (Marlon) disguises himself as a baby and gets delivered at Derryl's doorstep. This seems to be the PERFECT situation for a wanna be father, isn't it? WRONG I LOVED this movie! Kind of dumb, but, hey, who cares?","user":"bubblegumbomb","rank":[27,37]},{"title":"From the Hollywood cookie cutter...","rating":1,"date":"12 July 2006","review":"Comes this heartwarming tale of hope. Hope that you'll never have to endure anything this awful again. *cough* Razzie award *cough*<br><br>I disliked this movie because it was unfunny, predictable and inane. While watching I felt like I was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained. When I requested my money back at the end of the movie I was informed that because I watched the whole thing 'I wasn't entitled to reimbursement'. I was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten refunds already though.<br><br>The movie summary is pretty basic. The midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to elude police. Underneath this clever outline however, lies a repertoire of original, fresh and hilarious skits. Or not.<br><br>Ask yourself the following: Do you like to see people getting hit by pans? Do you like fart jokes? Do you like to see midgets posing as babies threatened with a thermometer in the anus? Do you like tired racial jokes? Do you think babies say 'goo goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? Do you drool?<br><br>If you answered 'yes' to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you. Although it has been billed in some places as 'The Worst Movie of the Decade', there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse...somewhere. I can't say for sure. I gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn't be taken seriously. <br><br>This lowbrow comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. Save your money for something funny.<br><br>Respect","user":"chattykathy8282","rank":[205,334]}]
