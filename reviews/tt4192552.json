[{"title":"Not Impressed","rating":2,"date":"4 September 2019","review":"Why or how anyone would want to sit through this movie and give it anything above a 2/10...I really couldn't tell you but I can guess that maybe they're \"getting something out of it\".\nA terrible attempt at rewriting Shakespeare's Macbeth is not only a bad idea, it also leads to a long boring result that's as interesting and terrifying as watching pain dry. Don't waste your time, I wasted mine for you.","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"8 September 2019","review":"It was horrible, slow and a very low budget type of a movie, actors with no talent whatsoever. Plot? What plot, felt like there were some random scenes only. Sharknado compared with this one was a masterpiece.","user":"windsorenquirer","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Other reviews are right!","rating":1,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"The other reviews hit the nail on the head. This move is intolerable. I can't believe something this bad could ever be made and taken serious. After 5 min I was wondering why I waited so long to turn it off.","user":"zlubbz","rank":[0,0]}]
