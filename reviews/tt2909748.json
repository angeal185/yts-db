[{"title":"A very enjoyable film, the photography and score were amazing","rating":9,"date":"21 September 2014","review":"I give it a 9 as it deserves a great rating. Nothing really deserves a 10. The cast were well chosen for their rolls so were all convincing, there was no musha begorra accents so the whole thing came across very real. If you are looking for drama on the big screen then this is a movie not to miss. The story has a number of twists in it but its still easy to follow. Watch out for the Directors, I don't think (hope) this will be their last feature film. I believe its won best film at two Film Festivals and had an second screening in Galway as the first one sold out. After seeing it on Thursday I can see why. This is not Spiderman but special effects are not needed when you have good solid actors such as Tara on the screen. A good story well told doesn't need special effects. Well done to all concerned.","user":"m_imdb-112-372934","rank":[13,25]},{"title":"Nice Try","rating":5,"date":"9 November 2015","review":"There's nothing that I can point to as being at fault, but think it would've made a better TV adaptation than a full length feature. The setting and period were convincing, and one did get a sense of menace from the situation. The acting was fine. All in all though it just didn't really engage and take off. I never really reached the point of caring very much about the three central characters, and I can't say the acting was totally to blame. I feel the script could've been better, a lot more could've been made of the situation, it didn't lack drama, but didn't really live up to the possibilities, and seemed obvious at times. Its not a bad film, but not a great one either, hence the score.","user":"chris-brown77","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"i gave a generous 1 one star ...becaus you can't give 0 stars","rating":1,"date":"8 November 2015","review":"with the budget they captured the irish landscape and the time beautifully in this film. recalling the hardships of well to do protestant sisters suffering in ireland in their huge mansion, shows the struggle the poor girls endured. also highlighting the famous friendliness of the black and tans in ireland.
