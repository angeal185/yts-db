[{"title":"This time Waldemar Daninsky battles bandits , witches and the snowman in exotic scenarios","rating":6,"date":"21 January 2011","review":"Creepy meeting between the infamous Wolfman and abominable snowman from remote Tibet .Again the renowned Waldemar stricken by two demon cannibalistic nymphets that turn into Werewolf at the full moon. Atypical Daninsky film where he returns as El Hombre Lobo for the umpteenth time and once again battles enemies . Waldemar, the notorious adventurer , joins an expedition led by Lacombe (Gil Vidal) or Larry Talbot (homage to Lon Chaney Jr) accompanied by his daughter Sylvia (Grace Mills who starred ¨Exorcismo¨ as a Linda Blair-alike) , all of them to find the mythic Yeti in the Himalayas. They arrive Katmandu and after the bunch goes to Karakorum . While Waldemar along with a scout (Victor Israel) hiking the mountains, he goes into a cave where is captured by two wicked sorceresses guarding a Buddhist sculpture and becomes their sex-slave . They transform him into a werewolf setting him loose to roam the mountain where Waldemar continues a murderous rampage every time the moon is full . Later on , Waldemar meet a Buddist monk who lives in a monastery full of luminous candles , he helps him against his illness. While the expedition is captured by a sadistic bandit named Temuljin . The prisoners are given to Mongol chief named Sherkan-Kan (Luis Induni , a baddie similarly characterized to Fumanchu) , whose palace lives the perverse Wandesa (Silvia Solar). Meanwhile , Daninsky falls in love with Sylvia and she tries to cure his Lycanthropy with love and a flower (such as the first classic version ¨the Wolfman¨ by Stuart Walker with Henry Hull).<br><br>Acceptable Werewolf movie with the unforgettable Waldemar Daninsky-Jacinto Molina ,under pseudonym Paul Naschy . Continental Europe's biggest horror star again with his classic character and frightening to viewer . Jacinto Molina Aka Paul Naschy ,who recently passed away, was actor, screenwriter and director of various films about the personage based on fictitious character, the Polish count Waldemar Daninsky. The first film about Waldemar was ¨The mark of the Wolfman (1967)¨ by Enrique Eguiluz , after that , went on the successful ¨Night of Walpurgis¨ by Leon Klimovsky , ¨Fury of the Wolfman¨ , ¨Doctor Jekill and the Wolfman¨ ,¨The return of the Walpurgis¨, ¨Howl of the devil¨, ¨The beast and the magic sword(1982)¨ that was filmed in Japan and finally ¨Licantropo(1998).After ¨The craving¨ it was such a box office disaster that Jacinto was bankrupt . He was forced to turn to Japan for making artist documentaries, as he filmed ¨ Madrid Royal Palace and Museum of Prado¨ and he gets financing from Japanese producers for ¨The human beasts¨, the first co-production Spanish-Japan and followed ¨The beast and the magic sword¨ that was lavishly produced for the Paul Naschy standards.<br><br>¨The curse of the beast¨ or ¨ the werewolf and the Yeti¨ is a B series entertainment with abundant sensationalistic scenes , comic-book style and a Naif-gaudy realization . This exciting terror movie contains adventures, action , some nudism and lots of blood and gore . The movie has a bit of ridiculous gore with loads of blood similar to tomato and is occasionally an engaging horror movie full of zooms, witchery , beheading , impaling and several other things . This time Paul Nashy/Jacinto Molina exhibits little breast but he was a weightlifting champion . Here Waldemar takes on vampires and Mongols in some unforgettable fighting scenes with bounds and leaps . The picture is plenty of sadism taken from Sax Rohmer stories and Robert E.Howard's Barbarian rampages . Pretty slow going, but hang in there for the Werewolf versus witches , vampires and Mongols. In the film appears a secondary cast who starred innumerable films of Spaghetti and horror genres during the 60s and 70 as Victor Israel , Silvia Solar and Luis Induni . Good and loud cinematography by Pladevall with chillon , yellow colors in Maria Bava or Hammer style and is accompanied by a correct remastering . Colorful and exotic outdoors filmed in Valle Aran , Aragoneses Pyrinees and Bañolas. The motion picture is professionally directed by M. Iglesias Bonn , a lousy director but here he makes an acceptable film . The flick will appeal to Paul Naschy fans and terror genre enthusiast. Rating : 6, passable and amusing","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Schlocky Spanish werewolf yarn","rating":6,"date":"13 September 2012","review":"In this Spanish horror movie a group of scientists travel to Tibet to try and track down the Yeti. While there one of their team is infected with lycanthropy and periodically turns into a werewolf.<br><br>This is my first exposure to the Spanish horror icon Paul Naschy, who stars in the lead role here. Seemingly Naschy made many similar films in a long career. On this basis, his back catalogue could do with further investigation. Despite being a low budget affair, The Werewolf and the Yeti throws a lot of ideas at us and certainly tries to entertain. Aside from the two title monsters there are a pair of cannibal vampire cave-girls, a wicked sorceress and a gang of violent bandits. Sadly, while the werewolf has a prominent part to play in proceedings as he goes round killing bad guys, the Yeti only appears at the beginning and the end. The snowy locations and sets are very nice too and add to the overall atmosphere.<br><br>This film's main claim to fame has to be its inclusion on the Video Nasty list. It was even one of the titles that remained on the DPP's hit-list right until the very end and so has an added notoriety. However, it really is quite difficult to work out why this should be, as despite some gory moments this is hardly a shocking film. The skinning sequence is probably the most obviously infamous but it's not particularly graphic. Rather than being nasty, this is more of a silly and schlocky film. It should interest werewolf film fanatics and should also offer something to those who enjoy the racier Euro variants on the Hammer horrors.","user":"Red-Barracuda","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Love this film","rating":9,"date":"3 September 2006","review":"Werewolf vs. Yeti, cannibal vampire women. Maybe something got lost in the translation, but I really saw no sign of a plot. BUT I loved watching this movie! I would have given it a 10, but this movie has just turned me on what looks like thousands of other Spanish horror movies. I'm sure this CAN'T be the best! My quest begins now!!! There's something about the tone of this wacky 70s horror flick that is just missing from today's movies. I bet they had a hell of a lot of fun filming this movie. Today's movies take themselves so SERIOUS. I suppose if you've got millions of dollars riding on film, that demands seriousness. But I miss the days when making and watching movies was fun. Some may consider this a bad movie but there is no denying the fun.","user":"dgordon-12","rank":[14,23]}]
