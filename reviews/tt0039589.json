[{"title":"Lured (1947) ***","rating":7,"date":"15 March 2005","review":"An interesting curio for Lucille Ball fans as well as those who enjoy old horror and mystery films. This one is worth seeing for its cast alone, featuring (in addition to Ms. Ball): Boris Karloff, Sir Cecric Hardwicke, Alan Napier, George Zucco and George Sanders! This solid mystery/thriller stars Lucille Ball in a dramatic part before she became Lucy Ricardo. She plays a feisty American gal in England who is hired by Scotland Yard to go undercover to trap a serial killer who claimed one of her friends. Boris Karloff's role is a small one but it's absolutely wonderful, and it's an essential watch for the actors' legion of fans. George Zucco is a cop who keeps an eye out for Ball to make sure she doesn't get into too much trouble. *** out of ****","user":"JoeKarlosi","rank":[39,43]},{"title":"All For Love","rating":8,"date":"1 July 2006","review":"This excellent noir film was somewhat copied forty years later as \"Sea of Love,\" with several changes bringing it up-to-date. One surprise in store for viewers is the comic talents of George Zucco, obviously kept hidden throughout most of his brilliant acting career. He is an excellent comedic sparring partner for Lucille Ball. They work well as a team, providing laughs that are sorely needed in an otherwise serious murder mystery thriller. Boris Karloff adds to the fun as well, giving a monster performance as an insane dress designer--can you believe? The stellar lineup also includes the likes of George Sanders, Charles Coburn, Cedric Hardwicke, and Alan Mowbray. The cast alone is worth the price of admission.<br><br>Directed with savvy by Douglas Sirk, the film has a script put together by a hodgepodge of writers. Still, the dialog is filled with witty and intelligent lines. The mystery will keep the viewer guessing until the serial killer is revealed. There are red herrings along the way to lead the best sleuth astray. Even when the movie seems to be ending with the mystery solved, it becomes the wrong solution to the case under investigation. The film proceeds to fool the viewer a second time before the ultimate meanie is apprehended. There are thrills aplenty throughout this delicious cinematic whodunit.<br><br>The story involves a serial killer running amok in London who kills beautiful young women lured by newspaper ads. The madman fancies himself a poet copying his style from the dark poetry of Charles Baudelaire, who once wrote about a tempting woman being more beautiful in death. One such poem is sent to Scotland Yard before each murder. Inspector Harley Temple (Coburn) is determined to catch the psycho any way possible, even using a young woman, Sandra Carpenter (Ball), as a decoy to lure the monster out into the open. Sandra is chosen when she inquires about her good friend's disappearance. Coincidentally, her friend's moniker is Lucy. In the process of finding the perpetrator of the crimes, Sandra makes several interesting encounters, eventually meeting a stranger named Robert Fleming (Sanders) with whom she falls in love. Their favorite song becomes \"All For Love,\" which serves as a clue in the mystery.","user":"krorie","rank":[51,58]},{"title":"An EXCELLENT film!","rating":9,"date":"16 November 2001","review":"For those of you who only know Ms. Ball as the \"dizzy redhead\" in the 50's sitcoms, you're in for a TREAT!<br><br>Before making the above, she was in many films -- Marx Brothers, The \"Annabel\" series, and this great film.<br><br>Backed by a solid cast (Zucco, Sanders, Karloff, Napier, Coburn), she acts as the \"bait\" to lure a London killer out of hiding.<br><br>Even tho (at least to ME) it was obvious who the killer is, it is fascinating watching her in a non-comedy role!  And, she certainly was lovely!<br><br>If you get a chance to see this, DO SO!  You won't be disappointed!  It's a shame that she didn't make more films in this genre.","user":"normv","rank":[44,50]}]
