[{"title":"I didn't think anyone could write a decent comedy these days , I WAS WRONG","rating":8,"date":"3 August 2011","review":"For the first time in nearly 3 years i can finally say something that's modern and in this century has made me laugh i cant get over how amazingly blunt the jokes are in the show , and that's what i think the writers went for in this film BLUNTNESS , every joke in the film hits you like a ton of bricks there isn't one scene that didn't have me in fits of laughter it was just fantastic. Jason Bateman again showing the world he can act and telling his critics to go swivel on his middle finger by how great he was in horrible bosses.<br><br>I personally rated every single actor in this film as Grade A , the acting was just superb! If you want a good laugh and a good night out go and see horrible bosses , best 8 pounds 50 I've ever spent! Oh on a side note , something totally off topic! As the film ended in the cinema i got up and went down the stairs leading out of the cinema , i looked back for my mate who was taking his time , and everyone was still sat down watching the blooper reel , when it ended everyone saw me alone at the bottom of the stairs noticed my T-SHIRT and i quote my T-SHIRT SAYS! FAT PEOPLE ARE HARD TO KIDNAP.<br><br>Entire cinema laughed! :) Great day Great Film , Great Audience.","user":"richenstony","rank":[106,152]},{"title":"Stop the Presses! A Funny Comedy for Adults","rating":8,"date":"21 December 2011","review":"Those who think Hollywood is no longer capable of creating a funny comedy for adults need not worry, as \"Horrible Bosses\" is proof that that increasingly rare phenomenon can still happen.<br><br>\"Horrible Bosses\" is one of those comedies like the classic \"Ruthless People,\" in which an outrageous and dark premise works because of good writing and an ensemble that knows exactly how to handle the material for maximum comedic value. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day play the requisite straight man, alpha male and dumbass, respectively, that male buddy comedies need, while Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell (sadly underused) play the titular bosses. All of them have a field day with their roles, and Aniston especially stands out because of the film's decision to cast her against type as a slutty, foul-mouthed sex kitten; you can almost hear Aniston sighing with relief as she gets to play something other than the cute-as-a-button girl next door.<br><br>As with most comedies, whether or not you think \"Horrible Bosses\" is funny will probably depend simply on whether or not you think the actors are funny. Charlie Day, for example, will likely drive some people crazy -- I thought he was hilarious.<br><br>Grade: A","user":"evanston_dad","rank":[63,96]},{"title":"A good one time watch","rating":7,"date":"11 November 2015","review":"Kudos to the \"killer cast\"- Aniston and Spacey sizzle as crude bosses. The cast is quite good, Kevin Spacey shines in the role of one the bosses and as does Jennifer Aniston. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell also worth a mention are the most funniest of them all. The lead- trio share a nice chemistry and even if unoriginal they fill in the shoes just fine. Colin Farell of course, devilish indeed! ðŸ˜ˆ HB is still funny though, and with a neat running time it's a story you can get invested in without having to pay too much attention. Many of the jokes are funny and a scene involving an assassin who turns out not to be an assassin is very funny. Though it should be funnier than it is ðŸ˜‚","user":"asb_deutsch","rank":[7,8]}]
