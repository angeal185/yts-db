[{"title":"Why not?","rating":7,"date":"17 September 2018","review":"Yeah sure, there were things I disliked and casting that I couldn't quite digest (Byakuya and Renji look like home made cosplay, I won't go there), but It was fun watching this movie. I have mixed feelings, but the \"good old Bleach feeling\" is there. It's certainly better than most, if not all, anime/manga live action adaptation, it's not quite on Rurouni Kenshin live action level, but I like it. I also think, when doing live action, that they have to respect certain absolute things in manga/anime storyline, but also change a few things, and that's exactly what this live action adaptation of Bleach did. I also hope there will be sequel since the whole saving Rukia and soul society arc is the best arc in Bleach.","user":"Valhala90","rank":[84,93]},{"title":"It's decent","rating":8,"date":"17 September 2018","review":"We all know feature films of animes are trash. Dragon Balls, Full Metal Alchemist, Attack on Titan etc. But this one is decent. I think Japanes just starting to find that grey area between movie and anime. /Blade of Immortal, this one/ I would give this movie about 7 stars, but I gave 8 because, I know there are people who would just give a star only for sake of being picky.","user":"chintok91","rank":[57,64]},{"title":"A must see.","rating":9,"date":"20 July 2018","review":"A very good adaptation of the first arc of Bleach(well half of it anyway). Just go see this movie when you can.","user":"claudiu111","rank":[116,142]}]
