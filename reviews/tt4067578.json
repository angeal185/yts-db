[{"title":"perfect movie","rating":10,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"I have been recommending this marvelous movie to anyone who was within ear shot since I watched it the first time a few yeas ago. The writing and acting repay the investment of your time ten fold. There are no car chase , bombs exploding or CGI, but but within minutes you you will start falling in love with this couple..","user":"dlpc-99360","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Top notch webseries!","rating":10,"date":"28 February 2019","review":"I watched this on Netflix after I saw this production company's first film Jimami Tofu. This was apparently the web series they made before they made their debut feature.<br><br>This series was made with US$800 and 4 people. It is really an amazing web series. I love the simplicity of it and yet its humour, subtlety and relatability. It's everything we all have experienced at one time or other especially those who grew up in the 80s or 90s.<br><br>Acting is great. Music is great. Can't believe they made this on a tiny budget. Apparently it won 7 awards internationally before it was picked up by Netflix.<br><br>These creators are people to watch. Also loved their debut feature!","user":"coldmanna","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Poetry in motion","rating":10,"date":"15 October 2019","review":"Seriously never gave web series a chance till I was told about this one. Saw that it had won a bunch of awards and low and behold got picked up by Netflix! Anyway, it was really entertaining. At times touching. The dialogue was witty, the acting was solid. Found myself laughing and remembering good times with friends from college. A winner - worth watching for sure! Music btw was reminiscent of James Horner!","user":"seetolam","rank":[1,1]}]
