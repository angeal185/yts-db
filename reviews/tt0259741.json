[{"title":"Romance on Paradise Island","rating":7,"date":"7 February 2001","review":"Summer Holiday is about a Hong Kong (Sammi Cheng) girl who loses her office job and finds that her boyfriend has been cheating on her, and travels to an island in Malaysia to sell her half of a beach that her cousin gave her. Only then does she know that her cousin sold the other half to his best friend (Richie Ren) to pay off debts. In her quest to convince him to sell, they begin to fall in love on a summer holiday in paradise.<br><br>Summer Holiday is a story of falling in and falling out of love. The scenery is so beautiful, it even made me want to go back to Malaysia once more! A romantic comedy, there are plenty of laughs throughout the film, and interspersed with some really touching moments. The film, however, is very much a fairy tale, though the characters do seem very real. Cheng does do a lot for her character although Ren, being a non-Cantonese speaker does stumble occasionally in the dialogue. But the film is well-directed and it a perfect watch for couples!","user":"leekandham","rank":[3,4]}]
