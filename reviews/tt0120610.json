[{"title":"Patrick Swayze's third personal favorite underrated best action film he ever did!","rating":10,"date":"10 October 2016","review":"Black Dog (1998) is Patrick Swayze's underrated unappreciated explosive, nonstop high-speed adrenaline-pumping highway road war action film! This is my third favorite personal favorite Patrick Swayze's film! The first two are Road House and Steel Dawn, but Black Dog is my third favorite film and I love this film to death! Just recently finished watching this and I love it so damn much. I love Patrick Swayze's characters Nomad, Dalton and Jack Crews those are all my favorite characters! Directed by Kevin Hooks the director who directed awful Die Hard copycat film Passenger 57 and Fled, this film is very decent and a damn solid good action film of the 90's and finally Kevin Hooks made a movie that I love. <br><br>\"The only way to stay alive is to keep moving.\" <br><br>Plot: An ex-con takes a job driving a truck cross country. What he doesn't know is that the truck is filled with illegal weapons and now he must fight to survive and save his family. <br><br>Patrick Swayze is back and he teams up with Randy Travis and Meat Loaf to deliver explosive, nonstop high-speed action in this adrenaline-pumping highway road war. A 40-ton truck is a lethal weapon and veteran driver Jack Crews (Swayze) knows how to use it. Desperate for cash, he's got one last delivery to make. The trip's barely begun when he and partner Earl (Travis) discover they've been set up and are being chased by Red (Meat Loaf), a relentless fanatic who's as deadly as he is greedy. Now, with his family, his life and his freedom on the line, Jack's going to buckle up, put the pedal down and show Red and the Feds a thing or two about road rage. After being double-crossed and rudely underestimated, Jack and Earl shift gears, becoming a two-man wrecking crew, trucking down the highway blazing a trail of diesel-powered destruction.<br><br>This film is for all of truck drivers out there, this movie is great not to many movies like this. Trucker that does not know of this movie, it is not a trucker. This movie it should be in every driving school, great movie. The acting in this movie is very decent and solid, Patrick Swayze is always awesome and fantastic! Randy Travis as Patrick's partner was excellent! Meat Loaf as the villain in this movie was fantastic! <br><br>Jack Crews (Patrick Swayze) is an ex con and a truck driver who desperately needs the money to support his family and pay off his deb for the house. He accepts the offer from his manager to make a delivery from Atlanta to New Jersey a lot's of toilets' for $10,000 , so he thinks, this is cool easy money so he does what he is told too, on he's trip he find's out that he was set up and he is transporting illegal guns and now he has to fight for his life and for his family. <br><br>Black Dog is Patrick Swayze's best underrated highway speed action movie that was released before The Fast and the Furious come out, it is an action film of the late 90's that I will always cherish and love to death. This movie is very underrated solid action film. I love it to death. I have this movie on Blu-ray the same Patrick Swayze movie I have on Blu-ray are Steel Dawn, Road House and this film, they are all in my collection, but I don't have Uncommon Valor because that film was never released on Blu-ray, I am still waiting on the release. <br><br>Black Dog is a 1998 action film directed by Kevin Hooks and starring Patrick Swayze. The film tells the story of a trucker and ex-con who is manipulated into transporting illegal arms. The film co-stars musicians Randy Travis and Meat Loaf.<br><br>R.I.P. - Patrick Swayze (1952 - 2009) I really miss you so much and I wish you could do more bad ass action movies, I am your biggest fan and so was my mom we all miss you and we all love you, I love you to death! Black Dog (why doesn't THAT film get the cult/appreciation/notice of this POS), Steel Dawn (underrated) and Road House are my top 3 personal favorite Patrick Swayze movies he ever did! <br><br>This movie get's 10 out 10 for Patrick Swayze's best underrated action movie he ever did, alongside with Road House! But Road House for me will be his best action classic martial arts film a film of my childhood that I will always cherish it.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[39,40]},{"title":"surprisingly entertaining dumb action","rating":8,"date":"16 March 2004","review":"I am no fan of the stars of this movie or a truckdriving buff or interested in country music (not that that's overly relevant.)  I borrowed this tape with low expectations but was happily surprised by how entertaining it was. What has happened to Patrick Swayze?  I thought he did a good job acting in both Donnie Darko and now this.  THIS film is what goofy, illogical action flicks are supposed to be.  This isn't simply a music video stretched out to an hour-and-a-half.  This director actually knows how to make a movie.  The plot ain't deep but there IS a plot, which is important.  The ideas are dopey but the actors aren't simply laughing their way through but rather they treated this like a serious work.  The actress who plays Swayze's wife has a style which usually annoys me but she, too, was ok in this thing. Even the little bits of country music didn't bother me.  A stupid finale? Sure, but even that was fun.  Wow.","user":"zimbo_the_donkey_boy","rank":[29,33]},{"title":"Road rage with Patrick Swayze and Meat Loaf.","rating":6,"date":"19 June 2008","review":"For the genre movie that this is, it's a pretty enjoyable movie to watch. It's definitely no worse or better than any other similar simple straight-forward action flick from the '90's.<br><br>Of course the movie is suffering from more than 1 problem though. One obviously is its story. It's simple and actually doesn't make a lot of sense and is a real unlikely one. I mean, why did Red ever let the truck drive off from his place, only to dangerously attempt to hijack it later, on the very same day. But oh well, without this story we wouldn't had all those exploding trucks and action scenes within this movie.<br><br>Well, it's not like the action is much spectacular though. Funny enough there are lots of exploding trucks and cars but they already seem to blow up when one of the passengers farts. Action-wise this movie just isn't good or spectacular enough to watch.<br><br>Another problem with the movie is that it has far too many villains in it. It's like the main characters against the rest of the world. The movie also doesn't seem to be able to make a choice who to make the main and most important villain of the movie, with as a result that all of the villainous characters aren't really anything memorable or evil enough, since the movie spends to much time on showing the many different villainous characters of the movie.<br><br>The movie is from the period when Patrick Swayze's career of course already was more or less on a death end. Nevertheless he's always good and serious with every role that he plays. He's also credible in this role, despite his already showing age. He was perhaps a tad bit too old at the time of this movie to play the main lead in an action movie. Meat Loaf mostly seemed to have had fun with playing his role, which shows on the screen. But like I said before, since he plays a villain, he didn't get the screen time he deserved. There are parts in the movie were he completely disappears, only to show up 20 minutes later again.<br><br>But despite this all, the movie is good and entertaining enough to watch. It's current rating on here would suggest that this is one of the worst action flicks of the '90's but it hardly is. It's also no better than some action flicks but also definitely no worse than some others.<br><br>6/10<br><br>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","user":"Boba_Fett1138","rank":[10,10]}]
