[{"title":"The hate has nothing to do with a lack of Myers, so stop saying it.","rating":2,"date":"23 October 2019","review":"All of the comments defending this movie seem to imply that those who dislike it only dislike it because Myers isn't in it. This is wildly untrue. I think most people can respect the 'anthology of Halloween' angle they went with it. The problem isn't with Myers, it's with literally everything else. The acting, the plot, the creative direction, the writing (story and characters), everything. I would even say that the jingle everyone praises is only well-regarded because it's the only 'not bad' part of the movie. It's London Bridges, people. It writes itself. Time to take off the nostalgia goggles on this one. I wouldn't recommend this movie to an enemy.","user":"c-dobbin","rank":[80,118]},{"title":"Underrated","rating":6,"date":"18 February 2020","review":"I used to be one of those Season of The Witch haters that felt it was a bad film, primarily because it doesn't feature the iconic Michael Myers. But as a standalone film it is entertaining and works.<br><br>Give it an honest chance, you might be pleasantly surprised!","user":"coconutkungfu-30704","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"If I could rate this flaming piece of garbage less than 1, I would.","rating":1,"date":"4 September 2019","review":"Reading the horrible reviews is more entertaining than watching this movie","user":"lebdingo","rank":[59,93]}]
