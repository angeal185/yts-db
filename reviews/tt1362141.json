He recommended it because it was totally different from a big studio movie (we both support indie film makers).\nI really enjoyed it! It's fast, funny and sexy, with a great look and some cracking tunes! Made me want to go to Spain! Although not with Janine!","user":"lcrowter-19484","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Another male bashing movie.","rating":1,"date":"16 July 2018","review":"After Revenge, another male bashing movie joins the list: \"The honey killer is a movie where the women just have sex with her dates and then proceeds to hurt them in whatever physical ways she deems physically possible.
