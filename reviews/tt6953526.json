The production values are all great, but what impressed me most is the message contained in the film. It's got all of the genre specifics right - basketball team going for a championship, needing to overcome obstacles, coach trying to keep the team together etc. But it's the incorporation of faith elements that, for me, help this film rise above other sports dramas. Do yourself a favour &amp; check it out!","user":"AKamp79","rank":[7,9]}]
