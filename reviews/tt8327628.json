[{"title":"Insult to Hackers everywhere","rating":1,"date":"26 March 2015","review":"They could have at least had actual hacker consulted while making this garbage. Or even a competent script kiddie.<br><br>This film is what happens when people decide to make a film about something they know nothing about, using negative stereotyping (hacker just HAS to be a virgin, because, you know, no way above average individuals can be socially and technologically apt at the same time. Nonsense!).<br><br>Writing is terrible, acting is atrocious, just ... none of these people can act. This is more like something you accidentally see on YouTube for free, and most likely do not actually waste your life watching it beyond scanning through.<br><br>And its not even one of those 'so bad, we can laugh' films either. Its more like ... watching a comedy about Holocaust. Thats how offensive this film should be to any legitimate hackers out there.<br><br>PASS.","user":"jackhuntermtl","rank":[21,27]},{"title":"Even hacker's fall in love","rating":8,"date":"29 March 2015","review":"I rather enjoyed this cat &amp; mouse story of deception and love.<br><br>It certainly isn't a big budget movie but Director/writer Cyril Morin did a fine job in creating a story of mystery, deception, fear, and love. The story unfolds in multiple layers just thin enough to keep the viewer thinking he can see whats coming next only to be tricked into discovering you're wrong.<br><br>Pom Klementieff (Loise) and Chris Schellenger (Soyan) are just exotic enough to keep your interest up in them and their relationship which gets a bit rocky. King Orba (Russel Belial) is just evil enough to make you want to know his next move.<br><br>Low budget - yes, but that issue doesn't harm this flick one bit. It is a very 21st Century story!","user":"cekadah","rank":[10,20]},{"title":"Not a tech/hacker movie","rating":3,"date":"25 March 2015","review":"\"Hacker's Game\" is a love story between two hackers, Soyan and Loise. Like many other hackers, Soyan works for a company he previously hacked. This \"online security\" firm runs covert activities for high-profile clients around the world.<br><br>Loise is a cyber-detective who investigates war crimes for a human rights organization. Obsessed with the truth, she also has spent years searching for an unknown person. The two hackers meet on a rooftop and bond together through a virtual chess game. But Soyan's employer, Russell Belial, has asked him to protect the same arms- dealer that Loise is determined to help to capture.<br><br>Who will call the game now? What is Soyan's real goal? The pair embarks upon an intense but dangerous romance, playing an elaborate game of deception. After being in a virtual world, will Soyan and Loise risk everything for true love?<br><br>Its funny because both the Title and Cover make it look and sound like a Tech/Hacker movie, but clearly its not. Its more about love and romance.Even if you do manage to make sense of the plot, it still doesn't make the film any more watchable. Worse, the performances are uniformly insipid.","user":"RajaKrishna","rank":[6,11]}]
