[{"title":"Quirky, Well-Acted, Sweet Movie","rating":9,"date":"15 November 2019","review":"For someone who's been watching a lot of Hallmark movies this was a breath of fresh air. The characters are interesting and funny. Not sure if the script is tolerable or if the actors are just good enough to cover it. It's well-edited so that the story is cohesive. The puppet elements make it quirky and playful.\nNow it's not perfect and there are some overly cheesy moments. But, the characters felt so real and like someone your could know.","user":"courtneyfosterwilson","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"A different Holiday movie.","rating":8,"date":"29 November 2019","review":"Heads up ... this is not your typical Hallmark/Lifetime movie with near perfect main characters and a predictable plot! What it is ...is a really funny movie filled with quick witted dialog and a main character that can be quite the goofball at times. I laughed out loud throughout the whole movie. Great Maine scenery and a good supporting cast ðŸ‘Œ","user":"colorsourcexyz","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Great character acting here!","rating":9,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"As a fan of Holiday movies in general, both the good and the horribly horribly bad, this one was light and refreshing. I loved the artistic take of the puppet interludes but most of all Teya Patt was AMAZING!!!!! She was hilarious and the best part of this movie by far!","user":"babybunger","rank":[5,5]}]
