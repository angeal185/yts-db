[{"title":"Don't watch it without seeing the TV show first.","rating":6,"date":"27 April 2018","review":"I see all these negative reviews from people and then they end with \"I haven't seen the TV show though\". That made me want to write this review so I could maybe clear something up.<br><br>I, who was a huge fan of the TV show, can understand why this movie sucks if you don't know the characters. I think it's safe to say that this is nothing more than a reunion. It's something fans should watch if they want to see what has happened to all their favourite characters from the show.<br><br>I've also seen many reviews saying \"where was the humour?\" and that is something I can understand as well. Almost every joke in this movie, is a joke about something that has happened in the TV show.<br><br>I can't stress this enough: It's a great movie for fans of the TV show and it's better than most reunions, BUT it doesn't have a great story of it's own apart from the TV show, which makes it a slightly boring and confusing movie for people who don't already know the characters.","user":"Imme-van-Gorp","rank":[48,55]},{"title":"Feels like watching new episodes of the show!","rating":8,"date":"15 March 2014","review":"Very well done! This is the most unabashed Fan-Service film I've seen since Serenity...and I daresay, it caters to its fans even more than Serenity did. <br><br>In fact, my biggest complaint about this movie is that it might cater too much to fans, leaving newcomers in the dark. The movie re- introduces you to Veronica, but virtually everyone else gets no exposition and no character development (beyond what you'd see in a typical episode, that is). <br><br>For fans of the show, this movie is a gift. You basically get a new episode of the TV show here- a bottle episode that's roughly 100 minutes long.<br><br>There were a few differences- namely, I didn't remember the show being this funny. Veronica always had a good sense of humor, as did her dad, but in this movie there were a surprising amount of laughs. <br><br>Also, the mystery isn't as deep as the full season one and two story lines (obviously). What's worse, I don't think the resolution of the mystery has that same \"I should have seen it all along!\" genius that made seasons 1 and 2 so special. I'd say the plot is comparable to one of the mini-arcs from season 3. <br><br>Lastly, as good as this movie is, it still doesn't exceed (or even meet) what the show already did at the top of its game. The emotional highs and lows are the same old thing as before, and the plot isn't nearly as neatly connected. I'd say I rate the movie as slightly above season 3, but not as good as seasons 1 or 2. <br><br>But what the Hell, you get to see Veronica work again, and it's too much fun to pass up!<br><br>Fans must see this movie.","user":"DarthPaul85","rank":[98,133]},{"title":"It was worth the wait!","rating":10,"date":"13 March 2014","review":"This is one of the most satisfying movies I have ever seen! Then again, I am a bit biased since I helped back the movie on Kickstarter.<br><br>I was a huge fan of the show when it was on the air and was ecstatic to hear about the movie. It's been almost a year and we finally have it! It was well worth the wait and the contribution to the Kickstarter campaign.<br><br>For the first few minutes of the movie, there is a slight recap of the TV show featuring clips with a voice over by Veronica Mars. This is used not only as an introductory piece for new watchers but also a walk down memory lane for the fans.<br><br>As expected, there were plenty of \"inside jokes\" that were casually thrown out in dialog. What was brilliant, though, was the fact that they weren't obvious. They blended with normal conversation and were just added bonuses for the fans and for new watchers it was just another example of how great the dialog was. You don't need any background information about the show to watch this, you won't be left in the dark with the inside jokes.<br><br>The movie is self-contained but leaves space for a sequel in one form or another. Characters grow and change during the movie, so it's not just a movie to have a movie.<br><br>Characters from the show are brought back but not in a pushy sort of way. It is a large cast but everyone has a proper place. You don't have anybody from the show return for a only second, everyone gets good face time without it being overwhelmed.<br><br>Overall, I highly recommend this move to anyone.","user":"jedispyder","rank":[157,237]}]
