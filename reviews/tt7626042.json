[{"title":"It's really funny! Worth your time.","rating":10,"date":"8 April 2020","review":"I love politicians like this! It demonstrates that I can relate to him, and he to me. Even if President Trump was a Dem, I would find this movie entertaining.<br><br>I despise the life-long career politicians like we see just taking up space, with *both* parties! This movie shows us the alternative to the trough.<br><br>Viewer numbers for the 2016 debates and primary (which this focuses on) indicates that no other prior political event came even close to these. Highly entertaining! A similar movie/documentary couldn't be made about any politician after President Lincoln.<br><br>I look forward to the sequel, after the 2020 election!","user":"rsvp321","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Liberal POC Point of View","rating":10,"date":"7 May 2019","review":"This documentary was hilarious . Even though I voted for Hillary and now regret it. President Trump has lowered Black Unemployment to its lowest recorded time. Keep Fighting for POC #45. MAGA I'm onboard.","user":"suspence8526","rank":[35,73]},{"title":"Showcase of Trump's Idiocy","rating":1,"date":"4 August 2018","review":"Does a good job of showing horrid he is at insults, and being a human being. It honestly is just a showcase of all the stupid things he said before and during the election. You can't watch this and gain any respect for the man.","user":"WristFlick","rank":[36,76]}]
