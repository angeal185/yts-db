[{"title":"Very nice movie! ðŸŽ¥","rating":10,"date":"18 March 2020","review":"It's good movie to watch! The problem with \"professional critics \" is they think that their job is to be overly pretentious. The more they insult movies and look at every single aspect only from their perspective, the smarter they think they are. And then, they bring out all the bad vision, a vision that is not reflected by 80% percent of the \"average unprofessional watchers\". I do not have a very vast reviewing experience, however I can tell when a movie is bad or not. And this movie is a good movie! Nicely filmed with good actors, super famous and top locations in London and Amsterdam. I would like to know if it will be a part 2?","user":"oanaa_claudia","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Good acting ,decent thriller","rating":8,"date":"11 February 2020","review":"Why the low reviews ðŸ¤”Very odd\nThis firm is actually a very good watch .Keeps you guessing right up until the end\nSome amount of rubbish out there with high reviews ,yet this film has great acting .Good story and some twists .\nIt's worth watching .You will not be disappointed you did .","user":"ewgers","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Stylish thriller with a fantastic cast","rating":10,"date":"26 March 2020","review":"A brilliant contemporary use of Hitchcockian themes with plenty of intrigue, fascinating character arcs, and shocking twists. Maryam Hassouni was mesmerising and you find yourself rooting for characters like Robert Atkinson even when they are caught up in more and more sinister situations. The use of Amsterdam as a character in itself was riveting and the cinematography is beautiful. A great piece of entertainment!","user":"abi-24996","rank":[3,3]}]
