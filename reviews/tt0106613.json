[{"title":"For Kids, What A Shocker!","rating":6,"date":"21 December 2007","review":"You people are crackpots, just insane with arrogance. This movie did what it intended. Golden's performance was incredible given his age. Not very funny, but witty and cute. Here's a clue people: Most 8 year olds over-act! And Burt--well, Burt is Burt, not even one dimensional...The only fault I can find is the Hollywood by the numbers script, which is plenty dreadful. That's what Hollywood does. You knew you were getting a kids movie, right? <br><br>When I saw this as a kid, I really liked it. So, for me, it did what it was supposed to--capture a child's imagination. Not an adults petulance.<br><br>Recommended for kids.","user":"jeffronthi","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"Love this movie!","rating":10,"date":"6 May 2018","review":"Watched it all the time as a kid. And just watched it again as an adult. Devon is an adorable kid.","user":"msnbynum","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Put yourself in the shoes of a child","rating":6,"date":"9 February 2008","review":"This is one of my childhood favorites! Yes, the plot is pathetic and unbelievable. Yes, the boy is no Dakota Fanning. But Cop and a Half is a very enjoyable movie for people between the ages of 4 and 10. I mean, this movie wasn't marketed towards art school graduate students. The situations are very light-hearted and the jokes corny enough for the young age demographic.<br><br>This is also a good movie if you enjoy making fun of B-movies (especially with your friends... and beer). There are numerous plot holes and the man-boy love undertones are hilariously disturbing.<br><br>Do not watch Cop and a Half if you are a cantankerous old geezer!","user":"ngox0077","rank":[8,12]}]
