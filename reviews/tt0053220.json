[{"title":"Deservedly a cult movie","rating":9,"date":"24 July 2002","review":"\"Ride Lonesome\" fully deserves its cult-movie status. Here the chemistry between the director Budd Boetticher and Randolph Scott attains its highest level. Of course, as for any other cult movie, it would be desirable to see \"Ride lonesome\" several times to fully appreciate it. The story is very simple, and somewhat reminiscent of others by the distinguished western-writer Burt Kennedy, but it is dense with distinct themes and psychological nuances. The dialogue is perfect: extremely dry, sharp and laconic, but endowed with a remarkable sense of humour. We feel that the guys on the screen are more for action than for chats.<br><br>\nBoetticher merges the audience in the open freeness of wild nature, according to his trade-mark style of turning the landscape into a further character of his films. The photography and the use of color are magnificent. The action scenes are terse, (enough) realistic and much accurate in the movements of the actors. Particularly brilliant are the nocturnal scenes: the shadows which hide the faces are opposed to the glitter of metal objects (cups, fire-arms) and to the lights spread by Karen Steele's blond hair and white shirt. And these nocturnal scenes create a remarkable erotic atmosphere, due to the breathtaking presence of Steele as Mrs. Lane. It has been said that in Boetticher's films the Woman is never a real character, but rather a dreamed object of desire. \"Ride Lonesome\" is perhaps the best evidence of this theory: Karen Steele is so incredibly gorgeous that the viewer is led to see her more as a Goddess than as a woman. And thus we easily accept the instinctive respect paid to her by the male characters. Also note this subtlety: the Apaches attack the whites just because their chief wants to get Mrs. Lane. The power of Woman rules.<br><br>Any character is designed with accurate psychology, with excellent work by the whole cast. Randolph Scott, Karen Steele, Pernell Roberts, James Best are all commendable. I especially liked a very young James Coburn in the role of the naive cow-boy, living on the risky border between good and evil. Lee Van Cleef has a short role as the main villain Frank, but leaves his mark: look at his sneer and his body language when Frank realizes that he's going to face a mortal clash.<br><br>A marginal note: the Italian title of the movie sounds like \"The tree of revenge\". I venture to say that this title is better than the original one.<br><br>I greatly like \"Ride Lonesome\". You can enjoy it at two levels: either breath in the open spaces and relish the adventure, or make a deeper study of Boetticher's admirable style and technique.","user":"pzanardo","rank":[51,55]},{"title":"Roberts and Scott perfectly matched","rating":9,"date":"23 June 2004","review":"For a 71-minute movie, Ride Lonesome is one of the most rivetingly memorable Westerns I've ever seen.  Fans of epics and lots of mindless action should stay away.  This is a thinking person's group character study of the five principals and the ubiquitous presence of Lee Van Cleef's \"Big Brother\" Frank despite a very economic amount of screen time. <br><br>True enough that in many ways, this plays a like a typical '50's \"classic-formula\"(including a misplaced-and-awkward Indian-Chief-wants-widow-for-squaw subplot) Western -- albeit exceedingly well-directed and well-acted. The dialog, richness of characterizations, and interplay among characters ultimately set this one apart.  These come across as indelibly drawn real people who happened to live in the 1870's West.  However, Boetticher fans need not threat that he has totally abandoned his contributions to Western Mythology.  The rather spartan genre-emblematic symbolism he does include resonates all the more as a result of this efficiency.<br><br>This is true despite the presence, nay -- especially due to the presence of Randolph Scott and his pitch-perfect interplay with charmingly roguish Boone, marvelously essayed by Pernell Roberts. Neither ever loses sight of who and what the other man is.  Both share a healthy amount of mutual respect mixed with healthy skepticism and awareness of an inevitable dark cloud shadowing their temporary alliance.  Roberts, in particular, evokes every bit of sardonic humor, masculine charm, and fidelity to his own peculiar code that the script allows him.  Scott, for his part, is far closer to the dark bitterness of Will Kane than he is when playing most of his heroic characters.<br><br>Both characters are more-than-ably joined in the ensemble by half-witted-but-loyal cowpoke Whit (James Coburn), homicidal man-boy Billy (James Best), and-abandoned-wife-and-later-widowed Karen Steele.  The female actor is quite appealing visually and as convincing as possible in her role given her contrived introduction into the plot.  Once we get past the Indian subplot, she comes into her own as she gradually learns who Scott's and Robert's characters truly are, and adjusts her emotions accordingly.<br><br>But, one facet of this film that has always stuck in my mind is the way Boetticher and Kennedy brilliantly collaborated to have Van Cleef essay Big Brother Frank, the movie's ultimate villain - especially considering the many High-Noon-ish parallels. He neither portrays a Big-Brother-Frank-Miller type of cocksure-but-defiantly-laconic swaggering gang leader or a typically unrepentant Lee Van Cleef villain.  Instead, we get a somewhat remorseful, increasingly bemused, but immutably duty-bound human being of real-flesh-and-blood feelings.  It is only after exhausting potential alternatives that he reluctantly comes to terms with the inevitability of his final conflict with Scott.  And, his reluctance to do Scott further harm seems genuine, only to be trumped by his commitment to free little brother Billy. <br><br>But, as good as the entire ensemble is, the film draws a good deal of its charm and heart from Pernell Robert's performance as Boone.  I note this as an aside, because Roberts went on to make only one more indelible feature film performance before getting overshadowed on Bonanza.  Even worse for his promising career, directors reportedly found him nearly impossible to work with and there was no love lost between him and his fellow cast members who felt he thought himself superior to all of them; intellectually speaking, he was probably right, but that bought him nothing in Hollywood. Eventually, he had a fairly long run starring in a highly rated series that for some reason, has had no shelf-life on reruns called Trapper John, M. D.  But, there, too, Hollywood scuttlebutt indicates that he made few friends.  After just re-watching his marvelous work in \"Ride Lonesome\", and recalling other performances, I found myself thinking that these off-the-set issues were truly unfortunate because Roberts truly exuded leading-man-caliber talent. Instead I can only urge other IMDB'ers not to miss this performance. <br><br>\nDespite the economic budget, the cinematic and sound-related choices are impeccably executed.  Contrasts are especially effective.  My rating for this near-perfect Western is 9/10.","user":"herbqedi","rank":[54,62]},{"title":"The best of the Scott/Boetticher films","rating":7,"date":"7 January 2002","review":"Ride Lonesome is that rare B-film, one that eclipses in a wink most of its bigger budgeted brethren. The return of scripter Burt Kennedy (who had not done the two previous Scott/Boetticher films) to the Ranown company (founded by Randolph Scott and producer Harry Joe Brown), the close group harmony, resulted in an obviously glorious reunion for all concerned.<br><br>\nShot entirely outdoors, like \"The Tall T,\" we have large open spaces, but a tightly confined group. This time the bounty isn't gold or money - it's outlaw Billy John (James Best). Former sheriff Ben Brigade has captured him, counting on Billy John's brother Frank (Lee Van Cleef) to come get him. Brigade has a score to settle, the murder of his wife, and he intends to settle it at a tree that holds relevance to both lawman and outlaw. Scott is joined by two minor lawbreakers, in whose hope of amnesty provided by the turning over of Billy John to authorities, provides the alliance of adversaries so common to the Boetticher films. Pernell Roberts, the more worldly and intelligent of the two, like Brigade, is looking for personal redemption, and the hope of his own ranch once he settles down. He acts a big brother to the less intelligent, and basically decent, James Coburn, in his filmic debut, is a long way from his more forceful character that would surface in later westerns of Sturges and Peckinpah. Karen Steele is on hand again (she was in \"Decision at Sundown\"), the group finds her alone in a way station, threatened by the Indians who killed her husband. She serves as conscience and libido stimulator, and her breathtaking appearance is highlighted in what is one of the film's most humorous moments (\"I said her eyes\").<br><br>So, avoiding the Indians on their trail, and the threat of Frank's gang, Brigade leads the group to the inevitable showdown at the hanging tree that will determine the fate of the group, and the individual futures of each.<br><br>\nRanown, Boetticher and Kennedy had one more film to go, the actor was slowing down - after years of averaging three per year, there were just two releases in both 1957 and 1958, Ride Lonesome was the only film for 1959, and 1960's Comanche Station would be the sole film for Scott until 1962's valedictory film known as Ride the High Country.","user":"clore-2","rank":[29,32]}]
