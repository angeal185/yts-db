[{"title":"One of the greatest 80s teen comedies ever made","rating":10,"date":"17 May 2003","review":"While John Hughes seems to have the monopoly on 80s teen comedies, anyone who loved Ferris Bueller etc... should check out this Carl Reiner masterpiece. Great writing, flawless direction and perfect performances from the lead roles help this film portray summer, school, (as you could guess from the title)and teenage rebellion with charm and wit. Mark Harman is widely considered to have made his name on his looks, but the performance he gives in Summer School is one of a comedy master, with subtle hints of a father figure who never grew up himself. A timeless feel-good classic.<br><br>two thumbs up.","user":"ChainsawDaveandMisterShoop","rank":[40,49]},{"title":"It Makes Me Laugh","rating":7,"date":"23 December 2001","review":"This is not a great movie and it got bad reviews, but it stays in the movie rotations of many television stations.  Why?  Because it is funny.  Just watch it and enjoy.  It is really aimed at young teens and they will probably like it best.","user":"pattersonsmith","rank":[30,39]},{"title":"One cool movie","rating":6,"date":"6 December 1999","review":"This movie is truly a blast from the past. The characters are funny and the plot is very interesting. Personally, the best character's are Dave and Chainsaw due to their \"laid back\" attitudes in the film. Mark Harmon also does a good job in his role. The movie is in the mid 80's but thats what makes it so interesting.If you have not seen the movie... go rent it, you just might enjoy it. Two thumbs wayyy up.","user":"fasted_22","rank":[23,30]}]
