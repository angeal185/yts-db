[{"title":"Cornball in the extreme","rating":1,"date":"1 February 2015","review":"When this movie started I thought it was going to be a comedy. <br><br>Then I realized they actually meant for this to be serious.<br><br>As it turns out it was a comedy that started taking itself FAR too serious. <br><br>As other reviewers have already stated it is cheesy with shallow characters that are as ridiculous as I have ever seen. <br><br>There is so little fact that I laughed till I thought I would cry. It was worth watching just for the laugh.<br><br>I would say that the acting was like something out of middle school production but I wouldn't insult the middle school students.<br><br>The CGI was substandard at best.","user":"historyguy197","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Best movie EVER!!","rating":1,"date":"18 June 2014","review":"This movie has to be the best movie ever created that can actually waste 2 hours of your time without giving anything back. You can actually learn more by watching the wall and following some ants around the house.<br><br>I recommend reading a book about nothing.<br><br>You can go out and just sit on the front of the house and enjoy 2 hours better than this movie.<br><br>I will be adding this movie to the worst list ever of movies that can waste money on actors and produce nothing.<br><br>10 lines!","user":"luisalvaradox","rank":[41,54]},{"title":"Ridiculous waste of time","rating":1,"date":"2 June 2014","review":"Even for a b-movie this is just a terrible movie with a story that contains so much nonsense, it could be written by a 4-year old.<br><br>A 747 locked on autopilot, but a guy (who never flew a 747 before) that can control the plane better than any experienced pilot (using flying debris to rip off an engine), while flying through volcanic ashes and debris for hours, apparently without any problems for the plane. Volcanoes that can rise out of the sea in seconds without any effects (waves) to the sea. A guy fixing a 747 jet-engine in flight by using a hammer... And these are just a few facts. Add a few terrible actors and a even worse storyline and you'll get this result.<br><br>I've seen a lot of good movies (A and B) and a lot of bad movies (A and B) , but this is the first movie where i had to force myself to watch it till the end.<br><br>Conclusion: A waste of time.","user":"ikreageeropeenadvertenti","rank":[19,23]}]
