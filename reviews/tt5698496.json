[{"title":"Lovely","rating":16,"date":"16 March 2018","review":"The experience of watching this film is quite unlike any other. I found the poetic and metaphorical nature of the story to be complimented amazingly by the animation, which will not be everyone's cup of tea but which I personally found stunning. The story itself is lyrical and meditative, and the power doesn't entirely hit you at first, but it's on reflection that you truly realize it. Overall, this is a strong film that deserves more recognition.","user":"Red_Identity","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"A good film","rating":7,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"This film is good. It adequately describes the Brother's Grimm tale and brings a lot of creativity and originality to the project. The whole story captivates you the longer you watch.<br><br>I liked the animation overall. However, some of the animations seemed rather lazy. One scene in particular when the bird was traveling through the mountains. Also, the disappearing characters. It is useful in scenes to convey meaning, but at other times it happens randomly and seems again, like lazy animation. But watch for yourself, maybe I'm missing something from the art.","user":"rawisnwo","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Poetic and beautiful","rating":9,"date":"22 August 2018","review":"At first sight you may get disturbed by the drawings and the storyline but then you progressively look more and more intensely. Every movement is incredible, every drawing is a dream\nLet you immerse in it","user":"pierrelacaze","rank":[3,6]}]
