[{"title":"Fast violent and gore, fun to watch","rating":7,"date":"25 October 2017","review":"Surprisingly I had fun watching this movie. It's a movie you don't have to take too serious, with a lot of violence, even gory moments, a bit of sex, but all with a humorous tint. Maybe it will not make everybody laugh but for me it worked. It's all very fast so you never have a dull moment and so you never get bored. The characters are all well chosen, from hot crazy women to complete deranged maniacs. The cast might not be well-known actors but they all delivered. It's not going to be a cult movie like some others in the same genre but it's a pretty decent one. I had fun watching 68 Kill and that's what it's all about when I watch a movie in this genre. Maybe it's not everybody's cup of soup but I'm sure there will be a lot of people like me that like this kind of fast gory action movies.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[24,32]},{"title":"The Bat-Poop Crazy Film of 2017","rating":7,"date":"24 March 2017","review":"Chip Taylor's girlfriend Liza had the perfect plan to rip off her rich sugar daddy. It should have been an easy in and out kind of deal. Nobody would get hurt and they would come out of it with enough loot to solve their problems. But things started going wrong as soon as they were inside the rich man's house, and for Chip it was only the beginning of the longest, most terrifying ride of his life.<br><br>Let's start by discussing the cast. Matthew Gray Gubler is perfectly cast as \"sad sack\" Chip. Gubler's facial expressions alone should really make him a bigger name than he is. His range of emotion in just his eyes is very intense. AnnaLynne McCord is his partner-rival as the stereotypical crazy-beautiful Liza something she is quite good at playing, as seen in \"Excision\", which coincidentally also starred Gubler. The duo also both starred in last year's festival hit \"Trash Fire\". Are they the new Hepburn and Tracy?<br><br>Alisha Boe, who is distinguishing herself on television, is the breakout star here. Although she was unknown to me before \"68 Kill\", her strong screen presence suggests that offers are going to start pouring in. She has the look, she has the personality. Heck, she could make one great Marvel superhero, for example.<br><br>The film as a whole is great in its bat-poop craziness, and the perfect vehicle for director Trent Haaga. I have been watching Haaga grow as a filmmaker for decades, from being a Troma darling to \"Cheap Thrills\". With \"68 Kill\", he has really hit the mainstream, with some bigger name actors and production value that could easily be mistaken for a Hollywood film. He does touch base a bit with the punk rock look of the gas station attendant, and the climax does seem to be something that would fit in alongside \"Terror Firmer\". Fans of Troma will enjoy this film, as it just keeps pushing the envelope in ways that we never see anymore.<br><br>The black humor is endless. We have the \"happily ever after\" scenario that is quite funny given the amount of money involved. We have lines like \"what Dwayne does is his own business\" when what Dwayne is doing is certainly more than just his business. This is the blackest of humor with tongue more than firmly placed in cheek.<br><br>As with many films, this is not for everyone. Those who are easily offended will be offended. The violence is over the top, the sex is gratuitous and frequent. But if what offends some is what excites you, this is going to be a must-see. The movie plays March 24 at the Boston Underground Film Festival (BUFF).","user":"gavin6942","rank":[36,58]},{"title":"A very enjoyable film.","rating":9,"date":"10 July 2018","review":"A film that doesnt take itself seriously at all, and that works very well for a movie you dont need to invest alot in. Funny, disturbing and bloody with a ridiculous plot. I think if you want a fun time and you like grindhouse type movies, this will be enjoyable. Of course its my opinion but it helps that the lead actress is fantastic at acting crazy in this film and others.","user":"staypuff-589-883937","rank":[16,24]}]
