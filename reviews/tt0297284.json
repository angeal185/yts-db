[{"title":"Surprisingly Entertaining","rating":20,"date":"20 November 2004","review":"Knowing Renny Harlin's track record, you never know what to expect from the Finnish director. It seems it's more or less random which of his films turn out to be crap or really quite good. I didn't know what to expect here, and maybe my low expectations were part of the reason why i found this film to be surprisingly entertaining.<br><br>The setup is pretty standard-fare for a serial-killer film. What makes this different is the victims. They are FBI-agents in training to become profilers. Their teacher is Jake Harris (Val Kilmer) who likes to use special methods while training his agents. As a test the profilers-to-be are sent out to an army training facility on a desolate island. A small town is built on the island and the morning after their arrival a murder will have happened in the town, their job is to find the killer. Something goes wrong however and it seems the game has become real, a killer really is on the loose and now he's chasing them.<br><br>To say that this story is unbelievable and forced is an understatement. The whole set-up with an abandoned island feels a bit cheap, a lame excuse to get the agents alone in a place from which there is no escape. But if you can accept that particular bit of plot then the rest is not bad at all. The atmosphere is well built and the suspense is thick. Also most of the actors do a pretty good job creating that \"anyone-could-be-guilty\"-feeling.<br><br>So, even though the serial-killer thing has been done a thousand times and even though the set-up here is even less believable than usual, this is still an enjoyable experience. It might not be revolutionary, and it might not be something you'll remember for very long. But if you like this kind of movie you will at least be entertained for as long as it lasts. I rate it 6/10.","user":"Antagonisten","rank":[80,102]},{"title":"One of the best of its kind.","rating":7,"date":"17 June 2004","review":"No Spoilers Ahead<br><br>I saw the movie last night in the \"sneak preview\". I had no idea what kind of movie it was, except for the genre \"thriller\". Thriller is not right. It is more a \"Thriller/Psycho/Horror Movie\"<br><br>Most of the movie you had no time to get breath. It has a really good atmosphere and good actors. You never know what will happen next and you are really shocked the whole time.<br><br>Thats what my experience with that movie was, but i have to say that i did not know anything about the content of the movie, i did not see one trailer of it and i read no comment of it before watching it. <br><br>I have to admit, that there are several parts which are not logic or seems to be not logic, but it doesn't destroy the atmosphere, because you have no time to think about it during watching the movie.<br><br>I would not watch it a second time, because the shocking effects would not work anymore, but i give this movie 7 points. <br><br>By the way: there are really morbid and cruel scene's in it, i hadn't expected that.<br><br>I can't understand \"illegal alien51\"'s comment. I liked it!<br><br>( I hope my English is not so bad, because i am not used to write or speak English a lot )","user":"Kazum","rank":[92,120]},{"title":"does what it's supposed to","rating":8,"date":"21 January 2004","review":"I found Mindhunters to be a thoroughly entertaining movie that did have some good surprises and moments.  The story is as original as it could be, although, one can argue that the whole group in isolation getting picked off one by one thing has been done before.  I will not give away too much of the movie so that you can be surprised at the twists that it offers, except I must make one comment.  Why on earth do they let LL Cool J have some of the most ridiculously stupid one liners.  I mean, if he wants to be bought as a believable actor, he needs to put an end to this madness.  I am sure you will know what I am talking about when you see the movie.<br><br>Anyway, I give it 8 out of 10 and a definite check it out if you enjoy thrillers... especially ones with gruesome killers.","user":"lix","rank":[43,60]}]
