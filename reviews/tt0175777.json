[{"title":"It's no \"Swingers\" but still mildly entertaining","rating":7,"date":"30 November 1999","review":"\"Just a little harmless sex\" is a flimsy, silly sex farce.  The story concerns 3 males, 3 females, and stories of infidelity and picking up mates. Everyone seems to be sexually aggressive in the movie, even one of the character's mothers.<br><br>It is mostly a comedy, but there is a fair amount of drama in the movie. Should you forgive a loved one for cheating on you?  Not because they are in love with someone else, but because they are horny at a particular moment? This is the main theme of the movie.<br><br>The cast of the movie saves it.  It was surprising to see Kimberly Williams (of \"father of the bride fame\") performing a long strip scene near the end.<br><br>And for all of you looking for gratuitous nudity, the intro scene is the only nude scene in the entire movie.","user":"Go_Blue_99","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"A cute, light comedy....a good rental","rating":17,"date":"17 January 2000","review":"Found this movie to be a perfect Sat evening rental.....some light comedy (a few very funny scenes) added with some drama, and a pretty good cast.  It is not Shakespeare, that is for sure...but what is?<br><br>The only glaring problem was a stage-hand's head popping up at the bottom of the screen during a particularly good scene towards the end.","user":"dantwo","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Not bad for a late night cable movie","rating":30,"date":"30 December 2001","review":"I caught this on cable at about 4:30 in the morning. It was pretty funny. I recognized some of the actors, and was pleasantly surprised with their performances. It was a cute movie, and somewhat accurately described what seems to be the average girls night out. I thought that the scenes with his friends hitting on his mother-in-law were great. I dont know if I would rent this, but if it was on cable again I would most likely watch it. =)","user":"Illusia","rank":[5,6]}]
