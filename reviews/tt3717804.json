[{"title":"This Film Isn't A Morrissey Biopic; So Cool Your Heals Mozza-Manics","rating":6,"date":"20 September 2017","review":"I can encapsulate working class Manchester of this time in one sentence: Cigarette burns in bus seats with the smell of stale urine in the air.<br><br>I like what's been done here. The Smiths (&amp; Morrissey himself) create such devotion in fans (especially those who were there at the time) that any conceived wrong foot in a film relating to that band would be gnawed upon by a multitude of bedroom martyrs; especially in this internet age.<br><br>Nevertheless, what the film makers have done with England Is Mine sidesteps this problem, for they've made a film not about MORRISSEY, but rather Stephen (Steve) Morrissey - a young Mancunian man suffering from depression within in a time &amp; area of depression; The Smiths aren't even a whiff away.<br><br>It's hard to emphasis to those who didn't experience it, how gray Manchester of the 70s &amp; early 80s was. It was stuck in a polluted puddle of red brick decay, unsure &amp; struggling to break free from its own shadow. In many ways this film (consciously or not) reflects young Steven Morrissey against Manchester of that time. No clich√© in sight.<br><br>P.S. It is slighting disconcerting how much the lead looks like the English comedy actor Alan Davies in the first half of the film.","user":"LouieInLove","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"One for the fans","rating":8,"date":"5 August 2017","review":"At last, a musical biopic that doesn't throw in cheap references, nor equally cheap laughs, and instead gives us a sober, realistic and not always warm character study of the formative years of one of Britain's best loved singer-songwriters. But be warned - if you have no interest in Steven Patrick Morrissey, indeed if you have a passing love for the band and aren't too bothered in learning how he came up with the lyrics that he did, then much of ENGLAND IS MINE might not do a lot for you. This film is definitely one for the proper fans, and for those of us in that position it's a real treat. <br><br>Lots to love about this one. Jack Lowden might not look a lot like Morrissey but he gets across very well the sense of alienation and perpetual disappointment that surrounds our hero. He's bored and unfulfilled with every aspect of his life, feeling like there's something more out there and yet too shy and not forthcoming enough to go after it. That lack of belonging is something many young people experience - I know I did - and Morrissey is kind of the Dean of that time in life, and Lowden nails it. His friendship with Linder (fantastic Jessica Brown Findlay) shows him finding a rare kindred spirit, and he reacts to the lost chance of success he arrives at briefly with Adam Lawrence's Billy Duffy by doing what we would all like to and retreating to his bedroom.<br><br>The period detail is excellent - you get the vision of late 70s/early 80s Manchester as a bit of a dive, crammed with lost souls and angry voices, from which Morrissey feels entirely apart. Lovely touches, like the cracked, single pane windows upon which rain hammers, add to to reality. <br><br>The choice of musical numbers is another bonus. There are no Smiths tracks, given the tale essayed here takes place before the band was formed. Instead we get the 1960s songs that heavily influenced the group's sound, and that's a real bonus. The era before the Smiths existed really feels like another place, another time, bereft of something that they ended up filling. One nice bit of detail, the local venue that exhibits posters for an upcoming Duran Duran concert while Morrissey and Marr (Laurie Kynaston, not in it much) start hammering out the more localised and altogether grittier music and lyrics that would eventually form the Smiths, a great snatch of visual storytelling that the film stuffs in. <br><br>And if you aren't interested in that, there's the gallows humour of young Mozzer to enjoy, an acerbic wit that would put people off and yet find expression in his words put to Marr's tunes.","user":"T_Side","rank":[36,42]},{"title":"An interesting character study of a pre-Smiths Morrissey.","rating":5,"date":"2 July 2017","review":"I was lucky enough to attend the world premier of this at the Edinburgh Film festival closing gala. Now to the actual movie. The story is focused on Morrissey towards the end of the 70s and the struggles he had trying to get his first foot on the ladder as a performer while at the same time being paralyzed with fear of being on stage and dealing with his everyday struggles. In the movie he comes across as a hyper sensitive and shy person but with an underlying streak of arrogance in his own belief in his abilities,despite his lack of confidence in social situations. However the acerbic one liners you would expect from Morrissey are there and when they arrive they are genuine laugh out loud funny. If Smiths fans were hoping to see a film which has a lot of Smiths music in it they will be disappointed. Its similar to the James Brown biopic there's none of the music you may have anticipated being part of the story, which may be a problem for some fans. What we do hear is mostly pop music from the charts from that time. The cast do a great job however without dropping any spoilers for me the film ended almost at the point it was about to get even more interesting, though I doubt there will be any sequel. The film is an interesting character study of one the UKs greatest ever front men from one of the best bands the country has produced, however I am not sure that this film is something either he or his fans will take to their heart. I feel there is a better film on this subject yet to be made. Interesting from as a psychological study but fans may feel shortchanged.","user":"torrascotia","rank":[23,29]}]
