[{"title":"LITE FARE, A NICE LITTLE BREAK","rating":5,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"I found breaking breaking brooklyn to be a nice little interlude from dreary reality, without a heavy layer of religiosity, just sappy feel good, a cross between billy elliot and miracle on 34th st.","user":"bandanajack","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Gotta dance","rating":3,"date":"14 January 2019","review":"There are elements of Billy Elliot in Breaking Brooklyn.<br><br>Aaron is a 12 year old boy who along with his older brother become homeless as their dad is carted away to jail for some outstanding warrants.<br><br>They are looked after by Miles Bryant (Louis Gossett Jr) while their father is away. Miles was a top dance act in his younger days with his brother Greg Bryant (Vondie Curtis-Hall.)<br><br>Both are now estranged although they all live in a rundown theatre along with Miles's daughter who is a talented singer.<br><br>Miles recognised that Aaron has talent and teaches him some dance steps. When Aaron's father is released, he disapproves of Aaron taking part in a dance competition.<br><br>With the Bryant Brothers theatre at risk from foreclosure, Aaron organises a fundraising event to help them out. However the bickering brothers need to reunite.<br><br>Breaking Brooklyn is a slightly gritty festive set film of two fractured families who come to heal each other. The dance scenes are well staged but the drama never flows and the story is well worn.<br><br>Greg is too much of a curmudgeon but you know eventually he will get his act together. Unfortunately it is very hard for the dance scenes between him and Miles to be staged. It is obvious Lou Gossett Jr is not mobile enough unless CGI was involved.","user":"Prismark10","rank":[1,2]}]
