[{"title":"An honest review","rating":7,"date":"17 March 2019","review":"Out of the twelve current reviews, the ten 10/10's are all fake, and the two 1 &amp; 2/10 are wannabe critics that have no clue how to rate a film.<br><br>I found this film flawed, yet interesting and entertaining, and better than I expected.<br><br>The acting by all cast was on point, especially J.L. Curtis. The sound/score was decent. The directing and cinematography were well done by writer/director Joe Chappelle. But his writing is were the flaws showed. The too-long 102 min length, and extremely slow pacing made this film seem over 2 hours long. Many scenes were dragged out and unnecessary imo. Joe Chappelle's resume is mainly TV's shows, so going into a full length feature film clearly was a challenge for him. Had this films pace been sped up, and the screenplay edited/cut down to 60 (TV show length) - 80 min, it would have held the audiences attention better with constant uninterrupted suspense..<br><br>The premise of this political drama/(hardly a) thriller was actually very interesting, and the flashback scenes were done well, but most of the 'entertainment value' was the last 15-20 mins. The beginning was the slowest, focusing too much on unnecessary long or irrelevant scenes.<br><br>Still, an enjoyable film on dirty underground politics. Would I recommend it? Only if you are into political films and/or have nothing better to watch. It's an honest 7/10 from me.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[26,39]},{"title":"Strong film. Why the low score?","rating":7,"date":"15 July 2019","review":"Not sure why such a low score. Well made, good acting, politically driven and undeniably believable in the real world.\nI enjoyed this as a Sunday night film, I was interested and enjoyed it. Sure... it didn't blow my mind, I was aghast at what I was witnessing, I wasn't bowled over eyes peeled on the edge of my seat. But it was entertaining and a strong film... certainly wasn't a waste of time or anything so negative. Would def. recommend as a drama, political thriller type. Good cast too.","user":"dannypetty-73316","rank":[11,16]},{"title":"Worth the patience.","rating":7,"date":"9 September 2019","review":"It started slow, but by the end, I was very glad I had hung in there.","user":"kiko-49980","rank":[6,9]}]
