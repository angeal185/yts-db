[{"title":"Quite good, up to a point","rating":7,"date":"5 February 2016","review":"Three kids who play a competitive sailboarding flag-capturing game end up involved in a moon mission to stop a mad squillionaire businessman from destroying evidence of the 1969 moon landing, and reunite the father and grandfather of one of them.<br><br>This Spanish-produced CGI feature is really strange. On one level it works perfectly satisfactorily as a kids' action adventure movie. On another, it puzzles the adult viewer as it blends hyper-realistic scientific detail with things which have you going \"Huh?\" (not least of which is the way that NASA allows three pre-pubescent kids to wander in and out without any kind of security issues arising).<br><br>There is also a credibility mismatch between the NASA mission hardware (conventional rocket, command module, LEM) and the baddie's state-of-the-art sci-fi spaceship and its payload of heavy duty machinery. I doubt that this will trouble the intended audience, though, most of whom will be of an age with the protagonists.<br><br>This mismatch also applies on the animation side. The scientific detail is excellent, from NASA hardware to the moon's surface, gravity, and so on. But the human faces, particularly the kids, are all strangely bland, unfinished, and similar (apart from the chubby, scientific genius, incredibly annoying, ginger kid).<br><br>I can't say that I thought this was great, but I guess it would be a lot easier to think more of it if I was age 9.","user":"neil-476","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"Amusing and charming adventure about a little boy who travels outer space and lands in moon","rating":8,"date":"8 July 2017","review":"Great movie that contains brilliant and enticing animated pieces that have the rare quality of appealing both , youngsters and adults but on different levels .
