[{"title":"Hunchback of Notre Dame is a great animation.","rating":10,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"Such an underrated Disney film! If you haven't seen this movie yet, definitely check it out! Maybe Victor Hugo fans won't enjoy it since this film was criticized at the time of its release for not being faithful to the story it's based on, but if you want to witness an amazing movie crafted by the professionals at Disney, you have no reason not to watch this film!","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[39,40]},{"title":"Disney grows up, and it is good","rating":10,"date":"15 January 1999","review":"Going into the theater to see this movie, my friend and I (who are \"cynical\" teenage movie critics) honestly expected to be disappointed, especially after the relatively blah Pocahontas. When the movie was over 90 min. later, we both ran frantically to go buy the CD and read the book (which, actually, was rather different than the movie, but hey.).<br><br>I am 17 years old; I grew up watching The Little Mermaid and Aladdin. When Disney released this movie, which dealt with extremely heavy subject matter in an extremely tasteful manner, I jumped for joy. During the entire movie, I was amazed and spellbound. The music was also fantastic, by the way, as was the cinematography (although those crowd scenes begin to look really fake after a while). That scene where Quasimodo holds Esmerelda up in front of the rose window and yells, \"Sanctuary!\" still gives me chills.<br><br>This is not a movie for children in any way, shape or form. I think the only problem with Hunchback is the fact that Disney refused to accept that this is a serious, relatively adult motion picture and would not make any animated movie, no matter how serious, without obnoxiously cute little critters (i.e., the gargoyles) bouncing around to entertain the kiddies, or huge marketing campaigns at McDonald's, etc. As some others have written on here, it's pretty obvious this movie isn't for kiddies from its subject matter.<br><br>But anyone over 13 who's willing to think as well as be entertained when watching a Disney movie would probably love Hunchback.","user":"Jenny-83","rank":[138,153]},{"title":"Disney's Miracle of a Movie","rating":4,"date":"4 October 2004","review":"A risky wedding of wholesome classic animation, to adult and often dark-themed material. The risk paid off and the result is one of the greatest achievements of Disney Studios.<br><br>The animation here is first rate and the entire thing is shot like a live-action film with some incredible long shots, great theatrical panning and even at one point, during Quasimodo's song \"Out There\" a realistic camera flare (I did a double take the first time I saw it!) Hunchback is filled with all sorts of great \"tricks\" like this. Lighting effects here are nothing short of magnificent  often subtle they sometimes change in an instant dramatically altering the mood of the piece. Frodo's demonic song \"Hellfire\" is perhaps one the most sinister and frightening moments to emerge from Disney and the animators let loose. <br><br>The prologue to the movie alone is a minor masterpiece and, like Beauty and the Beast, marvelously prepares us for the whirlwind of a story to take place.<br><br>The complaints about the singing and dancing gargoyles Victor, Hugo and Laverne, are simply wrongheaded. I read the Hugo classic too, and know they're not in there. What the complainants fail to realize is these gargoyles live only in Quasimodo's imagination. He invented these companions to ease an otherwise tortured, lonely, friendless life. The culmination of all of this becomes obvious in the spectacular song \"A guy like you\" which finishes with pigeons flying and hearts and banners and ribbons and Quasimodo being celebrated and then BAM immediately upon the conclusion of the final notes, the room becomes the same dark, dank, splintering tower filled with relics, junk and heartbreak. It's one of the movie's most shattering effects. <br><br>While deserved praise goes to the animators and crew, the voice talent here is, in my opinion, Disney's very best. Tom Hulce goes to the very soul of Quasimodo and gives a performance that is as poignant and shattering as anything he has done (Hulce also happened to be the best Hamlet I've ever seen.) Certain lines (\"I am a monster, you know\") will ring in my ear forever. Hulce has a beautiful voice and renders \"Out there\" with such abandon and vigor it makes my hair stand on end. In the quiet \"Heaven's light\" (which sequences into a stunning shot of the bells frantically ringing the opening theme), Hulce brings a fragility to such lines as \"no face as hideous as my face, was ever meant for Heaven's light\" that only a heart of stone would not be moved. Switching from pathos to rage, Hulce lets us feel the hidden rage and danger that this character also possesses. It is a truly remarkable performance.<br><br>Demi Moore, Kevin Kline, Tony Jay, Paul Kandel  and the rest of the cast all sound at the top of their game creating wonderful and vivid characters. <br><br>Alan Menkin and Stephen Schwartz get to the heart of the matter with score and songs  a sound  that are as integral a part of the telling of this story as the animation and voices. <br><br>Hunchback is a miracle of a movie!","user":"gpadillo","rank":[79,88]}]
