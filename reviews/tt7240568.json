[{"title":"Do we really need this? Does anyone actually care?","rating":1,"date":"25 October 2018","review":"This is quite possibly THE most pointless documentary ever created, which is especially surprising considering its talented creator.<br><br>Well made in regards to direction, production, etc, but seriously, who cares about this? Honestly, without any intent on being rude, and purely from an objective standpoint, why was there a documentary created about this person? It holds the same interest as it would for any random person on the planet.<br><br>Every person in the world has a \"story\". Welcome to humanity, we don't all need a documentary.","user":"efreed09","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"confirms what i knew about him","rating":1,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"The douche is back on flattering himself on the big screen. i wonder who came for the premiere.","user":"AziziOthmanMY","rank":[10,19]}]
