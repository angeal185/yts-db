[{"title":"Not Good Enough","rating":4,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"\"A boy who wished to be okuda tamio and a girl who drove all men crazy\" was .... okay. I really liked the ending, where the character had a meal with his old self. I guess there was more in that scene than in the whole movie.<br><br>The main plot of the drama was not anything that we haven't seen before. And the story felt a bit flat and predictable. It was easy to read the characters, especially the leading lady's. Not that the performances weren't good. Both actors did an good job and they had chemistry. However, her character was a bit stereotypical.<br><br>So, overall, four out of ten.","user":"pennyelenabooks","rank":[0,0]}]
