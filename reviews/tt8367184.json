[{"title":"Cute.","rating":7,"date":"21 September 2019","review":"Don't really undrstand the low ratings. It's a romcom people, not Wuthering Heights. I thought it was cute, funny and light. Exactly what I was looking for.","user":"missbestworst","rank":[27,35]},{"title":"difficult to watch","rating":2,"date":"27 January 2020","review":"I wanted this to be an easy movie to watch and though it was simple indeed, i found myself cringing 75% of the time. characters and their story lines were wildly underdeveloped. the protagonist was extremely unlikeable and rude and hard to root for. i felt like i was missing major plot points but alas they just didn't exist... good thing it was predictable. not to mention, hasn't this exact movie already come out 8 time since the last year? save yourself and skip this one","user":"lauracreecher","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Bad","rating":2,"date":"21 December 2019","review":"I felt like watching a chick movie but this wasn´t a good romantic comedy. You don´t leave feeling uplifted or happy. It drags on at the end. A waste of time.","user":"tlarraya","rank":[6,7]}]
