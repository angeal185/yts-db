[{"title":"Skip to the last 40 minutes.","rating":5,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"Except for the last 40 minutes, this is typical anthology fare. Not great acting, writing or filming. With exception of the mildly amusing Tampoon. However, in the last 40 min. we are treated to Room 731. Truly frightening thanks to the performances of Yoojung Kim and Tim Kang. Also, we get Weeji. A fun little palate cleanser. And finally, a breakout performance by Heather Morris in The Cleansing Hour. Worth the time to check out in under an hour.","user":"whowatchesthewatchmanskids","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Not as good as reviews suggest","rating":3,"date":"9 October 2018","review":"Honestly, I was expecting very little from Dark, Deadly &amp; Dreadful and sadly my expectations were not met. The film quality and set designs are the only real redeeming qualities of the film, but that's about it. Almost every story makes no sense (I still have no idea what anything meant in The Listing short), there are quite a bit of fodder scenes, and the acting is okay (just okay). Don't trust what the other reviewers are posting, because honestly, they were probably paid to write that. Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass.","user":"sean_payne","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"Difficult to watch","rating":2,"date":"10 October 2018","review":"It's perfect to put on if your doing something else and want something on in the background that you're not following. Otherwise, it's totally awful.","user":"jrpowell-19228","rank":[13,16]}]
