[{"title":"Arthur and the Invisibles","rating":8,"date":"21 May 2007","review":"The movie in the theater was wonderful...however now we have watched the DVD and the children are quite disappointed as many of the funny scenes have been cut out...this is the first time I have seen this happen. For example the two kisses between Arthur and Selinia...the dance with Max...when the parents are digging for the treasure...the part where the buyer tries to steal the treasure....the part where the coconut breaks and Arthur asks Selinia for the string on her top for him to climb...when they were almost kissing and Selinia's brother said she had to wait for the next ten years....when they are sleeping in the flower and Selinia wakes Arthur has his arm around her...these are just a few of the scenes the children have noticed on our first viewing.","user":"nounou-jb","rank":[30,35]},{"title":"Great animation, fun film","rating":8,"date":"14 January 2007","review":"Took my nine-year old daughter and we both really enjoyed it. I found the animated portions far more engaging than the human-acted portions, but that wasn't a real distraction. The other commenters on the film here in IMDb seem to be very annoyed by the lack of a completely cohesive plot, but hey, this isn't Citizen Kane! We really work hard to find films we will take our daughter to see, and having viewed the preview some time ago, I was happy to stumble upon the opening of this movie this weekend. I can guarantee that we'll see it again before it leaves the theatres and will likely purchase the DVD. The violence was minimal and well-handled (vague battle scenes), the scary parts not over-the-top scary, and the light touch with the romance was appreciated by the mom of a pre-pre-teen. Nice family movie.","user":"kamsarmer","rank":[44,56]},{"title":"Adventure With The Minimoys","rating":9,"date":"9 November 2008","review":"'Arthur et les Minimoys' is a charming little children's adventure film. The world of the Minimoys is well created and it is the animated sequences that are much more fun than the acted sequences even though Mia Farrow and Freddie Highmore keep the latter sequences alive while the rest of the actors don't. There has been some nice creative input behind the making of the world of Minimoys. The animation is lively, the vibrant colours and detail are fascinating, the characters are lovable, especially Princess Selenia and her brother and the voice casting (that includes Madonna, Harvey Keitel, Jason Bateman and more) is great. The adventure with Arthur, Selenia and her brother is fun and engaging. How often do you get to see characters sleeping on a cosy bed of pollen, straws being used as a water supply or figures dancing on a moving LP disk? The romance between Selenia and Arthur is well handled. Moreover the film balances the comedy, fantasy and adventure feel very well. Overall, 'Arthur et les Minimoys' is a cute little fun film. Clearly, Luc Besson's intention was to make a children's film and he has succeeded in making a nice one.","user":"Chrysanthepop","rank":[15,17]}]
