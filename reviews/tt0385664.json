[{"title":"Unwatchable, ultra-amateur movie musical attempt","rating":2,"date":"27 January 2008","review":"\"Jekyll and Hyde\" claims to be a rock musical from the \"Rocky Horror\" school of low-budget cult musicals. Even fans of \"Rocky Horror\" and its cult-movie ilk (\"Shock Treatment,\" \"The Apple\") will admit that these kinds of movies aren't \"good,\" per se. The acting isn't the greatest, the film-making is a bit awkward... but still, they have something-- a fun, camp sensibility, an imaginative bizarreness, some catchy songs.<br><br>Unfortunately, \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" isn't bad in a fun-campy-cult-movie kind of way. It's bad in the \"we have absolutely no idea of how to make a movie\" kind of way. It's like four buddies in a band--with absolutely no knowledge of or talent for scriptwriting or film-making--pooled together $1000 and roped in their friends to act in the movie version of their song cycle. The results are really only fit to be viewed by their family and friends. A total lack of narrative coherence, hilariously bad dialogue and acting, disposable characters with no motivation, excruciatingly awkward editing and really, really poor cinematography... this movie has almost nothing going for it. It seems almost mean to criticize the particulars, because this is obviously not a film that any professionals were involved with. Ideally, it would never have made it into the video stores in the first place.<br><br>I will say that the songs aren't bad. They're reasonably catchy, the musicians seem talented, and the lyrics are standard rock-musical fare. As a mostly-sung stage show (presumably set in 1885 Britain, rather than \"present day Los Angeles,\" justifying songs like \"London Fog\" that are otherwise totally illogical), \"Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" probably wouldn't be so bad. As a really, really ineptly made movie, though, it's godawful. Unless you personally know the filmmakers and are curious what they were up to that one summer, stay away. And if even you do know the filmmakers... you'll probably still be disappointed.","user":"greenhalcyon","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Film Review","rating":8,"date":"6 May 2005","review":"I'll have to admit that when I watched this film for the first time I was a bit surprised to find myself in a theater watching a musical. But even more surprising to me was the films level of entertainment. Musicals in general tend to bore me, but recently films like Chicago, and Moulin Rouge, have worked their ways into my DVD collection, and THE JEKYLL AND HYDE ROCK 'N ROLL MUSICAL is no exception. I love the campy feel of this movie and it's true roots to \"B\" movie making. So I wouldn't doubt if later I find myself trying to replace my borrowed copy. I just think that it's great to see that there's still filmmakers here in LA who dare to make \"B\" films on purpose and with no apology.<br><br>Dalton Toledo / FilmMaker","user":"daltonrt","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"A great rock and roll musical!","rating":10,"date":"21 March 2005","review":"I was truly inspired by this musical. The Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Rock and Roll Musical is a small independent film that has a great story and wonderful music. It's not to often you see a rock and roll musical with such great musical talent. I understand this film was shot on a very low budget and on weekends. I think any independent film maker would enjoy seeing this film. The songs are great. I was wondering if there is CD with the music? Does anybody have it. It is great stuff. I hope this film is seen by a large audience. It's just great fun! Can't wait to see Bernhoft again. I hope he has something coming out soon! Maybe another horror musical?","user":"sp728","rank":[3,4]}]
