[{"title":"A unique and original film.","rating":26,"date":"26 August 2004","review":"If you love quirky movies this one is a gem. Basically the story plays out like this ... Charlie, played by actor Chad Lowe and Rachel, played by actress Kristy Swanson. Are young lovers who decide to elope in Nevada ... Bad mistake. They decide to take a seldom used highway where they meet a old gas station owner played by veteran actor Richard Farnsworth. It is at the gas station where Mr Farnsworth warns the young lovers not to drive a certain highway while tired. Of coarse they don't listen to him and procede to take the deserted highway where Rachel is nabbed by a person known as \" Hell Cop \" He promptly takes Rachel to hell to become satans ( Patrick Bergin ) bride. Charlie must overcome his fear and rescue his love from hell. Hell turns out to be both a terrible and humorous place with interesting characters. I found the story well written and directed. If your looking for a fun and unique movie to watch I highly recommend this now out of print movie.","user":"cyril-18","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"One hell of a ride!","rating":8,"date":"12 April 2003","review":"Watch out for this one! It starts out as a slight horror comedy, gets increasingly more bizarre as it goes along, and finally adds up to something almost visionary. Certainly one of the most original and offbeat horror films to come out in a long time, this one almost demands a second viewing just to appreciate the imaginative production design, and a third just to catch all the throwaway gags (a sign reads \"Road To Nowhere\" and, in smaller letters, \"Don't Buckle Up. It Won't Help\"). Good cast, too, with Patric Bergin being perfectly enigmatic in the first half, perfectly imposing in the second. How refreshing to finally find a film that breaks away from the traditional formulas and dares to do something new and different!

If you see this on cable, SNAG IT! Cameos by the Stiller clan are priceless. Good fun! Why does this have a rating of 5.1? No sense of humor! Why is this not on DVD? As a dealer of rare VHS (and DVD) the answer is standard. The copyright owner has gone out of business / has not had any licensing offers and is not prepared to reprint and market on their own. There are thousands of such titles which is why there is a flourishing industry of reprint labels like Alpha Video and many others. We make a good living finding and selling existing copies of movies like this. This is one of many titles that I had not heard of but the high demand for used VHS copies got my attention. I have discovered many enjoyable unknown gems this way.","user":"strat-8","rank":[27,33]}]
