[{"title":"Not a rip-off, actually fairly good.","rating":8,"date":"24 November 2003","review":"Pretty good movie that has been pretty unfairly treated over the years. It has some flaws, but in general it stands out owing to outstanding performances and ingenious direction. It's been called a copy of \"Natural Born Killers\", but that comparison is both unfair and inaccurate. Unfair because the movie was completed *before* Natural Born Killers was released, and inaccurate because the characters are fundamentally different. Natural Born Killers was about two people who were by nature violent and evil, whereas this movie is about two who are by nature *not* violent.<br><br>Check out the movie yourself, and rather than listen to accusations that it's a rip-off of movies that actually came after it, give it a shot as what it is -- a better-than average entry in a long-standing film genre, the outlaw couple on the run. And where it's due the director gives nods to his influences. Note one item that struck me as an inside joke -- the addition of Peter Fonda, the star of one movie that truly *is* a predecessor of this one: Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry (1974).","user":"Joe-385","rank":[27,32]},{"title":"EXCELLANT, LOVED IT!!!","rating":10,"date":"23 June 1999","review":"Anyone who like their films stacked with dark humour and well-written characters should check this out! It's \"Natural Born Killers-esque\" in style here and there, but was actually made before that movie. Absolutely stunning performances all round. I highly recommend this film.","user":"YAMA23","rank":[30,36]},{"title":"Unfairly Maligned...Clever, Violent, and Funny","rating":8,"date":"19 September 2013","review":"Some lazy and uninformed Critics and Reviewers can't help themselves and immediately lash out at this Movie's similarity to others Directed by Tarantino, Rodriguez, Stone, and Lynch. Truth of the Matter is that when Films are so near in release dates it is unfair and somewhat inaccurate to claim thievery.<br><br>It is more likely and a bit Metaphysical that these Creative Folks were all tapping into that Akashic Record thing or what may be called the Hundred Monkey Theory. Whatever. This is a very good, Fun-Frolic Road Movie with White Trash Anti-Heroes and a Kick-Ass Soundtrack. More quirky characters than have a right to exist in any one Movie and some Witty Banter that makes it all quite a Rolicking Ride.<br><br>It is over the top, around the bend, down the rabbit hole and off into outer space. Nutzoid and Naughty, Dirty and Delightful, with a Cast that cries out Cult Movie. It is proudly self-conscious, Violent, and Funny enough for it to become part of the Zeitgeist that was working in its Day and can not be ignored. This one will do nothing but gain Reputation and Admiration acquiring more Fans every Year. <br><br>It was an easy thing to miss and dismiss this in the Mid-Nineties but if nothing else, the Success of Renee Zellweger will have the curious seeking this one out as a Career Starter and while she is a standout here, this Movie has more to offer and does so with layers of interest far beyond anything as shallow as Star Power. It gets its energy from a Chemical Compound and a Cultural Milieu that is forever Fascinating.","user":"LeonLouisRicci","rank":[11,12]}]
