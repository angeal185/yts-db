[{"title":"Some of Rap's first major players","rating":6,"date":"25 April 2003","review":"The storyline is a familiar about trying to make it big and how sometimes that means selling your soul to the devil but find redemption in the end etc.  The difference here is many of rap music's early stars take a turn at acting.  They do all right.  I think that Blair Underwood inspired them to do a decent turn.<br><br>The main attraction now is the nostalgia of seeing Kurtis Blow, Run-DMC, The Fat Boys and New Edition perform.  Also there are cameos from the young Beastie Boys and a skinny LL Cool J.","user":"vvanpo","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"If you like old school rap this movie is for you","rating":12,"date":"12 September 1999","review":"This is a movie about the struggles of early rap groups trying to make it big in the 80's when rap was not a popular music genre. This is not the most dramatic of movies by any stretch of the imagination, but if you like old school rap acts like RUN-DMC, The Beastie Boys, The Fat Boys, and LL Cool J you will find this movie entertaining. However if you are not familiar with the 80's rap scene you may not be very impressed with this movie. I though it would be a really stupid movie at first, but once I watched it I was impressed.","user":"matte723","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Good film for old school Hip-Hop heads.","rating":5,"date":"23 February 2002","review":"This film isn't an award winner but it is a must see for all Hip Hop historians.  Loosely based on the life of producer Russel Simmons this film takes us back to the early days of Hip-Hop when rap was just starting to break into the mainstream. Blair Underwood plays Russel and everyone else (Run DMC, Fat Boys, Sheila E, New Edition, Beastie Boys, L.L. Cool J, etc..) play themselves. I think, if anything, this film gives fans an idea of what it was like for young rappers, producers and other musicians from NYC in the early eighties. I think the film could have been better if it was a little grittier and honest, but if it was than Rap and Hip-Hop may not have blown up the way it did into mainstream culture.","user":"myklook-1","rank":[5,6]}]
