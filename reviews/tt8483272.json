They all loved it! Some of the characters especially Hedy really resonated with the gang. Waaaaaay better than most of the generic rubbish hoist upon us nowadays","user":"jeremy-181","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Great Family Film","rating":9,"date":"17 April 2020","review":"Have watched many films over the last few weeks with the Kids. This had something for everyone. Both the kids and us (Mum &amp; Dad) laughed! The story totally captures you, we even had the kids cheering on Mungo at the end. Fantastic!","user":"gcourt-67318","rank":[8,8]}]
