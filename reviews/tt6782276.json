[{"title":"Saved by the actors","rating":5,"date":"18 January 2019","review":"And otherwise dismal story which doesn't make a lot of sense and has a lot of Banal scenes , is saved by the actors . Tim Roth,Luis Guzman,Nick Nolte are noteworthy.","user":"fmwongmd","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Lacks Dramatic Tension & Suspense","rating":5,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"Set in Colombia, Tim Roth portrays a pickpocket and conman disguised as a padre, as he tries to escape the pursuing ex-Marshal Nick Nolte, who believes Roth was responsible for the death of his pregnant daughter. Nolte has hired Luis Guzman, a local police officer, to help him in this pursuit and to smooth things over when Nolte disrespects the local populace or their customs. Finally, Valeria Henriquez is quite engaging as the young charmer Lena, who is desperate to join her sister in Minnesota (sold online to a family when they were both in a church orphanage) and will even team up with the \"padre\" to get there.<br><br>With this good cast and storyline I guess I expected more from this movie, but it lacked dramatic tension and suspense and came across as too flat-toned. Overall, it just never seemed to gel into anything substantial, as I see it.","user":"larrys3","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"All around fun in this cat and mouse drama","rating":8,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"Director Jonathan Sobol nailed this film with exceptional directing, as was the screenplay and cinematography. The scenic photography stills were great for showing the landscape, but I feel the images were too lengthy and some unnecessary that added to the somewhat slowly paced 98 min length of the film. Had the pace been slightly faster and the film edited down to about 80 or so mins, it would had been more suspenseful. The flashbacks where well placed, but should have been a little more detailed.<br><br>Tim Roth, Nick Nolte, Luis Guzm√°n and especially Colombian actress Valeria Henriquez nailed their roles, and I don't think this film could have been cast any better.<br><br>This is one of those films that was done so well, you really couldn't decide who to route for, and I found myself going back and forth quite a bit. A great fun film that is well deserving of my 8/10.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[16,24]}]
