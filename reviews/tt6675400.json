[{"title":"B acting at best","rating":1,"date":"30 July 2018","review":"And they never finished describing what a complete scum bag this guy still is. What gets me is that many of his church friends are either in denial of him being the devil or just naive sheep at the slaughter.","user":"jandkcorbitt","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Don't watch","rating":1,"date":"13 March 2018","review":"I have never written a review before. But just because I feel conned into watching this movie I have made an account on imdb. I am sure the people who've left good reviews are insiders or have worked on this movie. The worst movie I have ever seen. It could have been a great movie, but the plot is thin. The acting is horrible, especially in the second part where Barry Minkow playing himself... It's a joke. He deserves another 20 years in prison and 500 million fine just for making this movie.","user":"tarikbrummelaar","rank":[25,32]},{"title":"Pretty sure it was a money laundering operation.","rating":1,"date":"7 March 2018","review":"I worked on this movie 8 1/2 years ago, and I have no doubt Minkow was using the film production to create loss sheets, presumably to hide stolen money. One day he and his assistant went around set issuing \"bonus\" checks for $100 to crewmembers. No records were kept as to who received what, they just wrote checks for $100 and handed them out blindly. Mine cleared. Several did not, I heard. In 12 years' professional experience I had never witnessed anything like that before, and haven't since. <br><br>In the 8 1/2 years since we wrapped production, the most I ever heard from this show was that Minkow (WHO WROTE THE SCRIPT AND STARS IN THE MOVIE, a fact the ads do not highlight) had made an appearance on Hannity, where Hannity swore the movie deserved all the Oscars. Perhaps it's a fitting end that Minkow's back in jail, where he belongs.","user":"jtrimm-96559","rank":[26,35]}]
