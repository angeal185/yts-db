[{"title":"Returning Lions To The Wild","rating":7,"date":"8 May 1999","review":"Set in Kenya in the 1960's, and based on factual events, the film is the story of how a young orphaned lion cub is rescued by a British colonial couple who run a wildlife sanctuary and then prepared for a return to the wild. The scenery is spectacular, and the thin dividing line between death and survival in the wild is palpable. But the film is not only about struggle, it is, in an almost unique way, a love story too; one between a woman and a lioness. Hugely popular when released, the film still has the power to move. An especially good movie for families.","user":"Paul-250","rank":[24,24]},{"title":"If you don't love Elsa, there's something wrong with you!","rating":9,"date":"27 November 2003","review":"Real-life husband and wife Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers play real-life husband and wife Joy and George Adamson. Strangely, the chemistry between them is really not played up here. Everything is focused on the cubs, perhaps as it should be. This film takes what could've just been another National Geographic episode and turns it into a \"triumph of the spirit\" story. When you watch this film, you understand the true meaning of freedom. And you can't help but look at that lion and want the best for her. The title song is a perfect ending to the film. It is too bad the Adamsons' lives did not have a happy ending like this story. The film keeps it simple, but there are still some emotional moments. It delivers what it promises.","user":"xavrush89","rank":[35,37]},{"title":"innocence lost","rating":8,"date":"24 June 2005","review":"It's really hard now days to get the same feelings that this film brings to your soul, innocence, love, devotion, honesty.

It's all rare commodities in the today's life in general. Virginia McKenna &amp; Bill Travers are the perfect couples.<br><br>The film brings you the atmosphere of the great African wildlife on its last glorious days; I and my family enjoyed this film very much.
