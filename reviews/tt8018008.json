You've gotta watch the first ten minutes. It's mind boggling. The most rote robotic readings by pre teens spouting R-rated dialogue, then cutting to John Waters'-like line readings in a bar. Whoah!","user":"HeathCliff-2","rank":[16,19]},{"title":"Fun movie","rating":10,"date":"20 November 2018","review":"Watched this in the theater. Super fun. Tons of laughs. Great work.","user":"devilbritson","rank":[2,12]}]
