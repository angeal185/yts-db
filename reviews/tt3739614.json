[{"title":"Starring two tiny heroes: Mouse Damon and Chipmunk Bale!","rating":10,"date":"25 July 2016","review":"Tiny Giants 3D is a 43 minute feast for the eyes. It follows the lives of two tiny heroes: Mouse Damon and Chipmunk Bale. Mesmerizingly shot and captivatingly narrated, it's a film that is brief but burns bright. I don't know how I missed it but it looks like it flew under the radar of most people. If you have missed it too, you should see it now. You will enjoy every minute of it. Scene after incredible scene, you will wonder how they managed to shoot it and how they managed to get the cameras in there. The action in this movie is so much better than some of those multi-million dollar action movies. I found myself holding my breath in some scenes because they are so intense. And, there is a message in it for all of us: that all lives are valuable, however small they might be.","user":"holomodo","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"I have tears in my eyes!","rating":10,"date":"16 July 2016","review":"This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen! It gives us such wonderful presentation of these little guys, how they lead their little lives and how brave and heroic all of them are. We do not notice it, we do not value their lives as we should, but it is time people realize how valuable and unique this life is.<br><br>I have a Russian Dwarf Hamster, and she is such a strong little person worthy of a huge amount of respect. This film only made me love her and understand her even more!<br><br>We need more ''films'' like these, and I hope more get filmed, because this will make people realize how priceless the life of every creature is.<br><br>K.","user":"kristina-d-80904","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"NATURE in full motion.
