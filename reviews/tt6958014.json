[{"title":"Why you should give this movie a chance despite the low rating.","rating":7,"date":"31 May 2018","review":"Hollywood really lacks good lesbian scripts that doesnt end with heartache. But what makes this worth your time is the plot and acting. Laia Costa is AHHHMAZING. Seriously her smile, the tears, the rants and farts. She is a joy to watch. <br><br>The plot is simple enough. Two women drudge thru (almost) 24 hours together. They learn more about each other than they'd probably like. Mostly I think, they learn they have to learn to love themself before they can truly love someone else. Also the scene where Laia holds her hostage in the bathroom is a huge metaphor I think. You can hold someone else emotionally hostage to make them stay around, to make them love you back.<br><br>So despite another a heart breaking movie, it does make you look into your own bad habits in relationships. Its like watching a cringy trainwreck because you kinda see yourself in each of these women.","user":"FIoret","rank":[37,41]},{"title":"Finally, a portrayal of real-life","rating":9,"date":"9 July 2018","review":"I've been using IMDB for years, and I finally created an account just to review this movie. <br><br>Duck Butter captures REAL human emotions, challenges, and conversations. In \"24 hours\", this movie takes you through all the things you may or may not experience when you're in love. I'm a straight gal, but these actresses represented all the nuances that every couple (regardless of sexual orientation) can experience: clinginess, irrational jealousy, unexplainable sadness, family anger that trickles down into every day life, desire for space and breathing room, and very real arguments about music. <br><br>I love that the movie represented two extremes of the human spectrum -- one person who is vivacious and care-free, and one person who is a little more mild and guarded. <br><br>You'll have fun watching these girls through the motions, and you'll feel sad and cringe-y. Somehow, no matter how crazy people drive us, we know that it was worth all the while to open our hearts to them and to just love them.","user":"hnkirkman","rank":[35,41]},{"title":"Not quite as bad as the rating suggests.","rating":6,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"Duck Butter tells a story of two struggling artists (sigh, I know) that flee from their troubles into an intense relationship. The good part is that both Alia Shawkat and Laia Costa deliver amazing performances as reserved Naima and dramatic Sergio, respectively. The bad part is that the story elements are rather trite and the plot doesn't lead anywhere. Overall, it seems like a waste of talent. At best, Duck Butter is a movie to be enjoyed for the ride rather than the destination.","user":"maksverver","rank":[14,15]}]
