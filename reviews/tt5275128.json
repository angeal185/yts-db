[{"title":"Really funny film with lots of laughs and heart too","rating":10,"date":"13 April 2019","review":"So if you want something that will make you laugh, like the Inbetweeners style comedy and want to see what can be made in a very small budget, then this gross out British comedy is for you. If you prefer more refined films thwn there are plenty of others that you can watch instead.<br><br>It's purposely purile, raucously silly and even has a little heart too with an emotional ending.<br><br>Watch, enjoy, eat a pizza and have a few beers.","user":"foreverkeogh","rank":[8,18]},{"title":"Interesting British film","rating":5,"date":"6 May 2019","review":"Not a bad effort for a British film. It was funny at times but not hysterically. The story was simple but keeps you watching and the acting is acceptable. Worth a watch if nothing else catches your fancy","user":"hello-31327","rank":[2,6]}]
