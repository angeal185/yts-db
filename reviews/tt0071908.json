[{"title":"One of the best polish comedies ever.","rating":10,"date":"12 January 2005","review":"Nobody wouldn't believe, that screenplay wasn't total sci-fi. But one of the best movies directed by polish comedy master Stanislaw Bareja, was based on a real and completely absurd tenant regulations (script was advised by a lawyer). It's a 1974's Poland. Young marriage Jan and Wanda Filikiewicz, moves from one little room to a large flat. Unfortunately, a former husband of Wanda Filikiewicz came along with them, because twisted regulations allows that action. Poor Jerzy is trying to kick off uninvited co-tenant Jerzy Dabczak, but everything he touches, turns back to him. But it's going even worse - clever Jerzy does his best to make hell out of Jan and Wanda's life. Just like other Bareja's comedies, \"Nie ma rozy bez ognia\" is fully understandable only for someone who lived in Poland those days. And believe me - it's one of the best polish comedies ever.","user":"adrian-szczypinski","rank":[13,16]}]
