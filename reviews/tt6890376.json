[{"title":"A DAY","rating":8,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"A celebrated doctor returning from a high profile meeting with the UN encounters a traffic accident on the way to meet his daughter; to his horror, he realises that she is one of the victims of the crash. Then his life rewinds and he lives the day again, and again, each time trying to alter the inevitable chain of events which leads to his daughter's death. This ambitiously high concept thriller has a baffling timeline but, thanks to deft editing, it more or less manages to keep all of its juggled story elements in the air.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[36,37]},{"title":"A Thrilling and Intense Ride","rating":8,"date":"11 May 2018","review":"A Day provides a fresh take on the \"endless loop\" story. My suggestion is to NOT watch the trailer... don't even read the synopsis if you haven't already. If you like loop movies and thrillers... just check it out! Even the synopsis on IMDB gives away information that I had no idea was coming during the film (I went in completely blind during a film festival). <br><br>Overall, A Day was very well-rounded. A great thriller that maintained high levels of suspense and intensity from beginning to end... even a few chuckles in there. It was such a fun and interesting ride. Watching everything unfold... and wondering what new secrets would be revealed as you got deeper into the story. The production, direction, acting, cinematography... ALL very well done.","user":"moviebuffchick","rank":[9,15]},{"title":"7.5 From Me","rating":7,"date":"6 November 2019","review":"You've got to give credit where it is due and the Korean's have found their niche when it comes to dramatic thrillers. When you sit down to watch one, you can count on a steady pace, a healthy dose of action and well, to be honest, they can actually go a little overboard with the drama but they do it well.<br><br>In this film, we find a doctor of worldwide fame returning home after a long business trip. While he is an over achiever when it comes to his job, he is not doing all that great when it comes to being there for his daughter. He has missed her last birthday. She's skeptical when it comes to him actually showing up when he says he will but they make plans to meet up. While making their separate way to each other, the daughter is struck and killed by a vehicle and he sees it happen. The day begins a cycle of repetition leaving him to search for the reasons behind the occurrence and a way to save the life of his daughter.<br><br>I enjoyed this. It did a wonderful job of holding my interest with several twists and turns. It is well scripted, acted and filmed. My only complaint is that,like I mentioned before, they have a tendency to lay the drama on pretty thick. It can draw you in sometimes and at other times it can seem a bit over played. It's still a great film but for me the drama was just a tad heavy at times.<br><br>I would suggest this to my friends without hesitation. I can't say that this is my favorite dramatic thriller to come out of Korea but it is one that holds its own and doesn't fail to deliver. I say check it out.","user":"Foutainoflife","rank":[2,2]}]
