[{"title":"I Can't Look Away","rating":9,"date":"26 March 2004","review":"'In the Line of Fire' is one of those Hollywood films that shows up on tv quite a bit, but although I've seen it a few times, I usually end up sitting through the whole thing again. Why? - It's GOOD!   Clint Eastwood is great as usual, and the character he plays is interesting and more fleshed out than usual. The character, Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, is haunted by the fact that he was on the detail that failed to protect President Kennedy in Dallas, and now he's forced to match wits with a professional assassin that is openly declaring that he will kill the president. However, the film doesn't make him a depressed, brooding, and obsessed character. He's charming and personable, and is realistic as a guy that has experienced a lot in life and is comfortable in his own skin. He's even quite convincing when he flirts with the pretty younger agent played by Rene Russo. The killer, played by John Malkovich at his best, is cerebral, deliberate, and enjoys playing high stakes games of life and death. He even goes by the name of another presidential assassin, John Booth.<br><br>  The film is consistently enjoyable, and it delivers all the goods - suspense, action, romance, and drama - all in their proper amounts. It's a fun film that is really helped by the great actors in it!","user":"mattymatt30","rank":[85,97]},{"title":"Underrated Thriller","rating":9,"date":"14 October 2004","review":"Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo<br><br>holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's<br><br>greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as \"Booth\". He captures<br><br>this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. <br><br>Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an<br><br>Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be<br><br>on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!","user":"RChatterjee81","rank":[65,75]},{"title":"Peterson and Eastwood make a great team","rating":8,"date":"11 January 2002","review":"Clint Eastwood scores big in this thriller from 1993.Teamed with an absolute master of edge of your seat suspense,Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood delivers as only he can.Also,John Malkovich goes on my list of most effective screen villains in the history of cinema as the demented assassin.As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest,I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said,referring to his own career,\"I keep getting older,and my leading ladies keep getting younger\".This film is a very effective thriller with enough plot twists and surprises to keep you going.Eastwood and Peterson should team together more often. Top notch movie.","user":"SmileysWorld","rank":[42,48]}]
