[{"title":"Genuine fun.","rating":7,"date":"11 October 2018","review":"I wouldn't say its an original piece or that its a real gem or something like that , but i must say that i really enjoyed this film . It doesn't have a cheap stupid puns and it somehow provides a sense of an adventure , makes me feel good when i see that you can still make a decent comedy without stupid jokes and naked bodies. \nIts a good movie for a beer and a snack , i really recommend it for everyone.","user":"Evanoil","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"A joyful, stupidly entertaining slice of life gem from the perspective of people the system has left behind.","rating":8,"date":"16 November 2018","review":"Never Goin' Back is a raunchy, ridiculous, and wildly entertaining film from top to bottom. The pace is fleet, the characters are fun, and the writer/director was able to capture a lightning in a bottle slice of life (for stupid people) on par with the greats. Think 'Tangerine'. Getting it even closer to its comparison, the audience isn't begged to love these two dummies, but it's impossible not to. For all their hare brained ideas and bucket pooping, the inescapable fact is that these are two nearly homeless 16 year old girls with apparently no parents, no direction, no safety net. They've truly slipped through the cracks of the system and have to make or find everything they have; money, rent, furniture, and most importantly joy. I love this film.","user":"anthony-d-kelly","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"Loved it","rating":9,"date":"19 August 2018","review":"This is a great buddy flick. It's full of hilarious moments, the actresses killed it, and I felt good when the credits started rolling, and it never got boring. If you're looking for some fun entertainment with a heart, check it out.","user":"nathanpendley","rank":[18,28]}]
