[{"title":"Good Documentary","rating":17,"date":"17 October 2016","review":"VHS Massacre: Cult Films and the Decline of Physical Media (2015) <br><br>*** (out of 4)<br><br>This here is a good documentary that tries to do a bit too much but if you remember renting videos back in the 80's and 90's then you'll still want to check it out. The main goal of this documentary is to show what the lack of \"mom and pop\" video stores means for low- budget horror and cult movies.<br><br>If you grew up \"back in the day\" then you remember how great it was going into video stores where there were a great number of titles on the shelf and more arriving weekly. This documentary does a good job at looking back at this era and then talking about how Blockbuster eventually killed them off. Blockbuster would then be killed off by Netflix and streaming, which takes us to the final aspect of this documentary. With streaming killing off so many small companies, is there a way for low-budget films to survive?<br><br>At just 73-minutes there are a few too many topics that tried to be covered here but for the most part this is still an entertaining look at how the home video wars have changed over the decades. The impact on small movies like PSYCHOS IN LOVE is discussed as well as how illegal downloads are making it nearly impossible for filmmakers to make money anymore. Joe Bob Briggs, Lloyd Kaufman, Juliette Danielle, Deborah Reed, James Nguyen and Carmine Capobianco are just a few of the cult names that are interviewed.","user":"Michael_Elliott","rank":[19,26]},{"title":"Fun and breezy look at VHS culture in relation to US independent horror movies","rating":6,"date":"10 March 2017","review":"VHS MASSACRE is a fun, appropriately low-fi documentary that explores the glory days of video collecting and renting in the 1980s and 1990s. It has a rather narrow remit, focusing on low budget horror and cult film production mainly during the 1990s and exclusively in America. While the documentary has virtually no material from back in the day, it does fill the running time with plenty of incident and discussion, including many interviews with leading figures in the field.<br><br>The main emphasis of this documentary is to be fun and it's certainly that. It's designed for like-minded people, not to convert the non-fans. The interview footage is very interesting and explores how the market has changed in the face of streaming movies and illegal downloading. Cult figures like Lloyd Kaufman, Debbie Rochon, and Joe Bob Briggs are all featured here and they all have plenty to say. There are few clips from a handful of films, but mainly this is about showing video box covers and the collecting culture. It's light, breezy, and amusing.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Flawed, but interesting for a movie geek","rating":3,"date":"22 March 2020","review":"I'm a movie geek, but not really an expert on b-movies. I grew up with VHS tho so I found this kind of interesting here and there. Overall I wouldn't say this is very good and that's mostly because it's not very focused. If the makers had ditched focus on their own productions and focused more on the physical media and VHS movies in general it might've been better. Troma etc are interesting, but the documentary feels very subjective with very preachy piracy part (fwiw, I'm against piracy). I wasn't fan of the actual VHS massacre either, imo the diabetes video wasn't a laughing matter. I've seen this kind of movie geeks at local arthouse movie theatre laughing at everything and basically ruining the show for everyone else. So yes, I found the VHS part interesting, cover art appreciation etc, but there was a lot of stuff I didn't find that fitting. The subject calls for a better documentary.","user":"rlaine","rank":[2,2]}]
