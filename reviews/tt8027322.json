[{"title":"A raw honesty about life and how you live it.","rating":8,"date":"27 October 2018","review":"Well. I will start by saying it's more of life observation that a movie. It's honesty touched Me and I really engaged with Simon (the main character).<br><br>Life is short and keep trying to make it or reaching for something you always wanted is never impossible. A small budget, but big on hope and honesty. You will switch off in 10 minutes or fall in love. But hey, that's life.x","user":"syacey","rank":[696,708]},{"title":"Simply Brilliant!","rating":9,"date":"19 May 2018","review":"If you're a fan of standup comedy then you will love The Joke Thief. Centered around an aspiring standup comedian, (Simon, played by Frank D'Angelo) he embarks on a tale of love, loss, introspection and redemption. Simon finds the answers to most of life's questions thanks to a lovable and unassuming hero Jerry. Nervous on the way to a big gig, Simon learns to be grateful for even the smallest things in life. Simon realizes he's taken a few things for granted and perhaps it's time to make amends. The acting is superb and Frank D'Angelo's on-screen presence is nothing short of undeniable as he weaves through the scenes of different emotions in a search of a lifelong dream.","user":"davenicholson","rank":[698,728]},{"title":"What the hell man...","rating":2,"date":"5 November 2018","review":"Except some jokes...
