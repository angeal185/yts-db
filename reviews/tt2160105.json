She seeks help with her schoolmate Kirk Lane (Richard Harmon), who is an expert in remnant, and they need to the Chicago's No-Go Zone, a place forbidden to humans, to learn secrets about The Event and the killer.<br><br>\"I Still See You\" is a surprisingly good supernatural thriller with an original ghost story. The screenplay does not have the usual clich√©s of the genre and the acting is good.

By the end, I had that belief confirmed. Don't get me wrong I Still See You is a very enjoyable movie but I think it was perhaps released in the wrong format.<br><br>Genuinely clever, interesting and captivating I can't argue that it isn't without its flaws as truth be told it has many BUT the quality of the film outweighs them.<br><br>I'd recommend the film to anyone and everyone, sure it has that teen-sci fi vibe about it but thankfully manages to be considerably better than that.<br><br>I'd love to see this become a television series, I'd rush to watch that every week.

In addition to this novel concept, the acting was good, and the characters' motivations and actions were logical and intelligent. In fact, I can't think of a single instance where extremely poor decision-making was used to advance the plot, setting this apart from most horror/thriller movies. <br><br>On the minus side, there were a number of plot holes and cheesy bits. Although they weren't bad enough to ruin the movie, there were enough of them that I can only give it a 7/10. <br><br>Overall, it was an enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it.","user":"ddbeuth","rank":[41,56]}]
