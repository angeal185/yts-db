[{"title":"Desolation, Desperation, Vodka","rating":8,"date":"14 January 2015","review":"Leviathan takes a long, immersive look at the machinations of corrupted power in the lives of the powerless, who desperately struggle to stay the course, hoping against hope to win a losing battle.<br><br>A man and his family face off against a politically backed fat cat who wishes to buy the piece of land upon which stands their house, willing to destroy their family nest to raise a modern building in its stead. The grandiose, solemn music of Philip Glass (Akhnaten; Act I Prelude) opens and ends the movie, flanking it like a sturdy front and back cover a fine book from a Russian master's pen. Other than that, the movie is rather stark, musically and otherwise. It is remarkable how effective silent scenes can be. With little music and less sound effects, the film has your undivided attention, reaching emotional heights towards the end. The lack of a musical backdrop further enhances the gritty realism that imbues all the 140 minutes. Relationships between the characters evolve and change significantly over the span of the movie, and though the patterns are somewhat familiar, interpersonal developments are portrayed with commendable subtlety and brilliance. There is a lot of intelligence to the storytelling; much can be understood without words. We embark on a chilling journey into the land and home of ordinary, simple folks, who are kicking and screaming for justice under the suffocating oppression of ruthless power, also blighted by their own frailty.<br><br>Leviathan is an outstanding work of art that manages to drive home universally relevant points with sparkling clarity in its refreshingly honest way. A highly recommended piece.","user":"dobolevente","rank":[125,152]},{"title":"\"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord?\"","rating":10,"date":"22 July 2014","review":"I must say I was very excited to see this movie in the international film festival hosted here in Auckland.<br><br>Set in corrupt small northern Russian town, that could very much be any other town, or even country, in the world, Leviafan explores the confrontation of a man against the mayor. The last wants to kick him out of his house for his own benefit.<br><br>Superb photography, superb acting, spine chilling music, solid plot and dark humor touches make Leviafan a truly rewarding experience. One of the best movies I have seen in some time. Do not let the duration discourage you, hours fly. When you glance at your watch for the first time the movie will be over.<br><br>Be ready to pity, hate and love the characters. Laugh, feel anguish and rage and enjoy this emotional roller-coaster.","user":"martin_ee1986","rank":[167,232]},{"title":"Injustice for the Righteous","rating":8,"date":"28 December 2014","review":"Greetings again from the darkness. It may surprise some that the most relatable of the Foreign Language films submitted for Oscar consideration this year may be a rural Russian re-imagining of the Book of Job with a tip of the cap to a 1651 book from Thomas Hobbes, and so much alcohol consumption that it should carry a Warning notice for anyone in recovery.<br><br>Please don't interpret the description of relatable to mean likable or enjoyable, at least not in the traditional sense. This latest from director Andrey Zvyagintsev (The Return, 2003) is tough to watch with its theme of the working class vs the government. Who holds the power in this clash is obvious in a case of eminent domain, as Kolya (Aleksey Sorebryakov) tries everything (including blackmail) to hold on to his home and business in a fight against the Mayor (Roman Madyanov).<br><br>Religion, politics, and the judicial system team up to ensure the imbalance of power remains in effect, and Kolya's belief in the system slowly evaporates. It's particularly interesting to note how his consumption of Vodka evolves from a shot glass to full bottles as his home slips away.<br><br>The story takes place in northwest Russia in the Kola Peninsula of the Barents Sea. It's a dramatic setting with vast landscapes, including the carcasses of fishing boats and giant whales  a statement of what happens to those left behind as times change – much like what happens to Kolya.<br><br>As dramatic as the landscape is, the story is actually quite small. It's the struggle of one family against a system that has corruption down to a science. When Kolya asks his lawyer friend Dmitri (Vladimir Vdovitschenkov) to play dirty with the Mayor, he has no idea how this will impact his life and that of his younger wife Lilya (Elena Lyadova) and son Roma (Sergey Pokhodaev). <br><br>There is very little comic relief in the film  only a single sequence involving target practice on pictures of past Russian officials, but the story and acting are so grounded that at times it feels much like a documentary. It's always a bit of a cold slap to be reminded of how the righteous often struggle with injustice, but rarely will you see it better presented than this.","user":"ferguson-6","rank":[78,114]}]
