[{"title":"Very bad!","rating":14,"date":"14 May 2018","review":"I'm usually not interested in this kind of movie. I watched it because there are two actors in the cast that I know, we were together in two short films. The film is produced by a company named Picture Perfect, but it is far from what can be called perfect. In fact, it's exactly the opposite, everything is very bad, a waste of time for everyone.","user":"RodrigAndrisan","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"24 May 2018","review":"School plays are much better. The characters suck at acting, their lines were really predictable and the setting really poor.","user":"mrbr-35629","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"awful, terrible....","rating":1,"date":"28 May 2018","review":"How did these so called film-makers get the money to make this tripe?...honestly my 5 year old has more talent...please DO NOT make a film again!!!
