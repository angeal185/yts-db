[{"title":"It's for kids, but it still had me belly laughing!","rating":8,"date":"30 July 2019","review":"I've always found HH amusing on the telly box, by 8 year old twin girls love it, so I'm often in the room when it's on.<br><br>I wasn't sure what to expect from it's move to the cinema, but I went with an open mind.<br><br>It's got a very strong cast from Britain's sitcom/tv drama/stand up stable, and it's had a very clever script written for it too. There are many, I suppose Easter eggs, in there some obvious, some not so, but I found them funny and clever.<br><br>Ok so some of the humour is a bit toilet based, but so is most British humour! It's very similar to some of the better Carry On films, obviously without the cruder humour.<br><br>It's got a bit of a slating on here, which to be honest I found a bit sad. Do yourself, and your kids a favour and on a rainy day this holidays go see it!","user":"winspb","rank":[21,30]},{"title":"Kids loved it, adults didn't.","rating":5,"date":"31 July 2019","review":"We are huge horrible histories fans in our house. This fell short of our expectations as adults. Missing the original cast and the format of the TV show which makes it all so funny. Seemed at parts to be taking itself a little too seriously, which makes it disconnected to both the TV show and the books which are very much tongue in cheek humour and light-hearted and fun.<br><br>The cast that were in it were good, but just not from the TV show. History facts were accurate. Storyline was minimal and not offensive.<br><br>However, my kids did enjoy it and my 6 year old was engrossed.","user":"julia-mcphail","rank":[18,26]},{"title":"Very impressed, good transition from TV to film","rating":7,"date":"6 August 2019","review":"As someone who watched the show growing up, I had high expectations for the film due to the nostalgia I have from the show and I have to say the expectations were met.<br><br>The humour has not changed at all even if the cast did, (however there are some notable people to look out for if you grew up on BBC/CBBC shows. The transition from being a sketch show to film was well done and as always you learn a surprising about the Roman Empire, Boudica's uprising and Celtic Britain.<br><br>If you enjoyed the show you'll enjoy the film but if your tastes are a bit more high brow I suggest you give this one a skip.","user":"alex284","rank":[13,18]}]
