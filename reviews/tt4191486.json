[{"title":"So cliched!","rating":2,"date":"2 October 2019","review":"I guess my review is pretty the opposite of the one other review here.\nI found the visuals of this movie to be intriguing -- I'm always drawn to visually innovative movies. But the people who create these visually innovative movies, frequently don't appreciate that even the best visuals can't prop up a bad story.<br><br>And this is a bad story! From the first few minute intro your heart sinks as you hear one damn cliche after another.<br><br>No thanks! Everyone involved should have stuck to a short!\nOr admitted that they didn't know what they were doing, and befriended someone capable of creating a story more sophisticated than what a tween could write.<br><br>Compare with the movie 9, also visually innovative, but at least the story wasn't awful from the first minute. Or compare with the Aardman movies (or Pixar), where the every bit as much effort goes into the story as into the visuals.","user":"name99-92-545389","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Boring","rating":3,"date":"7 August 2019","review":"I mean, the story itself is not too bad but those moving dolls... really??","user":"nikolamdc","rank":[1,10]},{"title":"Interested","rating":1,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"Watching now will update after I finish.
