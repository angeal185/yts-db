[{"title":"Not a bad first full-length feature film by UK's Carl Strathie","rating":6,"date":"5 December 2018","review":"This is Carl Strathie's 7th film he's written and directed - all shorts, this being his first full length feature film.<br><br>This is not a big budget Hollywood blockbuster production, and thus I'll rate it accordingly as a low budget international film by a amateur film maker.<br><br>I will say that Steven Ogg's performance was excellent considered he lacked direction from a seasoned director.<br><br>The S/VFX although rudimentary, was actually decent with beautiful cinematography inside the capsule and of the sun.<br><br>The score was too loud and annoyingly excessive for the most part.<br><br>Carl Strathie's directing was really good, capturing some tense moments, but his writing is still stuck in the 'short film' mode. This film had overly extended scenes that dragged on way too long. The pacing was also way to slow. The length of 92 mins for this film needed to be edited down and sped up the pace to a maximum of 60-70 mins. Had this film been substantially edited down to a short film, it would have been a winner.<br><br>Nevertheless, still not bad for his first attempt, but could have been much better if Carl stuck to the directing, and passed his story onto a seasoned screenwriter who could have filled in the blanks.<br><br>Would I see it again? No. Would I recommend it? Only to die-hard sci-fi fans that have nothing better to watch on a Sunday afternoon. No worthy of all the 1/10 haters, and not even close to the fake 10/10's, but certainly worthy of a 6/10.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[40,46]},{"title":"No end! 90mins of my life I won't get back.","rating":10,"date":"10 March 2019","review":"Well this an ok film, but it missed a whole bunch of tricks and twists- like what was being tested when the accident happened, what happened to the prototype sun suits mentioned at the beginning... They would have been handy at the end, and what was the true status of conditions aboard the Hathor. Why spend the whole time trying to speak to the commander when there was apparently nothing significant to say to him and finally, when connected home at last...( In the middle of a rescue manoeuvre really???) again apparently have nothing to say! The worst thing though is that there is no ending. The film builds to a rescue attempt and just stops in the middle of it!\nYes the filming was good, effects great but insufficient story and lack of any kind of closure means that this is an hour 30min of my life I won't get back.","user":"mjcarter73","rank":[24,32]},{"title":"Slow burn baby, slow burn.","rating":7,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"Solis.<br><br>This movie covers old ground in a new way. You can't help but feel for Holloway's desperation as his life pod hurtles thru space towards the sun. From the outset Holloway gives off an air of brashness but that literally dissolves as his plight becomes all too clear to him.<br><br>I found this movie to be a real 'slow burn' as the story progresses and grips with the voice of Alice Lowe being the glimmer of hope that underlines the despondency felt.<br><br>Yes this is low budget but the production values are very high and give that it's sci-fi, the story is so very 'human' that it negates the need for CGI on a blockbuster scale as that would distract from the narrative.<br><br>Solis. Well worth watching!","user":"garylawrence","rank":[13,16]}]
