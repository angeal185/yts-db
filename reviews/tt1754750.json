This is a fast paced 'girl gets even' film that holds without being dated. A beautiful lady is charmed away by a smooth talking gangster - 'I'm the man of your dreams'. She becomes his captive and her final revenge, planned in the bath with his ex, is worth waiting for. Sensual, hot strokes abound with a good redeeming climax. The likable stars all perform brilliantly and the pace is suave, the editing &amp; direction is enjoyable. A delight to see Margot Kidder again. This is a feel good evening flick that delivers with a want more. More from this director.","user":"shhhhenterprises","rank":[4,9]},{"title":"Intrigue, danger, revenge","rating":7,"date":"29 March 2020","review":"Intrigue, danger, revenge, and a wild surprise twist.
