Lost, Lost, Lost is one of his most well-known films, and is an interesting montage-esque autobiography.  The footage was shot over several decades, and many shots have a very home-movie feel to them.  Some shots are quite beautiful and thought provoking, but there doesn't seem to be much continuity throughout the film, which left me disoriented and dissatisfied with many sections.","user":"Mary-18","rank":[15,27]},{"title":"just saying","rating":4,"date":"4 November 2019","review":"This is just a response to tasataskitasana.
