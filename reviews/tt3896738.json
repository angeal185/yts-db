[{"title":"Couple of monsters.","rating":8,"date":"9 May 2017","review":"Great movie about horrific stuff. There ya go. Evelyn and John cruise Perth school yards, fishing for teenage girls with friendly Aussie banter and car ride offers. The pleasantries end right there.<br><br>As the secret predator couple in the neighbourhood, Emma Booth and Stephen Curry are spectacular in their complicated performances. Charming and congenial, slick and methodical, brutal and sadistic, vulnerable and suspicious; all bases are covered. \"Hounds of Love\" is about serial sexual homicide, and it is as brutal as that sounds. Not in an exploitative manner (most of the cruelty is off screen), but in its believable depiction of perversion, and the matter of fact execution by the monsters.<br><br>Sporting a cheesy mustache, Curry presents a tiny, unassuming wimp - he is humiliated and berated about money owing. Yet deep inside he is a tight wound ball of explosion, and the creepy manipulator of all crimes. Evelyn is a more than wiling accomplice, but she has a wounded past, shows some semblance of sympathy, and is thus the weak link in the monster couple. How all this plays out in the most recent triangle is expertly framed by newbie filmmaker Ben Young. <br><br>\"Hounds of Love\" is a difficult watch, but it's also difficult to ignore.","user":"js-66130","rank":[59,68]},{"title":"Never talk to strangers!!!!","rating":15,"date":"15 May 2017","review":"\"Never talk to strangers. If someone ever tries to take you, fight with everything you have.\" â€• Lisa Unger, Ink and Bone<br><br>Young writer-director Ben Young must have watched Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs at least once because his Hounds of Love has earmarks of brilliant thriller/horror ultimately hinging on character and not blood. Young even introduces his film by observing that the real terror comes from what is not seen.<br><br>Much of this film, set in Perth, Australia, at Christmas time, 1987, is about the idea of a psychotic couple abducting and killing young women who happen to be stupid enough to get in the car of strangers. I say \"idea\" because once the girl is chained to a bed, the couple begins to reveal their psychoses, almost exclusively about the loss of children in their lives. <br><br>Although John White (Stephen Curry) does most of the physical heavy lifting as he abuses the girl, his partner, Evelyn (Emma Booth), is the tormented one and the object of abducted teen Vicki's (Ashleigh Cummings) campaign to drive a wedge between the two. The home and neighborhood is working class Perth, where similar events actually happened; the atmosphere is joyless living, not impoverished, just not nourished by the better angels of culture.<br><br>As the film moves assuredly to the climax, the characters' arcs move toward their deserved fate: Vicki shows a presence her initial bratty teen side did not evidence, John becomes more vulnerable because he is visceral rather than cerebral, and Evelyn struggles with her desire to have her children back in her life and her desire to be loved by John.<br><br>The title, Hounds of Love, ingeniously plays off the couple's dog and everyone's hunt for love, even Vicki's wounded but intrepid mother. Yes, life can have its moments of horror beyond the terrors of abuse and abduction. <br><br>Hounds of Love is meaty film from a talented filmmaker and a delight to see in a summer sure to be filled with explosions not of the mind.","user":"jdesando","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"Autistic reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.","rating":10,"date":"12 May 2017","review":"\"Vicki Maloney is randomly abducted from a suburban street by a disturbed couple. As she observes the dynamic between her captors she quickly realizes she must drive a wedge between them if she is to survive.\" <br><br>Let us start off by saying that the second this movie starts (slow motion effects) it immediately lets you know you are in for a very unsettling, uncomfortable and disturbing movie. The movie slowly introduces us to each character bit by bit. The main focus is Vicki and her horrible relationship with her Mother. But within the first 20 mins the story wastes no time in getting really tense. <br><br>The acting was absolutely brilliantly played by everyone involved. This would not have been an easy role for Ashley Cummings to play Vicki, the girl who went through and goes through hell. Stephen Curry does a great job at playing the childish, yet ringleader of as John White. While he may be skinny and not looking so tough...trust us...actions speak louder than words. And while he maybe childish he is a leader and one not to be messed with, especially if he loses his temper. Last but not least...Emma Booth. She seriously gives an Oscar Worthy Performance here. Her role is so powerful, and yet so terrifying and horrible and disturbed that she is twice as bad as John (Stephen Curry). At times you feel sorry for her then she does the unthinkable! I doubt it will happen but Emma Booth truly deserved an Oscar for this role if the movie gets more recognition, because it's her best role yet. A truly terrifying villain. <br><br>Newcomer Ben Young does excellent as this is his first feature Film, and he is off to a magnificent start. While people may complain that this is a student film and it's incredibly low budget...try to look beyond that and see just how disturbing and terrifying and uncomfortable this film will make you feel. Me and Nick (The Autistic Reviewers) wouldn't recommend it to the faint of heart, because so many people would be offended over a film like this. It's a great movie, but only see it if you have a high pain tolerance. 5/5 stars.","user":"autisticreviewers","rank":[45,61]}]
