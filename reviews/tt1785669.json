[{"title":"Worst movie in ages","rating":1,"date":"13 October 2013","review":"\"Vikingdom\", the title had the word \"Viking\" on it and being a Viking movie fan I just had to see it.<br><br>What can I say? Worst computer generated graphics I ever saw, the movie is all made with computer landscapes/scenery and that could be good if well made (\"300\", \"Sword of Xanten\") but it failed miserably.<br><br>The color palette seems to only have 3 colors at times, red, greed and white. The actors seem to have been cut down from paper (yes, it is that bad).<br><br>That could fit the main actor role Dominic Purcell since he has the acting skills of a cardboard, or should I say a piece of wood. I noticed this in previous movies of him and this one just confirms it.<br><br>Also, whats up with the native American look? I can't decide if I'm seeing a native American playing a viking, or if they tried to give him some kind of a ridiculous \"Conan the Barbarian\" look.<br><br>Speaking of looks, what's up with Thor with his plastic hammer? Surprisingly Thor plays the part of the bad guy here (constantly in bad temper) but he wears a plastic hammer and has the strength of a normal guy. In fact his strength either is capable of blowing up doors (dynamite style) or he wrestles the main actor in a equal match...<br><br>Thor's hammer is famous in myth and history of being a magical object that ONLY Thor could lift.... how come the main character can lift it in the end? The film is a constant mess, ridiculous characters, ridiculous plot and scenery, the movie editing is confusing to say the least, fake bears in some cuts, a dragon with just a head and legs (no budget for the body?), Asian guys kicking around, total garbage.<br><br>Special effects looks like animated gifs, editing looks like it was made by a 5 year old, I couldn't stop but laugh all the way till It wasn't funny anymore and I had to fast forward on many scenes.<br><br>This is an insult to every Viking movie ever made and to Viking culture.<br><br>Actually this is more an insult to cinema than anything else.<br><br>Avoid like the PLAGUE.","user":"davish_wulf-1","rank":[95,126]},{"title":"I liked it","rating":7,"date":"16 February 2014","review":"I have always been into fantasy and i really enjoyed this movie. I was going into it expecting it to be a terrible movie but they actually did a good job with what they used and how they used it in the movie. I can't understand at all someone giving this movie a 1 out of a 10 saying it's the worst movie they seen. Who ever gives this a 1 hasn't seen a lot of movies, on top of that the few movies they have probably seen have been only Oscar winners and 300 million dollar budget Hollywood block busters. I could never call this a bad movie, I've seen 10's or thousands of movies and i can tell ya, I have seen some 1 out of 10 truly bad movies in my life time, but this one I give them credit for putting the work they put into it with what they had to make it into what looked like they were most shooting for. A wild viking fantasy with sword play, fighting and magic. Yes there are a hell of a lot better movies but i was pleasantly surprised and cheered me up on a sick night. You just have to accept it for what it is.","user":"nemisis_0","rank":[31,45]},{"title":"Not worth the time","rating":1,"date":"14 October 2013","review":"Low cost set, no effects, BUT you made me laugh about the \"dragon\" that looks like a paper mache tadpole. I just wasted my time watching this movie. REALLY This is the first rubbish film i watch in 2013!<br><br>The movie is trying to disgrace THOR? FTW? i just recently heard it came from malaysia? I really can't understand how did the film cost up to $15million, It certainly looks a LOW BUDGET FILM.<br><br>You will laugh if you visit youtube trailer. THE COMMENTS ARE DISABLED lols wonder why? I BET to many negative comments they can't handle :P<br><br>Don't watch don't download don't waste your time please its a very frustrating movie.<br><br>p.s. actors looks like they are on steroids or something","user":"allemailhere","rank":[51,78]}]
