[{"title":"Disturbing","rating":6,"date":"15 July 2019","review":"Well filmed and acted and a very strange story - where is this meant to be set as I certainly haven't seen this sort of place in the USA and in what year as it seems to be a futuristic movie or just trying to be different.<br><br>I must admit I always find movies in which women are used and abused quite disturbing and this one leaves a particularly bad taste in the mouth and does not really have many redeeming features!<br><br>I suppose you could say it does illustrate what is going on in the world but it has been done many times before and this film really gives nothing new and although it is well acted the story really goes nowhere - pretty average fair!","user":"omendata","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Way better than expected","rating":7,"date":"11 February 2020","review":"Is it a stellar film? No, but it's way better than I expected. Good acting, good action, interesting enough plot, effectively disturbing at times. Some plot holes but solid indy thriller.","user":"machi712-835-648661","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Good movie!","rating":9,"date":"11 February 2020","review":"Wtf is with the bad reviews?!
