[{"title":"Your suffering won't last long","rating":1,"date":"9 November 2018","review":"First let me just say that I was happy to discover this \"film\" is not a ripoff of Dan Curtis's 1976 classic Burnt Offerings. This movie is just bad, bad acting, bad story and a musical score so bad it alone will make you want to switch this turkey off. The only good thing is that it's just 73 minutes long.","user":"andreask-07174","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Please for the love of God don't watch it","rating":1,"date":"9 November 2018","review":"Only watched this because it was only 74 minutes long and i didn't have a lot of time, the trailer made it look like it was supernatural, which it is not. So trust me it's still a waste of time despite only being 74 minutes long.","user":"armadilla17","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE","rating":1,"date":"12 October 2018","review":"Horrible movie .
