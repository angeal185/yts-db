[{"title":"Well, this is the first time this year I said \"Wtf was that?\"","rating":1,"date":"4 November 2016","review":"\"The past can define our future. But I won't let it.\"<br><br>The opening scene of this sci-fi horror was promising. Even better, it was a snapshot that instantly caught my attention. A sublime and fascinating scene after which I snuggled in my cozy chair in anticipation for something magnificent. I was immediately convinced that this was going to be a hell of a movie. What did you expect? With a score like that on IMDb, this couldn't go wrong. The frozen image of a puzzled looking girl smeared with blood, seamlessly merged with a TV-show where we get the melancholic picture of a generation with no future. The education system needs to be changed so a new generation of intelligent young kids is being produced instead of a generation of obese and hopeless youngsters . The images looked futuristic with a suitable graphic design. And then the flashy google glass lookalike is introduced. A gadget we'll be watching through the rest of the film.<br><br>Just recently I've seen \"Jeruzalem\" where they used the same kind of glasses. A disappointing film though. The only feat I was excited about was that high-tech device. Unfortunately this facet of \"Let's be evil\" became a rather annoying element to me. Even worse. I got so sick of it that I wanted to give up already halfway the movie. The rickety soundtrack was perhaps an omen. Admit it. If you want to create a futuristic movie, you shouldn't be using those stale Jean Michelle-Jarre polyphonic sounds. It felt as if I was watching a third-rate SF from the 80s. Unfortunately these weren't the only disturbing elements. When the end credits rolled over the screen I made my final conclusion. This was probably the worst thing I've seen this year.<br><br>First, the overall picture you get to see almost the whole movie. The fact that it all happens in a virtual environment (the three selected candidates can only see by making use of the spectacles) was at first an exciting and interesting display. It all looked great and well-known (especially for those who sometimes sit behind a screen to have fun with some PC games), but it has one major drawback. After half an hour of hazy and swirling images, you gradually start to hate it. Biggest advantage is that a not so talented cameraman with virtually no experience gets away with it when some blurry and out of focus fragments appear in between. Combine this with a dark underground bunker where the lighting consists of pulsating lights in all sorts of colors and your irritation level is reached very quickly. It looked as if the whole story was set in a concrete submarine.<br><br>And then you have the actors who were recruited based on some unknown requirements and who are participating in the Posterity Project. Judging from the conversations they have, the requirements concerning the level of intelligence needed for this job wasn't very high. Their ultimate function is to observe the group of teenagers that are also present in this underground facility (spending their days waving their hands in the air). And when necessary they accompany a lost teenager back to the group. Not exactly intriguing and exciting. The fact that the group of children organize a sort of artificial uprising afterwards in which they manipulate the electronic system in an incomprehensible way, was the start of a confusing outcome and a ridiculous denouement.<br><br>Finally, the part that frustrated me the most. I had no idea what the theme of this movie was about. And in the end, I still didn't know it. Perhaps it's me getting older and a mild version of dementia sneaked in my system, but I couldn't make head nor tail of it. What was the opening sequence about and how did this correlate with the rest of the movie? And the end didn't clarify anything either. In a subtle way they tried to demonstrate the dangers of technologies and the way it's intertwined in our everyday lives. Kind of obvious. But eventually I still had a few questions about the film. Occasionally I like to watch a sophisticated film with a not so simple story line. But this was a level too high for me apparently. I suggest however that the creators of the IMDb website check their algorithms, because the score given to \"Let's be Evil\" is totally irrational. Or was there an artificial intervention by the makers of this movie? Well, that's a spooky thought!<br><br>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT","user":"peterp-450-298716","rank":[88,97]},{"title":"Don't waste you time","rating":2,"date":"13 December 2016","review":"Seen this movie on Netflix it looked interesting. I came here to IMDb to find out a bit more info on it and noticed it's high rating and stupidly gave it a go.<br><br>DO NOT BE FOOLED LIKE ME!!!!!! A lot of inflated ratings of 10 but this movie is rubbish. Basically the entire movie 3 idiots walk up and down a corridor with weird flashing lights and trying to act scared. I had no care if they lived or died in fact I wanted them all to die so this movie could finally end. Not really anything I can say that is actually good about the movie it had me somewhat amused for a while it's not scary and it is not even in the least bit thrilling or suspenseful.<br><br>I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I hope in writing this you will save yourself precious time and watch something worthwhile","user":"Badsharkmoviefan_118","rank":[104,119]},{"title":"Lots of Unrealistic Votes?","rating":2,"date":"27 October 2016","review":"I don't know how this gets an 8.5. I looked a few weeks ago and it was 4 out of ten. It's terrible! Very low budget, awful cast and writing. The direction, well, it's poor at best. I'd urge everyone to watch this for as long as you can take it, then vote HONESTLY what you think about it. The vast majority of votes gave it a 10 out of 10. I just don't get it! There are far superior 'horror' movies out there's that struggle to get over 5/10 so I'm flabbergasted. This is literally one of the poorest attempts at horror or even psychological thriller out there. Not sure if this is a spoiler or not, but this movie sure spoiled my afternoon and robbed me of a couple of hours I won't get back!","user":"moviegoermagician","rank":[48,56]}]
