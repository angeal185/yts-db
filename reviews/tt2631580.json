[{"title":"I Guess Tim Burton Was Involved","rating":4,"date":"4 September 2019","review":"The only positive I can think of is the outlandish cheapness of this, which probably wasn't cheap at all. It's an attack on flying sauces made of various tin cans and things by a pet dog. It's only two minutes long and that's as it should be.","user":"Hitchcoc","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Really not needed","rating":4,"date":"16 October 2015","review":"\"Captain Sparky vs. The Flying Saucers\" is a little add-on to Tim Burton's \"Frankenweenie\" and it shows us how Victor Frankenstein plays with his dog. The latter has to save the world in this scenario and, of course, he succeeds. I think this is a bonus feature on the DVD or Bluray, but it's not too popular, especially looking at how famous the movie was. So yeah, maybe it would have been more known if Burton had directed it as well. At least, it was done by people who also worked on the \"real\" movie. Charlie Tahan also speaks the character of Victor Frankenstein again. Still, I must say this is only a recommended watch for huge fans of the movie. Everybody else is not missing much as it adds basically nothing of value to the franchise. Thumbs down.","user":"Horst_In_Translation","rank":[2,5]}]
