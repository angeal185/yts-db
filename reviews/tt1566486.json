[{"title":"How can you not love this stuff?","rating":7,"date":"16 January 2011","review":"I don't get the negative reviews, I thought it was fun. I mean, it's about a monster living in a mountain, what are you expecting?!?! It had better characters than \"2012\" and better story and effects than a ton of the Syfy movies. It says on this page the budget was $1.3 million whereas Avatar's budget was over $300 million! How much can you do for that little? Would've loved to see more of the behemoth at the end, reviewer was right about that. A lot of build up to very little screen time. Would love to have seen it break free and crush the town! Cast was good with what they had to work with. I got a kick out of it. The monster was awesome (when it finally showed up)!","user":"NYCinemalover","rank":[32,46]},{"title":"Predictable, but still fun","rating":3,"date":"16 January 2011","review":"No surprises here and fun if you play the \"Cliché Game\": Watch the movie and try to count the clichés. 1 point for standard cliché, 5 points for ridiculous. I lost count after about 500 points.<br><br>This is pretty much standard made-for-TV movie fare. With the predictable moments fighting it out with the ridiculous moments for top prize.<br><br>One of my favorite \"what the BLEEP\" moments was when the Sheriff finally decides to believe the \"experts\" and evacuate the town all he says to the townsfolk is, \"Grab your stuff and get out of town!\" Since the town is so small, \"out of town\" is about 200 yards away. Not a lot of help...<br><br>The actors do their best with a horrible script but, as another reviewer stated, the women for the most part stand there screaming, \"What's happening!!\" over and over. There is a character named Zoe that you really want to slap repeatedly after 2 or 3 scenes...<br><br>Watch this for an excellent lesson on how to make a really bad movie!","user":"krohach","rank":[19,26]},{"title":"Disappointing ... I expected better from this cast","rating":2,"date":"17 January 2011","review":"There are B movies that are good, cheesy fun and then there are B movies like \"Behemoth.\" Given that I've seen most of these actors in other shows, and all have them been pretty good ... especially Ed Quinn who plays the lead ... I was expecting more from this film.<br><br>I was dismayed and disappointed when most of the acting was wooden ... almost like Tippy Hedron watching the the line of fire at the end of \"The Birds.\" The dialogue was stilted, the timing was off and basically, \"Behemoth\" left me scratching my head.<br><br>For example, Ed Quinn, who is pretty darn awesome as Nathan Stark in \"Eureka,\" seemed like he was sleep walking through this movie. On top of that, the plot was predictable, the action was less than exciting and the climax was almost anti-climactic. Unless you just can't resist watching yet another over-sized monster movie, I'd recommend you pass on this one.","user":"carma-953-518986","rank":[15,22]}]
