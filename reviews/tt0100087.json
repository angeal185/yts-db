[{"title":"\"If we have a nuclear war, the only remaining living thing will be houseguests\"!!","rating":30,"date":"30 August 2000","review":"Ah,Madhouse. One of those great movies yours truly can't get enough of. I saw this movie in theaters when I was 11, and it has gotten better with every viewing. The jokes in this movie are hilarious and well-placed. John Laroquette and Kirsty Alley are magnificent in their roles as Mark and Jesse Bannister. They are two,happily married people who have it mad in the shade until Mark's cousin Fred comes to visit on his vacation. Oh, he also brings his wife Bernice and the cat Scruffy. Circumstances beyond their control lead to them staying longer than expected,and this leads to everyone shacking up at the Bannister's like it was a Holiday Inn. Soon,Jesse's sister Claudia and her son Jonathen,and the neighbors all live in the same house,while managing to drive Mark and Jesse out of their ^&amp;%*ing minds. In the end, they manage to stand up against the terror that is their family and friends. *Some of the funniest moments include Jesse's interview segments,the cat and its ability to rise from the ashes,and Mark's scene at the end where his boss attempts to give him a raise.* All,in all a 9 out of 10. Also watch for Monday Night Football's Dennis Miller in a bit part.","user":"teenwolf97","rank":[18,19]},{"title":"Why oh Why isn't this on DVD yet?","rating":10,"date":"24 March 2012","review":"If you're not a John Larroquette fan nor a fan or Kirstie Alley at her heyday, don't bother to read on. But if you loved John in Night Court and Kirstie in Cheers, you're in for a treat.<br><br>This is the best of both of them. And as a couple they really work - the chemistry, the timing, everything. Tom Ropelewski really hit it out of the park in writing and directing this. So many great quotes, so many great characters, and subplots that all come back together at the end.<br><br>I've always heard, in writing school, that if you want us to care about a character or laugh at a character, keep making things fall apart for him/her. Well, I've seldom seen things fall apart so many times in a row. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse...it gets worse. Over and over.<br><br>Sure, it's as dated as a film could be for its era. The clothes, hair, music, everything. But nobody could play it better. Nobody.<br><br>It's a bit PG in a couple of places, where there's a bit of foreplay and one racy part where Kirstie starts to strip, but my 10 and 13 year olds haven't been grossed and they think it's hysterical.<br><br>Just showed it to a friend that's 36 (another writer) and he loved it.<br><br>So-o-o-o...why isn't this out on DVD yet, when so many people are clamoring for it? I'd sure buy it!","user":"writer8008","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"This is one cool comedy!","rating":19,"date":"19 January 2000","review":"This was one hilarious movie to begin the 90's.  I've always been a fan of John Larroquette since he appeared on Night Court. This movie rocks!  And I was just a pre-teen kid when I saw this in the theater, and it's still funny to me now that I'm an adult!<br><br>It's about John Larroquette and Kirsty Alley playing these yuppies who have some relatives visiting, and then before we know it, practically the whole neighborhood becomes their houseguests!  Also the news interviews were amusing, too!<br><br>So, if you're in a mood for a screwball comedy from this past decade, you're in for a ride with this one!  I highly recommend it!","user":"wishkah7","rank":[15,17]}]
