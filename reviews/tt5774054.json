The acting was TERRIBLE, there was way to much makeup on the girl at all times, there was absolutely no plot what so ever, and there were long periods of time where nothing would happen. The only cute part was the dolphin, and they were trying to shoot it. I am shocked in how this actually made it to being a movie. BAD MOVIE ALERT!","user":"alwurtele","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Good Family Movie","rating":5,"date":"19 July 2019","review":"Although the acting was not A list it still was a good family movie to watch with your kids. Nothing objectable. I'd watch it again.","user":"kmediallc","rank":[3,3]}]
