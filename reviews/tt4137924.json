[{"title":"Monster High: Haunted","rating":4,"date":"13 July 2015","review":"The story is so bad that I wasn't sure if I was watching a rip-off of Monster High or that Monster High was just a punchline in this movie. The animation is fine and I do love the colors the animators put effort to, but the characters are mostly either not like what they were before or the ones that are smart enough are just too mean spirited. The setting is alright, but the plot is just too idiotic to be considered a Monster High movie. Ones who don't know anything about Monster High, do not watch this movie, that's all. I would give the story 3/10 due to being just stupid or mean spirited, animation 7/10 for mostly colors and motion, and characters 3/10 for not even trying.","user":"paigehebertph","rank":[0,4]}]
