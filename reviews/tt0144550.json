[{"title":"Amazingly lighthanded telling of infuriating Pentagon bureaucraticinfighting","rating":10,"date":"9 October 2000","review":"The story itself--the crazy process whereby a simple request for an improved armored personnel carrier resulted in the ridiculous initial design for the Bradley transport--is one that should be well-known.  It is the ultimate cautionary tale about a bureaucracy gone out of control.  What is amazing is the light-handed skill with which the story is told--it is funny when it should be, yet sucks you in sufficiently to get you really mad at what is going on.  And the casting is superb.","user":"kakilliany","rank":[43,43]},{"title":"Comedy or horror?","rating":28,"date":"28 January 1999","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, especially Kelsey Grammar as the unflappable general - always ready with a quick answer and so sincere you want to believe him, despite the utter absurdity of what he is saying.  I am not sure whether to treat this movie as comedy or horror - it would be quite amusing as fiction , but I find it rather terrifying to think that it is based on a true story.  Is this really how our tax dollars are wasted?  As a former member of the military I find it all too easy to believe.","user":"NCYankee","rank":[35,36]},{"title":"kinda scary how dead-on accurate this movie is...","rating":2,"date":"2 March 2003","review":"i first saw this movie well before coming into the military, and while i found it very entertaining, didn't fully appreciate it.  having now been 3 years in, i can very much appreciate the humor of this fantastic satire. granted, there is a fair amount of hyperbole, and no, not everyone in the military is so very inept... but simply put, a few years working with military intellegence elevates my view of this film quite a bit.","user":"koolduck23","rank":[28,30]}]
