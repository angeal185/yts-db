[{"title":"GODZILLA FINAL WARS: The Big G goes out with a big bang","rating":25,"date":"25 June 2005","review":"GODZILLA FINAL WARS may not please Godzilla purists but it delivers the goods for everybody elseat least those with some knowledge of Godzilla lore. I saw it with a packed house of G fans at Subway Cinema's annual New York Asian Film Festival and it was the perfect audience for a film as steeped in the kaiju mythos as this one. Every time a new monster appeared on screen the crowd applauded or, rather, they applauded once that monster became recognizable, since the director often teases us with quick cuts and blurry motion before giving us a good, steady full-body shot. There are 15 monsters in all, many friendly old faces and some obscure ones, but all recognizable to longtime Godzilla fans.<br><br>The other real pleasure for G fans is the star-studded cast. Three venerable stars of older kaiju films turn up, two in major roles. Akira Takarada (star of the original GODZILLA, 1954) plays the UN Secretary General and Kumi Mizuno (the gorgeous leading lady from MONSTER ZERO, FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD, WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS and more) plays the Commander of the Earth Defense Force. In a smaller role, Kenji Sahara turns up in a lab coat assisting the attractive young female biologist (Rei Kikukawa) assigned to investigate the monster attacks. Also on hand are Jun Kunimura (Boss Tanaka in KILL BILL VOL. 1); Kane Kosugi, a martial arts star in his own right and son of \"ninja\" star Sho Kosugi; and one other gorgeous actress, Maki Mizuno, who plays the biologist's newscaster sister. Masahiro Matsuoka plays Ozaki, the lead mutant hero who uses MATRIX-style martial arts to fight the alien invaders. Don Frye plays the tough American captain who pilots the Gotengo (the flying, burrowing ship from ATRAGON) and stands up to the aliens in several memorable confrontations. A martial artist/wrestler/extreme fighter known primarily in Japan, Frye speaks all his lines in English in the Japanese print I saw, while everyone else speaks Japanese to him.<br><br>The film's all-star monster cast and alien invasion plot seem derived chiefly from DESTROY ALL MONSTERS (1968), but with everything pumped up to hyper speed. The film is incredibly fast-paced and filled with action, either in the form of battles between monsters or martial arts fights/ray-gun shootouts between the human and mutant defenders and the alien invaders. Since the monsters attack numerous cities around the world (including New York, Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo--of course--and even Vancouver!) there turns out to be more mass destruction in this film than in all other G films combined.<br><br>One can argue that the whole production is sheer lunacy, but it's lunacy done with conviction and affection. The director clearly knows and loves Godzilla films and he conveys that love while also adding new twists and imaginative touches (e.g. Anguirus, the spike-covered ankylosaurus, curling up into a spiked ball to launch a rolling attack). One's overall reaction depends on any number of factors, but this should definitely be seen by all kaiju fans.","user":"BrianDanaCamp","rank":[43,47]},{"title":"Wow","rating":30,"date":"30 November 2004","review":"I think there is a tendency with hardcore Kaiju fans to forget that these movies should not be taken so seriously. They are never executed to perfection. There are always plot holes. There is always some sub-par acting. Some of the special effects always look a little weak. Get over it.<br><br>I also attended the world premier of Final Wars, and I would say this has to be the most exciting of them all. It takes a very similar sci-fi angle to Godzilla vs. Monster Zero and adds a dash of Matrix stylization while constantly bombarding you with fantastic Kaiju fight scenes.<br><br>I am not sure that \"Final Wars\" will see the same shelf-life as some of the older classic Godzilla flicks due to the fact that it is so action-oriented. This film is definitely not going to get the camp appreciation that so many older films do. However, if you are a Godzilla fan and want to see some absolutely fantastic battles along side an entertaining sci-fi plot, you will really enjoy this film.","user":"RAND0","rank":[56,67]},{"title":"A going away party worthy of a king!","rating":10,"date":"19 June 2005","review":"Somewhere between 1954 and today, Godzilla lost his meaning. Originally a symbol of nuclear destruction, foreboding and terrifying, Godzilla has played a number of roles, such as hero, villain, father, and everything in between. So it's only fitting that on his 50th birthday, and his retirement party, he gets to be a little of everything and pretend he's nothing all at the same time.<br><br>This is said to be Godzilla's final theatrical appearance, and like any big star stepping out of the lime-light, his presence will be felt long after he's gone. But instead of one last curtain call or final bow, the King of all monsters isn't walking away with grace and dignity- he's throwing the biggest monster-filled party you could possibly imagine. Now, to be fair, if you're a huge fan of Godzilla movies, there's a huge chance you won't like this film. However, as a devoted and loyal G-fan for the last two decades, I can only say this- WHAT A WAY TO GO OUT! <br><br>Helming the film is the amazing director Ryuhei Kitamura, director of such great cult classics as \"Versus\" and \"Azumi\". And, while he may seem an odd choice for a kaiju-director, he makes the best of everything he's got to use. His cast is excellent, especially Kazuki Kitamura as the X-Alien leader who damn near stole the show, or rather, he would have if he didn't have to compete with the worst, but greatest actor ever- Don Frye. The clichéd action hero of the group, Frye rocked out loud delivering such great one-liners as \"Listen Kid, there are two things you didn't know about the Earth. One's me, and the other's...Godzilla!\". Sure, all his lines are delivered terribly, but that didn't matter. He was just a cool-as-ice presence on the screen.<br><br>For the first since 1968's classic \"Destroy All Monsters\", the human characters actually seemed to matter in the film, doing more than just tracking monsters or building weapons. But, what about the monsters? Well, first of all, Kitamura breaks the \"most monsters in a single movie\" record set back in 1968 (over 12!) and brings back some of the fan favorites you've been dying to see again- King Caesar, Anguirus, Kumonga, and of course, the awesome cyber-kaiju, Gigan. The visuals in this movie are great, and the action is non-stop. The monster fights are stunning and cool, yet cheesy and campy at the same time. The suits (with the exception of maybe Caesar) are incredible, and Godzilla finally gets to trash monsters in the way we only imagined he could. Even Godzilla's adopted son Minilla (you know, the little aborted Godzilla fetus) gets some screen time that really makes you like the ugly little monster. <br><br>The story is simple- Aliens try to take over the world with giant monsters. But it's executed with such style and raw power that the old clichéd story works so well, and even takes the liberty to poke fun of itself when it doesn't (the word \"somehow\" seems to get tossed around a lot!). Think of it as a going away party for a friend- you invite everyone you know, they bring their friends, and they bring even more friends, things get a little out of control, and in the end you're not really sure what happened, but you know it was an awesome once-in-a-lifetime ride. That pretty much sums the film up.<br><br>All in all, I've never had more fun watching a Godzilla movie in my entire life. I don't know if Mr. Kitamura set out to make a great movie, but if his goal was to make the most entertaining film ever, then he succeeded and then some! <br><br>Long live the King!","user":"JermaineWarfare","rank":[24,27]}]
