[{"title":"\"Madam is the greatest star of all.\"","rating":4,"date":"4 August 1999","review":"Sunset Blvd. could be looked at as a thesis on what fame does to certain people.  For Norma Desmond, fame created a fantasy world that forever trapped her.  Living alone in that giant house on Sunset, save for her servant Max, Norma whiles away the hours planning her magnificent return. Her fame kept alive by fan letters, and her hope of return kindled by Joe Gillis.  For Norma, there is no other life than standing before cameras and acting out lives of characters that are larger than life.  Of course, no one knows who Norma Desmond is.  Gloria Swanson gives a magnificent performance. She runs from melancholy, to unbridled joy, to complete mental breakdown. William Holden is the ultimate cynic.  He plays Norma like a fiddle but gets ensnared in her web of decaying glory.  In the end, Joe pays the price for enduring Norma's insanity.  As she descends that staircase in the final scene, you can see that she is completely lost in her own world.  A world where no one grows old, where she is forever young, and where she is the greatest star of them all.  After all, stars never age.","user":"bat-5","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"A true Hollywood horror story","rating":10,"date":"15 March 2008","review":"Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite \"Salome\" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.<br><br>A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.<br><br>The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for \"Born Yesterday\" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical. A 10 all the way.<br><br>\"I am big--it's the pictures that got small\". \"All right Mr. deMille--I'm ready for my closeup\".","user":"preppy-3","rank":[62,73]},{"title":"Best Performance in Film History: Gloria Swanson","rating":10,"date":"11 January 2006","review":"The plot has been discussed at length in other comments.<br><br>To me SUNSET BOULEVARD has it all. The comedy is sly, the drama is of epic proportions because it's not JUST a story about Hollywood or an aging actress. It's really about the giving up of dreams.<br><br>Norma's dream of return, held to for 20 years, is ironic because Norma so closely parallels Gloria. That Norma cannot make a comeback in 1950 even with connections to DeMille is sad. The sadness is due to Norma's refusal to accept her aging or the politics of Hollywood that worship youth. It's ironic that Norma has no place in Hollywood (the parade has passed by) but DeMille is still working and in the scenes from Samson and Delilah we spot other old-timers like Henry Wilcoxon and Julia Faye--still working but not as STARS. The final irony here is that Gloria did make the comeback that Norma couldn't make.<br><br>Norma has a thing about STARS.... she says at one point... \"the stars are ageless.\" Well this is true in a filmic sense. I can still watch Gloria Swanson in THE LOVE OF SUNYA or MANHANDLED and yup, she is ageless. She is still twenty something. That screen image is forever held up like a bad mirror to the reality of being 50. On another occasion Norma says \"nobody leaves a STAR, that's what makes one a STAR.\" True again, but it's not just Gillis who is leaving Norma, her fans have already left. Hence if one is left, one cannot be a STAR.<br><br>Gillis also gives up his dream (temporarily) of being a writer, Max gives up his dream of directing, and even Betty gives up her dream of love with Gillis. Scary stuff.<br><br>The film is also about LOVE. Look what these people have done for love: love of another person or love of fame or whatever. Max loves Norma. Norma loves Gillis. Gillis loves Norma and Betty. Betty loves Gillis and Artie. Artie loves Betty. And all of them love Hollywood.<br><br>Everyone is crushed at the end of this film..... The scene of Max \"directing\" the scene as Norma descends the staircase is one of the all-time great scenes in a film. Norma's final speech, which sums up everything (\"there is nothing else\"), is devastating. Can she really be insane and make this lucid speech? If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her (a STAR)....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends (supposedly into madness) and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about \"being back\" and \"all those wonderful people out there in the dark\" (which of course includes us every time we watch the film).<br><br>I cannot think of any other film (possibly CITIZEN KANE) that works on so many different levels. And Gloria Swanson gives the greatest performance in film history!","user":"drednm","rank":[107,133]}]
