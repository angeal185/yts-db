[{"title":"Octavio Is A Bit Of A Mess","rating":4,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"This starts out intriguingly, with Rosanna Arquette's portrayal of the lead character's grasping and manipulating mother, but that only lasts 5 minutes or so and then once Sarah Gadon leaves to move into her dead father's house, and begins going out to strip bars in his clothes, the film pretty much falls off a cliff. <br><br>Gadon seems a fairly good actress but she makes THE most unconvincing cross-dressing 'man' imaginable. The idea that the gay guy she becomes involved with (and everyone else she meets) wouldn't be able to tell she's a girl is simply too ridiculous for the story to remain standing. The 'ghost story' stuff seems kinda patchy and random as well, and by the end the whole film is just a ragbag of implausible, disconnected and emotionally unconvincing scraps that add up to very little.<br><br>I think it was perhaps trying to show her discovering her father's hidden sexuality by walking in his actual footsteps or something, which could have been interesting if there had been a tighter hold on the material and a better use of the cinematic medium to depict that in a clear and compelling manner. But there wasn't, so it's a bit of a mess, really.","user":"Fiahm","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"I liked it!","rating":8,"date":"20 April 2019","review":"I liked it a lot but I also identify with the plight of the lead to try and figure out who she is on the inside and explore her sexuality. I think some of the low reviews are because the reviewers just 'don't get' the point of this movie.","user":"the_nephilim71","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Probably you have to be LGBT to get it","rating":10,"date":"9 February 2019","review":"Her father literally kept his sexuality in a closet Haha This movie is about the way that people experience each other and experience gender and sexuality in different contexts. Not all of the acting is amazing but it makes it feel real","user":"mamday","rank":[4,6]}]
