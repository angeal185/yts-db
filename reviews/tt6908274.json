[{"title":"Mirage","rating":10,"date":"12 February 2020","review":"I wasn't expecting this film to be so good. It's an understated thriller with a very good plot that keeps you wondering what will happen till the end. Great cast and very convincing acting, would highly recommend! It's been the best time travel film I've seen in a while","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[49,55]},{"title":"Oriol Paulo should have more worldwide recognition","rating":8,"date":"24 March 2019","review":"This is the 3rd movie i watch for the Catalan director, and man did he deliver another masterpiece.<br><br>The plot is genius and most importantly \"current\" coping with this age and so original. The script itself was tight and connected ,, and even thought it was a bit slow in the beginning but turns so helpful to clear things up before introducing the \"time lines change\" idea.<br><br>The cast were all perfect ,, from the lead Adriana Ugarte to Álvaro Morte (the guy from the Netflix show money heist) and Chino Darín and even the kid was really good.<br><br>Netflix knows where to invest ,, the other day i read that Steven Spielberg attacking Netflix that they shouldn't be on the Oscars and so on (After they won three Oscars for Roma by Alfonso Cuarón) .. My say in this was ... \"The future is now old man\" , Netflix knows whats worth spending money on ,, and they harvest what they planted.","user":"Aktham_Tashtush","rank":[120,158]},{"title":"This guy did it again!","rating":9,"date":"22 March 2019","review":"Fascinating concept built into a suspenseful story with exciting twists.<br><br>After The Body, The Invisible Guest, and now this, Oriol Paulo has become one of my faviourite directors. Just wonderful!<br><br>The ending is a bit weak, but nevertheless a highly fascinating and enjoyable ride!<br><br>As a movie this one is a solid 7/10 - 8/10, as a fan for both the genre and the director, I gave it 9/10.","user":"konporer","rank":[115,153]}]
