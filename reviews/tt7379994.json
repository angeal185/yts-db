[{"title":"Pleasantly surprised","rating":7,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"I had zero expectations going into this and actually found it to be very entertaining. It was cool seeing one of these types of movies with a middle aged mother as the lead character kicking people's asses. I really liked the concept too but wish that they showed more of what was happening outside of the suburbs on the red letter day. It felt like it went by too quickly but I enjoyed the film overall.","user":"Teddy-Bear-Picnic","rank":[27,40]},{"title":"A Wild and Gory Ride","rating":8,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"I had a blast with this film. The concept was interesting, the characters were goofy but loveable and the events unfolded in a natural but unpredictable way. It probably helped that the sibling relationship reminded me of me and my brother...<br><br>I was not expecting this film to get as gory and nasty as it did. The visual effects were awesome and I almost gagged during one moment. The filmmakers were likely working with a low budget but that didn't limit the amount of creativity on display. The camera work was always interesting, the fights were pretty cool and I was a huge fan of the old school score. I look forward to revisiting this one again with a group of friends.","user":"MrsOrange","rank":[26,40]},{"title":"Stupid plot and terrible acting","rating":3,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"The acting in this movie is so bad and the characters jump from one extreme to the other for no reason at all. The plot is like the purge but stupider because of the lack of reasoning for why everyone should killed who they have been assigned to in the letter...they just do it just because. The teen daughter is bad and who leaves her brother with someone who wants to murder him?? Just jumps out of the window and rolls out to kill the person assigned on her letter? The characters do other stupid things that logical people wouldn't do and overall this was just a lazy attempt at movie.","user":"michelleld-95349","rank":[13,18]}]
