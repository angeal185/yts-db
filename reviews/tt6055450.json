Go get a copy of football factory or I.D. Do not be fooled by the cover!!","user":"tylergerard","rank":[23,24]},{"title":"CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE!! How does this title even have a score over 5 stars?","rating":1,"date":"1 June 2018","review":"The most.... Cringiest film to come out of england this year. Cringe acting. Cringe cinematography, Cringe color correction, cringe editing, CRINGE EVERYTHING.<br><br>I was cringing from the very beginning. Don't be fooled by the cover of this film, which was well done, but holy crap. The film itself is cancer. I actually thought it was a satire comedy at the start. Those sound effects during the fighting scene at the start... Omg... cringed so hard my eyes caved in.<br><br>Avoid this movie at all costs!","user":"charleshowler","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"This is even worst than its title","rating":1,"date":"28 May 2018","review":"This movie is so bad that I wonder why it wasn't released on a VHS tape","user":"Wag669","rank":[22,26]}]
