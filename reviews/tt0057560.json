[{"title":"A change of scenery proves good for Tarzan","rating":6,"date":"6 February 2006","review":"It's surprising so few people have commented on this movie since it enjoyed a degree of success upon its original release and still qualifies as one of the better Tarzans. The plot follows the traditional pattern of a guide/protector leading a party through dangerous territory toward a sought-after destination. The guide/protector in this case is Tarzan who's come from Africa to parachute into an Asian kingdom that looks a lot like Thailand. His job is to escort Kashi, a boy who's been chosen as the \"Successor\" to the kingdom'e dying leader. The leader's evil brother, however, seeks power for himself and is determined to keep Kashi from reaching the city where his ordination will occur. The middle part of the movie is thus filled with dangers and obstacles which Tarzan must face and overcome. Along the way, of course, are snippets of the usual wildlife footage plus an \"adorable\" baby elephant who here serves the same purpose Cheetah did back in Tarzan's African movies. Even better, though, are the scenes of exotic temples, statues, and ceremonies which have been well photographed in Metrocolor and widescreen. These scenes alone make a look at this movie worthwhile.<br><br>The title refers to three challenges which Tarzan must pass before he is entrusted with the case of the Successor. The first is a test of skill involving archery and the third is a test of wisdom which requires Tarzan to answer a question. In between comes a test of strength which provided this movie with its most distinctive image. Tarzan stands between two tall posts. Ropes with attached handles have been looped over the tops of these poles. Tarzan takes hold of these handles and then is told: \"You will be required to resist the pull of two buffalo for five strokes of the gong.\" The buffalo, tied to the other ends of the ropes, are then driven in opposite directions, causing Tarzan to be s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d like a wishbone after Thanksgiving dinner. This \"stretching,\" similar to feats of strength in such \"Hercules\" movies as \"Goliath and the Barbarians,\" gives Jock Mahoney a chance to show off his sweaty, muscular, and carefully-shaved physique in a \"bondage\" situation that's quite sensual.<br><br>Alas, Mahoney's physique looks haggard in the movie's final reel in which he faces a fourth challenge -- a test of might which culminates in a sword fight vs. Woody Strode taking place over a netting stretched above cauldrons of bubbling liquid. (Why isn't the title, \"Tarzan's Four Challenges?\") Much has been made of the illness striking Mahoney during the filming which resulted in this haggard look, but the truth is Mahoney was about ten years too old for his part. Still, his age gives him a certain \"gravitas\" missing in most of the other Tarzans and he has no need for apologize for his performance which projects an image of quiet strength and mature judgment. Rocky Der is also commendably good as Kashi, managing to be appealing without resorting to \"cuteness\" and he has a great smile.<br><br>One question: Tarzan's bids farewell to his new friends in the final scene and then runs off down a country road. Where is he going? Does he plan to run all the way back to Africa?","user":"dinky-4","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Wager Of Battle","rating":6,"date":"22 October 2011","review":"Although this film was shot in Thailand, the small inaccessible kingdom where the action of the film takes place looks more like a Tibetian type culture. Jock Mahoney plays Tarzan for the second and last time in Tarzan's Three Challenges. And the title is a misnomer, the heir to the kingdom has three challenges, Tarzan is his champion in the fourth which is a kind of medieval wager of battle.<br><br>Woody Strode is both the old and dying king and his younger ambitious brother. A young child played by Ricky Der is named the heir probably in a process similar to how the Dalai Lama is chosen. The brother who is a warrior and has trained his son to be the same thinks the time has come for a warrior to lead in this modern age and the hell with traditions of pacifism. <br><br>Tarzan comes to this kingdom to aid young Master Der on his journey to claim his rights. And of course Strode the warrior tries to stop him as the king Strode dies. When Der completes his three challenges Strode does the wager of battle thing that involves barrels of hot oil. Quite a good challenge as Tarzan is the only guy around who would have chance against Strode.<br><br>Actually Strode the warrior does make some rather valid points about moving into the 20th century. Even the Dalai Lama in exile has come to grips with modernity in some ways.<br><br>Tarzan's Three Challenges holds up very well for today's audiences, these films shot on location are so much better than those shot on the back lot of RKO back in the day.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Tarzan ala The Spaghetti Western","rating":29,"date":"29 October 2011","review":"FOR THE SECOND film in a row, our Jungle Lord both leaves Africa to be a Globe Trotting troubleshooter and also enters the film in an aircraft. In the previous outing, TARZAN GOES TO India (Aflin A.G., MGM. 1962), he dives into a river from the small plane. With no flowing body of water handy, the Apeman goes it the common sense route; making use of a parachute.<br><br>WE SOON LEARN that this unnamed land (somewhwhere in the region referred to as Indochina *)is in trouble due to political and religious treachery. The trouble from a jealous brother, who is a pretender to both the throne; as well as his coveting the position of religious leader (apparently being a Budist nation with a Dali Lama like Holy Man in charge(.<br><br>TARZAN PROMISES THE dying King that he will protect the young heir to the throne from the evil brother, Khan, who will stop at nothing to ensure that the line of succession will pass to Kahn's son, who is the rightful heir's cousin. Understand? <br><br>INCIDENTALLY, BOTH THE infirm King and this warrior guy, Khan, are capably portrayed by former Decathalon Champ and Football End from UCLA and the Los Aneles Rams, Mr. Woody Strode.<br><br>BUT IN MUCH the same manner as the character of Darth Vader was brought to the screen in a sort of 'Tag Team' method; using two actors to cerate one character. In STAR WARS(Lucas Films Ltd., 20th Cetury-Fox, 1977), it was 6' 7\" former Weightlifter/Bodybuilder, David Prowse, who gave Vader his imposing physical presence; while James Earl Jones gave us the benefit of his fine, deep and richly voiced tones.<br><br>IN THIS OUTING,TARZAN'S THREE CHALLENGES (Banner Productions, MGM, 1963), most of the voices are dubbed over the words spoken by the multitude of mainly native Asian actors on location where the filming was done, in Malaysia and Thailand. The voices that appear in the final, on-screen product have an overall British tone and accent (not that we're suggesting that most residents of the U.K. wear overalls).<br><br>ANOTHER DISTINCTIVE ATTRIBUTE of the movie is the very crisp and distinctive presence of the sound effects used in the sound track. The general expression of action for the ear seems to be at least somewhat exaggerated; often could be classified as highly or even extremely over stated. That is not to imply that this treatment of sound is too extreme; for it all adds up to being proper and even equal proportions, when all components are assembled.<br><br>THE VISUALS ARE very good, even breathtaking at times. The great and expansive tropical outdoors are shown to fine advantage; all of which gives us a truly authentic jungle in which to send all of our suspension of disbelief. Cdertainly, no jungle picture has had better \"sets\" on which to film. Without having to consciously say or think it, we know that this movie wasn't done on a Hollywood Studio's back lot.<br><br>ALL OF THESE previously mentioned elements add up to give us the thesis that appears in the Summary Box above these written paragraphs. The intensity of sound, the crisp editing of action sequences together with the dubbed speech, all add up to a movie which is very much like that which was coming out of Italy and Spain from such filmmakers such as Sergio Leone and Bruno Bozetto.<br><br>WE BELIEVE THAT this was indeed no accident; for \"Hollywood\" is and has long been famous for doing one things. That is following trends and fads. Many would say that this is stealing, plagiarizing and not very honest or original.<br><br>OF COURSE, ON the other hand, they** say that, <br><br>\"Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!\" <br><br>THIS WAS FOLLOWED-UP with TARZAN AND THE VALLEY OF GOLD*** (Banner Productions, American International Pictures, 1967); which brought us a nearly perfect Tarzan physical specimen in ex L.A. Rams Linebacker, Mike Henry. THREE CHALLENGES was Jock Mahoney's farewell to the loincloth.<br><br>NOTE: * Indochina = Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma (?).<br><br>NOTE: ** That is, whoever \"they\" are.<br><br>NOTE: *** Speaking of following trends, just watch the opening of the VALLEY OF GOLD to see how much the very popular JAMES BOND 007 Series had grown and shed its influence over the movies.","user":"redryan64","rank":[3,3]}]
