[{"title":"Ultimately...It Sinks!","rating":4,"date":"14 August 2017","review":"Open Water 3 starts off somewhat promisingly but ultimately fizzles out. It starts of when two brothers and a girlfriend of one of the brothers decide to go to Australia to film themselves Shark Cage Diving in order to enter the footage into a reality TV-show which could potentially earn them $100 000. During their dive however, a freak wave overturns the boat, and they together with the crew members and other tourists are left floating in shark infested waters. Soon almost everyone is separated and trying to survive while awaiting rescue. <br><br>The shaky camera found footage filming gets annoying pretty quickly. As does the relationship between the two brothers and the girl. One of the brothers is planning to propose to his girlfriend not knowing that his brother is also in love with her. The same girl gets more and more hysterical as the movie goes on and eventually ends up torching a life raft they were fortunate enough to find floating after almost a day in the water. At no point in time in the raft do they show any signs of exhaustion. This and the fact that these three at no time give any indication that they have dived before or have any clue about what to do also makes the movie less believable. By this point in the movie however the viewers probably couldn't care less because the ending is predictable and is in fact given away in the first few minutes of the film anyway when its stated that what is on the screen is footage from a camera found on the ocean floor. The acting could have been worse but is nothing special. Overall not really worth the time of watching.","user":"nebk","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"We are going to need..........less screaming","rating":17,"date":"17 October 2017","review":"I find it difficult to understand why directors and writers make and write films like this. It is well known that most film goers do not enjoy found footage films that pretty well consist of the actors screaming and shouting at each other whilst doing incredibly stupid things. The viewer feels no empathy, just irritation with characters. The viewer does not feel suspense or fear because fear and suspense are swamped by irritation and annoyance. The viewer wants the characters to die.<br><br>And so it is with this Asylum-esque teen-scream (almost) offering. The incredibly stupid thing here was so unbelievable in it's stupidity that it would have been a kindness and relief for the film to have ended there. I wanted Megan to die.<br><br>In the main the viewer wants an intelligent script, good acting, plausible behaviours,intelligent decisions and mature likable characters. Why directors not understand this? Why is it that they do not take lessons from Jaws or The Reef? Why do they take lessons from Asylum films? It is a mystery.<br><br>Oh..the sharks were good though, particularly in the suddenness of one death where one shark was a stalking horse!","user":"daver6","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Why was this made?","rating":1,"date":"4 September 2017","review":"The characters in this are so unlikable, they are all idiots who I actually wanted to die. You need to be able to root for your characters but whoever wrote this shitbox doesn't know that and I have no idea how it got made with the crap script it had. Everything was generic, guy loves girl, girl loves brother, oh no! It was 30mins of them being tools then 50 minutes of them in the water screaming at one another, there was no suspense no tension, as I said, I wanted them to die. Bad writing. How do these people have jobs?","user":"dene477","rank":[20,25]}]
