[{"title":"It's like a porno with all the good bits cut out.","rating":3,"date":"22 April 2018","review":"The film starts with a good premise. 4 guys use a unsellable condo to hookup with women. Then the acting starts... <br><br>The acting feels like you're watching a porno where the dialog is just there to justify the sex. This movie has the same standard of acting, without any of the good bits you find in a porno.<br><br>Somebody should make a parody of this... the acting cannot get worse.","user":"naboy-82175","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Give this a miss","rating":1,"date":"29 August 2018","review":"The acting, lame lines, lighting and props are as fake as in porn movies, the women all have fish lips and plastic grapefruits, but there is no sex to justify sitting through all that.","user":"nojunk-46182","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Nah","rating":1,"date":"1 December 2019","review":"I thought this was a sex comedy. Why the dead rapper in the beginning?<br><br>Such a weird introduction. I don't care enough to watch this movie.<br><br>Terrible. Don't see it.<br><br>1 star","user":"michaeltrivedi","rank":[0,0]}]
