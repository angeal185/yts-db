[{"title":"A great precode classic that even TCM doesn't show","rating":9,"date":"5 September 2006","review":"This is probably the most daring precode picture made. Miriam Hopkins starred and I can't think of anyone else who would have been just as good. Even Harlow wouldn't have worked. She never played such an amoral C.T. as Temple. Jack LaRue was absolutely perfect as Trigger. Such a face. Extraordinarily good looking and yet resolutely menacing. I'll never understand why he never was used as a romantic lead in any of his movies that I know. Read the other reviews for plot details. They are precise. I purchased my copy privately on DVD. I've always wanted to see it. It was worth it. The settings and lighting were extremely good for the story and time in cinema history. Hooray for the director and all of the technicians,","user":"sideways8","rank":[36,40]},{"title":"Interesting adaptation of Faulkner story with strong legal subplot","rating":7,"date":"6 January 2000","review":"Temple Drake is a well brought up Southern woman who has a strong wild and crazy streak.  She refuses marriage proposals from Steven Benbow, a dedicated and ethical young lawyer, because she knows she isn't ready to settle down.   She is, in fact, a notorious sexual tease.  Soon she's being held by a group of bootleggers and is raped by a hood named Trigger. Temple's wild streak takes over and she decides to stay with Trigger, perhaps working as a prostitute.  Pretty heady stuff for the 1930's!<br><br>I particularly liked the character of Benbow who willingly takes all of the pro bono criminal cases assigned to him by the judge (Temple's haughty father) and handles even the hopeless ones with great dedication.  In the courtroom scene that ends this film, Benbow's skill and ethics are put to the test.<br><br>There is an extensive discussion and analysis of \"Temple Drake\" in Thomas Doherty, \"Pre-Code Hollywood\" (1999) at 114-17.  The story of the film's struggle with the censors (both in Hollywood and in the states) is told in Thomas Vieira, \"Sin in Soft Focus\" (1999) 149-50; stills from the film appear at 158-59.","user":"Michael-110","rank":[37,43]},{"title":"Strong stuff","rating":7,"date":"7 June 2001","review":"Southern belle Temple Drake (Miriam Hopkins) is attacked and raped by a violent bootlegger. He decides to keep her for himself and she sees no way out...until her boyfriend finds out.<br><br>I saw this many years ago (the 1990s) at a film festival and have never forgotten it. Even though they toned down the source material (William Faulkner's \"Sanctuary\") considerably, this is strong stuff for 1933. The acting is good, it's well-directed and has an ending that censors of the 30s hated (I won't give it away, but you can see why). Seeing it again all these years later on Blu-Ray it still holds up and looks great. It's now pretty tame and dated but good.","user":"preppy-3","rank":[35,41]}]
