[{"title":"Evans At His Best!","rating":9,"date":"9 July 2001","review":"This is typical Lee Evans, he is definitely one of the funniest comedians around but surprisingly not many people have heard of him. If you want to see what Lee Evans is really like doing stand-up comedy then buy this video, I couldn't stop laughing all the way through, a definite thumbs up and a must see for anyone with a sense of humor!","user":"Dan-Bowes","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Hilarious","rating":2,"date":"2 April 2002","review":"Is Lee Evans the funniest comedian around today? Resounding yes me thinks.<br><br>Anyone who hasn't seen Lee Evans should try this. He's an extremely funny, energetic and enthusiastic comedian. His humour is based on observation, where he points out the obvious with a funny twist. Very, very funny, and worth the money just for the effort that he puts into his act. He must lose a couple of stone everytime he's on stage he sweats that much. He has tried his hand at sitcoms too, but don't judge him on that. For me, his sitcoms are poor, but his stand up is second to none.<br><br>I have just seen him live on his Wired and Wonderful tour and I think when the video comes out for that, if you like this, you should try that too. A genuine comedy genius, who'll have you crying with laughter. It's difficult to review one particular show as they are all so funny, but give this a shot as the Scotland show was special.","user":"sparky-113","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"If this guy isn't a legend , Ill eat money","rating":10,"date":"9 February 2006","review":"Lee Evans. The best British comedian of this generation and in my opinion can establish himself as one of the all time greats. His unique brand of physical comedy. His accents on stage makes this guy the funniest comedian on television. All of his live performances has him singing a song on his piano. And this one has been my favorite. Not only can he act, but damn he can sing too. If you have a chance to go and see this guy. It well be the best money you are going to spend if you want to laugh till it hurts. This is probably one of the best shows during his great career and you should really check out the wired and wonderful tour, that was also a great laugh.","user":"xbladechrome","rank":[3,4]}]
