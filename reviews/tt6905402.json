I was really expecting something good and I've just wasted 1hr 30 mins of my time.","user":"kemi-99299","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Well it was... experience I didn't ask for.","rating":1,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"At first I write big review, most of it not about film, but about director and his girlfriend and other sensitive stuff. Then I delete it because imdb did this anyway, so in sum: its not a romantic story at all, yes its pretty impressive how it was shot, but we here to watch a film, not a picture themself, and a film its like need to have story. Story in this flick pretty generic its like another one love night in cityname, dialogs is boring, nothing new. BUT then it goes to politic. Oh wow. I have some issues with one (only one!) scene from Blackkklansman (wich is not from original script, but added only for political statement and for falsification of real history - I think, because I didn't read the book, maybe it was real part of it), but in \"A Boy. A Girl. A Dream\" I have tons of really laughable opinions (especially when I see it like from 2018) and BIG WORDS about baaaad peeeople. So now industrialist's who try to make Detroit great again - is bad people. Okay. I just stop on this, because I clearly see all characters in film was or rich people from show business or people who want to be in show biz. So why I even should be bother about opinion of this people. And I didn't, just say your film is political pamphlet. Its note romance at all.","user":"edgy-827-486965","rank":[10,22]}]
