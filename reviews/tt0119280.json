[{"title":"Excellent, but not a romance","rating":16,"date":"16 March 1999","review":"This is a phenomenal movie, but I am rather peeved at the way it has been marketed.  When I rented the movie, the blurb on the box luridly touted the \"forbidden passion between a rugged Scotsman and the most powerful woman in the world.\"  Other marketing of the film is similar.  That's not what the movie is about at all!!  It is a very sad commentary on our society if a moving drama about terrible grief being assuaged through loyal friendship cannot be accepted for what it is.  Is the American public really that shallow?  I don't know whether to blame movie execs for dumbing down the presentation of their product to titillate the lowest common denominator, or the American public for maybe actually being that way.<br><br>Diatribes aside, Dench and Connolly are phenomenal.  Victoria and Brown are complex characters with conflicting emotions, and one almost feels able to look upon their souls in this portrayal.  Antony Sher was delightful as the orator/politician Benjamin Disraeli, at the same time both wise and gently pompous.  The makeup job was so good that I actually recognized him as Disraeli before his name was mentioned.<br><br>If you are disappointed because this is not a puerile romance, shame on you. These are real people with real emotions.  This moving story of grief and friendship is definitely one of the best of the year.","user":"Matt T","rank":[61,64]},{"title":"Fantastic love story","rating":9,"date":"23 August 1999","review":"This film is a fantastic love story.  You'll note that I didn't say \"sex story,\" because there is absolutely no sex in this film.  And yet most people equate \"love story\" with sex, or at least a beautifully shot kiss at the end, complete with a cheesy song penned by Brian Adams.  This, my friends, is a love story with a difference.<br><br>It is the story of a servant's love for his queen; it is the story of a woman's love for the man who has given her life meaning; it is a story of two best friends, who ignore social circumstances and care deeply for one another.  The story is nearly flawless, combining the historical situation and circumstances with intense and riveting emotion.<br><br>The acting is outstanding.  Both of the central actors convey exactly what their character is feeling, even if no words are spoken.  Billy Connolly lets John Brown's humanity shine through his rough exterior, and he has a naturalness that is quite inspired.  And Dame Judi Dench gives a masterful performance, worthy of the Oscar (like that's never been said before). Her portrayal of a queen tortured by her feelings and her position in society is the best of the year by any actor, male or female.<br><br>Hands down the best British film of the year.  9/10.","user":"Dr.Teeth","rank":[44,48]},{"title":"A masterful, touching, gentle piece of history","rating":8,"date":"4 May 1999","review":"Absolutely brilliant film. No question, we all seem to agree that Dench deserved the Oscar (ok, Hunt was cute in AGAIG but a long way from 'Best'), Connolly is surprisingly good in this very dramatic role (I'm not exactly a huge fan of his comedic work), and Sher was very clever as Disraeli. All in all, a sterling performance by a wonderful cast. But this movie is just a little bit more that just great acting, it is also a moving story of the burdens of office, the mores of Victorian society, the anguish of the death of a loved one, and the blessing of true friendship. This is a very good movie. Don't expect sex, violence or swearing, but if you're looking for a quality film, this could be for you. 8/10","user":"Rumples","rank":[26,28]}]
