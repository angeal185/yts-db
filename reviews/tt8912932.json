[{"title":"Hell Yeah!","rating":25,"date":"25 May 2019","review":"This movie is amazing! I am a true Johnny Thunders fan and I think the lead actor did an amazing job portraying him and the storyline was excellent. Everything in this movie was great, the directing, acting, costumes, lighting... It's not meant to be a documentary, it's a thriller! I was truly enthralled and the ending pulled at my heart strings. If a movie can make me cry, I give it an A+. RIP Johnny","user":"bad-card","rank":[11,16]},{"title":"Thunder's rolling in his grave in embarrassment","rating":1,"date":"22 May 2019","review":"There was a opportunity to make a good movie about a rock and roll/punk legend, but instead they made a low rent version of the Shining. At least the actor playing Thunders didn't scream out \"Here's Johnny, so he gets the one star!!\"","user":"EAA123","rank":[11,19]},{"title":"Oy oy oy oy oy oy","rating":1,"date":"21 May 2019","review":"Quite possibly the worst acting you will ever witness. Of course, that's offset by the $200 budget for cinematography. I don't really know who this guy was, but whoever he was, and however crappy his life may have been, he deserves better than this as an epitaph.","user":"jake_fantom","rank":[13,25]}]
