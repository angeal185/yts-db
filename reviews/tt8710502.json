[{"title":"A One Of A Kind Documentary On Custom Bike Builders","rating":9,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"A really well put together documentary on bike builders and where they see their future within the booming industry.\nLots of interviews with builders from all over the world. Some build on a shoe-string and passion. Others use the latest tech to build show bikes which will likely never see the road.<br><br>This documentary will be of interest to those who admire engineering and innovation, even though they only have a passing interest in motorcycles.","user":"bigmoe-16356","rank":[0,0]}]
