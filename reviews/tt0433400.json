[{"title":"We've all been there...","rating":6,"date":"26 November 2005","review":"...the \"Friend Zone.\" We've all been in Chris, the main character's, shoes.<br><br>The storyline isn't deep - and it's not intended to be. The plot is simple: Guy secretly pines for his best friend, but he's chubby and considered nothing but a friend. After graduating high school, he goes to L.A. to pursue a career, slims down and becomes wealthy and then surprisingly returns home to N.J. only to reunite with his former unrequited love. Despite how successful Chris is in his new life, at his core he's the same and the object of his affection still makes him nervous. Does he pull his head out of his butt and win the girl or does he go back to L.A.? I won't spoil it. But I will say this - See this movie. It's full of laughs and we can all relate to Chris. His family dynamics are hilarious and I guarantee you'll think, if you have siblings, \"I've done that\". See this flick for entertainment, not for the answer to life's greatest questions. Expect nothing and enjoy everything.","user":"Space814","rank":[94,111]},{"title":"Entertaining","rating":9,"date":"5 February 2006","review":"I went to see this movie to pass the time, but it is now probably one of the most entertaining comedies i have seen in a long long time. The Cast is rich and the slapstick comedy is hilarious! <br><br>Chris is totally in love with his best friend Jamie, but she does not return his feelings. Chris is the put down insecure kid because of his weight. 10 years on hes slim, sexy, rich and confident however he is now an arrogant womaniser, probably fuelled by his unlucky past. He returns home with Ditzy Popstar Samantha (batently a Britney spears mimic) who is one of the main contributers to the comedy, (the scene with the toothpaste is hilarious) <br><br>He bumps into Jamie who is amazed to see Chris, but when they go on dates he puts on a \"cool boy\" front and Jamie doesn't like it, she wants her original \"fat\" Chris back.<br><br>The movie goes on from here, many mishaps and slapstick fights with his hilarious younger brother, and his rivalry for Jamies heart (Chris Klein) Dusty.<br><br>I left the cinema laughing, not one dull moment in this movie. However if your a 'hardcore' movie goer who is choosy about plot quality you may not like this. Others who are looking to be cheered up are going to love this Cracker of a Comedy!<br><br>Ryan Reynolds is set to be the next Jim Carrey or better!","user":"sammysmee","rank":[79,99]},{"title":"Laugh-out-loud, Feel-good movie of the season","rating":9,"date":"7 December 2005","review":"My fiancé and I went and saw this movie the other day and thought it was great! The humor was well-placed and it was great to see Ryan Reynolds in a movie where he wasn't surrounded by tasteless humor every 5 minutes. Me and my fiancé both agreed that the funniest bit throughout the whole movie was the relationship between Reynolds character and his brother. The slap-fights were great and the one moment of brotherly love was simply hilarious. If you're tired of the raunchy humor of the likes of 40-Year Old Virgin and want a good movie for a date or just as a stand alone movie, this one is great. It's got so many things in it that make it wonderful: Tasteful witty humor, good plot, puts you in the Christmas spirit (but also works as a non-seasonal movie), and gives props to any guy who's been put in the \"Friend-zone\". My fiancé came out of the movie and said \"That makes me feel bad about all the guys I've told them I 'just want to be friends'\". So there you go guys--if you got a girl you're crushing on and you think you might be in the \"Friend-zone\" with her, take her to this movie (even if it's just a \"friendly date\"). It may break the ice and she could see what kind of girl she's being. I found my 'one and only', but I've been in the friend-zone several times, so I was able to relate to this movie in many ways.<br><br>This is just an all around feel-good movie. I was very happy with the 14 bucks I spent on this flick.","user":"vipher20","rank":[98,133]}]
