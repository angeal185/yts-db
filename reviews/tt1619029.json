[{"title":"what is the problem?","rating":9,"date":"10 March 2017","review":"I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews of this film on IMDb. I would be interested to know how many of them came from people who are too young to remember the Kennedy assassination or much about Mrs. Kennedy.<br><br>Okay, several people were angry that John-John in the movie didn't salute the casket.<br><br>One review referred to the story as \"horrible and morbid.\" Guess what - it is.<br><br>One review said Jackie was a \"housewife.\" I won't dignify that with a response.<br><br>Natalie Portman was criticized for doing a \"cringe-worthy\" imitation. Her voice and accent were found hilarious.<br><br>And it was called \"boring\" over and over again.<br><br>I understand that to each his own, and I respect that. I'm just surprised. <br><br>I first of all did not find this film at all boring. I found it emotional, compelling, and interesting - and despite what someone said here, I did find out things I never knew.<br><br>I thought Natalie Portman did a brilliant job and, while the role didn't offer as much as Viola Davis' did in Fences, I would not have been upset to see her win another Oscar. There was nothing wrong with her accent, that's how Mrs. Kennedy talked. If you don't believe me, go to youtube and listen to the tapes.<br><br>The film focused on Jackie after the assassination, but it was shown, as were earlier times, such as her televised tour of the White House. I thought the film mixed with the actual footage was excellent. <br><br>The clothes were perfection. Like others, I did not care for the music and what I really did not care for was the music at the end.<br><br>The rest of the cast did an admirable job - John Hurt, Greta Gerwig, and Billy Crudup. I was disappointed in Peter Sarsgaard, but I think he was trying to convey Bobby's shock and grief. He's a good actor normally but not very successful here.<br><br>I found this a poignant film and a stunning portrait of Jackie Kennedy and what she suffered as a result of the assassination.","user":"blanche-2","rank":[54,66]},{"title":"An exploration of grief, grace and mythmaking","rating":8,"date":"24 February 2017","review":"I mostly fell for this exploration of grief, grace and mythmaking. Even when it was a bit too on the nose (the faults mostly lie in the wraparound story). It's concerned with how someone copes in the spotlight, how someone can make a legacy from the idea of a thing, how a person is more important than their legend but also how their legend shapes how that person is forever perceived.<br><br>It's telling in the universe of the film that Jackie herself is first obsessed with redesigning the White House in what is ostensibly a superficial act of decorating, but then is revealed to be, in reality, attempting to reflect more than the legends of past presidents but also the men who shaped them. A reminder that all legends start with a simple human being doing things only a person can do. A grandiloquent gesture of political humanity for a house full of ghosts.<br><br>There's a lot else to like here. Natalie Portman's performance does indeed capture Jackie Kennedy's persona, but also the legend of her and the real woman behind it all. Watching the real White House tour video on YouTube showed me how accurate Portman's breathy accent and meticulous demeanor really were. Beautifully composed, with notes of elegance and grotesqueness in equal measure. And a wonderful, tragic, near other-worldly score by Mica Levi.","user":"spencergrande6","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"Disappointed","rating":5,"date":"21 January 2017","review":"As the film is titled 'Jackie' you expect to learn more about her through the film, it should have been called 'JFK's widow one week following his assassination'. This is a woman who was powerful and had a background, a life, buried two babies. All we get from this film is a portrayal of a grieving, often selfish and self absorbed woman who smokes and drinks too much. Who wouldn't fall to that after something as traumatic? The film is flat and bland, it gives us no indication of the type of woman she was, her role in white house (aside from her expensive renovations and insistence on a huge funeral for her husband) We see nothing of her personal achievements. Natalie Portman and the excellent cast's acting skills are the only interesting thing to watch. Disappointing and does 'Jackie O' no justice at all.","user":"shola-35818","rank":[185,293]}]
