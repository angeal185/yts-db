[{"title":"One of horror's greatest character studies!","rating":10,"date":"28 December 2005","review":"Over the years George A. Romero has created a number of landmark horror films for the genre. This modern 'vampire' flick ranks among his very best films!<br><br>Shy teenager, who believes himself to be a century old vampire, comes to live with his superstitious old cousin in Pittsburgh.<br><br>Romero's Martin is a truly unique, one of a kind psychological thriller. It is a memorable journey from its disturbing opening sequence to its chilling conclusion. Martin, like most of Romero's classics, is a film with plenty of social commentary and believable characters. The driving force behind the films premise is the question of whether or not our title character really is a vampire. Martin has no fangs, no fear of the sun, in fact he actually uses razors and syringes to seize his victims. Yet, Martin has memories of an attack that apparently he did ages ago and his elderly cousin fully believes his young relative to be an evil creature. Romero throws out all of the old fashion vampire conventions for this symbolic clashing of the ways. Romero's direction is, as always, very nicely done with plenty of suspense, atmosphere, and gruesome moments. Romero makes this drama stylishly operatic and adds an occasional moment of dark humor. The haunting music score also adds greatly to the atmosphere.<br><br>The cast is excellent, but it's star John Amplas who really drives this show. Attractive youth Amplas is a greatly sympathetic character, even as he is the films monster and hero all at once.<br><br>A film unlike any other of the horror genre, Martin remains a terrific low-budget masterpiece that is as hauntingly effective today as ever.<br><br>**** out of ****","user":"Nightman85","rank":[37,40]},{"title":"Great Revisionist Horror Movie","rating":17,"date":"17 June 2003","review":"Sometimes it seems to me that the \"users\" who comment on movies here go out of their way to miss the point. The horror storyline here isn't just \"vampire nonsense\" nor does Romero succeed in spite of his \"lowbrow intentions.\"  The film IS a horror film, as successful in \"revising\" the typical vampire films as other 1970's classics like McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Point Black were in \"revising\" the western and gangster genres respectively.  The film would hardly be as interesting if it were some kind of slick production with the usual trappings.  Instead Martin is a low-key intense underplayed film that reverses the usual expectations without rejecting its genre.<br><br>I don't think Romero is somehow upholding the ideals of faith either;  the religious zealot, Martin's uncle, is the least sympathetic figure in the movie, though he may be right in thinking that Martin is \"nosferatu.\"  Or his fanaticism may have created the delusion in Martin's mind, an attempt to reject the religious dogma by adopting its traditional/mythic opponent. In any case, Romero's take on faith is very complex and is as interesting in this film as his complex take on individuality and consumerism is in Dawn of the Dead.<br><br>Romero makes great use of the depressed area of Braddock Pennsylvania, the kind of down on its luck, conservative, fading neighborhood I know from my own experience.  The setting is essential to the movie, but Romero doesn't overplay it.   The radio talk-show angle isn't as well handled but it is interesting.<br><br>I thought this film was very impressive in its deadpan update of the vampire story and Martin is a strangely moving character.  Ultimately the movie is a much more convincing dramatization of the \"serial killer\" figure than we get in most films now, despite the current fascination with that type.   (P.S. Romero was so good in the 1970s..how did he fall to the likes of Creepshow?)","user":"howlermonkey","rank":[47,52]},{"title":"One of the most underrated movies of all time!","rating":3,"date":"3 June 2002","review":"George A. Romero will always be associated with his innovative and spectacular zombie trilogy ('Night Of The Living Dead', 'Dawn Of The Dead' and 'Day Of The Dead', all classics). Dig deeper and you will find he has made several less discussed but worthy movies, including this one, quite possibly the best movie he has ever made.<br><br>'Martin' manages to be both a disturbing psychological drama and a genuine horror movie at the same time. It is complex and mult-layered enough to be read in more than one way. It's up to you, the viewer, to decide whether Martin (John Amplas, in an impressive debut) really is the vampire he claims to be or is simply deluded. It's a pity that this movie slips through the cracks. Hard core horror nuts often undervalue it because it isn't what they expect from the genre, and movie buffs who can appreciate downbeat 70s classics like Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver', and Toback's 'Fingers', will dismiss it as \"just another horror movie\", not realizing just how much it has in common with the aforementioned. Too bad. 'Martin' is a real gem, and highly recommended. I think it's absolutely brilliant, and a classic.","user":"Infofreak","rank":[37,42]}]
