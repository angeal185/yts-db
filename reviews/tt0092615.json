[{"title":"Highly enjoyable, tongue in cheek sword & sorcery","rating":7,"date":"12 October 2005","review":"This was directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon to many horror film fans after he directed the seminal and notorious Cannibal Holocaust. However, don't expect to find any such notoriety in the film reviewed here as it proves to be incredibly tame in comparison and plays more like a Conan inspired outing for a young audience.<br><br>Such a description may instantly put off most fans of the whole Conan inspired Sword &amp; Sorcery genre but before you turn your nose up at this, it has to be said, this movie is just so much fun!<br><br>It's mostly played for laughs and features two HUGE and highly likable heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. the Barbarian Brothers who both seem to be having a ball with their characters.<br><br>B-Movie favourite Richard Lynch turns up as the main villain in the piece and it's also great to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman.<br><br>Added to this, the ladies are stunning to behold and suitably scantily attired throughout the films duration (a staple and much welcomed ingredient in the genre!)<br><br>What can I say, - this simply is a really fun and lighthearted take on the genre and I recommend it wholeheartedly!","user":"HaemovoreRex","rank":[20,20]},{"title":"For fans of camp, this is a gem","rating":10,"date":"10 July 2004","review":"I have to admit that I loved this movie -- it's completely campy, it doesn't take itself seriously for a moment, and it has few redeeming qualities. The actors -- which is a loose description of what they are doing on screen -- look like they are having a ball filming this over-the-top sword-and-sorcery outing, and it's hard not to share in the fun. The heroes are musclebound, the damsel-in-distress is pretty and spunky, the bad guy is a caricature of bad-guys. What more can you wish for? <br><br>Frankly, any movie that includes a girl in a cage commenting on the arrival of her two rescuers with \"And look at the size of you two! This is Ismina's lucky day!\" gets a pass from me. It's fun.","user":"phouka-2","rank":[47,50]},{"title":"couple of knuckleheads","rating":6,"date":"26 May 2005","review":"Kutchek and Gore are two orphans who got abducted by an evil warlord who makes a promise not to kill them. They go up into the Barbarian Brothers (the brothers if you don't know are freaking' HUGE) who after learning that the warlord is less than altruistic in his intentions, decide to break free and restore the balance. The two are stupid fools but they're big enough that no one cares. This movie is one of those films that's so bad it's good and is definitely tongue-in-cheek. Many highly quotable lines and I enjoyed it immensely.<br><br>My Grade: B- <br><br>Eye Candy: a few breasts are bared","user":"movieman_kev","rank":[25,27]}]
