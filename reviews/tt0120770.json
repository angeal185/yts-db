[{"title":"secretly wonderful","rating":8,"date":"22 June 2004","review":"I'm going out on a limb here.  I've just bombed \"Joe Dirt,\" and now I'm going to do an about-face on modern comedies and argue that \"A Night at the Roxbury\" is brilliant.  Most critics didn't see a distinction between these two bombs, but I do.<br><br>Comedy oftentimes depends on suffering.  Comic protagonists always take a beating, and we either laugh with them, or at them, or maybe we laugh not at all because we couldn't care less.  The essential question is, are the protagonists of \"A Night at the Roxbury\" lovable losers or just totally annoying dweebs who deserve all the grief they get? <br><br>You know my answer already.  I love the Butabi brothers.  They have a strong fraternal bond, they're obsessed with Emilio Estevez, and they can't get any play.  What's not to love?  <br><br>Dan Hedaya is great as the brothers' disgruntled dad, and Chazz Palminteri does a hilarious cameo as an entrepreneur obsessed with ass-grabbing. Richard Grieco demonstrates a remarkable sense of humor about himself by allowing the Butabis to build him up as a big celebrity, when the joke is obviously that he's a total has-been.  What a sport, eh?<br><br>Nice song, too.  I like this stupid movie.  Really, I do.","user":"dr_foreman","rank":[134,154]},{"title":"Great and really funny movie.","rating":10,"date":"3 December 2004","review":"\"What's up?\" - Either you love it or you hate it. Actually to me Roxbury is one of my favourites. Of course the two guys are hilarious - but that's what they're supposed to be. This movie is full of great innuendos to disco chicks (\"Is this your first time?\"), to stupid and bored upper class people (\"Do you like my new chin? Is it better than last years?\") and to some movies (\"You had me at hello!\"). Even after watching it the 3rd or 4th time you still can discover some new hints and gags.<br><br>It's a funny movie but certainly not dumb!<br><br>Emilioooooh!","user":"PQTaggart","rank":[94,115]},{"title":"10 thumbs up","rating":10,"date":"19 February 2005","review":"THIS MOVIE IS GREAAAAAAAAAT! i guarantee you'll be laughing throughout the movie. I'v read some reviews about this movie and i can't help but wonder why people say its horrible? Maybe your not the type who enjoy a good comedy once in a while. The two brothers are absolutely hysterical. They just keep the laughs coming. AND, what about the music? The music just happens to fit the movie so good that i think its a 'must see movie'. I'm a proud owner of this movie. When i'm in need of a good laugh this is the movie i watch. The story is wonderful, and the actors and actresses have done the greatest job on this movie. If i could i'd give it 100 OUT OF 100 :)","user":"funkiie01","rank":[121,152]}]
