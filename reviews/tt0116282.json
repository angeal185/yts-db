[{"title":"You're darned tootin'!","rating":2,"date":"2 April 2001","review":"\"What'd this guy look like anyway?\"  \"Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.\"  \"Uh-huh. In what way?\"  \"Just a general way.\"  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coen's finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation  with Gaear and the wood-chipper.  Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H.  Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, \"He's fleeing  the interview!\"  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.  If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent  life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you.","user":"aharmon","rank":[245,300]},{"title":"Don't Forgo Fargo","rating":10,"date":"4 February 2005","review":"Boy, is this a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.<br><br>The performances, for instance, everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent, a very pronounced accent, let's say. So when characters are doing wicked things on screen, it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things. It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously -- only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys, but no more than that.<br><br>Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully. They never swear either. \"You're darn tootin',\" they say. The casting couldn't be better, with Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Macy outstanding.<br><br>The script is likewise splendidly done. It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs. Without taking the space to describe them, I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school. Why is it in there at all? (My God, those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly.) Well -- among other things, such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy, it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature. When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily. When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay. She is polite, a little distant without being unfriendly, completely practical, and absolutely iron bound in her values. Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe. Further, this scene is a set up for a later one. After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies, she wakes up to the fact that, yes, people can tell untruths -- and she returns to interview Macy a second time. <br><br>In another scene, when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview, he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car. She exclaims, \"Oh, for Pete's sake, he's FLEEIN' THE INTERVIEW.\" It's impossible to improve on a line like that, or on MacDormand's delivery of it.<br><br>The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction. The pauses come at the right times. A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV. Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach. He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar. He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside. Now in an ordinary action movie, by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway. Not here. The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door, half horrified and half curious. \"Who is this guy? He's not the meter reader, is he?\" <br><br>Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too. Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition, but Dad offers him only a finder's fee. We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in. Cut. Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another, and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness. Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it.<br><br>Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie. People die in it, drive off the road because of it, stand shivering in it. Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow. The shoveler stops, gazes up at the sky, and remarks that it \"ought to be really cold tomorrow.\" Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow. MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a niveous white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him, saying something like, \"Why did you do it, for a little bit of money? It's a perfect day, and here you are.\" (A perfect day!) <br><br>There are seven murders in this movie. Only three take place on screen. The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands.<br><br>\"Fargo\" is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD. It's an original and refreshingly adult picture. Don't miss it.","user":"rmax304823","rank":[196,242]},{"title":"Thank's a bunch for this one","rating":8,"date":"12 November 2005","review":"Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.<br><br>Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.<br><br>The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.<br><br>The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.<br><br>The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.<br><br>The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.<br><br>Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!","user":"Stibbert","rank":[31,38]}]
