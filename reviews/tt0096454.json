[{"title":"A must see!","rating":10,"date":"9 November 2001","review":"I was a theater manager in 1988. I got this movie called 'Without a Clue', and that describes what I knew about it. I never saw a preview, I had no one sheet (poster) for it......Nothing! When I put the thing together, and saw the beginning, I thought oh, no! Not another Sherlock Holmes movie! (I think they made too many as it is!) But when Watson yelled at Holmes \"You idiot!\", that blew me away! I sat and watched it and laughed my butt off! Unfortunately, nobody else knew about this movie either! My theater was in a small town, and everybody knew me, and I told people if you want to see a funny movie that has no sex, really bad words, you have to see this movie! On Friday, when it opened, the theater was nowhere near full, on Thursday, the night it closed, we had a good crowd, some seeing it two, or three times (our admission price was $1.00 at the time). Granted, the teen-agers didn't care for it, but the adults loved it! In fact, one lady said to me, why don't they make more like that anymore! This movie IS an overlooked gem of a comedy!","user":"super marauder","rank":[68,81]},{"title":"A Sherlockian Comedy of Grand Proportions!","rating":10,"date":"21 December 2001","review":"Its a shame this film is not better appreciated.Its the finest parody of the Holmes Mythos ever set to screen. The stories are sent up without being malicious.Its an absurdists view with loads of honest laughs. Ben Kinsley shines as Dr. Watson,the true brains behind the Holmes cases.In order to continue his medical practice without repurcussion (Crime Solving is shunned upon for a respected professional)Watson invents a character named Holmes. His reputation grows to the point that people wish to meet him...enter Reginald Kincaid played to perfection by Michael Caine. Kincaid is a drunken,out of work actor hired by Watson to play Holmes. With the teaming of these two screen greats the chemistry is electric. Add a solid supporting cast of wonderful character actors (including Paul Freeman as Moriarty and Jeffrey Jones as Lestrade)and a very convincing performance from the lovely Lysette Anthony and the film is off to a great start. The screenplay and Direction solidify its relevence as a first class comedic romp. If you can catch \"Without A Clue\" on television don't miss it! Its not yet available on DVD and sadly out of print on video.","user":"peacham","rank":[50,61]},{"title":"A true lost gem","rating":6,"date":"6 December 2002","review":"The premise is so clever. Sherlock Holmes never really existed. It was Dr. Watson (Ben Kingsley) who had been solving these cases all along, and simply hired bumbling actor Reginald Kincaid (Michael Caine) to play the fake Sherlock Holmes.<br><br>To those who are hard-core Holmes fans, this film will be cherished. Sadly, the VHS is out of print in the USA (I bought mine used at a flea market), and DVDs are available only in Europe. <br><br>(UPDATE: The film has been released on DVD in the USA, but in Pan &amp; Scan.)<br><br>Also, the film received hardly any promotion in the USA. But it is lavishly directed, cleverly written, and magnificently cast.<br><br>Everything about this film deserves exclamation points!<br><br>Track it down any way you can, and prepare to laugh out loud.","user":"Baroque","rank":[45,56]}]
