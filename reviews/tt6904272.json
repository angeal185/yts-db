[{"title":"SOme good scenes but improbable stroryline.","rating":6,"date":"21 September 2018","review":"This could have been great if they had maintained the tension. But the problem is there were too many screens and monitors in the way of the action. Anf the movie goes off the rails in the final act.","user":"mrrcott","rank":[13,19]},{"title":"6.5 Stars","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2019","review":"A negotiator, tired of seeing bad outcomes, decides to make a career change but before she can get out, she's called into a special negotiation where her boss is the hostage. This case is more than it seems but will she be able to avoid another bad outcome.<br><br>While this wasn't an awful film, it kinda goes haywire after what seemed to be a solid start. I thought the actors all played their roles well but the way that the script is put together had me struggling to keep up with whom did what, where, when, why and how. I had no problems with the effects or the pace. It just felt like there was too much going on.<br><br>I did like the film. I thought it was a decent thriller that had a few flaws. There are times when I watch foreign films and I start to wonder if maybe it might have been better had I been able to understand the language or had better subtitles. This might be one of those films. Check it out though. Maybe you can catch something I missed and it might just be the thing that makes this \"Just Ok,\" film into an \"Awesome\" film.","user":"Foutainoflife","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Its was good","rating":6,"date":"18 July 2019","review":"I honestly watched through this film and it was good. The main actor did well on his part. I dont quite remember this movie well but I do know that the vibe between the two on set was honestly amazing. How both of them played their characters was pretty cool. I would recommend this movie, but it doesnt always put you on your feet and keep you wanting more.","user":"pachiathao","rank":[5,6]}]
