Mild and light adventure with ecology issue , it's full of fighting , humor , action and silly scenes and results to be an average flick . The picture packs action , explosions and several slight fights in Terence Hill/Bud Spencer style . Good support cast crammed by familiar faces as Roscoe Lee Browne , Max Gail , Loreta Swift , William Sanderson , Barbara Niven , George Buck Flower , John Dennis Johnson , among others . Colorful cinematography by Joao Fernades , usual of Chuck Norris films ; being filmed on location in Hood River, Lost Lake, Mount Hood, and Parkdale, Oregon, USA . Functional musical score and including some beautiful songs . The motion picture was regularly directed by Aaron Norris who has usually produced , playing stunts and directed various vehicles for his brother Chuck , such as ¨Missing in action 3¨, ¨Delta Force 2¨ , ¨Hitman¨ , ¨Hellbound¨, some episodes of ¨Walker Texas Ranger¨and three children films such as ¨Sidekicks¨ , ¨Top dog¨ and this ¨Forest warrior¨. The only film done by Aaron Norris to not have Chuck Norris in it was ¨Platoon leader¨. Rating : Average but entertaining . The picture will appeal to Chuck Norris fans .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Yes.","rating":10,"date":"27 May 2011","review":"One word: Yes. A three in one experience: Home Alone, PBS's Nature, and Walker, Texas Ranger all in an hour and a half!<br><br>Special effects: The special effects were excellent, particularly the sparkling light balls. We also enjoyed the animal to human transformations. Seamless. <br><br>Law enforcement: The lawyers were accurately portrayed and incredibly competent considering the fees they were charging. The permit process was entirely plausible...I mean, who needs NEPA or EPA approval anyway? <br><br>Animals: The killer chipmunk? Slam dunk. A falcon transforming into a fist? Yes please!<br><br>Life lessons: The deep and riveting plot line of the alcoholic father and the lumber tycoon who finds his morality left us wanting more. Also Chuck was full of his usual cogent remarks on life's profundities. <br><br>Fight scenes: We were on the edge of our seats. It IS Chuck. The little kid who kicks the bad lumberjack in the face was the icing on the cake.<br><br>Political Correctness: comments like pull up your pantyhose (and be a man), and those environmentalist fairies were a couple gems. <br><br>Choreography: three words -- lumberjack dance scene. <br><br>Costume design: A great tour of some timeless 90s classics. Dad and Mom jeans a plenty!<br><br>Fave quotes: \"There were six of them (bad guys) and then there were five...\" (because Chuck was kicking their butts!) \"How very sad.\" \"Sad this!\"","user":"gemmaz","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Chuck Norris takes his brand of action-packed excitement to powerful new heights in this riveting wilderness adventure..","rating":7,"date":"24 October 2016","review":"\"Forest Warrior\" features the charismatic Chuck Norris as McKenna, a forest spirit who incorporates the powers of an eagle, wolf, and bear. When an unscrupulous businessman, Travis Thorne. (Terry Kiser.), attempts to cut down many of the trees in the forest of Tangle wood Mountain, a group of teens plot to stop him. They need help from the Forest Warrior and help they get! Not only can McKenna fight, he is a Shape Shifter and can take on whatever form he needs.<br><br>Personally i really like this film and It goes without saying that for me, Forest Warrior is a goddamn great movie. Anything that features Chuck Norris kicking ass is worth watching, but if you add in the ability that he can shape shift into various animals too, well then that's even better.If you think that I wouldn't watch this film every single day for the rest of my life, you just don't know me.<br><br>Forest Warrior plays out like a brilliant cross between Gremlins 2: The New Batch, Walker, Texas Ranger, and some animal morphing stuff that you didn't know you needed. It's friendly enough for children, bad ass enough for adults, and weird enough for people in search of originality.<br><br>\"Forest Warrior\" delivers wondrous scenes of nature, an energetic group of teens, and exciting action sequences from Norris. Give this movie a try if you have never seen it and if you have, show the master some respect and watch Forest Warrior once again...","user":"HarryLags","rank":[10,12]}]
