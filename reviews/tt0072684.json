[{"title":"A film so easily dismissed","rating":10,"date":"24 January 2005","review":"In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention \"Barry Lyndon\".<br><br>The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.<br><br>Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in \"Barry Lyndon\" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.<br><br>The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.<br><br>\"Barry Lyndon is\", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented. Stanley Kubrick made many great films  and this one is most definitely one of them!

English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into \"the trap of the picturesque\", but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world.  Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don't have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.<br><br>THIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen.  Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it's cut altogether - you won't catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in.  The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it's about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don't.  (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.)  And as always, Kubrick's musical sense is unerring.  My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles.  I was more or less right.  But then I noticed Schubert's name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I'd been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.<br><br>It's a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this.  Look at the ones he's responsible for: \"Spartacus\" (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) \"2001\" (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and \"Barry Lyndon\".  The last of the three is by no means a poor cousin.","user":"Spleen","rank":[269,318]},{"title":"\" good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now\".","rating":10,"date":"18 May 2007","review":"The beauty, the depth, and the mystery of this film are unsurpassable - what Kubrick was doing with light is just a miracle. Special lenses were designed to shoot interiors and exteriors in natural light. In one scene Barry (Ryan O'Neil) was having a dinner with a German woman who was feeding her baby and the candle light made the whole scene look like a Caravaggio's painting. This is just one of many scenes. Each of them is perfection and harmony. Costumes and sets were crafted in the era's design. Age of Enlightenment with its gallantry, wars, and duels, had been recreated in the film with the precision of the celebrated landscape and portrait masters of the period such as Thomas Gainsborough; Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy of Arts; George Romney to name just a few. If nothing else, watching BL is pure aesthetic delight - and there is one man who responsible for it, Stanley Kubrick. If ever divine film was made, \"Barry Lyndon\" was it and Kubrick could've quoted the Bible - \"God looked at everything he had made, and he found it very good\".<br><br>I've read the comments and articles that call \"Barry Lyndon\" cold, slow, boring, \"the collection of pretty pictures', \"flawed\" masterpiece, and the most ridiculous one, \"glittering ornament with a hollow center\". I simply can't understand it. \"Barry Lyndon\" is the most compelling and compassionate realization of the inevitable finality of everything in this world which was presented by the visionary director with elegant sensual melancholy. Stanley Kubrick known for his detached, seemingly remote and non-sentimental style chose to reach out to his viewer directly during the epilogue, \"It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personalities lived and quarreled, good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now\". I don't recall any other movie that would illustrate the old wisdom, \"everything will pass\" in such sublime and deeply moving way.","user":"Galina_movie_fan","rank":[108,124]}]
