[{"title":"Cinematic Equivalent of Malware/Viruses","rating":1,"date":"21 September 2016","review":"No danger of any accidental spoilers here....this absolute rubbish so called movie is a spoiler from start to finish.<br><br>The most absurd part of it is that the actors seem to be reading from cue cards and are operating under some strange rule that says that they must all speak at the same speed..ie.. so many words per minute.<br><br>As for story/plot/directing/dialogue etc....the kindest thing I can do is to make no comment.<br><br>Steven Segal made some decent movies in his early days....then disappeared from the scene only to re-emerge and pollute our screens with incredible rubbish. Additionally this self professed health fanatic returned as an obese man just to add insult to injury. Obviously he decided that there are enough gullible cinema goers out there to enable him to simply take their money, by pumping out the worst garbage possible, every chance he gets. There really should be some kind of law protecting the public from this kind of abuse.<br><br>Additionally, I think that these so called movies are Segals only chance to get his hands on young vulnerable women in naked and semi-naked states without the risk of being arrested.<br><br>Having said all that.....I strongly recommend that you get hold of a free copy of this so called movie (do not spend any money) and pass it along to as many people as possible with the condition that they also pass it on to as many people as possible. That way....having watched it, people will never again run the risk of watching another Segal movie which may have the same effect as antivirus/antimalware software, and prevent the release of any more of this rubbish","user":"kmichaelpm","rank":[48,60]},{"title":"Steven Saegal, Enough man!","rating":15,"date":"15 September 2016","review":"Well.. if u don't mind really bad acting, a really bad story line, really badly directed, really boring and really bad camera work.. then you will prob like it.. ** Steven Seagal only have a small role, 5 min.. All in all bad special effects, bad acting, goofy ripoff plot, really bad 'fight' scenes, yeah, it's a Steven Seagal movie all right. It's sad that newer Van Dam movies are better, at least he sees the humor in himself, this is just absurd. the end was the most amusing, absurd, and unrealistic fight sequence since him and Tommy Lee Jones in Under Siege. But People it's Steven Segall, by now we know what to expect. But what he CAN still move, he always moves faster than the bad guys, LOL","user":"deepakkhasa-32152","rank":[26,34]},{"title":"Incoherent, underacted and generally awful","rating":1,"date":"11 November 2016","review":"The acting in this is truly terrible, it goes back to the style of those cookie cutter direct to video productions of the 80's. Under or over emotion in all the wrong places. <br><br>This has Steven Segal all over it, poor plot line, pacing all over the place and B grade to bone. Do not go here, you will actually be a worse human at the end of this.<br><br>This is supposed to be post-government lockdown - quest for rebellion thing but it just doesn't gel at all. Writing problems in the script which led to character development problems and a basket case of a movie.","user":"dmstokes73","rank":[16,21]}]
