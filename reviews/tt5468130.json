[{"title":"Stupid","rating":2,"date":"24 February 2019","review":"These people just never pay attention regardless of the amount of danger they're in. They make it pretty easy for the killer. I couldn't wait for it to end. Worst horror movie ever ðŸ™„","user":"krisymc","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Stinker, don't waste you time.","rating":1,"date":"2 May 2019","review":"Terribly written and so slow it actually made 2 people fall asleep. I get what they were going for but they really missed the mark. It was a pretty annoying movie. Well the concept is horrible, but whomever put this garbage together doesn't know how to make a movie.\nThe writing sucks, the acting sucks, the directing sucks.\nDo you get the idea that this entire ting sucks?\nI wanted to dig my eyes out with a rusty fork.","user":"psxexperten","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"if the killer is once down, finish him! or die.","rating":2,"date":"24 February 2019","review":"I personally did not like it. terrible acting. lame story. irrational behaviour. among all the men-hunting movies out there this was a disappointing one.","user":"Critic_from_Outaspace","rank":[15,20]}]
