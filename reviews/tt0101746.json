[{"title":"Well worth the price of a box of hankies.","rating":1,"date":"1 March 1999","review":"It's not unusual in Hollywood for 2 studios to be working on similar projects at the same time. One obvious example might be Milos Forman's beautiful Valmont, and Stephen Frear's certainly adequate Dangerous Liaisons. The latter featured a bigger' cast by American standards, and did better business, not surprisingly.<br><br>About the same time as Randa Haines' beautiful, The Doctor',  with William Hurt  was delivered, so was Mike Nichols Regarding Henry', starring Harrison Ford. Again, the latter did bigger business, and as a result I feel this film was largely overlooked.<br><br>On first look, The Doctor seems a standard tale: icy, successful surgeon finds out what medicine is really like when the tables are turned and he is diagnosed with throat cancer. His redemptive arc is somewhat predictable, as he reconnects with family, redefines his medical practice, and restructures his relationship with his similarly icy partners.<br><br>But it's under these, predictable circumstances that a true craftsman like Ms. Haines can make the ordinary extraordinary. The film is genuinely heartfelt and touching, resisting at every turn any self-indulgence, or the gratuitous pulling at heartstrings, relying on a quiet, confidence, a softer emotion instead.<br><br>Not that it's not weepy at times.<br><br>Hurt has never been better in the title role. Elizabeth Perkins as his soul-mate cancer victim is equally superb.","user":"Doctor_Bombay","rank":[30,31]},{"title":"Excellent View from the Other Side","rating":10,"date":"10 June 2006","review":"The Doctor may not be the most moving, most influential, or best portrayed movie of all time, but it certainly should rank near the top of the best medical movies of all time. The story is about Dr. Jack MacKee (William Hurt), an arrogant heart surgeon whose believes that doctors should \"Get in, fix it, and get out\". However, when he finds himself diagnosed with cancer, he must see the system from the other side - a mechanized, unsympathetic system where the patient's comfort is the least concern. The story complicates when he befriends a fellow cancer patient, June Ellis (Elizabeth Perkins), who proves to be an inspirational figure in Jack's battle against cancer.<br><br>The movie could be deemed a transformation story. At first, Jack is an unlovable character - the doctor we all wish we didn't have. However, as he continues through his ordeal, his attitude begins to change. It is a profound change, and provides for many deep, moving scenes.<br><br>The story itself is not complicated, and is easy to follow. The acting, however, is top notch, and makes for a terrific movie. I would recommend it to anybody.","user":"chatterbug2k1","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"A Great Movie","rating":28,"date":"28 October 2004","review":"I was impressed and touched by the movie's theme. I've recommended the movie to friends and acquaintances and those that watch it are also moved. <br><br>When my wife was hospitalized for leukemia there was an intern who became impatient with my questions and concern. I couldn't help but think that \"hey, someday you'll become a patient too. Let's see how you'll handle it.\"<br><br>They should have medical students watch this movie. We can become callous at times, that we forget to put ourselves in the shoes of the other person. <br><br>The movie shows that there are people that stay in our lives so briefly but leave warm and good impressions that last a lifetime.","user":"dodjiesantos","rank":[18,19]}]
