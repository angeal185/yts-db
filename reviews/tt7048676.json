[{"title":"Better than you'd expect.","rating":6,"date":"15 October 2017","review":"It starts out like a typical horny-teens-take-a-road-trip-to-a-backwater-town horror flick and initially I only stuck around because the guy playing Lance is a hottie but it actually turned out to be a pretty decent movie. What also helps is its relatively short running time of less than an hour and a quarter. The acting is typical of this genre but that's not necessarily a distraction.","user":"jeffeastwood2000-628-193804","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"I can escape","rating":4,"date":"13 October 2017","review":"Four teens on their way camping stop at a country store not run by Captain Spaulding. For here they are directed to go to a local commercially run haunted house that looked like nearly a 1000 people were trying to get in and something that took dozens of people to operate. From the opening plot spoiler scene, we already know they all die and Jess (Morgan Wiggins) is the final girl who gets rescued by a local driving by. Guess how that works out. They are using non-locals as part of the torture exhibits while they film it on grainy black and white VHS so they can pack the tapes into boxes. Carpentry tools are used mostly. We didn't get to know any of the characters in this 74 minute production. This is a me-too film. The highlight being that Morgan Wiggins can really belt out a scream.<br><br>They were at the store during daylight with the haunted house only a couple of miles way. When they arrive it is pitch black outside. A popular Ed Wood device.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[16,24]},{"title":"Idea was great, but the stupid girls are annoying","rating":6,"date":"23 October 2017","review":"I loved the idea of this horror house with real torture. Also the set was cool. Nice look to the house etc. It was a bit to much with the stupid screaming girls. I mean in what hospital do you get a bandaid over your eyes without an eye injury? The ending was so obvious and overused. After all worth a watch if you like saw or such...","user":"Waldhorst","rank":[5,6]}]
