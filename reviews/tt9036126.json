[{"title":"Sandler Nostalgia","rating":10,"date":"26 October 2018","review":"There are some negative reviews here so I'd like to give one from the positive side. I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan, present tense. However, I am capable of recognizing when his items are no good. I recognize that much of the later work is not very good. However, this special is vintage Adam Sandler. It's both funny and emotional. You may have to have some knowledge of his old work to have that nostalgic feeling, but it's definitely there. This is actually an emotional set, and it was when I saw it live in Houston as well. I preferred this better than the live show. Complaints ab about it structure of stand up comedy and how it's supposed to be done by some of the reviewers here are unfounded. Sandler has been doing stand up for a long time. Some of this can roll forward into a new album, which would be a great idea, and I'd definitely buy it.","user":"sandler-85347","rank":[29,35]},{"title":"Such a fun ride","rating":9,"date":"26 October 2018","review":"Adam Sandler I always thought was hated on to much. He's a guy with comedian talent. This stand up special is no different. He delievers on hilarious punch lines, and funny catchy songs. The ending will bring a tear in your eye, leaving you wanting more.","user":"mikelovesalexa","rank":[27,34]},{"title":"Made me laugh and cry","rating":10,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"I laughed so hard i had a physical cramp in my side and when the end came around i was in tears and wished there was more.
