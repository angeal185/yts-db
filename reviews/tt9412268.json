[{"title":"Super thrilling action film made In VN","rating":9,"date":"1 March 2019","review":"This is \"Taken\" - Vietnamese version with lots of awesome action packs played by one lead attress NGo Thanh Van. It made me could not take my eyes off any seconds. Together with other great cast and easy plot but yet touching, Furie is indeed one hell of a Hollywood quality action movie that can't be missed","user":"ostrich_9","rank":[41,52]},{"title":"Awesome action","rating":10,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"I've become so tired of the Hollywood hype, the perfect American Dream always being pushed in American films. I've been watching a lot of foreign films lately and have to say that this was one of the really good ones. I absolutely enjoyed the action and the difficult livestyle depicted was much more relatable. Human trafficking is a huge problem and it's good to have movies that bring attention to the pure horror of it all. I will certainly be looking out for more Vietnamese films. Thank you from South Africa.","user":"amandajeanstone","rank":[22,28]},{"title":"Congratulatios Hai Phuong","rating":9,"date":"22 February 2019","review":"This is the best martial arts film I've ever seen in Vietnam, wish the film will be successful all over the world.","user":"lcltaro","rank":[38,56]}]
