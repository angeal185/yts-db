[{"title":"waste of time","rating":2,"date":"18 June 2018","review":"This movie tries to be too many genres at once but fails each. \nIt is not a good action movie because all weapons look like plastic toys and actors do not even pretend that things have some real weight. And everytime they 'shoot' it is just animated effect, I guess budget could not cover even a gun shooting blanks. \nIt tries to be also zombie horror movie, but the zombies are mix of all types, like it was borrowed from all other movies - fast, slow, 'deaf' - it is a low budget version of \"I am Legend\" movie.\nTries to be sci-fi, but it does not spend enough screen time on the subject, so it comes out as random twist, and of course the low budget CGI can't compete with 2018 movies.\nThe 2 stars are for makeups, which were believable.","user":"hromadne","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Great premise, but a failure everywhere else","rating":2,"date":"3 September 2018","review":"This movie had the potential to be good. The plot is decent. Hell, the storyline is pretty good, albeit lacking in places in this movie, where it could and should have been fleshed out. It would have been better as a 2-part movie, where more of the backstory could have been filled in. As it is, there is literally zero character development, and the \"plot\", as it is in ths movie, falls flat due to inadequate storytelling.<br><br>The acting is horrible. Stilted, jerky, almost looking like a college-level drama class entry using actual college drama students as the so-called \"actors\". Completely not believeable in any sense of the word.<br><br>This movie needed a larger budget, and better actors. And better story writers. Not to mention decent extras, and a dirctor who knows what he or she is doing.<br><br>Failing that, I gave this movie 2 stars because of the premise. I suffered through 92 minutes of bad acting, bad story telling, bad directing, and an overall let-down at the conclusion.<br><br>Don't watch this movie. Seriously. Don't bother.","user":"hfelsh-46-730639","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"No one in control, so movie type changes constantly","rating":3,"date":"13 September 2018","review":"My quick rating 2,6/10. This is what happens when you really don't know what type of movie you want to make. The story, I suppose, is about a secret experiment developed in a bio chemical company, aptly named biochem. Of course there are ulterior motives, and not to spoil it, the plan is to wipe out humanity. That is kind of told in the beginning anyway. So the movie, horrible acting, and I mean horrible. So the idea is in place, but as you watch, you can see the director just saying, ok, wait, how about a zombie movie...so now it is a zombie movie, but then a little while later, the director passes over the bong after a few hits, and decides there has to be aliens. So now it is sci fi as well, but why not throw in some ridiculous blood splatter...don't have the money? Just use adobe premiere and throw fake blood around. No one will notice how stupid it looks. The laundry list of problems with this movie can go on and on. A faster review-don't waste your time.","user":"jackmeat","rank":[6,7]}]
