[{"title":"An uncut diamond *potential spoilers*","rating":9,"date":"14 April 2018","review":"I see this movie is getting a lot of mixed reviews, but I am happy I watched it.<br><br>As my title says, I regard this movie as an uncut diamond. Sure it has flaws, some of them obvious and odd, but at its core it is still a very unique and genuine gem. It manages to touch on a part of modern social life that is very taboo and gets little attention, even though it likely is much more widespread than most of us think.<br><br>It is not a high budget film, so I did not go in with a lot of expectations to the general acting, but the two main lead actresses really killed it. If I didn't know better I'd think they were together in real life too - which is a joy to watch. There are some quite intimate scenes, yet the girls never appear awkward around each other. The \"antagonist\" (if you can call him that) has little screen time and character build-up, but the actor does a good job portraying a middle aged man who appears to have all, yet is constantly battling his inner demons. Maybe turning a little too drastic towards the end (no spoilers), but it's not hard to imagine that crazy people exist out there.<br><br>In regards to the whole cam girls aspect, I truly admire how well the movie portrays the potential casual attraction it has. It is easy to put it into a box with strippers, porn stars, hookers, etc. But the real fact is that it is much more approachable and casual, especially for teenage girls who might just look at the surface, but don't see the actions/consequences that lie behind. I bet most of us did some strange stuff in our teenage years, stuff that we look back at and think \"what the hell were I doing?\". Making money off being a cam girl is just that, or at least it has the potential to be so. It's easy money and you do just the amount you want, no pressure. Seems quite harmless at a glance, and that is what this movie portrays very well. How harmless and casual easy money can seem in young girls' eyes.<br><br>As stated, this movie is great because of its display of genuine affection, and how it touches on a taboo subject that I have not yet seen on the big screen, and that alone deserves a watch.<br><br>I'd definitely recommend it. Can't say everyone will love it, though I did. If you watch it with high expectations to direction, attention to details, etc, then you will likely be disappointed. This is a low budget film, and I am reviewing it based on that fact.","user":"dsigndzmail","rank":[40,43]},{"title":"As a former teenager girl","rating":7,"date":"23 August 2019","review":"I could relate to these girls. At least Annie. She's pissed that she had to move and basically disenchanted with life. That's teenager 101. I found it to be a very believable consequence of the actions of these girls. Being so young, they can't realize the consequences of their actions and certainly can't see that frank might be a creep like a grown up would see. It really doesn't dawn on them that he lied about his identity. So this film to me is very relevant to today's internet society, where one can make him or herself into whatever he wishes just with a few computer/phone keystrokes. Watch it. It's a good movie.","user":"mysprouts-740-813856","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Surprised the rating is so low.","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2017","review":"I've been on IMDb for years and never reviewed anything. There is no \"I wish I was a real film critic\" bs going on here. I just want to say that I loved it. It really reminded me of my teenage years and early 20's. I fell madly in love with this girl and we had a crazy relationship. We never did cam stuff because it wasn't a thing back then. We did have sugar daddies, and some of them were crazy as hell. This is a weird movie about drunk teenage girls that use men for money, so most people won't relate. But man, it reminded me of my life when I was young. I loved the movie. This isn't really a review at all. I'm just saying that I enjoyed it. My only issues were that the mom looked like 5 years older than Annie. She could have been her older sister, and the title makes no sense. If you \"entertained\" middle aged men for money as a teenager, this movie is for you! lol","user":"dr-deane775","rank":[48,59]}]
