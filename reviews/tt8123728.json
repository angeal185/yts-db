[{"title":"Horrible acting","rating":4,"date":"26 May 2019","review":"My compliments to the director to make with a very low budget ( I guess) this movie. With light and just a minimal decor he builds a good set.<br><br>However the acting is horrible, with some kind of Eastern Europe accent. The dialogs sound unnatural and the whole movie unfortunately turns into a school play of the 3th grade","user":"info-77430","rank":[32,37]},{"title":"A miserable attempt","rating":2,"date":"26 May 2019","review":"WWII and Holocaust movies should be given that gravitas that the subject merits. Not just in the values of the plot, but in the production standards, too. Alas, everything in this movie reeks of poor production - low quality acting and sets.<br><br>If it's so bad (you may be wondering), why have most other reviewers given this movie of 9 or 10 stars? Well, most of those reviews occur on the same day - on May 14th or thereabouts. Just after it's inclusion on IMDB presumably. By people closely associated with the production, I'd guess.\nYou see it on IMDB more and more, amidst mediocre ratings, there's usually a few reviewers awarding 9-10 stars. You can't rule out ulterior motives.<br><br>In conclusion, there are many great WWII dramas out there. Don't bother with this rubbish.","user":"marc-cheyne","rank":[23,27]},{"title":"a good story but horrible acting","rating":3,"date":"25 May 2019","review":"For starters, why in earth do the actors speak english with a very bad german accent. That fact alone makes it unwatchable. I think that if the movie was spoken in german, it would have been way better to watch. The story an sich is not badly told but the actors lack charisma.","user":"jeltestienstra","rank":[27,33]}]
