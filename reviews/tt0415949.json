[{"title":"Hilarious Film!","rating":10,"date":"11 May 2006","review":"Great movie!! I was in a bad mood all day until I saw this movie. It made my day!! From the audience's responses, it made their day, too! I found Jeremy Piven's performance to be in line with his usual comedic excellence. When it comes to comedy, Jeremy is king. Excellent performances from other cast is definitely worth noting. Even though I'm not Jewish, I found the film totally entertaining. This film is more than slap stick comedy woven into a worn out display of one-liners. The characters are not static, and there is a serious current underlying the funny moments. It's a redemptive story about family being more important than money--in grand style. Good job, guys!","user":"coleal2","rank":[30,45]},{"title":"not worth it","rating":2,"date":"24 June 2006","review":"So I saw this movie, not really knowing what it was about, and even then I was disappointed.<br><br>First off, a lot of what they do relating to the actual bar mitzvah is simply wrong. but okay, i can get over that.<br><br>I just feel like this movie had potential (and honestly there were a bunch of funny parts, it may have been funnier because I am Jewish, but there were many funny parts), but fell flat.<br><br>The movie, like another commenter said, has nothing to do with the Steins. They call it \"Keeping Up with the Steins\", open up with a Stein bar mitzvah, then ignore them for the entire movie until the very end. You can't suddenly try to add a plot at the end of the movie... it doesn't work.<br><br>Further, no one would possibly let the father do what he did. The wife, the kid, ANYONE ELSE would have said something. How about \"get over it, this day is about your son, deal with your issues later.\" The day of the bar mitzvah is not the time to let that happen.<br><br>Also, someone rediscovering Judaism, learning his Haftarah, and doing all that other stuff in less than a week? It's just too ridiculous.<br><br>I agree with other posters... it had potential, but the characters were not developed well, the plot tried to do too much but then simply ignored the sub-plots (how about sacred feather and the cameraman? We're going to have him make passes at her like 3 times then never bring it up) it tried to create. Parts were funny, but the entire second half dragged to the point of becoming unbearable. I'd skip this one.","user":"gw002m","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"Interesting Things...","rating":7,"date":"15 May 2006","review":"Interesting thing about having seen 'Keeping Up with the Steins' on a Sunday at Fallbrook in the Valley - there was a fieldtrip of some school that had seen fit to come see the film as a group, then hold a sort of Q&amp;A in the lobby. Ages of the folks in attendance ranged from 12 to about 60 and over. I love being in a full theatre when going to a film, particularly a comedy as you'll get laughs out of people that become infectious and actually make seeing the film that much better of an experience.<br><br>Another interesting thing about the 'Steins' film: while Jeremy Piven and the young hero of the film are the driving characters, the lasting memories of a film-goer actually belong to Gary Marshall &amp; Doris Roberts. The backstory of their relationship, how it affected Piven, and how they've let by-gones be by-gones while Piven clutches to his old grudges is beautifully and deftly handled by the director. Marshall delivers the father figure as likable to an audience as the characters he created on network television back in the 70's.<br><br>One more interesting thing about the 'Steins': you don't have to be Jewish to appreciate the humor, you just have to recognize the strengths and failings of every human being represented in these characters.","user":"mcgee4468","rank":[18,28]}]
