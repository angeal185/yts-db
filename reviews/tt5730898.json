[{"title":"ABYSMAL","rating":1,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"I thought this was a joke until, I actually took time out of my day to try and watch this. Fast forwarding through almost to the end. The opening, WEIRD. The message WEIRD. The acting AWFUL, just awful. Except the terriost, he was great. Weak storyline, poorly written, poorly edited, lacks direction, no character development and just misses all together. I get it everyone's reaching for that star, this falls immensely short. What's the deal with your real wife in the background of the scene with I guess was suppose to be your old girlfriend? Who wrote that in? Jay stick to chasing down guys in your yard with your machine gun, acting ain't your thing brotha. Dean Cain WTF bro - from the AWARD WINNING FILM MAKER OF UNTIL IT HURTS. Love you!!!

Besides the obvious racism in this film and the glorification of war, it's also poorly made. Storyline is just weird half of the time. You tell your pet moslim to come with you, to wear a suit and then you tell him to stay in the car because it's not the right time for him to come with. That's just the worst scriptwriting imo. If you're not a nationalist with an American flag on your porch who says things like \"Go back to your own country!\" Then you'll prob don't enjoy this film. :'-)","user":"sarina-vergeer","rank":[3,6]}]
