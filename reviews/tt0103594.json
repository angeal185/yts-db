[{"title":"Ridiculously inaccurate","rating":2,"date":"11 September 2007","review":"The real story of Columbus is an adventure story with plenty of plot twists and interesting characters. So there was no need to fabricate history in this film. We have Columbus' journals that tell us what happened when he landed in the new world and the events that followed. This film set an agenda to make Columbus out to be a visionary who against the odds made good and the only problem was that everyone else didn't have his insight. Ridiculous! Columbus did something quite amazing in sailing to the new world but that doesn't mean that he didn't have serious flaws. For one, in the film he speaks about a \"New World\" but Columbus died believing he actually had found a passage to Asia so for him there was nothing new about it. The first encounter with the natives is also ridiculous in the film. In Columbus' journal we see that naked villagers came out onto the beach and that Columbus claimed the land for Spain and then took out his sword and tested the natives' knowledge of weapons. They had none and Columbus actually cut them. In the movie, Columbus is just walking through the jungle and he is approached by hostile natives ready to fire their arrows at him. He tells his men who are about to open fire to stop and that they must act peacefully. So Columbus becomes the peacemaker when in reality the natives were peaceful and he drew his sword on them. There are tons of these moments in the movie that make this movie a joke in terms of history. If directors are going to use real historical figures they need to represent them accurately. If they want to imagine or reimagine the colonial experience then they should use fictional characters.","user":"mid-levels","rank":[111,146]},{"title":"On Creating Worlds","rating":7,"date":"18 September 2002","review":"1492 casts a long shadow over my filmgoing life. It is one of the first films I remember seeing where I started thinking of all the activity that went into making a film. My young mind did not process a lot of the plot - and in retrospect I can partly blame the makers of this film - but I did notice shots, sounds, music. Perhaps the music more than anything.<br><br>So fast-forward a decade and a half at least... 1492 was massive in Europe when it came out. Ridley Scott, director of Alien, Legend and Blade Runner, was telling the story of Christopher Columbus, starring the venerable Gerard Depardieu, all to a score by Vangelis which flew off the shelves faster than any film score since, well, Blade Runner. What did they have to show for it.<br><br>We know the story, or we think we do: Columbus, an Italian immigrant, gets a grant from Queen Isabella of Spain to map a shorter route to India, sailing West. What he discovers is a whole new world, the Caribbean islands. But the \"new world\" experiment fails badly and before long utopia becomes a stage for jealousy, manipulation, superstition and even genocide. <br><br>It took several studios to co-finance this massive undertaking, based on a screenplay by journalist Rose Bosch. Supposedly, Scott immediately had his sights set on Depardieu, which paradoxically leads us to both the film's greatest asset and liability.<br><br>Depardieu exudes a very un-Hollywood brand of charisma: grounded, vulnerable, but also prone to hardness and anger. His Columbus is a tragic idealist, likable even when carried away by his own arrogance. It's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. It is a pity then that his English was nowhere near good enough to carry the film.<br><br>For many years, I had been warned and had only seen the film dubbed in my native French (it did help that Depardieu dubbed himself, as did supporting actor Tcheky Karyo), but upon seeing the film \"as intended\" I was simply baffled. This, coupled with a script that leaves a few motivations unexplained and sometimes gets bogged down, severely undermines a film that is otherwise brimming with first-rate craftsmanship.<br><br>Despite the odd heavy-handed use of orange gradient filters recalling the younger Scott brother's feature-length Air Force commercial, the film is littered with unforgettable imagery. Vangelis' music, though even more effective listened to on its own, plunges you headfirst into another world, one of infinite possibilities.<br><br>The net result is a very imperfect film, but as an exercise in world-creation, an admitted Ridley Scott hobby, you'l be hard pressed to find its equal.","user":"OttoVonB","rank":[73,108]},{"title":"Awful!","rating":3,"date":"7 March 2006","review":"Wow. I was expecting this to be interesting, I've always found historical movies to be somewhat exciting. You know, a mix of the truth and the glamour of Hollywood? However, this movie was a crock of crap.<br><br>It seems as though the makers considered Chris to be some kind of hero and visionary. In fact, at one point, he actually compares himself to the son of God. At one point, I couldn't help but burst out laughing at the sheer idiocy of the script. After that, I just couldn't take it seriously. Comparing himself to Jesus? Honestly.<br><br>I'll tell you what this movie is, and what it is not. It is a completely Hollywood-ized version of the events that really took place, so if you're into the falsehood factor, go for it. It is not a movie one should see if one has read up on some of the things in which Columbus was involved - enslaving and killing thousands, I mean.<br><br>It's only strong point is Gerard Depardieu's accent. That alone is almost worth watching it. The poor man speaks French very well, but his English comes out with a strong accent. In this movie, he plays Columbus - a man from Spain. So combine the French-ified English with an attempt at a Spanish accent, and there you go.<br><br>All in all? Please, don't waste your time. But if you like Gerard Depardieu a whole lot, by all means, take this opportunity to giggle at his expense.<br><br>Plus, he gets punched out by a monk.","user":"silently_stressing","rank":[37,56]}]
