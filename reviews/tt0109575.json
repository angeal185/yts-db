[{"title":"So far over the top it vaults over the wall","rating":21,"date":"21 August 2000","review":"One of the characters yells at his friend: \"You just knew Ho-Ho was going to turn out to be the fat, sweaty, desperate psycho!\"  And of course, we all did too...<br><br>There is no question what this movie was.  There are even characters named Scott Ridley, Sam Raimi, and John Carpenter.  While the surface of the film is a long-corridor (Aliens) horror movie, what lies beneath is sort of a manic, director-oriented comedy that reminds me more of Evil Dead 2 than anything else.  The hyper sound to dead silence, the overly dramatic lighting, the first-person Missile Cam, the cool line followed by backlit explosion... it all leans towards a wild but fun ride through all of the most common camp in these types of movies.  It's a satire subtle enough to pass as just another bad horror movie, if you're not paying attention.<br><br>Brad Dourif (who was B-B-B-B-Billy Buh-Bibbit, a long time ago, and the voice of Chucky-- and might become a little more prevalent in film after being in the upcoming Lord Of The Rings trilogy) is the great shining spot in this film, and alternates from acting well (check out his outpouring at the end) to completely terrible (awful references to hacking... \"Molebdenic composite\"?).  And all of the best subtle jokes are bad guy parodies-- my favorite example is his inability to get his threat right over the monitors: \"Turning me off won't turn you off.  No.  Wait.  Turning you off--\" click.<br><br>But the real flair here is in the direction.  None of this would work if it wasn't played half serious with the sights and sounds.  As the climax builds, the ambient noise cuts out completely for the doors to chime \"Welcome!\" cheerily.  The HUD from the machine's point of view displays 1P and Hi Score.  The Robocop-style machine whirring in the Hardman gear as Raimi actually gets into a fistfight (!) with the machine... there is never any \"set 'em up, knock 'em down\" standard cue that *these* are the jokes... but there they are.  Dig in.","user":"thunderpuppy","rank":[34,41]},{"title":"Superb straight to video - capped by Dourif's excellent performance","rating":8,"date":"16 August 2007","review":"When people ask \"What are some good straight to video horrors?\", Death Machine is usually top of my list. Its a great blend of sci-fi/horror that borrows heavily from others but still emerges as a cool flick nonetheless.<br><br>The simplified plot leaves some good guys (and gal) trying to stay alive in a sealed corporate skyscraper, while being hunted by a robot controlled by the fantastically OTT Brad Dourif. There are a few sub-plots to keep things interesting between the characters.<br><br>The heroine of the piece is the very cute Ely Pouget, who gives a terrific performance. She is joined by a couple of would-be terrorists - Martin McDougall and John Sharian (who some may recognize from his role in The Machinist).<br><br>The plot is good, if a little far-fetched (hey I did say this was sci-fi/horror), and director Stephen Norrington skillfully constructs an effective sense of fear with tongue-in-cheek humor, which belies this being his first time at the helm (he would later go on to direct Blade and the less-than-stellar The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).<br><br>The effects are very good for what must have been a small budget, and the robot (which is reminiscent of a alien/terminator hybrid) is well designed.<br><br>There are \"strong influences\" from movies such as Universal Soldier, Alien and Hardware...and most of the death scenes are quite vicious, though its not really that gory. Also many of the characters are named after horror directors - John Carpenter, Sam Raimi, Scott Ridley etc - not so much as a wink to them but rather a 10 foot neon sign - but it kinda adds to the charm.<br><br>Final word goes out to Mr Dourif, who steals every scene he is in. He's funny, creepy, pathetic and totally manic. I have a feeling Norrington just let Dourif go wild in the role.<br><br>TTKK's Bottomline - If you like sci-fi/horror mixed with a bit of cheese and some laughs, you can't go wrong with Death Machine","user":"TTKKane","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"Extremely enjoyable and surprisingly funny","rating":10,"date":"3 March 2002","review":"Death Machine is a film which really surprised me. I was expecting a gore-fest with weak plot and even weaker acting. That was until I found out it had Brad Dourif starring in it, who is in my opinion one of the best actors ever. The film itself is not overly gory but is instead remarkably discomforting and surprisingly funny and thoughtful. It takes quite a while for any real action to start, the beginning instead being used for interesting plot and character development sequences.<br><br>Brad Dourif does one of the most wonderful acting performances of his life here as the child-like psychotic genius Jack Dante who develops the ultimate killing machine. Wearing a long black leather coat and having long black hair, he looks perfect for the part and gives a genuinely creepy performance - yet still makes you feel sorry for him. He's also been given most of the best lines in the pretty fantastic script, with many laugh-out-loud moments for the viewer (\"It's cool here! There's tons of... stuff!\").<br><br>A note about the violence and gore: the film has an 18 certificate in the UK and you would expect some pretty gruesome stuff for a film in that category, yet there is surprisingly very little. When the Death Machine of the title gets to kill someone, in most cases the death isn't seen at all and left up to the viewer's imagination. There ARE some fairly bloody moments but I don't think this film really deserves the 18 certificate, I've seen worse in 15-rated movies.<br><br>The film remains constantly engaging, has strong actors all round and is directed very well. A great script with quite a lot of comedy moments sets this film apart from other low-budget sci-fi horror movies. Great fun.","user":"matt_notley","rank":[22,30]}]
