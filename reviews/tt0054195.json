[{"title":"Wonderful performances make this worth viewing","rating":8,"date":"27 August 1999","review":"A vast improvement on the cutesy, blatantly unrealistic and cliched story on which it is based, the Disney film Pollyanna is a truly enjoyable, BELIEVABLE film.  It has a very charming, nostalgic feel to it.  The period costumes and sets are very good, and the direction is good, too.  The best thing about it, however, are the performances.  The talented cast really makes you believe in them and forget they're all stereotypes.  Jane Wyman is quite good as Aunt Polly, as are Agnes Moorehead, Adolphe Menjou, and espicially Karl Malden.  And Hayley Mills more than holds her own, giving a very good, subtle, believable performance.  This Pollyanna does not spend all her time chatting her mouth off and misinterpreting every cold act of her aunt's as an expression of love, which made her very annoying in the book, but rather, she really gets to know people and very subtly brings out the best in them.  A truly good family film, much better than the book, and one really worth viewing.","user":"Tommy-92","rank":[32,32]},{"title":"Gorgeous!!!","rating":9,"date":"25 March 2006","review":"As Pollyanna would say, the movie is simply \"gorgeous\"! In my 57 years I've seen this movie more times than I should admit. Just watched it again on Hallmark and felt compelled to offer my first comments on IMDb.<br><br>Everyone can feel down, lonely or put upon at one time or another. \"Pollyanna\" is just the right medicine for those ailments. I realize this is early Disney, but that is a positive attribute, not an indictment. Cheezy? How about \"touching\" instead? The cast, the performances, the setting, and most of all, the message are right on. <br><br>The film makes me laugh and cry every time I view it. How could you possibly ask for more? Guess I'm just a soft touch. Highly recommended for all but the terminally cynical.","user":"ralphfas","rank":[20,20]},{"title":"Don't Be Fooled By Pre-teen Appearances","rating":10,"date":"5 April 2003","review":"A period piece that boasts about \"The Glad Game?\"  Ready to tune out?  So was I, until I got what was happening.  This movie is profound, not only in its execution of story, but in the relevant, lovely message it naturally brings, as opposed to the message it sells.  I've viewed it 5 times and each time, I am newly informed as to how I can adjust my attitude for a better way of life.  I come from a school of thought where sunny is ridiculed and message movies are tedious, so the lead is an obvious target of disdain. Stay with Pollyanna awhile and watch her reform all the bitter, crusty malcontents on the planet into fans with a straightforward logic and uncanny point of view.  A true heroine.","user":"kimmie5","rank":[49,54]}]
