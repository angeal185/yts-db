[{"title":"exceptional film about relationships and an arkansas community","rating":10,"date":"4 October 2015","review":"we saw this film last nite as part of the woodstock film festival and was quite impressed with everything. usually i want to edit out a lot of most movies i see-- but this film \"blew us away.\" It had a tight script with excellent acting and cinematography. the music central to the film was complementary and not overwhelming.. A refreshing indie film without the numerous product placements of Hollywood.<br><br>the film gave you a real sense of relationships-father- son, race in arkansas-- both from a white and black perspective. the film was shot in the hometown of the director and you really felt the sense of community.. It felt realistic enough to be a docudrama in the best sense.<br><br>we all left the theater in an uplifted mood wanting to hear more music from jake la botz and hoping the film will get a major release so many of our friends can share our enjoyment.. see this film if you can you won't be disappointed..","user":"scspurple","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Chugging along","rating":6,"date":"14 December 2018","review":"Amazing low keyed story with a dramatic twist and truth be told crafty ending..","user":"fmwongmd","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Great movie but it is not what you think","rating":10,"date":"16 January 2019","review":"I am not a religious person. I will start by stating that. The movie was excellent as long as you are a deep thinker. My husband would have never been able to watch this. I thought it was brilliant. The movie definitely does not play out the way you would assume based on the trailer and comcast description.","user":"bobjs36","rank":[1,2]}]
