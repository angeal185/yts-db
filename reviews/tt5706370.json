[{"title":"Dinklage in a cuckoo's nest","rating":9,"date":"14 September 2017","review":"\"Three Christs\" was a last minute choice of mine at the TIFF. As a big Dinklage's fan, and considering that it was a world premiere, it was easy enough to go check it out. I'm glad I did. This movie is one about the brain and its struggles, but it does so with a big heart. It's funny and touching with a good balance, and the acting is top notch (I'm actually a bigger Dinklage's fan after the movie). The underlying themes about psychiatry as science and its potential negative effect on personality, the nature of identity, the complex interaction of desire and fear are inhabiting the film and are as relevant today as they were at the time. In summary, a great entertaining movie with a deeper layer... and a stellar Dinklage!","user":"laurent-milot","rank":[61,78]},{"title":"Emotional and moving","rating":9,"date":"12 January 2020","review":"I rated this so high because I work in mental health and it connects with me but to the everyday person I would say allow this film to unfold, it has very believable character performances which are easy to follow and as the film progresses you become attached to","user":"james-31978","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Great movie","rating":10,"date":"11 January 2020","review":"I am not familiar with the book.
