[{"title":"Good & Bad News About The \"Birdman\"","rating":9,"date":"24 September 2005","review":"GOOD NEWS: This is a riveting film start-to-finish, which is hard to do considering it runs over two hours. Burt Lancaster, one of the better actors, perhaps, of all time, gives a tremendous and very memorable performance. It's a clich√© but this IS one story you will not forget!<br><br>Director John Frrankenheimer also is one of the best ever. Check out his resume, if you question that last statement. He has some masterful camera shots in here. In addition to the talents of the director and main actor, you have Karl Malden,Thelma Ritter, Telly Savalas and Edmond O'Brien - no slouches they - in solid supporting roles. The DVD also helps highlight the wonderful black-and-white photography.<br><br>Most prison stories are bleak and depressing. This one is not. Oh, it has some melodrama and a few tough scenes which include prison violence, but generally it is a fascinating character study....and, even for those of you who are not bird lovers, full of interesting information about our feathered friends. How they trained the birds to do some things in here also is amazing.<br><br>BAD NEWS: What a disappointment to do some research about the real \"birdman,\" Robert Stroud. It turns out, as other reviewers have noted, the man was a sleaze-bag. No sense going into details since some of them are simply revolting. For those who simply want to remember this as a great movie and a great performance by Lancaster, do yourself a favor and leave it at that. In this case, ignorance IS bliss!","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[77,86]},{"title":"Excellent Example of a Sadly Lost Film-making Style","rating":8,"date":"9 January 2005","review":"\"Birdman of Alcatraz\" depicts a fictionalized version of the life of Robert Stroud, a real prisoner who served a life sentence in various American prisons, including Alcatraz.<br><br>As other viewers have commented, the film fictionalizes the life of the real Robert Stroud, who was a murderer and who has been accused of being a pedophile, as well.<br><br>This fictionalization should not interfere with an intelligent viewer's enjoyment of a fine film.<br><br>Too, this fictionalization doesn't change the key features of Stroud's case -- a bad man, a man who is shown on screen to be a real murderer, was condemned to death by the state. That much is true from Stroud's real life story, and that much is shown in the film.<br><br>Stroud was a difficult person who did not treat other people decently. That much was true of the real Stroud and that is shown in the film.<br><br>Stroud's mother pled for his life and President Woodrow Wilson commuted his sentence to life. A warden, aware of how difficult Stroud was to control, declared that Stroud be kept in segregation. That much is true in Stroud's real life story, and that is depicted in the film.<br><br>Finally, Stroud became noteworthy for his research and writing on canaries, after he found an injured bird in the recreation yard. That much was true in Stroud's life, and that is shown in the film.<br><br>Those who argue that the film is not as accurate as it could be have a point, but the film does follow the facts outlined above.<br><br>The film is quiet, and black and white, and yet riveting.<br><br>It is an example of a kind of film-making that is sadly lost today. The film attempts a serious discussion of serious issues: the value of a man, the death penalty, the role of prisons, their wardens and guards, the possibility of human connection, even under conditions of relative isolation. Stroud makes some human contact with his guard, and with a fellow inmate he communicates with via tapping.<br><br>The film is riveting because its entire cast has a kind of star power that is hard to find today. Even given his quiet, surly performance in this black and white film, you can't take your eyes off of Burt Lancaster. The supporting cast is equally excellent.<br><br>This film is a must for anyone interested in cinematic treatments of prisons, of the death penalty, of questions of human worth, even the worth of persons who display their lack of worth in, almost, their every act, and, the kind of films of the late fifties and early sixties that provided intelligent discussions of social issues.<br><br>It's also a great movie if you just want to be entertained.","user":"Danusha_Goska","rank":[71,79]},{"title":"Who cares about truth! Birdman Of Alcatraz 1962 is fabulous.","rating":9,"date":"4 March 2008","review":"This is a loose telling story of Robert Franklin Stroud (Burt Lancaster) who became known as The Birdman Of Alcatraz.<br><br>Have to say I have avoided this film for years purely because of its leading man, but before you Burt Lancaster fans jump on me let me say here and now that I'm now very much a convert these days. A dear on line friend of mine convinced me to check out some of his work last year after they found out I wasn't all that impressed with him, so after watching Atlantic City and his supreme film noirs, I was quickly back in line. This one landed from the rental folk strangely after me enjoying Lancaster in The Unforgiven only last week.<br><br>A strange thing with prison films is that few of them actually capture the oppressive feel of incarceration, so when I see one that does, then I'm very over the moon. Director John Frankenheimer manages to put the viewer in with Stroud because the pace is perfect, it's meant to be slow, prison time is slow time, the film is always close and intimate to give you the feel of being there. This film, much like two other greats from the genre in Papillon &amp; Escape From Alcatraz, needs its lead actor to be restrained yet brood with menace, and Lancaster delivers from the top draw here. How unfortunate for him that he should turn in a fantastic turn in the same year that Atticus &amp; Lawrence were dazzling cinema goers. The film never veers into over sentimental slumber because there is much more going on with Stroud, be it his Mother, business acumen, or the political fall out of this murderous man's time in prison.<br><br>Watching such macho men like Lancaster &amp; Savalas grow fond of our feathered friends is priceless and brings about scenes that are both touching and poignant at the same time. Whatever the distortion of the facts as regards Robert Stroud's penal life, one thing we do know is that he made an official impact and it makes for one hell of a story. Added bonus here is that you've got Frankenheimer directing deftly in his black &amp; white style, aided considerably by the smart cinematography from Burnett Guffey. And of course from a memorable performance from Big Bad Burt.<br><br>I was so impressed I ordered it for my own collection. 9/10","user":"hitchcockthelegend","rank":[32,35]}]
