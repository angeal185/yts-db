[{"title":"Honestly, not THAT bad...","rating":12,"date":"12 May 2004","review":"Taken for what it is, a pre-teen flick featuring the wealthiest 17-years olds in type-cast roles ever, the movie is not terrible.  It's no work of art, nor will it be nominated for any awards, but it is entertaining, which is all anyone can expect it to be.  It definitely isn't being advertised as anything else.<br><br>More than anything, it's silly and allows a girl to giggle at the crazy antics of two sisters caught up in more than they can handle in New York City.  A fun story of mayhem and mischief, it is far from the worst movie out this season (have you SEEN \"Van Helsing\"? I rest my case).<br><br>Maybe it's not worth spending $9 on a movie ticket, but it would be a fun rental. :-)","user":"gmglader","rank":[49,62]},{"title":"Great Family Movie","rating":18,"date":"18 June 2004","review":"I thought this was a good movie. Its not fair to compare it to \"Mean Girls.\" Although I like Lindsay Lohan, Mean Girls is intended for a different age group. My daughter is 10 and loved \"Freaky Friday\", but I feel \"Mean Girls\" has too much sexual content for that age. \"New York Minute\" is aimed for the \"tween age\" group. There aren't enough of these kinds of movies out. Its either cartoon-like movies, which this age thinks are not cool enough for them, or right to sex and violence. The New York Minute is an in-between kind of movie that we need to fill the gap for this age group. The people who are saying \"this is so predictable\" and \"we have already seen that kinda movie before\" are not the target audience. Yes, we older ones have seen this plot many times before, but our kids have not. Even if we let them see the movies that are similar, they were based in the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, etc., so the trends and such will be harder for them to relate to. Mary Kate and Ashley have not surrendered to pressure to include sex and violence in their movies and I say good for them. This is a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy and get a lot of laughs. If there were more movies like this, maybe our young wouldn't be so prone to grow up so fast, and actually still enjoy being with their families.","user":"donna-109","rank":[42,55]},{"title":"It is what it is","rating":10,"date":"9 May 2004","review":"If you like Mary-Kate and Ashley's previous movies than I'm sure you'll enjoy this one as well.  I gave it a 10/10 because it is what it is and shouldn't be judged for anything more.<br><br>The Olsen's produce family friendly movies which are enjoyable for what they are. I'm 22 and love their movies because they are fun and innocent. They don't run around in the film in cleavage/midriff bearing shirts or ultra-mini skirts, acting like complete bimbos in order for guys to think they're sexy, like most teenage actors do.  In most movies of theirs, one plays a very upstanding, conservative person who dreams of academic achievement and the other is more wild and likes to enjoy life to its fullest.<br><br>Why bother seeing it if you hate these kinds of movies? It makes no sense at all why most people who have voted or commented here at imdb even saw it in the first place (most I find didn't go at all).<br><br>Think about it... if all you read are sports magazines, why would you pick up a Harlequinn romance?","user":"phoenix999","rank":[54,88]}]
