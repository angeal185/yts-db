[{"title":"It wasn't that bad!","rating":7,"date":"7 January 2007","review":"I just saw this and I had extraordinarily low expectations, but I actually enjoyed it a lot more than I thought it would.<br><br>I thought the \"Scarier than Hostel!\" bit that they were using to promote it was corny and dumb, because a lot of people, including me, hated Hostel. But Turistas is better viewed when you're not expecting it to be that great. There were a few parts I thought were somewhat dumb, but the acting isn't bad. All of the actors are in their late 20's to early 30's, which I thought was good because I did NOT want to see another dumb teen-driven horror flick. But I don't see Turistas as a horror movie. It was a thriller that was actually somewhat scary, which is something that suspense movies these days lack terribly.<br><br>The parts I didn't like about it were overlookable. Like in the underwater scenes, I thought the acting could have been a little better, but in the long run, Turistas isn't a failure. I think there are much worse movies that could be on the Bottom 100, like Lady In The Water, for example. So, if Turistas is showing now at a 2nd-run house near you, you should go see it. Hopefully you won't hate it as much as typical IMDb folk do. They're all idiots, anyway.","user":"iheart_ny","rank":[152,198]},{"title":"Trouble in Paradise","rating":5,"date":"18 January 2007","review":"I saw this movie despite it's bad rating, and I must say that it wasn't at all bad. Good production values, great soundtrack and a somewhat believable story. I think a lot of people would've found it better had they not expected a horror movie. Sure there's blood and guts in it, but it's more of an adventure-movie in the sense that the good-guys, bad-guys ratio evens things up. What it does lack however is a satisfying ending and a subplot that would given an added depth to the characters. I still think it deserves a 5 rating as it's different than most movies, it doesn't follow the standard 'stupid-people walking straight into doom' recipe. It's beautifully shot at locations that I'd love to see in real life. It did get a notch or two higher for the effort. If the last 15 minutes of it had been a bit more scary and gruesome I'd definitely would've given it a 6 or a 7. If you are after a Texas Chainsaw-kind of deal you are most likely looking in the wrong direction, but if you are not, then this might tickle the fright in you just enough for it to be worth renting.","user":"henrik-225","rank":[55,68]},{"title":"I've seen a lot worse","rating":5,"date":"18 April 2007","review":"A group of backpacking tourists are vacationing in Brazil. Their bus breaks down and they're greeted by some very unpleasant locals. Even though the acting wasn't up to par and the story was trite, unoriginal, and clich√©, there was a few scenes that work for this movie. The Underwater cavern being the most obvious standout. I also really liked that the ending didn't go the extremely over-done route of leaving it open for a sequel (which is,by the way, the MOST overused idea in all of Horrordom) The movie doesn't stand up to multiple viewings at all. But it was a suitably enough rainy day time-waster. Not as bad as it you'd think.<br><br>My Grade: C <br><br>Eye Candy: Lucy Ramos shows T&amp;A; and Beau Garrett gets topless","user":"movieman_kev","rank":[32,39]}]
