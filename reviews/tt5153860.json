Who would have thought we'd be at the point where someone thinks it's a good idea to make a politically correct insult to the most amazing movie in history. I am going to watch Fight Club 10 times now to get this crap out of my head.<br><br>I would seriously consider joining a fight club if I could dish some revenge out on the creators of this hideous piece-of-crap-of-a-\"movie.\"<br><br>Don't waste your time. Sharknado is a blockbuster hit compared to this.","user":"mbeau88","rank":[44,69]},{"title":"OMG Dont Watch","rating":1,"date":"24 February 2018","review":"This is utterly a poor attempt to show women in a position of power and strength--which in turns does nothing but insults them. This is not a movie worth watching. The attempt to show that women can fight and be tough is a total miss in this film. I've seen other films that do a better job in portraying women as strong and battle ready. This film looks like a failed attempt to soft porn with poor acting. The dialogue is horrible, the 'anger', the 'sense of injustice' all is forced. The fight scenes---ugh--seen better fight scenes in a high school play! Don't waste your time.","user":"dnzspecop","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"worse movie ...","rating":1,"date":"25 February 2018","review":"Worse movie worse fight i have ever seen in Decades .. just waste of time totally Garbage ...Honestly even 1 star is also too much .","user":"tensang","rank":[7,13]}]
