[{"title":"Utterly hilarious!","rating":10,"date":"30 July 2017","review":"Well, these kinds of mockumentaries can be a bit hit and miss. Suffice it to say that this one is simply brilliant. I was laughing out loud the whole way through. <br><br>The cast is stellar and they have a riot. Who knew Cena could do comedy so well? Orlando Bloom was hilarious and I didn't recognise him at first! Tyson really have poke fun at himself, too.<br><br>The running gag, involving a certain well-known cyclist is really well done, too.<br><br>I think HBO may have struck a rich seam here. There are all kinds of sports stories that could be hilarious mockumentaries if they let Andy Sambergh loose on them.<br><br>Really, watch this!","user":"npvarley","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Absolutely hilarious","rating":10,"date":"8 July 2017","review":"It's like 30 for 30 meets Saturday night live. Outstanding cast with a very funny cameo from Lance Armstrong. It has a lot of full frontal nudity and crude jokes so if that's not your thing maybe you won't like it. I wish it were longer but every bit of the run time is full of laughs. If you enjoyed 7 days in hell then you'll love this also.","user":"wildturkeywill","rank":[24,32]},{"title":"A Must-Watch","rating":9,"date":"10 July 2017","review":"This is the funniest movie I have seen all year. Though I am not a fan of mockumentaries, this one had me constantly laughing out loud. The jokes hit and they just kept coming. The absurdity was so hilarious because in a way it wasn't so far away from reality. The cast was spectacular funny, and Lance Armstrong playing himself was the cherry on top.<br><br>I can only recommend \"Tour de Pharmacy\". Well done HBO!","user":"UPCritic","rank":[20,29]}]
