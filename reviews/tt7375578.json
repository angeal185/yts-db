[{"title":"Thought it was very entertaining","rating":9,"date":"30 April 2018","review":"I thought this movie was great. I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews. I watched it with 5 buddies and we all thought it was pretty clever. The cinematography was fantastic and I loved the characters. I would definitely recommend this film.","user":"joshh-37918","rank":[24,40]},{"title":"convict on the run","rating":6,"date":"30 April 2018","review":"Two inept deputies go after an escaped convict in the adirondacks. the movie is going for dark humor. it doesn't really work, but I have seen a lot worse movies. the very low rating is not really deserved.","user":"cdcrb","rank":[10,16]},{"title":"It's beyond me....","rating":2,"date":"10 May 2018","review":"...but the scenery is very scenic; the music is quite tuneful. Two stars.\nWords fail me. This is an abysmal movie. Devoid of humour. Surely this should go straight to video.","user":"mallaverack","rank":[14,27]}]
