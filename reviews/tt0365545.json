[{"title":"Great movie about finding ones self","rating":10,"date":"21 September 2018","review":"This isn't a movie just about hair. This movie is about a women who finds herself. It's a movie based on upon the deconstruction of African-American women fitting in to societal standards of what beauty is. The hair is a metaphor for African-American women who continuebeing someone they are not. By cutting her her she found out more about herself and her culture/ancestral roots. She freed all worries, stress, and anxieties that has been placed upon her shoulders. It's similar to the song by India.Arie \"I am not my hair.\"","user":"cameronterrell-91186","rank":[69,89]},{"title":"Black Hair Matters","rating":8,"date":"21 September 2018","review":"Someone else questioned how they could make a movie about a woman's hair. Well, they didn't. This movie isn't about one woman's hair. This movie is about black women's hair, and what it's like for black women to live in a world where they're stigmatized because of their hair. Where they're considered unprofessional and uncivilized if they don't straighten it. <br><br>I guess you have to actually be a black woman to relate to this film. But you shouldn't have to be a black woman to be able to empathize with black women. When the world is the way it is, we need movies like this. Black women need movies like this. Black women deserve movies like this.<br><br>Also, you know, it's a sweet and heartwarming movie, it goes places and doesn't end the way you think. I liked it.","user":"alexwebb32","rank":[66,88]},{"title":"Wow, all about image.","rating":6,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"It's amazing how hard we try to fit into a unattainable mold of perfection. People really do not care how we look or feel. We are our own person. We all need to remember that we are the captain of our ship.\nThis movie is a perfect example of how we let society dictate how we look and feel about ourself, screw them.\nLove yourself and only yourself and the rest will follow.\nI am a 64 year old white woman with thin hair. I have always worn my hair short up until the last 10 years. I thought that longer hair is what men wanted. I am going down to the salon and getting this thin crappy hair cut off to please myself and only myself.\nThat being said, live your life to please only yourself other than to make others happy. You only have this one life, live it for yourself.\nI think this movie is a wake up call for all people, not just women in general. Love yourself.","user":"Msbnitski","rank":[19,23]}]
