[{"title":"The Flamingo Kid","rating":13,"date":"13 May 1999","review":"Charming comedy from Garry Marshall starring Dillon as a Brooklyn teenager taken aback by the smooth lifestyles at a posh beach club. At the club he meets swift characters like car dealer Richard Crenna, in a wonderful role and the lovely Janet Jones, before the Gretzky. Hector Elizondo is also stand out as Dillon's father. Marshall also wrote the script for the film and it flows with heart and humor all the way through.","user":"Coxer99","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Delightful, some great dialogue too","rating":9,"date":"24 November 2001","review":"This Matt Dillon vehicle serves as the light-hearted equivalent to \"A Bronx Tale.\"  Richard Crenna plays the Chazz Palmentieri role as the idolized kingpin and Hector Elizondo plays the Robert DeNiro role of the honorable working class father.  There is some memorable dialogue, cute humor, and distinctive card playing (the upside down fan).  But, best of all, are the coming of age lessons that are taught to Dillon's character about values, hard work, and summer romance.  In the latter category, the movie is aided immensely by the refreshing debut of Janet Jones (now best known as Mrs. Wayne Gretsky).  I recommend this without reservation!","user":"wdemurjian","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Stands the Test of Time","rating":10,"date":"9 November 2005","review":"This movie was so great when it came out and is still great. I just watched it again 20 years later! Wow, has it been that long???? Charming story of a very bright young man Jeffrey Willis who has a bright future as an engineer. His father, a plumber wants to see his son become a success and wants him to stay on this path, but the summer before Jeffrey is to go off to college rather than working in an office he gets a job as first a parking lot attendant, and then quickly promoted to cabana boy at a fancy long island beach club. He is so enamoured with the lifestyle of these rich folks and especially impressed by Phil Brody, who made his fortune in luxury cars and feels he's found a new mentor.<br><br>Despite the fact that he is merely the cabana boy he really feels this is the life he wants to live. He looks at his Brooklyn roots and feels somewhat ashamed, and wants this life of luxury to start right now. Mr. Brody is also impressed by Jeffrey who is very smart, and a go getter. He shows Jeffrey \"the ropes\" and a new way of life. He even offers him a job as a salesman at one of his shops. Jeffrey is all ready to say F college! He now wants to be like his hero, Phil Brody, who also is the reigning king of the gin games at the club.<br><br>The movie is so old, but I won't spoil for you how it ends except to say that his illusions are pretty much shattered.<br><br>Great film. Great performance by a very young, very cute Matt Dillon.","user":"missygoldstein","rank":[11,15]}]
