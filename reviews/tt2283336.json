[{"title":"A new hire, \"MARY SUE\" who instantly knows everything and solves all the clues.","rating":7,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"OK, basically a woman wants to join MIB because as a 9 year old she sees a baby alien and two men in black show up and use a neuralizer on her parents' memory. The movie has nice effects, music, and action.\nSTORY:\nTwenty-two years later she finds the MIB home base, talks her way into being a probationary agent and in a few hours solves the case by finding EVERY clue while the male agents stand around with their mouths open, make mistake after mistake, and Agent H (Hemsworth) is worse than useless. He is totally incompetent and the other agents keep asking why he was never fired.\nSUPER WOMEN:\nFinally, in the end, another FEMALE agent shows up and makes Hemsworth the boss for no reason I can see. All he did was watch a MARY SUE, who from the first minute knows everything, every weapon, every device, and is instantly best buds with every alien she encounters. The moment Agent \"M\" steps off the elevator, she is never shocked by what she encounters, or surprised, or at a loss for words or actions. The entire MIB agency (other than techs) could just close down and let her run the show. She is the PERFECT SOCIAL JUSTICE SUPER WOMAN.","user":"adaringdo-1","rank":[681,1]},{"title":"Perhaps The Worst MIB Movie Ever","rating":4,"date":"24 June 2019","review":"Rating 4.5/10\nPerhaps the worst MIB movie ever. Slow,mess and weak !! Good effect but very lousy story. The greatest thing i can never forget is Chris Hemsworth a.k.a Agent H. Because he so handsome. Please dont waste your money on this film.","user":"ymyuseda","rank":[720,1]},{"title":"Forgot what made it successful","rating":3,"date":"12 June 2019","review":"The original 97 film is a classic. It was well written and acted. It knew exactly what it was and that made it great. The sequels were more CGI action than writing. More convoluted plots and more 'hey look who is in this movie' stuff. This installment is no different. Loud CGI fest with a story that is so all over the place it doesn't know what it is. I think with a better writer/director and less actiony stuff this could have been a decent film. After 112 min, I was left still wondering what the heck was happening and why.","user":"chip-heads","rank":[657,1]}]
