LMAO!<br><br>A girl in Ireland is inspired by Ali so much that she wants to fight boys?","user":"hiacios","rank":[7,14]},{"title":"Beautiful Hearfelt","rating":10,"date":"9 February 2020","review":"A beautiful portrayal of the life and hardships of the Irish Traveler/Tinkers and the life and kinship of the clan. The love is real. This touched my soul and heart. If you have no Irish in you, you will probably not feel it. Great and beautiful film. The photography and beautiful Ireland I was never able to get to in my lifetime","user":"mariuchka","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"A nice little film","rating":7,"date":"19 January 2020","review":"This film should be a lesson for little girls and boys. A family with a history of tragedy are reunited with the father. At a time when womyn were expected to be quiet, pregnant and in the kitchen, some womyn started to say no. This young lady is finding out who she truly is in beautiful rural Ireland. It is nice to see the strength of some womyn being portrayed in this way. The world I live in, most womyn are willing to knock a man who is out of line on his arse so any talk of being unrealistic is laughable. Only a very little man would have his insecurities rattled by this film.","user":"jraychretien","rank":[2,7]}]
