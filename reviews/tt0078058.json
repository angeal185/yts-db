[{"title":"So, THIS is my favourite Bud Spencer movie","rating":9,"date":"27 December 2003","review":"I used to watched about 100 times this film, and I'll never forget the Firpo brothers, Nynfus and his band (especially Bugsy), the blonde girl and Parapolis with his broken nose. Great characters, memorable quotes, good music, and the funniest Bud Spencer &amp; Terence Hill film of all time. If you like these Italian movies, don't miss it. This film was my favourite film when I was young. If you had already seen this movie, come on, watch it again nostalgically.","user":"dolphlundgren","rank":[44,48]},{"title":"Best ever, do not miss","rating":10,"date":"27 December 2017","review":"I have watched this movie since the age of 8 uncountable times and it is today the constant element of our New Years' party. To underline the epicness of the movie: every scene is postable to Facebook and very single sentence should be written onto a T-Shirt and sold on the street. Only one mystery is left for me: The Hungarian dubbing is spectacular - but English? :D Keep watching it in Hungarian!","user":"nbenyo","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"A classic to me!","rating":9,"date":"30 October 2006","review":"\"Odds &amp; Evens\" stands out as one of my favorite Spencer/Hill movies. Even though the storyline might be a bit weak and the movie is notably low-budget, it's still entertaining to the maximal. Excellent acting from Spencer and Hill, performing in their usual unique style that they always do in their movies, and of course; the classic fight scenes (never get's old!). Classic Spencer/Hill stuff! It might drag on for a bit long though, but in overall, this movie is excellent! Recommended to both new and old fans! This was one of the first movies I saw with them and it still remains as one of my favorites! I'll rate it 4.5/5. Great show!","user":"Hvalross","rank":[21,28]}]
