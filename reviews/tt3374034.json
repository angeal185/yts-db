[{"title":"Pure Fanatsy, bad acting and no real facts","rating":1,"date":"25 June 2015","review":"Using D grade actors to perpetuate lies and smears shows just how desperate Channel 9, Freemantle media, Eamonn Duff and Allen and Unwinn are. This movie was based on Eamonn Duff's book which has been proved to be defamatory. The whole movie was dull and boring and didn't include the real facts! Seems Duff was told told to pulp the book by a judge because they defamed the Corby family. Denise Roberts d grade acting of Rosleigh is so overplayed with her screaming like a banchee with no emotion as that of Mrs Corby who showed raw emotion at the horrific sentence of her innocent daughter. Pure fantasy is all I got out of this movie. Can't wait for the REAL movie on Schapelle, heads will roll :)","user":"jimthomson-76425","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Atrocious Katherine Thomson","rating":28,"date":"28 May 2017","review":"I think Katherine reacted to the rising interest rates on her mortage and wrote the biggest crock I have ever seen on television!! It is bordering on litigous, and is bad just in quality. Who picked htese actors by the way?<br><br>Shame job Katherine, shameful screenplay!","user":"johnnyharding","rank":[2,3]}]
