[{"title":"Welcome back Nicolas........","rating":8,"date":"6 November 2016","review":"Gary Faulkner, an unemployed handyman, and modern day Don Quixote receives a vision from God telling him to capture Osama bin Laden. <br><br>Armed with only a sword purchased from a home-shopping network, Gary travels to Pakistan to complete his mission. <br><br>While on his quest, Gary encounters old friends back home in Colorado, new friends he makes in Pakistan, the enemies he makes at the CIA -- and even God and Bin Laden themselves.........<br><br>Say whatever you want about Nicolas Cage, but he when he can be bothered, he is one of the most awe-inspiring actors Hollywood has seen in a very long time. Unfortunately for his housekeeping, he has starred in more than his fair share of terrible films.<br><br>So it's such a relief that Cage is back to his maniacal best, and he hasn't been this good since Port Of Call New Orleans.<br><br>His characters traits and the way he explains situations and theories is what really endears you to Faulkner's quest. Yes, we all know that he may have delusions of grandeur, and maybe the dialysis, or lack of is causing him to hallucinate, but you cannot help but hope that he completes his quest.<br><br>Depending on whether you like Brand or not, him playing God needs to be taken with a huge pinch of salt, because it's nothing more than Brand in a white sheet. <br><br>Yes, he can be pretty terrorising toward Gary, but they missed a trick not picking someone like Michael Shannon for that role, it would have added so much more edge to the narrative.<br><br>There are times when it's frustrating, times when it's laugh out loud funny, but no matter what the narrative gives you, one cannot deny the fact that Cage has really put some effort and research into his role, and it's wonderful to see him not coasting.<br><br>Keep it up Nic...","user":"FlashCallahan","rank":[21,24]},{"title":"Come on! Not THAT bad","rating":7,"date":"3 November 2016","review":"Is the depiction of Pakistan good? Probably not. Is the biography accurate? Let's say \"inspired by real events\". Is this the best comedy of the year? Probably not.<br><br>But, Nicolas Cage is above his own average, there is a story to tell and supporting cast do a decent job. In a sense the movie captures the spirit of the character if not the facts, the pacing is acceptable and eventually your viewing experience will be pleasant even if uneventful. Photography and editing are decent and the overall result is a slightly better than average comedy.<br><br>It's a full six and a third adjusted to seven to counterbalance the over criticism of my exigent fellow reviewers. There's a lot worse around!<br><br>Now, I've tried to carefully avoid mentioning Russel Brand (GOD) so far. That's because his acting is really terrible and his small but essential part brings down the whole to an annoyed five at best. What I've done is to imagine Steve Carrel playing God the whole time and trick my brain. No, I did NOT use drugs, it's a natural brain self defence technique.","user":"lokilfa","rank":[39,49]},{"title":"Very cute, quirky comedy","rating":8,"date":"21 December 2016","review":"There's Hollywood action star Nic Cage. There's multifaceted, serious actor Nic Cage. And then there's wacky, experimental Nic Cage. <br><br>Nic Cage goes back to his roots in smaller quirky comedies and explodes off the screen in every scene. He's in almost every scene and, while the script is mediocre, Cage elevates what would've been a forgettable C-movie into a fun and funny B-movie. This is proof that Cage is better than ever and capable of A+ material. Hope this is a sign of a comeback.<br><br>Its no Raising Arizona or Vampire's Kiss, but its good fluff. I think it was directed well enough but the script was too bare and the editing was a little sloppy. Cage has the most meat with his role and none of the other performers have much to do but react to him, instead of play off him. Would've been great to see Cage riff with these very funny and improv style performers, especially Rainn Wilson. Cage will make more comedies tho.","user":"quridley","rank":[20,26]}]
