[{"title":"Not as good as the first two","rating":6,"date":"15 March 2006","review":"Alien 3 was a letdown of a sort when compared to both Alien and Aliens, classics in their own right. Sigourney Weaver returns as does Lance Hendriksen in two different roles. But even though Weaver is there, the movie just doesn't have the same power as the first two films.<br><br>Ripley (Weaver) crash lands on a prison planet and is taken in by a doctor (Charles Dance). But the Alien has followed her again in a different way, and goes about destroying the inhabitants of the planet. Once again its up to Ripley to destroy the monster.<br><br>The acting in this film was pretty good, and the visuals are amazing, but this movie, as directed by David Fincher, is way too dark and depressing when compared to the first and second films. This film leaves us with no real hope for anyone. Yes there are some genuine scares to be found here, and like I said the film has a good look to go with quality acting. Too bad that the director took it down this despairing road with a horrible ending that I never could accept.<br><br>When compared to the first two movies, this film is second rate. However, it is still much better than Alien Resurrection which followed. That movie, to me, was a waste of time and money.","user":"freaky_dave","rank":[315,326]},{"title":"bad timing (editing problems?)","rating":7,"date":"5 May 2001","review":"I saw this movie for the third time now and I hoped that I might enjoy it a little bit more than the first two times. But, though I really did my best to like it, I was disappointed again.<br><br>But then, there are moments when I thought: hey, this could be very good, but it just doesn't work, it just doesn't touch me at all, so what is wrong with it? Maybe I just don't see it the way it is intended?<br><br>\nAfter all this is I think the truth about this movie: like it is, you can't see it the way it is intended.<br><br>I just can't believe that someone who directed such a solid and compact movie as Se7en, could make such a horrible mistake: there is no story, there is no center, the whole thing just falls apart in pieces when you watch it.<br><br>\nI think this is due to some wrong editing (and maybe this was caused by a not thoroughly thought trough scenario, but that I can't say). There were several moments when I thought: hey, why is this happening now, it should happen minutes ago and moments when I thought: why is this happening right now, it just spoils the enjoyment of suspense, they should show this way later in the movie. And there were scenes I thought: my God, why didn't they cut this piece away, it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.<br><br>\nLike the 'running scenes' closing to the end: you just can't make head nor tale of it, they're just running around, while you never get what they're plan actually is and how they would like to make it work. You just wait till they're done and get on with the 'story'. This is just annoying as it is. But I think what the director meant was to create this feeling of being lost in endless tunnels without ever really seeing it from a bird's view, to run and hope you will get somewhere, with only the help of your fear and the intuition it brings with it. Done well, this could prove to be some really exciting and nerve-cracking sequence, a real build-up to the grand finale.<br><br>\nThere were also moments when I thought the music was kicking in way too early or too late, making it some kind of a mere commentary instead of accompanying and enforcing the action (like it is so well done in Star Wars or The X-files just to name a few).<br><br>I think a better editing could make this movie a whole new experience, getting things at the right moments and making it one whole again, like it proved possible with \"Blade Runner\". I for one wouldn't mind to see it one more time, but only the way it was probably intended, so I hope they will give the director a chance to remake this movie and to prove that it is a good one after all.","user":"sezai_crane","rank":[305,316]},{"title":"Missing one thing:","rating":17,"date":"17 November 2002","review":"Intrigue. In Alien, the characters don't know what they're getting into and the only reason the audience knows is because 1. The trailers, 2. the Title and 3. by now everyone knows the reputation of the film . . . and it was good. In Aliens the characters know the creature, and declare war neglecting to calculate the possible numbers they face . . . and it was good. In Alien 3 we get a prison. \"But they're not prepared! That's the intrigue,\" you say to which I would answer, \"If they were prepared there *couldn't* be a film. They'd take out the Alien in 10 minutes.\"<br><br>Alien 3 just cannot compete with its predecessors. The film is 'okay' and it's up against two of the most influential sci-fi horror films by Ridley Scott (the director with the slickest style) and James Cameran (one of the best action directors) scores composed by the legendary Goldsmith and Horner. . . Alien 3 has David Fincher and Elliot Goldenthal. Fincher is a good director, but outclassed by Scott &amp; Cameran; Goldenthall has yet to impress me with one of his scores, and has yet to not annoy me with one of his \"sequel\" scores (Batman Forever &amp; Batman &amp; Robin come to mind). <br><br>The uninteresting premise of the film, the uninteresting setting, uninteresting characters, uninteresting story in the end just kill the film.<br><br>More effort seemed to go into shaving Weaver's head than making the script good. And, I'm sorry, but the handful of well crafted scenes where Ripley is emotionally torn, or faces a difficult decision--the whole 3 scenes in the film what have a valid 'deeper meaning' does not save the 90% of the film that is boring and stale. <br><br>Many people found the jump from Aliens to Alien 3, the return to one alien and the fate of the survivors from Aliens unforgivable. I'm somewhat torn--I don't mind such things happening if the new route is good. The route chosen for Alien 3 was mediocre, and so the break from its predecessors did come across more disappointing. Change is not always good; change for the sake of change is typically bad. Alien 3 is a good example of this. <br><br>In the end, all of the elements of the film are mediocre to good with the exception of the script which did not live up to standards. Hence, the film is overall just \"okay.\" But after the caliber of its predecessors, Alien 3 really is a disappointment in terms of quality.","user":"jaywolfenstien","rank":[419,436]}]
