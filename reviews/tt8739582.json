[{"title":"Great film","rating":10,"date":"2 July 2019","review":"I truly enjoyed Sell By. I found it insightful and thought provoking, yet still laugh out loud funny at moments. This film is well worth your time to watch, and may even cause you to think about relationships, gay and heterosexual, in ways you have not before!","user":"riddellronnie","rank":[16,23]},{"title":"Deserves A Better Rating","rating":8,"date":"12 April 2020","review":"I guess in order to get a decent rating for a movie involving gay men it has to include half naked chiselled bodies accompanied by that one homophobe character who comes along to shake things up. Haven't we evolved into wanting more for our gay characters and wanting to actually see and relate to a long term relationship between two men. This movie has its faults but deserves more credit than what it seems to be getting. It's nice to see two men in a long term relationship trying to navigate the ups and downs of what they want their future to look like together.","user":"pparkerhasanemail","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Happy times","rating":9,"date":"4 April 2020","review":"This is an ensemble picture. I love those. And this film is a great demonstration of how an ensemble can work together to tie many threads together. A group of Manhattanites meet others and chemistry dictates reactions. Not always easy or immediate. Someone says that relationships are hard work. True. But if we work for them the results are worth the effort and more so. And here I am with cliches when there is hardly one in this fine movie. Surprises ensue. The tension holds to the very end and then fireworks. Young, able actors and a loving writer/director.
