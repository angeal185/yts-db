[{"title":"classic oldies, slapdash binder makes an uneven show","rating":5,"date":"5 September 2005","review":"MICKEYS MAGICAL Christmas's nice bits are the classic DISNEYS' XMAS CAROL, an older short featuring Chip and Dale, a new sequence based on the classic Nutcracker Ballet (Ludrig Von Drake's a peppy spoiler), and a Donald Duck and Nephews \"Holiday on Ice\". The vocals for all sequences work well, and the music is tuneful and energetic.<br><br>Unfortunately, the overseas-produced animation for the scenes binding the shorts together is extremely uneven. Baby-boomer's will be surprised by the Princess's screen bits being some of the weaker animation Disney has released.<br><br>Fine for little children's holiday entertainment, but baby-boomer's may encounter some disappointments.","user":"kurtanIMDBguy","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Some Good Moments","rating":7,"date":"12 December 2003","review":"First off, I thought all the animated shorts they played throughout this movie were great. 'Mickey's Christmas Carol' is one of my childhood favorites. 'Pluto's Christmas Tree' is another oldie and goodie. The two new cartoons were great too. It was pretty funny to see Donald being chased by an ice crack of all things in 'Donald on Ice.' And Disney's new rendition of 'The Nutcracker' was quite original and funny, especially with Donald playing the Mouse King (as you can tell, Donald is my favorite cartoon character).<br><br>It's the in-between part that's a little dicey. I'm a relatively new fan of the 'House of Mouse' series on Disney Channel, but truth be told, I was a little disappointed by this special. I could tell that many of the scenes were just taken from previous episodes.<br><br>Also, while I find most of the episodes to be pretty clever and funny, this one just seemed to be lacking some comedic pep. Maybe this was done to concentrate more on Christmas sentiment. However, I will say I was pleasantly surprised by the last musical number. I thought it would be pretty corny and sappy, but it turned out to have the right amount of heart, and it made me laugh when the villains participated.<br><br>So while it's not necessarily a Christmas classic, there are some moments throughout the movie I think you'll definitely enjoy.<br><br>My IMDb Rating: 7/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B (Good)","user":"travisimo","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"The movie was not a rip off","rating":9,"date":"9 January 2002","review":"Mickey's Magical Christmas was not a rip off.
