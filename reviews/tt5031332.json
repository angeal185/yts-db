[{"title":"A wealth of archive footage brings this documentary to life.","rating":8,"date":"18 May 2018","review":"A wealth of archive footage brings this documentary to life. The excitement of motor racing roaring from the screen. It's primal, simple, honest and very informative. Packed with all the charm of the era, Sixties swing and pure engineering dedicated to power with little thought for safety. It's lovingly put together and worth watching for the 1967 Can-Am race at Mossport alone. The highs were phenomenal. The lows, crushing. Bruce McLarens story is quite something and this really does it justice.","user":"garethcrook","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Great!","rating":10,"date":"11 January 2018","review":"Personally I haven't raced in about 20 years, but this film got me to dig up some\nold polaroid's of a McLaren MK8 I have that was for sale long ago.<br><br>It surprises me that Universal has put out this movie as it probably\nhas a limited audience, but it's so well done I hope it does. \nIntermixed with current restored McLaren's the documentary is a mix of \npast period videos, photos, and interviews, with good acting from the cast.<br><br>The dialog and comments from all the racing greats are terrific and there's\ndetails that few may know about this man and those around him. I was at the Mosport race that is highlighted and it was well documented here. Really enjoyable with a tough ending.","user":"scarlettdave","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Quite good!","rating":7,"date":"8 July 2019","review":"Recommended, even if you're not an F1 lover.\nThe good edition and punctual comments by the cast make this documentary a passionate review of the life of the legendary Bruce McLaren.","user":"azeemnavarro","rank":[3,4]}]
