[{"title":"50's space-age theme.","rating":11,"date":"11 October 2003","review":"Fans of rocket-age science fiction films will find interest in this wacky spoof.  The early 1950's saw the start of the atomic age rocket ship film genre with ROCKET X-M and DESTINATION MOON in 1950 and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE and FLIGHT TO MARS in 1951.  These movies were all hits and the trend lasted through the sixties with MAROONED and JOURNEY TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE SUN in 1969 (one year after 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY).  <br><br>In 1953 Abbott and Costello quickly updated their old vaudeville routines to capture a younger, modern audience and try their hand at this phenomena. They had success spoofing the horror genre with A&amp;C MEETS FRANKENSTEIN and A&amp;C MEETS THE INVISIBLE MAN a couple years earlier and the young audiences who had watched Universal's monster films were now watching rocket films and would soon be watching alien monsters devour entire cities.  Though flights to Mars were now a typical plot device, A&amp;C GO TO MARS was ahead of the game by going to Venus six years before FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS (1959)! <br><br>\nAbbott and Costello start off toward Mars but end up back on Earth during New Orleans Mardi Gras.  They are fooled by fanciful costumes with giant masks and believe they are on Mars.  Eventually they flee to Venus populated by beautiful women and all's well that ends well.<br><br>The production values were very good, considering that studios were rushing out poorly produced imitations of ROCKET X-M and DESTINATION MOON after their success.  After the quick patter routines of the duo that serviced them well in the forties had become so familiar to the audience it was refreshing to have them do something else.  Though certainly not a classic and not on the list of best A &amp; C films, for those tiring of the same routines this film is visually exciting filled with space-age fun, beautiful models and hilarious gags.  Kids love the film and older adults love the 50's space-age theme.  Grab the popcorn.","user":"SanDiego","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"Great fun for kids from 8 to 80; better than fans will tell you.","rating":9,"date":"18 April 2003","review":"This was one of the first movies I ever saw, well before television came to Australia. As a child I simply loved it, and I've not changed my views on the movie in the intervening four or more decades. It seems usual for fans of A &amp; C to deride the movie, but I rate it as the best they made after the end of the 1940s. Of course the SF aspects left me in awe at the time as I'd seen nothing like it. I even appreciated the Miss Universe entrants :) Even now the special effects seem pretty good for the period. The scenes aboard the space ship seem pretty silly, and did way back then, but that's the only glaring fault. One either loves or hates A&amp;C. Put me in the former group.","user":"opsbooks","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"Not the worst A & C film","rating":5,"date":"20 May 2007","review":"This film has been referred to numerous times as \"the worst of Abbott and Costello\". I haven't seen that many A &amp; C pictures so far, but from those that I HAVE seen I'd say \"Comin' Round the Mountain\" and \"Lost in Alaska\" and maybe even \"Meet the Keystone Kops\" are worse than this one, therefore the above statement cannot be true. The best thing about \"Go to Mars\" are the special effects, which are creative and at times even ingenious; before you complain about them from a \"modern\" perspective, consider that they are about on the same level with those of, say, \"Superman IV\" - and that was made 34 years later! Unfortunately, much like \"Meet the Keystone Kops\", this film gives you the impression that more time was spent on the technical tricks and effects than on providing enough funny material and routines for Abbott and Costello. The funniest exchange in the movie comes early on: Dr. Orvilla: \"Why did you tell them that you are Dr. Orvilla?\" Lou: \"I didn't tell them, THEY told ME!\". And although the absence of songs is welcome, the two escaped convicts who eventually join A &amp; C in their trip to Venus get too much screen time on their own. (**)","user":"gridoon","rank":[8,8]}]
