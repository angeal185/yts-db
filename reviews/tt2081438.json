[{"title":"Here it is not only the rotting zombies that reek...","rating":3,"date":"6 July 2013","review":"As far as zombie stuff goes, I generally eat it all up, raw, pardon the pun here. But more than often the stuff that is released in the zombie genre is something that shouldn't necessarily have had seen the light of day.<br><br>As is the case with \"Apocalypse Z\" (aka \"Zombie Massacre\"). I can only guess that they opted with the \"Apocalypse Z\" title because of this summers major release \"World War Z\", especially if the movie is originally titled \"Zombie Massacre\".<br><br>And as much as people whine and complain about Uwe Boll's movies, then I don't have a problem with his movies, direction or production. However, everyone is allowed a swing and a miss every now and then, and this movie sure was a miss.<br><br>The storyline is so simple and non-interesting that it is painful to behold as the cast try to stumble through a script that is founded on absolutely nothing solid or serious. A small town has been infected with some kind of toxin that turned the residents into flesh-eating zombies. And a group of hired mercenaries is sent in to clean up. And that is basically it.<br><br>What the movie does have working for it in its favor is the make-up and special effects. The zombies do have some really nice-looking gashes and wounds. That was the best part of the entire movie, sadly so.<br><br>There were some really bad mistakes throughout the movie as well. Especially as the mercenaries kept on pointing out that they were low on ammunition, but had no problem squandering it on groups of approaching zombies. And I must admit, that it is the first time in my 38 years to have seen a zombie get hit by an empty metal cannister and fall down (dead?) and stop moving. That was just downright idiotic.<br><br>As far as zombie movies go, then \"Apocalypse Z\" has nothing interesting to offer, unless you enjoy pointless stories, bad dialogue and an overall lack of purpose behind the motivation of the movie.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[33,36]},{"title":"The only Apocalypse here was the movie","rating":1,"date":"7 July 2013","review":"Definition of Apocalypse: An event involving destruction on a catastrophic scale. This movie was destroyed by: 1) A truly lousy script. 2) Acting that was not up to school play level. 3) A director who couldn't remember the few lines he had to \"act\" 4) Characters that a seven year old could have given more depth to. 5) Special effects that wouldn't have made it into a 70's B movie. 6) A lack of continuity throughout. 7) A last ditch attempt to fix the movie with a semi nude scene. Well it didn't fix it, it just made it worse as it made no more sense than the rest of this truly awful movie.<br><br>There was one thing worthy of note and that was the make up. The Zombies did look as though some time and effort had gone into them except for when we got a close up on their hands which looked as though they had come from the local joke shop horror section.<br><br>Not so much a B movie, more like a Z movie. Don't watch it, you will never get back the 80 minutes you would waste on it.","user":"JDtheBigGuy","rank":[39,45]},{"title":"Z grade","rating":12,"date":"12 July 2013","review":"Some kind of secret US weapon turns the inhabitants of a Romanian town into zombies. The squad sent in to deal with this clustermug are just preposterous. The worst of them, and it's hard to pick, would be the ginger ninja woman who has clearly not had even five minutes training on how to hold her weapon and instead strikes what she undoubtedly thinks are 'dramatic' poses.<br><br>The sniper, who supposedly killed 300 men from the same position, uses a bolt action rifle that looks like it last saw service circa the Korean war. I could go on. None of them are actually any good at what they are supposed to be the best at, the sniper for example gets ambushed within 4 seconds of setting up his gun. In total the entire squad expends just over 20 rounds between them before running out of ammunition.<br><br>This really is poor. I always watch every movie to the end but in this case I just couldn't do it. What a waste of good effects. The lowest point has to be the president with his thick German accent played by none other than Ewe Boll. Here is how he introduces himself:<br><br>\"Hi! Ya, it is me. The president. Perhaps you are remembering me?\" he says and later wittily adds \"Ah I should be having sex with prostitutes! Perhaps I should just press ze red button.\" I lasted about another 30 minutes before hitting the off button. <br><br>Even if you love zombie films don't waste your time, this is just moronic.","user":"sebpopcorn","rank":[24,27]}]
