[{"title":"For Fans of The Tall Man","rating":9,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"If you love The Tall Man, then you'll love Lost Child. The director had me mystified from the get-go. Are the superstitious locals on to something? Are there demons in this story? The acting is superb from all angles, from the backwoods witch-hunters to the child who is the focus of the tale. Misunderstandings, prejudices, ignorance, superstition, child abuse, and, yes, hope in a better life after we sojourn through this valley of the shadow of death. It's all there. You'll love it, especially if you're ancestry has been affected in some way by the people of this section of America, being the Ozark Mountains.","user":"beorhhouse","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Enjoyed this one...","rating":10,"date":"24 September 2018","review":"I am not sure why there are 2 different names and years for this movie... That's a bit odd and not sure of the details but I found this a good watch. I loved the music, and the the way they got the culture pretty accurate for these parts. Definitely would not classify it as horror at all... Maybe more along the mystery, drama lines. Telling the story of the damage that believing to much in superstition can do. The movie doesn't go at all how you think it going to go, but in a good way for those that like happy endings. I found it refreshing and would watch it again.","user":"Wikkid_Gamez","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Very heart touching and well made","rating":8,"date":"3 November 2018","review":"A very good movie which keeps your interest.
