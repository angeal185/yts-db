I'm a faithful fan of Daniel Radcliffe, which is why I watched this movie. Whoever convinced him to do this movie is a desperate con artist. It barely makes any sense, and most of the setting is obscure and boring. The directing was awful, and the ending was just a bunch of concepts thrown together. Don't bother with this title, Daniel has plenty of better material for your viewing pleasure.","user":"uncsbuddy91","rank":[10,11]}]
