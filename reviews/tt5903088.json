I decided to also look at the external cretics reviews for the film and noticed twice the apposite critical reviews on the film. I checked out the sources behind the critic reviews and they all checked out legit. I saw the film last night and actually enjoyed it very much, so I guess the critics were right about the film and I have no idea why some people are talking nasty about it. I think I It was an entertaining ride.","user":"gene_boss","rank":[29,41]}]
