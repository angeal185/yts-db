[{"title":"a classic 80s funny joytrip","rating":7,"date":"13 September 2005","review":"I am not sure why this one gets rated so bad and it seems that it never got any publicity, but the movie was good for what it was made to be. It is too absurd to be realistic and that just helps it. I've laughed so many times during it that really, i would recommend it.<br><br>Think of it as the naked gun series meets super troopers. It has certain priceless moments such as \"the Doc\" scenes which are guaranteed to make you fall on the floor.<br><br>It is not a serious movie and if you are looking for some deep story line, you won't find it (i feel the need to highlight that). Simple down to earth fun like only the 80s can deliver. <br><br>Don't bring popcorn, you might choke on it :)<br><br>7/10","user":"idonotexist","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Bad Film To Love","rating":8,"date":"31 October 2005","review":"Not sure why John Murray didn't do more films - he definitely should have, and hopefully he will do some in the future. True, his acting style is similar to his older brother Bill's, but he's individual enough that he coulda made it big. \"Moving Violations\" is good. Not great, but it was pretty well directed and it's got its strengths. Actually, it made it into theaters only six months after it was written and filmed - if anything, I'd say that they should have gone back and rewritten and polished up a few things. The plot does get stretched a bit thin over the course of the movie...the best parts come in the beginning and middle. The ending is pretty limp and the whole Judge Henderson/Deputy Halik sexcapade and ensuing car chase sequence just gets boring with all the boffo antics. The character of Scott the Puppeteer, played by Brian Backer (Rat of \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\") doesn't develop as well as it should have, and the chick who plays his love interest wasn't written well at all - BUT, Backer's star scene near the beginning with the puppet stage rolling down the hill is a total gut-buster. Despite these few problems, there are enough good gags and Murray definitely keeps the movie afloat. Jennifer Tilly is superb as Amy Hopkins the nimrod rocket scientist. James Keach, Wendie Jo Sperber (who had just done \"Back to the Future\"), Ned Eisenberg, and Nedra Volz all contribute a lot of positive energy, making \"Moving Violations\" one of those 'so bad, it's good' movies.","user":"oceanave","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"Funniest move ever!!!!!!","rating":10,"date":"19 February 2005","review":"This is the funniest movie I have ever seen in my life. I have never laughed so hard at a movie in my life. The movie is so stupid that it is hilarious. The characters are unforgettable and they all fit in well together to make this movie so funny. The jokes in this movie are brilliant and the acting is excellent. This is the most underrated comedy and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have some good laughs. The old lady who can't see and the hypochondriac are probably the funniest characters but Dana is really funny also. I can recite most of this movie cause I have watched it over and over again. This movie is still funny no matter how many times you watch it.","user":"cabasaexpert351","rank":[23,33]}]
