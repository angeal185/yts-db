[{"title":"A Great Surprise - one of the best movies I've seen in awhile!","rating":10,"date":"3 December 2018","review":"First of all I haven't write a review for a long time but this movie definitely deserves more than one review, since it was artistically perfect, maybe your style or not but it was done right, worth to check it out if it is shown anywhere near you.<br><br>I watched this movie during Festival on the wheels in Ankara, and fell in love with it right away from the start, but I have to tell it is a bit of an acquired taste, it takes a while to get used to the esthetics and physical appearances of the characters.\nThe story is solid and interesting, it starts fast and pulls you in right away. The director balanced everything just fine, a little bit of fun here and there, sometimes a smile and other times a good chuckle. There are scary, creepy elements in this too, so definitely not for the faint hearted.<br><br>Without giving any spoilers, it is a very internationally culture references packed animation, lots of art, lots of cities with a nice background music. Overall I don't want to spoil any bit of it, since it takes whatever you know and recreates in its own universe. I salute the director for creating such a good piece of art himself by melting known art in his own pot. Good job!","user":"zdilay","rank":[46,51]},{"title":"Animation as a form of art","rating":9,"date":"2 January 2019","review":"Ruben Brandt, collector has many levels of depth.\nAs I watched the first few shots of the movie (introduced with a quote by one of my fav authors - Karinthy Frigyes), I was sure that it is going to be visually spectacular. It was - the way it is animated, the unique style of graphics and the genius way of incorporating and \"repainting\" paintings from the real world was quite eye-catching and immersive.\nThen, the plot starts. The movie references other classicals, like Bond-movies with the robbery-plot and action scenes, psychological thrillers with hallucinations and surreal events, and a big pile of ART, any way imaginable, in every shot of the movie. Thanks to these combinations, we end up with a totally unusual plot worth to experience.\nAs the plot evolves, many things get uncovered. Psychological, emotional issues and conditions start to emerge as we dig deeper in Ruben's head. The main anagnorisis - when Ruben discovers what makes him hallucinate - was absolutely unexpected and a brilliant point of plot.\nFinally, the ending raises a lot of questions, for it leaves the plot kind of open with a twist. Personally, I would have liked it to be a bit more specific, a bit more self-exlpanatory. At least it gives another reason to re-watch this piece.<br><br>p.s. I am really glad, because it is the product of my country, Hungary. We were highly in the need of (great) movies like this, and I am geniunely proud of the crew, thank you!","user":"galdagabor","rank":[32,37]},{"title":"Mesmerizing","rating":9,"date":"20 March 2019","review":"I was a little sleepy during the middle of the film but I thoroughly enjoyed it in all its entirety. It's rare to see an art film blend surrealism and artistic flare so well with Hollywood style action and dynamically awesome characters.<br><br>A","user":"cgearheart","rank":[16,19]}]
