[{"title":"There's a lesson to be learned here.","rating":3,"date":"8 April 2020","review":"There are actually fewer guidelines or rules in cinema than people assume. You can make a movie with no people in it at all, and it can still be fascinating (Microcosmos). You can make a movie with no linear timeline and / or a confusing plot, and it can still be great (The Lost Highway). You can make a movie that starts at the end and goes backwards, and it can still be wonderful (Memento).<br><br>But when it comes to animation, things change. There just have to be some constants: Competent character design, MODERN animation (I had to type that in capital letters) and an interesting story. Otherwise, the paragraph above doesn't apply.<br><br>Harvey And The Magic Museum is a perfect example. If this had come out in 1998, it would have received a much warmer welcome. Unfortunately, it's 2020 now, and audiences just won't accept this. Sad but true.","user":"suicidea","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Avoid at all costs!!!!!","rating":2,"date":"31 March 2019","review":"Dire... An absolutely awful movie to be avoided at all costs. A muddled story line, bland imagery and uncomfortable script make this one of the worst children's movies I've ever seen!","user":"warrenberry","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"just awful","rating":1,"date":"30 March 2019","review":"Horrible script, design, animation...: awful!
