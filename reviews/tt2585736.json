[{"title":"I understood the intention of the film but the production is very, very cheap","rating":4,"date":"19 January 2020","review":"The perfect allegory for this film is the same with restaurants. We usually visit those restaurants that are recommended to us or have good reviews, then you visit and discover the tragic reality.\nThis film doesn't know what it wants to be. I know it's an independent film and it's not easy to make movies, but besides some problems with the script, there are unforgivable technical problems, mainly with the audio editing.\nThe premise of the script is interesting but the acting seems close to that of a high school film. I wish all the luck to the authors and director but I didn't like the film very much.","user":"rruas","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Must have many friends or crowd-sourced reviews...","rating":1,"date":"26 September 2019","review":"The average rating of this movie is impossible, and has the potential to destroy the entire IMDB rating system reputation.\nThis movie is utterly unwatchable. Not fun, not entertaining at all. Just incredibly poorly made, acted, directed and scripted.\nCould possibly be used to torture suspects into confessions.","user":"eyefordetail","rank":[11,16]},{"title":"Heartfelt father/son duo!","rating":10,"date":"17 April 2019","review":"This film is truly heartwarming with unique comedic stylings. I was shocked to find out the two leads are real life father and son. Definitely fits my criteria of a fun, entertaining, unique film!","user":"MarkAnder_","rank":[17,32]}]
