[{"title":"Mickey Rourke's tombstone.","rating":2,"date":"29 September 2013","review":"Man, what happened to Rourke? After \"The Wrestler,\" he had a second act career resurgence that appeared to be another great Hollywood comeback story. He had a string of high-profile blockbuster films -- \"Expendables,\" \"Iron Man 2\" among them -- and a whole list of films on IMDb that were slated in pre-production, many with large casts and studios.<br><br>He swore in all his cover story interviews around the release of The Wrestler that he'd \"learned his lesson\" the hard way by bad-mouthing Hollywood in the '80s and '90s, and that he wouldn't allow his career to become ruined again, as he had resorted to straight-to-video flicks in the late '90s and early '00s when his career was in truly dire straits. (He claims a narrative that he was out of work entirely for a decade, but the truth is, he was just appearing in really crap films.)<br><br>But he didn't heed his own words of wisdom. Within a couple years, these things had happened: he publicly dissed The Expendables 2, claiming he wouldn't return unless they paid him more. He was never cast in the film, and the plot was re-written to involve a younger character in his place. After the worldwide success of EX2, which could have been another franchise for Rourke, a producer on the film was asked whether he'd be back for round three. \"Maybe if he doesn't act so crazy,\" was the reply from the producer. As of September 29th, the third film is in production, and Rourke's name is absent from the cast.<br><br>He also publicly bad-mouthed writer/director Martin McDonaugh (In Bruges), claiming he wasn't being paid enough by the \"creep\" to star in the film Seven Psychopaths; he dropped out, and was replaced by Woody Harrelson. The film wasn't a big hit financially, but critics loved it, and it had a huge ensemble cast. Instead of starring in that film, he starred in a straight-to-video movie with Kellen Lutz...if you don't know who that guy is, it's because he was one of the shirtless vampires in Twilight. <br><br>Then he bad-mouthed Marvel Studios, claiming they butchered Iron Man 2. Not a huge deal since his character had no chance of coming back anyway, but it's more burnt bridges. He also annoyed the crap out of Robert Downey Jr on the set of the film (RDJ went out on a limb for him and fought to have him cast in the film after Rourke's pay demands were deemed too high by Marvel, btw); apparently his Method Acting routine was hugely obnoxious to cast and crew, as he demanded odd flourishes such as blaring Gnarls Barkley's song \"Crazy\" at full volume before filming every one of his scenes.<br><br>My point of this long-winded rant is that Mickey Rourke has essentially ruined what could have been a golden opportunity comeback to fulfill his early potential as one of the great actors of all time, and now he has resorted to starring in utter dreck like this film, which is an absolutely abysmal production and something that any actor should be embarrassed to list on their resume. <br><br>It's a standard revenge flick, set in a western atmosphere. It is poorly made (the low budget stands out at every turn), poorly acted (Anthony Michael Hall is the villain - enough said), and poorly shot (the lighting is atrocious at times). Danny Trejo has experienced some kind of grindhouse-type career revival thanks to Robert Rodriguez, but he's best buried as a minor character in ensemble films, and he does not have the charm or charisma to carry a full-length picture. <br><br>The only remotely interesting thing about this film? Rourke plays the devil incarnate. Which, if you've ever seen his 1987 psychological thriller \"Angel Heart,\" is an interesting twist. Unfortunately this film isn't remotely similar to Angel Heart in any other regard, which was one of the best films of the 1980s in this humble critic's opinion; Dead in Tombstone, by contrast, is Dead On Arrival (har, har) and a truly bad film.<br><br>Rourke, you only have yourself to blame for this.","user":"MovieAddict2016","rank":[55,76]},{"title":"All this and epilepsy too.","rating":4,"date":"29 November 2013","review":"Danny Trejo is an acquired taste. Since being given cult status by the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, fearless Danny has now earned headliner status in movies built around him. Good for Danny, he's paid his dues. That being said, even the iconic presence of Mr. Trejo can't save this direct-to-DVD supernatural western. Trejo has maybe five states of being and facial expression in his acting repertoire. but only two are utilized by the director of this spooky oater. Danny looks grim. Danny looks grimmer. That's all folks. Still he tries, but he's just not cut out for leading man status.<br><br>A paper thin plot drags its story out for around 100 minutes here, filling the spaces between the actual story with repetitive gunfights, slow motion death, general mayhem, and an occasional visit to Hell, where the real-life horror show called Mickey Rourke pretends to be Satan (the character is referred to as \"The Blacksmith\" in the credits). Danny has been betrayed by his homies, the Blackwater Gang. His half brother Red (played by a nearly unrecognizable Anthony Michael Hall) murders him and Danny ends up in Hell. Tortured by Mickey Rourke (in a sleepwalking tour-de-force of acting as Satan), Danny strikes a bargain to win his soul back. Mickey wakes up long enough to accept this bargain using the worst dubbed-in voice for Rourke imaginable. Danny returns to life, and sets out to kill his homies in revenge. End of plot.<br><br>This could have been really interesting in the hands of a better director. Unfortunately, no one told the actual director Roel Rein√© that he wasn't making a music video. This entire movie is shot in 2-6 second scenes, underlit and too dark to penetrate, too many flashy jumpcuts, etc. If you don't come out of a viewing of this without acquiring epilepsy, lucky you. The end resolution is poorly thought out. Still, the Romanian locations and costumes are worth a look here and earn the first two stars I give. Danny T. gets the other two for really giving his all...I think. Maybe Mickey Monster Rourke slipped Danny one or two of the sleeping pills he must have been gulping down during filming. An interesting/headache inducing flick for those with short attention spans.","user":"Stachehunter-857-73111","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Another movie for Trejo fans. Nothing terrible but nothing to rush and see either. I say C+.","rating":5,"date":"3 October 2013","review":"\"I'm gonna stay here and I'm gonna take over this town and you can go to hell.\" When a gang lead by Guerrero (Trejo) enters a small mining town for a night of drinking he is surprised when the gang revolts and kills him in order to stay and control the town they now call Tombstone. When he wakes up in Hell he makes a deal with the Devil in order to live again. Now has an instrument of Satan all he has to do is kill the gang that killed him or face eternal damnation. Once again this is a Danny Trejo movie which means this will be a short review. His fans will watch this either way so what I will say is that this is pretty cheesy with a ridiculous plot. On the other hand this does have Trejo in it for more then 5 minutes and Mickey Rourke is also in this for added fun. This is a true western in the way that there are no zombies or other gimmick to make people watch. Other then that this is another movie for Trejo fans. Overall, not terrible but nothing to rush and see either. I give it a C+.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[10,14]}]
