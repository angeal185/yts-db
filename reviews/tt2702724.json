[{"title":"Not bad","rating":6,"date":"10 May 2017","review":"Melissa McCarthy is hilarious... This movie is better than its rating. Yes there are things that would never happen and people gripe about that but this isn't a freaking documentary it's a comedy. It's supposed to be a bit ridiculous. It's a good movie if you want a laugh. I'm looking forward to the next one written by her and Ben Falcone.","user":"felicialv","rank":[22,30]},{"title":"The Boss was laugh out loud hilarious, but also heartfelt.","rating":7,"date":"21 February 2017","review":"Melissa McCarthy strikes again – this time at a rival troupe of juvenile sweets peddlers known as the Dandelions. The Boss was laugh out loud hilarious, but also heartfelt. The bizarre cast of characters in this film provided for some absurd and funny moments, but the best scenes were between Darnell and her newest protégé – the young Rachel, who quickly became like family to the money hungry Darnell. McCarthy always excels at physical comedy, but it was her character's confidence and quick wit that carried the film. Overall, I simply loved this film.","user":"shawnwu","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"Funny and light-hearted","rating":9,"date":"7 May 2017","review":"A funny light hearted comedy, the casting was well done, all complimented each other. The story plot even though far fetched, but remember it's a comedy, is entertaining. Worth seeing on cable. Melissa McCarthy is entertaining and the out-takes at the end are very funny. Better than other comedies out there.","user":"berttom-64515","rank":[14,19]}]
