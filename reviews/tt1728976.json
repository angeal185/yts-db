[{"title":"1.3 million dollar hoax in many ways....","rating":2,"date":"25 August 2012","review":"I worked on this \"film\" There is no way that it was near 1.3 million dollars unless the producers paid themselves 1,270,000. It would be utterly embarrassing if the budget were that high to produce this product, and utterly criminal if they spent this money without paying any of the working crew (the shoot was done by a few very dedicated, very inexperienced interns). And not even pay for the use of camera equipment - one supplied by the unpaid shooter, the other by the unpaid intern. Its half laughable, half disturbing that a production company would advertise a budget on a production to be so much higher than it actually was (maybe $30,000 for production). They should be embarrassed and then audited. And after hanging their heads in shame, should send checks to the people who made it, and then watch a few movies that did in fact cost 1.3 million dollars and see what real film making, and script writing is. Or go to film school.","user":"omcary","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"What the bloody hell did I just watch?","rating":2,"date":"11 April 2012","review":"After seeing a film about Ron Jeremy's penis being taken over by a horny alien, I didn't think horror films could get any worse, but Episode 50 proved me wrong. <br><br>The ghost and spirits shown in the film are about as scary as hedgehog and the supposedly 'terrifying' ghost nurse walking around the place looks like woman in a Halloween costume<br><br>The acting is about the worst thing I have ever seen in any film, it feels forced and is awkward and embarrassing to watch. <br><br>I turned this off half way through, and I wouldn't recommend anyone watching it. Don't waste 80 odd minutes of your life. Terrible, terrible film.","user":"bethannorv","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Don't judge a book by its cover...","rating":2,"date":"26 October 2011","review":"Thats what i did...i saw this on the shelf and picked it up, the cover image was enticingly disturbing, a well worn through story idea but these kinds of horrors never get old if done right. But sadly, this one wasn't.<br><br>From the word go you see some of the shoddiest acting available in any movie today, a laughable \"captured footage\" scene of the team debunking case 49 and then even more laughable acting as they get their next job.<br><br>I think what makes this film even worse is it's use of music. If your going to do a film like this, there shouldn't BE any music other than the slightly ominous background tones to set the scene, you certainly don't need plinking, heartfelt piano music every time you have someone crying on another team members shoulder!!<br><br>This film is a joke, don't waste your time.","user":"leonhart35","rank":[25,29]}]
