[{"title":"A different kind of stand-up show","rating":24,"date":"24 May 2017","review":"This is more of a one-man show than your typical stand-up comedy special. Instead of 25 different bits, Hasan tells different stories about his life, both hilarious and heartbreaking. It wouldn't work if his storytelling ability wasn't so brilliant, but his timing and ability to connect with the audience at each point are spot on. Even if you didn't grow up with immigrant parents, anyone who has ever felt like an outsider will identify with his stories.","user":"throwntosafety","rank":[46,55]},{"title":"A Comedy for the \"Others\" in the White Suburb","rating":10,"date":"25 May 2017","review":"Someone once said that satire occurs when one faces an absurdly unjust scenario that can't be changed but only laughed at. For those who find Homecoming King boring, the white suburbia must've been a perfectly normal place to be themselves. So congrats for not being able to enjoy the show.<br><br>For those of us who have different skin color and are possibly immigrants, Hassan Minhaj told our similar experience with veracity and gut. Being the \"others\" has helped colored immigrants developed a third-person's perspective to look at ourselves, or specifically the ability to see ourselves as the exotic and foreign creatures from white people's perspective. If you don't find Hassan Funny, probably you've looked at yourselves in the first perspective your whole life.<br><br>As a Chinese immigrant who went to high school in the suburbs, I'm drawn to Hassan's story even though I know little of Indian culture. After all, who doesn't have that \"white princess(or prince)\" complex?","user":"heathcliff1019","rank":[41,51]},{"title":"The authentic American-Indian family, without the accent.","rating":9,"date":"24 May 2017","review":"This comedy special is Hassan's best work by far. The use of the screen behind him to aid in his jokes was helpful, and his storytelling is interesting. <br><br>I can definitely see how this would not be as funny for those that are not South Asian or have limited exposure to this community, but you have to view this from a different lens to appreciate it's comedic humor. <br><br>For South Asian-Americans, it is a validation that their stories are part of the American fabric. For those not from this community, take this comedy act as an educational tour in the intricacies of living a dual life as an American born immigrant child. <br><br>It doesn't rely on the classic \"Apu-dad Indian accent\" humor that Russell Peters is well known for. It is simply a story, and one that is told excellently. <br><br>By the end of it, maybe you'll see that his goal isn't necessarily to Americanize his experience, but to share it as authentically as possible. It is up to the viewer to take the humor as it is, and to perhaps see comedy from a new lens.","user":"talhabb","rank":[30,42]}]
