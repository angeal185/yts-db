[{"title":"3 Hours of Confusion and Boredom","rating":3,"date":"19 February 2018","review":"I have never written a movie review before but this one just demanded one, perhaps to save some other souls from spoiling their evening. I had so looked forward to watching a 3 hour western because I really enjoy westerns. Fifteen minutes into the movie, my husband and I turned and looked at each other and both made a disparaging remark on the movie. My husband finally fell asleep and I forced myself to watch the entire thing. I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. This movie plays like it was produced and directed by a 10 year old. Sure does, right down to the part where the two men spit in their hands then shake on something. The movie is all over the place, no clear direction. Near the beginning, my husband states, \"What just happened?\" It was as if a scene was added to the movie that absolutely did not belong. The dialog was really very bad. The movie does not give endings to the main situations within it so if you watch it all in hopes of learning what will happen to certain people or of certain events, you will be sadly disappointed. This movie deserves a rating of 1 but I gave it a 3, only because you could see how hard the cast was trying and for the beautiful horses.","user":"hifrmny","rank":[27,35]},{"title":"No! No!
