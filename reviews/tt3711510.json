[{"title":"Intriguing and supernatural thriller with interesting screenplay plenty of twists and turns","rating":7,"date":"5 May 2018","review":"Tense thriller plenty of suspense , thrills, supernatural events and a complex intrigue. It deals with Jon , Raul Arevalo, a desperado young Mathematician at thirty and some years old. He witnesses how his best friend is shot by a delincuent at a gas station , outside Madrid .While a ten year old boy receives a note that if he goes to the petrolium station on April 12 he will die. The kid tells this fact but no one sees to believe except for the unsettling mathematician . Later on , Jon to be aware about previous shots and massacres happened at the same location in 1912, 1955, 1976 . He tries to use maths to find out a solution around the threatening and bizarre incidents , but things go wrong.<br><br>Taut and slick thriller in 92 minutes titled El aviso or The warning with supernatural events in which a boy suffers bullying and receiving a suspicious letter telling his life is in risk , while a disturbing young attempts to save him and uncover weird mysteries. Suspenseful and mysterious flick with an interesting group of roles caught into fear , despair and paranoia . Twisted and complex script based on the novel by Paul Pen , being written by Sparling who wrote Buried and along with Javier Guerricaechevarria , regular Alex De la Iglesia collaborator such as Dia de Bestia, and other hits as Cell 211 and Kovack box . Raul Arevalo gives a nice acting as the mathematician who suffers shizophrenia and begins a dangerous race against time to save the child and to avoid that crime will repeat , seeking a way to prevent it . Aura Garrrido as the protector mother is pretty well , she is a fine actress, as she has proved in Ministerio Del Tiempo series.Support cast is frankly good such as Aitor Luna , Sergio Calleja, Patricia Vico who is Calparsoro' wife , Alfredo Villa , Belen Cuesta and the veteran Julieta Serrano.<br><br>The fim packs an atmospheric and stirring musical score by Julio De la Rosa . And an evocative but dark cinematography by Sergi Villanova , shot on location in Madrid outside , Chamartin barrio. The Motion picture was well directed by veteran director Daniel Calparsoro, though It has some flaws and gaps . Daniel has a long career as filmmaker from his beginning with Basque films as Pasajes, Salto al vacio, A ciegas , Ausentes ; subsequently making thrillers as Asfalto , Guerreros , Invasor ,and the successful Combustion and Cien a√±os de perdon . He also directed Tv series as Inocentes, La ira, El castigo , Apaches. Rating 6.5/10 . Decent and passable yarn as well as acceptable supernatural thriller.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[34,45]},{"title":"It could have been awesome","rating":5,"date":"29 July 2018","review":"While watching this moving, I was interested since the beginning of it. An intriguing Thriller with a murder that is somehow connected to past ones through the analysis of numbers, which are done by Jon, the mathematician who is the only one who really believes there is a meaning behind it.<br><br>The story is told in two different timelines and somehow both of them are connected. How? Different murders occured in the 20th century, but somehow all of them happened with 5 people with ages of 10, 21, 32, 42 and 52. Those are the magical numbers. In 2008, a murder with the same conditions happened and Jon is convinced that it will happen again in 10 years, because of math and stuff. This is where the 2018 timeline with Nico comes in place, a young bot who suffers with bullying. <br><br>Personally, what spoiled this movie for me was exactly the ending it took. I really was expecting an ending where my mind would be blown, maybe something to do with Jon\"s squizofrenia in a \"It was all in my mind\" type of end, or something to do with ETA, which was the responsible for one of the past murders. I would also accept some alien time travel ending if it was well done (ok, maybe I'm pushing too far here), but I was just expecting something darker and thriller-like.<br><br>All the movie gave me was Jon communicating with a kid 10 years in the future through a mirror avoiding the next murder. Not wanting to give more spoilers, but all in all, the movie chose to go with the \"everything is connected and we reincarnate to fulfil what we are meant to fulfill\" path. They chose the easy, spiritual ending, and although the movie kept my attention, this is what disappointed me.<br><br>Positive arguments for the movie? It is indeed an interesting thriller, which keeps you thinking of possibilities to explain the main question of the movie. It has intereseting characters, which are easy to connect because of their life struggles, and although I did not enjoy the ending, it is an OK movie to spend some time chilling and learning some spanish.","user":"alexgntr94","rank":[31,42]},{"title":"Good movie, but had some holes","rating":6,"date":"2 August 2018","review":"Without giving away a lot, the movie was good. The story takes a little dialogue to get going, and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense at first. But, the story does develop and after a little, keeps you intrigued. The move could have been a solid 7-8, but the ending brought it down 1 - 2 stars. Overall, good acting, original storyline, and shot fairly well. That ending though...","user":"tjsuf","rank":[13,16]}]
