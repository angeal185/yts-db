[{"title":"Barely watchable","rating":4,"date":"24 December 2016","review":"This is one of those movies you will see at 3pm on cable. It's predictable af and we've seen this type of romcom 1000 times over<br><br><ul><li>a guy who's down on his luck falls in love with his pretty coworker but then messes things up and than he fixes it and as they kiss the camera pans over and fades into a black screen - the end.</li></ul><br><br>To be fair there were 1 or 2 laughs in the first third of the movie but than it falls flat on it's face with cliche's. The acting was bad but the directing was terrible, the color scheme was wrong for a romcom and the movie just looked like crap. <br><br>If you have nothing better to do and the movie is on TV you might leave it play while you are browsing on your phone.","user":"Greevas","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"My Kinda Movie","rating":6,"date":"30 November 2019","review":"I really liked this film. It was passable on all levels. Didn't go beyond being just good and passable. Brooklyn Decker is alright in this, not as hot as she could be. The main actor I like, I guess he plays the role well. And David Arquette revitalizes himself in this too.<br><br>The movie is about an office worker who gets dumped by his girlfriend, and turns to online dating. After a few encounters, he learns he loves his coworker.<br><br>The movie is alright. It's passable. It had the office worker aspect going for it. And it also has the trials and tribulations of dating in there. Makes for a good movie.<br><br>Would recommend<br><br>6 stars","user":"michaeltrivedi","rank":[1,3]},{"title":"Not dating. Experiencing","rating":4,"date":"19 November 2017","review":"Justin (Taran Killam) gets publicly dumped and humiliated by his now ex-girlfriend Sarah (Aimee-Lynn Chadwick). His workmates help him out with an Internet date called \"Casual Encounters.\" He works for Cal Telcom, pronounce Telecom. Justin has the proverbial female office mate (Brooklyn Decker) that has an interest in him....Internet dates show up in real life etc. formula, barf writing.<br><br>We know how this turns out 5 minutes into the film. The predictability factor was extremely high, Justin's sad sack character was not likable. Not worthy of a date night film.<br><br>Guide: F-word, sex, nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[1,3]}]
