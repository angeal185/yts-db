[{"title":"Extremely boring","rating":2,"date":"21 November 2018","review":"TRUTH OR DOUBLE DARE is another extremely boring indie horror flick based around the game of truth or dare; the subject has been done so much better in the past. This one goes for a grungy look but aside from some mild nastiness it's a very empty viewing experience with a seen-it-all-before feel. It's also too long, with too many characters doing very little, and possessing nasty-looking choppy editing.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"What a waste of a DVD!","rating":1,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"This is one of the absolute worst I've seen in a long time!! Acting is extremely unreal at best. Story line just puts you to sleep and is way too predictable.<br><br>Don't waste your time watching it!!","user":"piratejimbo","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Pretty Bad and Needed T&A!","rating":3,"date":"22 November 2018","review":"It was a trash heap. It's about teens, ten years later now adults, meeting and playing a game. The movie is bad, yes....but it had funny dialogue and funny cringe worthy scenes. WHat it needs was some T&amp;A.....you know sex.<br><br>That might have saved the movie and made it passable. It's missing fun. A lot of good bad movies are fun and sexy. This movie lacked both, but it especially lacked nudity. Really needed female nudity badly.","user":"Dark_Lord_Mark","rank":[4,13]}]
