[{"title":"Not About Gambling","rating":9,"date":"7 January 2015","review":"This movie is about a man who has given up hope on achieving his dreams and is trying to make his pain stop by engaging in self destructive behavior... his weapon of choice is gambling but he is not a gambler. He says so multiple times. I have read the many negative reviews of this movie and I think people are really just missing the point. He wants a real love and something real to do every day and if he achieve anything beyond mediocrity then he would rather be dead. People who can relate with that sentiment will love this movie but perhaps no one else. If you enjoy a movie that makes you think a little and go beyond what's on the surface. The movie is not about gambling... it is about finding inspiration and hope.","user":"wendy-weist","rank":[225,293]},{"title":"Yes and No","rating":3,"date":"3 January 2015","review":"Yes this is a gambling film and includes just about every clich√© you can think of. No it isn't any good.<br><br>Yes Mark Wahlberg plays a gambler. No he doesn't hit, shoot, stab, or otherwise assault anyone.<br><br>Yes the film has several excellent co-stars like George Kennedy, Andre Braugher, and Richard Schiff. No you won't see very much of them and if you sneeze you may miss them.<br><br>Yes there is some romance. No it doesn't work with a girl who is half Wahlberg's age.<br><br>Yes it's great to see John Goodman in a meaty role. No he isn't going to play Jabba the Hut in the next Star Wars release.<br><br>Yes I did stay for the entire movie hoping that the final scene would somehow raise the stature of the film. No it didn't.","user":"drjgardner","rank":[220,353]},{"title":"Complicated","rating":10,"date":"26 December 2014","review":"The Gambler was a difficult film to rate. It was a movie that not everyone is going to like because not everyone is going to relate to Mark Wahlberg's character. It was a hard movie to understand. After seeing this movie you will either love it or hate it. There is really no in between. You really had to connect with the main character and his personality, and that's not possible for everyone. I really enjoyed the film because i really connected with it, but that is not going to be the case for everyone. I would highly recommend seeing it just to take the chance of loving it. Just like the gambling theme of the movie, seeing the movie will be a gamble for you.","user":"sidellgarrett","rank":[115,185]}]
