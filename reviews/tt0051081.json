[{"title":"Sin, vice, crime, and corruption south of the border.","rating":31,"date":"31 March 2002","review":"Yet another fifties semi-documentary style crime thriller \"ripped from the pages of todays headlines\" purporting to expose the sin, crime, vice and corruption of some major city. This time the setting is south of the border in sunny Mexico, where a crusading newspaper editor battles the local syndicate who have turned the border city of Tijuana into a cesspool of drug dealing, gambling, and prostitution.<br><br>Despite the slightly different setting, THE TIJUANA STORY is mostly a routine low budget semi-documentary style crime drama. The film is not as exciting as many of the other films of this genre. At times the films pace slows down. Of interest is seeing Mexican actor Rudolfo Acosta in a change of pace from his usual villain roles, playing the crusading newspaper editor. James Darren is given top billing in the films ads, but his role is actually rather small. Here he plays an American teenager who goes to Tijuana for a few cheap thrills and ends up getting accidentally killed when fleeing police who try to bust him on  drug charges. Also in the cast is Robert Blake with a phony Mexican accent.","user":"youroldpaljim","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Poorly Done Crime Drama Based on a True Story","rating":2,"date":"8 August 2019","review":"TIJUANA STORY is a tepid crime drama based on a true story of newspaperman, Manuel Acosta Mesa (Rudolfo Acosta) who takes on the mob / syndicate led by fictionalized mobster Peron Diaz (Paul Newlan). After Acosta digs up the names of influential politicians involved in Diaz's illegal activities, he is targeted for assassination.<br><br>The movie opens with a newsreel-style recounting of Acosta's importance as a whistle blower, followed by a talking head American journalist who actually wrote about the Acosta case. His tone suggests that Acosta Mesa had brought trouble upon himself due to the provocative nature of his reporting. While the real-life story of this brave journalist could have made a good, hard-hitting exposé, but we're in producer Sam Katzman territory, which means poor production values, one-take performances and sensationalized dramatics.<br><br>The denizens of Tijuana are shown as mostly villainous peasants, while the top line casting is strictly from Hollywood and Vine. For example, the main Hispanic mob boss is played by Paul Newlan, who was born in Plattsburgh, Nebraska. Acosta's daughter and the newspaper publisher are both played by Anglos. The sassy bar girl who talks Mitch into buying marijuana makes the mistake of trying on an irritating Mexican accent.<br><br>Despite these handicaps, a few performances stand out: Rudolfo Acosto is a strong presence playing against type as the hero but his delivery is stilted. Jean Willes plays the stereotypical mob moll with some class, and James Darren and Robert Blake make an impression as a disaffected J.D. and as Acosta's son, respectively. Darren had been signed to a long-term contract with Columbia Pictures in the summer of 1956, and TIJUANA STORY was one of several B-movies that featured the young actor. However, he plays a small role here in scenes that look like they were an afterthought and are barely connected with the Acosta plot-line.<br><br>On balance, none of these thespians are supported by the clichéd screenplay by the usually competent Lou Morheim, which contains its share of clumsy dialog, such as, \"I know you've had some results crashing into walruses,\" \"A little bit of that would put hair on my chest, oh, mama,\" \"What are you, an avenging angel?\"<br><br>Likewise, the direction and staging of many scenes is unimaginative and at times unintentionally funny, as when faux jazz players blithely continue their playing on a night club stage while half the cast is fist fighting and throwing chairs around on the dance floor.","user":"jfrentzen-942-204211","rank":[2,3]}]
