[{"title":"Nostalgia Heaven!","rating":7,"date":"8 January 2006","review":"This movie is of almost generation-defining importance to some of us born in the early post-war years in that (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending Saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house) you almost certainly saw it. And the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you. It's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days. <br><br>It had a modern, space-age storyboard for the audiences of it's time. The set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a Friday midnight show. It has hot rods and rebellious youth, but in the 'why can't they let us have fun' way rather than the disturbed, histrionic rebel-without-a-cause way. All characters were identifiable to us - teens, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the cops - were sympathetic to us. We could relate to them all<br><br>It had a singularly horrifying monster. It's first victim is heard moaning 'it hurts.....it hurts' and we were convinced and frightened. The menace grows continually throughout the story. There are intense periods of suspense, colourful effects, a fabulous lead in McQueen, and moments of humour, both intended and not. It even had an almost over-the-top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying.<br><br>I saw it in summer, age 9 or so, double billed with 'I Married A Monster From Outer Space', and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that I went back a couple more times before it left. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved it.","user":"worldsofdarkblue","rank":[82,88]},{"title":"Smarter than the average horror film","rating":23,"date":"23 January 2001","review":"I have read many of the user comments and I think that the film is generally not getting credit for being a smart thriller.  Why does the monster have to be on-screen to make it good?  Hitchcock said that suspense plays better than action and although this film missed many opportunities to be more suspenseful, it's is at least not stupid.<br><br>In how many horror films today does the hero know the monster and its nature when he should?  Steve knows what he's dealing with almost from the beginning and his frustration is not being able to convince the authorities.<br><br>\nYet the authorities act in a totally credible way as well, even the annoying sergeant.  Who would believe such a story from a bunch of \"kids\" (we know Steve wasn't a kid, but his character is).<br><br>One key example of the movie's intelligence: Steve is yelling to Dave to get CO2 fire extinguishers long after Dave has already gotten the message and dispatched people to get them.  How many movies made in the 90s would be smart about this subtle detail?<br><br>I'm really tired of watching movies and having people behave in ways different than they really would in real life (the most irritating recent example is Tom Hanks falling asleep with the flashlight on in Cast Away). Horror films in particular do this in spades (which is why the Scream films have been so popular), but The Blob, to me, stayed pretty true to its characters, and in so doing made a smarter and better film.<br><br>Yes there are many flaws, perhaps biggest is Steve McQueen's very uneven performance, but I think they missed key opportunities for suspense that could have turned this above average, kinda scary, kinda funny movie that's a cult favourite into a true classic.","user":"benzene","rank":[48,54]},{"title":"I grew up in Royersford, Pa.","rating":8,"date":"9 January 2000","review":"I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The town where Jerry's market was.  I remember my whole family going out to watch the filming.  I remember a guy showing the \"Blob\" to me and my brothers in a bucket.  I also would like to share that my mother was in the movie.  Her hair style was the same as Aneta Corsaut's and she was ill one evening and they saw my mom and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen  for some shots from behind.  They payed her $25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away this past August. My mom was not a teenager and she was a few months from giving birth to my little sister.","user":"RickNeal","rank":[28,32]}]
