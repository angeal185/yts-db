[{"title":"One of the bests","rating":10,"date":"5 March 2018","review":"I don't understand why the rating is this low here. It was one of the best animation movies I have seen. It has several layers to it. Surface layer is of course going against violence and advocating peaceful life and behavior. But it can have several other layers; like how the society forces boys to define themselves as \"masculine\" based on the norms of the society. Masculinity is more of a sociological construct rather than an eternal unchanging truth.\nSome people here have said that this movie is not pro fighters. I totally think the opposite. It is advocating a new definition for fighting. Rather than violence, fighting according to Ferdinand is patience and perseverance. <br><br>All in all, I loved this movie and totally recommend it.","user":"ghazaal-b","rank":[71,86]},{"title":"Great family film","rating":10,"date":"29 March 2018","review":"We are a family of animal lovers, especially cows, and we absolutely adored this movie. Ferdinand is the lovable giant who melted us all.","user":"Marisabrown1","rank":[34,40]},{"title":"Silly MooMoo, heartwarming and funny!","rating":9,"date":"6 April 2018","review":"It may be a bit generic with a predictable plot and some clich√© characters. Some of the voice acting may be a bit jarring and the animation is simply OK. Still Ferdinand delivered humor and warmth in spades. I could not stop laughing! \nEven when the jokes were corny, the corniness fits right in with a soft-hearted, flower loving bull that wouldn't hurt a fly.<br><br>A pretty good, feel-good family movie for when you just want some light watching.","user":"dreamsrepository","rank":[31,37]}]
