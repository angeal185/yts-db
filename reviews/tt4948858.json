[{"title":"Just no, not worth your time","rating":1,"date":"5 December 2019","review":"If I could rate it less than 1 star I would.\nEver seen one of those cheezy 50's alien movies in black and white with really bad SFX and equally bad props and actors? This is just the modern version of that. I got to watch a couple of minutes and no, just couldnt anymore. Move along, nothing to see here.......","user":"grdanielz","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Ouch.","rating":1,"date":"2 December 2019","review":"I usually love creature features, even bad ones. This was worse than bad it was painful to watch and I lasted only a couple minutes past the first meeting of the \"creature\". The CGI was good if it came from an 8th grader, otherwise it's one of the worst I've seen. Coming from this monster lover, walk away, just walk away.","user":"dakotaspoo","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"It's so bad I couldn't even laugh at it.","rating":1,"date":"2 December 2019","review":"The fx, acting, script, editing, camera work are all ridiculously horrendous.<br><br>Now that that's out of the way..... How the hell does anyone get funding to make a film this bad??? It shouldn't be labelled as sci fi. I've never seen a film that made me hate every character in the first few seconds of seeing them on screen.<br><br>I had a look at the filmmakers credits and he actually makes crap like this all the time. Wow lol, don't waste a second of your time on this.","user":"bencrea","rank":[13,21]}]
