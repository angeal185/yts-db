[{"title":"Group of survivors are lost in a zombie movie that has lost it's way","rating":3,"date":"25 March 2015","review":"The movie opens with a scene--which is unrelated to the actual movie--of a spec ops soldier moving through the forest. The shot is presented through impressive variations of first person and third person perspectives. The commando sneaks up on an enemy camp. He dispatches three enemy soldiers and begins to collect intelligence when he, surprisingly, discovers a woman held captive. While trying to cut her free, he accidentally slices his own hand, causing a change within himself; a few moments later, 28 Days Later-ish, he has morphed into a zombie and attacks the woman. <br><br>The above scene is immediately followed by an animated title sequence which was actually really well done and worth watching a few times. But, it feels like it should be used as the opening credits for a syndicated Zombie television series.<br><br>Up to this point, five minutes in, the movie is looking to be a promising zombie flick. Unfortunately, it appears that the scene, described above, must have been a bait and switch. I certainly feel like I was duped. One can only imagine that they used the half decent opener to present to potential investors in an attempt to generate financial support for a full length movie... because what comes next is a catastrophe of a film.<br><br>Four hundred and fifty some days after a zombie apocalypse, a group of survivors are being escorted by a pair of \"military\" personnel through the country, toward one of the last havens of humanity. Some place called \"Imperium\" or something. I loosely use the word \"military\" because these two jackholes are merely caricatures of their roles. They remind me of the soldiers, in charge, in the underground bunker in Romero's Day of the Dead. <br><br>Along with the soldiers, there's an overly protective Father with his 20-something, naive, daughter. There's a horny young man, trying to get into the daughter's pants, a Christian zealot, pygmy, pregnant, raped, black woman, and a young attractive foul-mouthed brunette who, for inexplicable reasons, is letting the middle aged father plow her, whenever and wherever they get the chance.<br><br>Also, there's a prisoner, orange jumpsuit and all, who I mustn't forget, because he is the protagonist of the story. Apparently, he is one of the scientists responsible for the zombie plague. The apocalypse was caused by a vaccination, went wrong, that they had developed in the lab. <br><br>So... they're bringing this guy, in chains, across a zombie ridden land, back to Imperium... so they can execute him. I know, this sounds pretty dumb: probably because it is. The only person who knows how to get there is Major Gibson, who couldn't lead a platoon of men out of a wet paper bag.<br><br>I'll note, here, that up to this point I seriously thought that the movie was trying to be a comedy, like Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead. The character's antics were highlighted by the plucky strumming of stringed instruments, like something straight out of a Looney Tunes cartoon. Major Gibson, while hunting a rabbit, does a perfect Elmer Fudd impersonation: \"Shhhhhh.... I'm hunting a wabbit!\"<br><br>The Father and the slut are banging in the woods. He's railing her from behind, when the two are interrupted, and he loses his erection, to her disgust. I nearly blew cola out of my nose. Someone decided that it would be cool to add a sound effect of his \"pull out\". Which ended up being a wet, sloppy sucking noise, pretty much the same as you'd expect to hear in a scene with zombies digging through the intestinal tract of a recent kill.<br><br>Not-at-all related to the abundance of dumb-f**kery, of pretty much every person in the group, an unfortunate incident, with the Major, involving a bear trap, a zombie, and a machete, causes them to decide to seek shelter in a nearby abandoned school. <br><br>From here forward, the movie takes a decided turn toward actual horror. The party gets attacked, by a lone zombie, after they've barricaded themselves up in the school chapel. They decide that the \"freshness\" of the monster could mean that there are other survivors nearby, or at the very least, other zombies. As such, they go out to explore the school and find themselves facing an auditorium filled with the creatures. But something obviously queer is going on: one of the zombies has the power to bring the undead back to life. Of course, they decide to abduct this 'messiah' zombie, who could potentially be the cure for the plague. <br><br>Now the film becomes muddled again with only about fifteen to twenty minutes to go, there's no clear path as to what they ought to do. The Major, who is the only one who knows the way to civilization, recently turned zombie from his injury, could be made un-undead. But that path, in the story, is quickly tabled when the daughter, for no explainable reason, blows the Major's head off at the moment he has just been resurrected. <br><br>So... they (the writers) decided to just end it all in a typical downward spiral of chaos that ultimately has the film coming to conclusion with everyone dead, except for the scientist, who has pretty much given up, and appears poised to throw himself into a herd of zombies, cause he would rather be dead than \"living amongst the dead.\"","user":"captzero","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"Interesting zombie take.","rating":4,"date":"29 March 2015","review":"I expected this to be a very low budget production, with nothing to show but a weak poster and the most typical of horror movies subject today: zombies!<br><br>Strangely enough, this isn't a horror but a black comedy, at least for better than half you do giggle a lot as the script is funny to be honest. Did not expect that, came in as a nice surprise. And as the movie progresses you do get to see a little zombie action too, not too gory, not too deadly, overall, the usual I guess. So I won't go bashing this one, as I initially expected but am gonna rate it as a nice surprise, nothing to recommend but I for one am glad I got to put my eyes on it. I've seen worse, a lot worse, thus, I can only appreciate it to its normal value. <br><br>You do have to consider the budget firstly, the genre, the location and at the end of the analysis I think \"Zombie Resurrection\" is just an OK movie!<br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"It's a shame it couldn't make it's mind up what film it was.","rating":4,"date":"18 August 2019","review":"Starts off with a almost unrelated scene of night vision commando strike taking out a few soldiers to gain intelligence (clearly never found in this film) . ...all quite optimistic so far.......<br><br>It then becomes an overly camp attempt at comedy horror with some of the worst overacting possible from one of the supposed soldiers. A 20 something woman playing a schoolgirl ........ A very odd looking pygmy black woman with the largest forehead I've seen .....who also happens to be pregnant after allegedly being raped, an overprotective nerdy father with erectile disfunction. A chav woman, a supposedly young boy who fancies the girl (who is clearly bald but tries to hide it with a combover).\nWe then get a mess of storyline leading them to a school.<br><br>If this film had just decided on what film I was going to be it could have made a fairly good serious zombie film. The effects weren't too bad (if you forgive the overuse of cgi blood splatter.\nBut instead they attempt to add what I guess they thought was humour!? If so it failed massively. People swearing at each other constantly doesn't make a scene funny.......especially if one character is acting like he's out of a kids film overacting like Jim Carey on Speed and the rest just swear and play it straight.\nFor a low budget film its set design, locations and make up are great. But the script seemed to be written as they went along. .........\nAnd the ending last and non sensical.\nOk if bored and looking for something on in background but sadly they missed an opportunity to make a good serious themed Zombie film.","user":"Jester222","rank":[1,1]}]
