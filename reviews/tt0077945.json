[{"title":"Madman's review!","rating":31,"date":"31 March 2004","review":"Italian horror supremo Sergio Martino managed to persuade Ursula Andress into this now notorious jungle adventure and moreover got her to display her boobies! Back in the days when animal rights activists were just a glimmer in their fathers eye, film makers were able to shock audiences by showing gratuitious scenes of animals being killed. In this case, a giant snake eating a monkey, tribesmen slicing open a large lizard, and a number of others - intense imagery but it does go to show how brutal nature can be.<br><br>Andress plays Susan Stevenson, the wife of a scientist who has become lost in the New Guinea jungle, and mounts an expedition with the help of her brother and another scientist. They soon meet up with the mysterious Manolo who helps in the search and discover that Susan's hubby has gone in search of a secret tribe living on a remote mountain called Ra Ra Me which translates as Mountain Of The Cannibal God.<br><br>Much of the group are killed on the way by members of the cannibal tribe and when they do arrive at the mountain, it is the Uranium in the rocks that Susan seeks for financial gain rather than locating her husband. However, her plans are quickly scuppered when the tribe capture her and the last remaining scientist and take them to their mountain lair. They believe that Susan is a goddess and create a living monument by smearing her naked body with fluid and putting ceremonial items on her. How sweet.<br><br>The jungle locations are rich and vibrant, and the cannibals are genuinly scarey looking characters - especially the midget one. The flick does over use shock tactics in parts such as the frenzied sex scene which includes a large boar as far as I can make out. That said, I personally enjoyed the whole 70's exploitation experience but that may be due to having something wrong with my head.<br><br>7.75 out of 10.","user":"MrMad","rank":[36,41]},{"title":"More ghastly cannibal stuff........","rating":20,"date":"20 January 2003","review":"I can't figure out why these late 1970s, Italian cannibal adventures intrigue me so much.  I always get disgusted when they kill animals for the sake of a stupid movie, and yet time and time again, I'm drawn to movies like SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, which, in this case, I saw under its uncut European version, MOUNTAIN OF THE CANNIBAL GOD.  I had thought that with big names like Ursulla Andres and Stacey Keach involved, this one would be at least a little cleaner than CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, the most notorious of the genre.<br><br>    As another of those \"movies we love to hate\", I recommend this one if it's easily accessible.  Fans of Andres will enjoy seeing her naked, of course.  As a jungle adventure, it succeeds and the occasional gore makes it that much more intense.  Scenes of humans bleeding are faked, but as is often the case, the scenes of animals (i.e. a monitor lizard) bleeding are way too authentic.  I don't advise eating spagheti while watching this story of some lady seeking her missing husband in a dense jungle, and stumbling upon \"The Puka\", a group of cannibals (one of which is a dwarf; added for comic relief).","user":"damonfoster","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Very well-made jungle adventure","rating":7,"date":"24 April 2006","review":"\"Mountain of the Cannibal God\" may disappoint those looking for a hardcore cannibal flick, but if you're willing to accept it as a jungle adventure with occasional doses of gore it works better. The production is colorful and polished; this movie really looks great on DVD. Sergio Martino does a solid job with the direction; apart from \"Predator\", I don't think I've seen a film with a better sense of place during its jungle scenes. The plot has a good build-up, and even attempts a couple of twists. Ursula Andress handles her physically demanding role well (no wonder the cannibals mistake her for a goddess; that's what Ursula is. And did anyone else find one of the cannibal girls that were painting her up quite hot?). Stacy Keach is a solid lead and has the best (and best-delivered) line in the film: \"You never forget the taste of human flesh!\". By the way, I watched a 97-minute version which was quite gory, but had some \"extreme\" scenes that others have mentioned (bestiality) missing. (**1/2)","user":"gridoon","rank":[19,21]}]
