[{"title":"TERRIBLE WRITING AND DIRECTING","rating":4,"date":"20 August 2019","review":"Had potential... But the acting and direction often seemed forced and clunky. Had some well known film and TV stars, however they were bound and gagged by the script. Sorry but it's a fail for me","user":"ceedee68","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Some talented actors, wasted","rating":3,"date":"5 February 2019","review":"This is being written to counter all the 10/10 review written by the friends and relatives of the above-the-line crew. This is an abysmal film built around a decent premise, that wastes the talents of pretty much every actor involved. The constant switching to talk shows discussing the crime is full of self-importance, the \"twist\" is annoying, and the trial is just pure, hot garbage. Honestly, without some of the actors' efforts (not the lead, though... he was terrible), this would have rated zero stars. And for those of you praising the lack of profanity... Yes, isn't that just terrific? So clean and wholesome... Oh, except for the genuine footage of a young black man being shot through the head at close range. Yeah... So good that this was free from profanity. Dull AND disgusting.","user":"iboso64","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Nothing Interesting to Talk About on This \"Street\"","rating":2,"date":"19 January 2019","review":"Canal Street<br><br>While Canal Street boasts the hope for the audience to look beyond racial views, instead shoves it in your face harder than snowplow. It's a shame since in the age of films like The Hate U Give, BlacKkKlansman and other groundbreaking films like this in 2018, Canal Street lacks any of the emotional weight to hang onto.<br><br>The film tells the story of a young black male named Kholi who recently moved to the neighborhood and befriends another male named Brian. After dropping Brian off from a party, he was found dead in the middle of the street and Kholi standing over his body. Then the world will find out in a highly publicized case will another black male fall under the court's decision.<br><br>While the inclusion of having well-known radio DJ's sharing their opinions brings a sense of realism to the film, it becomes too repetitive as it cuts back and forth constantly throughout the film.<br><br>The biggest problem I have with the film lays with the reveal of how everything came to happen to Brian. When we find out who does it, not only is it very unsatisfying and left me with the belief that none of the characters learned or grew from the situation. There was no changes or growth in the development of how characters see one another.<br><br>Canal Street boasts a star-studded cast but doesn't really challenge them as it should have. Nothing was learned, nothing was emotionally felt outside of the status quo and nothing left to say after seeing the movie.<br><br>Rating: 2.8 / 10","user":"travishouze","rank":[17,23]}]
