[{"title":"Thematically Profound, Visually Stunning","rating":8,"date":"1 February 2012","review":"This is a non-Hollywood type film, too. There are no fancy sets, and some of the plot and dialogue are improvised, enhancing spontaneity and grim realism. It's a film not unlike 'Courageous' or other spartan Christian films.<br><br>\"Suing the Devil\" is one of the most visually striking film I have ever seen. And the underlying theme of mankind's arrogance, against an implacable Nature, is starkly apparent. The film is visionary, profound. It will leave many viewers changed, enriched, perhaps even a little wiser.<br><br>There are many good, very good and great films - too many to list, in fact. What I am hoping to do is label each film I see fit as a \"masterwork\".<br><br>This film is a masterwork.","user":"howardbrown","rank":[56,60]},{"title":"an almost Biblical like morality play","rating":9,"date":"31 January 2012","review":"If you've read C.S. Lewis in college or university, this film will be a delightful surprise, especially in contrast to what usually happens to film adaptations of literature. For those of you who've never heard of C.S. Lewis, it's no matter. This film can stand on its own without reference or support from its original source.<br><br>Many a movie since my childhood has brought a tear to my eye, but I have not *sobbed* at a movie in the past fifteen years, except once: at the end of SUING THE DEVIL. It is moving, passionate and poignant. Don't miss it.<br><br>Rating: **** out of ****.<br><br>The film most-likely will not appeal to the young, hip, God-less crowd who relish 'Dark Knight' and drool over 'Saw'. But for the more intelligent, kinder generation - this film is wildly amazing and shows the spiritual battle that we face against a real Biblical dragon. If you just read the negative reviews from these kids, it makes you almost cry. They're doomed and they don't know it. They'd rather play Special Ops than seek God. Just like in the days of Noah....","user":"shoobieK57","rank":[63,68]},{"title":"An appropriate spoiler review","rating":7,"date":"31 January 2012","review":"As an African-American, I loved this movie, man. Bar none.<br><br>I'm really tired of hearing about these 2 guys who pirated the film, then bashed it. You guys should be thrown in jail. What's wrong with you? Why do people have to be like that? This is the state of our society, man.<br><br>Let me start by saying the Suing the Devil is a good movie. A GOOD movie, not a great one. I'm not sure how this one got so big, I mean, yes it's got that nice twist, but it's also somewhat predictable and (SPOILER AHEAD!) completely ludicrous if you think about it. Think about it! seriously. This movie reminds me of Arlington Road and Reindeer Games in that the movie doesn't make sense if you sit down and rationally think about it.<br><br>If you like drama, horror, mystery, and/or thrillers, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. Although it's not one of my favorite movies, it is a great movie, with great acting and directing skills. If you haven't already seen it, rent it. 3.5/5 stars","user":"the_og1","rank":[62,67]}]
