[{"title":"Gripping!","rating":9,"date":"15 February 2020","review":"Great thriller, totally in suspense! Rachel Warren was fantastic!","user":"hamermichelle","rank":[9,15]},{"title":"Hi score reviews are fake, low scores are bitter","rating":5,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"Tricky one this....\nOverall, not bad. Some misdirected/poorly acted scenes between Alex and Liam but the two lead actresses did a pretty good job throughout. Too much of a lean on wide angle lens shots - and the fact that I picked up on it should show how much it was misused.\nPretty sure I understood the end, but it's slightly ambiguous which is not a bad thing.\nIt's not a GREAT film but it's not awful either. If you have an interest in films (as opposed to purely being a consumer of them) I'd say it's worth a watch. I didn't regret seeing it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know either.\nLooks like a first feature for a lot of the creatives, and I think it was a strong showing with a lot of really nice choices. Without being derivative it reminded me a little of the Hammer House Of Horror series from the 80s and also (weirdly) the 60s Avengers TV show (Emma Peel and Steed) - in a good way.\nDon't be mislead by the super high scores, but don't be put off by the super low ones either.","user":"al-mcdowall","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Thought provoking thriller","rating":9,"date":"16 February 2020","review":"Slow start but becomes very interesting, not at all what I expected. The story leaves you with something to think about. Much more of a psychological thriller than a horror. High production values and a great cast. Recommended for something a bit different.","user":"Billiekind","rank":[5,8]}]
