It's for kids who don't want to see, and especially not read Lord of the Flies. It's basically a re-imagining of it with less creativity, worse writing and filled with contradictions and cliches. Lord of the Flies was all about the premise of what would happen if kids were put into an almost impossible situation. This movie was made just to have another movie with a bunch of pretty young people who look like the young Jonas Brothers and Kardashian fans. But: If you like movies where you couldn't care less about ANY of the characters, you might like this. But you might also be a little dopey.","user":"genious-35413","rank":[26,31]}]
