[{"title":"Tongue in cheek","rating":6,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"What you need to have in mind when watching this movie is that it's a spoof and is all very tongue in cheek. It should not be taken seriously.\nSure, the acting isn't great, but it isn't supposed to be.\nThe leads both absolutely looked the part, there were some amusing support roles and the style was nicely observed.\nAs a movie, it never quite took off for me and I never detected any real chemistry between the leads. But it is amusing, the bowling scenes with the cardboard salesman and the dancing at the dinner party were highlights for me.\nThe line \"A&gt;B&gt;C, Always be cardboard\" had me laughing out loud.\nNo classic, but not a complete dud either.","user":"greenheart","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"Poppy Delevingne!","rating":9,"date":"1 March 2020","review":"The acting and production was done in this way. It's done purposely. Enjoy every bit of it. Some of my favorite actors in this one and it's so funny. Clever scriptwriting and you have to give it to the director he sure got so many people mad on here for some reason lol.","user":"irina_rivers","rank":[19,23]},{"title":"Original","rating":7,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"I loved it! Great actors, funny storyline and though it's an indie movie they still made it work. Give it a go","user":"shanksrajendran","rank":[18,22]}]
