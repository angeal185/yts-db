[{"title":"Spoiler alert!","rating":7,"date":"14 October 2019","review":"Always fun to watch a daring indie film, this one did not disappoint. Several twists in the film. In the end though, I felt that Isaac was selfish for his reckless action to try to force a confrontation that Tom didn't want to have. Isaac just needed to get over the heartbreak and move on.","user":"canyongirl60","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"Bad movie, bad acting, bad stiry","rating":2,"date":"22 October 2019","review":"Based on the high reviews, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. When I started watching this movie....I thought I must be watching the wrong movie. The main character was such a bad and wooden actor.... along with most of the other \"actors\". Its so bad, so badly acted and written and is so unbelievable.","user":"cammic","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"The film I've been waiting for!","rating":10,"date":"6 November 2019","review":"I was not sure if it was worth paying the $5.99 to stream it but I absolutely loved it. It's just a great movie, and the subject matter happens to be gay. Isaac Smith takes us on a beautiful ride of self discover. It appeals to a wide variety of ages, genders, and sexual orientations! And the cast of the movie is diverse as well! Whether you're gay, straight, or undecided you will love it...or not. Don't take my word for it, go see it and write about it.","user":"goalstoday-766-248845","rank":[3,4]}]
