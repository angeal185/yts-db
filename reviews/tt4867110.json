[{"title":"Worst movie I've ever seen","rating":1,"date":"22 June 2019","review":"I really don't know how can anyone rate this with more than 4 stars. I have no words to describe it. Only watched it because of Noah and it was a complete waste of time. The characters are all stereotypes, the girls are either dumb and shallow or a nerdy shy romantic, the boys are pigs. It's not even funny. Of course there's a man to teach girls about their value, feminism and all, cause how else would they learn, right? The storyline is so poor, terrible acting, useless scenes. I'm so confused, why the hell did Noah take this job? Adam Sandler's movies are oscar worthy compared to this garbage, honestly. Don't waste your time!","user":"bamarconi","rank":[345,350]},{"title":"Really bad movie","rating":2,"date":"1 July 2019","review":"I don't even know where to start. The acting was poor, there were sound issues on the movie, I don't think I've ever watched a movie where that happened (you can hear ambient noise sometimes, weird music, people that are talking on corridor sound louder like if they were speaking directly to you). Most characters acting was really bad, they introduce new people, like family members all the time. There scenes that doesn't make any sense, they just add extra minutes to the film. Many plot holes and continuity issues too. It could have been a funny movie based on the app idea, but they make it painful to watch instead.","user":"lucas-kovacs","rank":[116,117]},{"title":"TRASH","rating":1,"date":"7 July 2019","review":"I made an account just to review this. This is the WORST movie I have ever seen. The cinematography was horrific. The acting was atrocious. The plot? What plot! PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS! It's not even fun to make fun of, it's just bad.","user":"giwaamuomotese","rank":[146,148]}]
