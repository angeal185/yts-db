[{"title":"Understated but well done","rating":6,"date":"6 June 2004","review":"Though a low budget movie, this is the stuff movies should be. There is no need for CG and glossing and there are a few times the plot is slow, but very few. Overall, with the twists and turns and the \"humanness\" of the characters, this movie is better than most, IMHO. The \"reality\" is high and that grabs the viewer in a way most big budget movies cannot do. The idea of many high-grossing productions is escapism, and that's fine, they do what they are supposed to do. But this movie drags you in rather than allowing an escape, wonderfully refreshing and well done.<br><br>Cast, crew, and director, take a bow. The camera work also deserves high honors. No, it does not have the most erotic, gore-filled scenes. It does show what real people are capable of when driven by their own desires. Howie, the wannabe scriptwriter, willing to do anything, Tammi, the wannabe actress, in the same boat, Silk, the killer and psychopath doing what he does and then Howie's wife, and two friends, duped as they would be.<br><br>I'd give it a solid 8 and hope for more from this talented group.","user":"gdunagin-1","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Not the Greatest.","rating":3,"date":"15 November 2007","review":"The beginning of the movie i found to be to strung out. It took forever for the plot to start taking place and it was hardly scary at all. <br><br>It was more of a erotic mystery film than a horror. I found the acting to be somewhat horrible and i think Mekhi Phifer, who played Silk, should have thought twice about doing this movie. <br><br>The \"Scary\" scenes included mostly of guns being fired and inevitable shouting, wasn't horrifying at all. <br><br>Acting on some scenes seemed to be unrealistic. Ending of the plot was twisted and good but wasted to much time getting to the plot. I definitely wouldn't pay to see this movie nor would i buy it to add to my collection","user":"staticextasy","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"Not a perfect movie, but worthy to be watched","rating":8,"date":"22 September 2006","review":"A good thriller, keeps you unaware of how plot will develop and every time the bad guy is gonna be knocked down, a mishap happens, which leads to uncover the real story. Watch it till end! You won't regret.<br><br>Movie is certainly far from perfection - budget definitely was scarce, at the same time all male characters are rather well played, female roles are less impressive, though not bad. Some did call this movie erotic, may be formally correct, but sex is shown in more innocent, one could have expect from erotic thriller. Still, the best in this movie I found - a screenplay.<br><br>The very often used moral in most of US thrillers - DO NOT GET A STRANGER IN HOUSE! If you do, you're wrong!","user":"georgegeorgian","rank":[8,12]}]
