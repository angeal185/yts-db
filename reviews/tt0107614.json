[{"title":"Robin Williams Dressed Up As A 60 Year Old Women? HILARIOUS!","rating":18,"date":"18 August 2001","review":"I saw this movie at the cinema in 1993 and thought it was fantastic! It has everything you could ever really want in a comedy. Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) will do ANYTHING to see his children! This movie has plenty of gags, but it all comes together in a nice, friendly framework that centres around one man's family and that man's love for his children that'll make him dress up as a 60 year old granny to get back into their lives! Plenty of laughs throughout and all-round great performances. 9/10","user":"GrantCAGE","rank":[79,92]},{"title":"Funny And Heartfelt","rating":10,"date":"19 January 2000","review":"\"Mrs. Doubtfire\" is an extremely funny and heartfelt film. It has tons of laughs as well as tears, this is definitly Robin Williams' best film. Watching williams do voices as well as play Mrs. Doubtfire is a real treat. Also the supporting cast of actors do an excellent job, I highly reccomend it.","user":"claudonio","rank":[56,65]},{"title":"funny and wonderful movie!","rating":30,"date":"30 November 2004","review":"Many people say that \"Mrs.Doubtfire\" is one of the funniest movies ever made in the U.S. I agree with the above idea for the following two reasons. First,performance of the voice of Robin Williams is very wonderful.For example, he uses a lot of funny ad lib in the stand-in of animation in the first scene. Second, Robin Williams and Sally Field as well as the three children act very delightfully though the movie deals with a rather serious theme---warmth and importance of family. Some people say Sally Field doesn't act well in this movie. But, I think that she acts a role of a wife whom is worried about her husband excelentlly. We feel big love of both father and mother toward children. It is not only a real funny comedy but also a real wonderful family movie.","user":"yumincoromochi","rank":[77,93]}]
