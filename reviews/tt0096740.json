[{"title":"A truly moving story.","rating":9,"date":"11 February 2007","review":"What a great movie. It was recommended to me by a friend whose family escaped communist Poland in the early 1980s. Having no notion of what life under such oppressive regime might be like, I watched the movie more out of respect to my friend than a genuine interest in the story. But it sucked me in completely. It was well worth the time. And stayed with me long after. What these two kids went through to help their family was truly moving. Also, it gave me a better understanding of what communism in Eastern Europe was like in the 1980s. Excellent acting. Very well done.<br><br>A moving story, indeed.","user":"ank02","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"amazing movie, a must watch for anyone who thinks their life sucks","rating":10,"date":"22 November 2014","review":"i am so happy to find this movie again,i last watch this movie in Europe as a kid when i was only a young boy in the 1990's,i am about to re- watch it again as a adult living in Asia, lets see how it will turn out this time, i vaguely remember the story, so its going to be a great watch, lets start now,i will write more as the movie progress or when i am finished @20min of the film i love the way their park their motorcycle, hehehe so funny @44min i love the way the 2 boys reunited @125min of the movie is the most touching part, makes u want to cry,i can really feel their pain <br><br>OK the movie finished now,man it was great, i loved it, this story will really touch ur heart if u r an immigrant,most especially if u came from Europe controlled by Russians. anyways, i recommend to watch the new movie \"The Immigrant\" (2013) right after seeing this movie if u haven't already seen it, also i really wish that they showed more of the boys life after leaving Poland,i am really curious if the little boy really made it all the way to Louisiana USA.

As a crucial element of a person's daily life, freedom is essential for all citizens of the world as it enables everybody to realize their true potential. A key thing to note about freedom is that it takes a completely new meaning with the involvement of money in its significance. It can be surmised that Polish director Maciej Dejczer must have kept these things in mind when he shot \"300 Mil Do Nieba\". He has made one of the finest European films which deals with key questions related to money, danger, risks, immigration etc. The theme of east versus west has been nicely dealt with in this film with the dissemination of the underlying message that life is much better in west. This makes perfect sense to two young Polish boys who experience on a personal basis how corrupt officials ruin the lives of innocent people. The political system in the east is shown as a colossal failure as an essential activity of even getting a passport is subjected to unnecessary scrutiny. It is at this stage that this film's protagonists realize the importance of risk taking in order to become completely free. It came in the form of two young lads who move to the west after hiding themselves under a truck. Some structural changes were brought in the film. For example: Denmark represented West as if it had everything.Lastly,the benign presence of Polish actor Wojciech Klata is enough to bring smiles on one's face.","user":"FilmCriticLalitRao","rank":[5,6]}]
