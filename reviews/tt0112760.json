[{"title":"not fair","rating":6,"date":"4 August 2003","review":"This film was responsible for the bankruptcy of the company behind it, Carolco. Which is a shame, but the film is not as bad as it is rumoured to be. Far from it. It's above average oldfashioned entertainment.<br><br>The soundtrack alone is a standout. Sweeping and powerful, it serves the plotline well and it's a joy to listen to on its own. Although the characters aren't among the most complex and well defined in movie history, they work (with a couple of exceptions, among them Maury Chaykin as John Reed, whose acting just doesn't match the tone of the film). And then there's the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships, well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects.<br><br>\nIn short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time. A great warmup for Pirates of the Caribbean (which hasn't opened yet in this neck of the woods).","user":"PennyLANE77","rank":[57,71]},{"title":"Bad Marketing for a Good Pirate Film","rating":7,"date":"26 June 2018","review":"\"Cutthroat Island\" is a 1995 film with chaotic production and distribution and with unfair reviews of the professional critics. Renny Harlin and Geena Davis were married at that time and he convinced the producers to cast his wife in an action film in a complete misevaluation of her talent. Geena Davis was a great actress in comedy and drama genres in the 80´s and 90´s but was only reasonable in the role of the female pirate Morgan Adams. Another problem was to find an actor for Morgan´s slave William Shaw since Matthew Modine was the last choice in a long list of actors that refused the role. It seems that this notorious film was also the responsible for the bankruptcy of Carolco Pictures since the box office was frustrating.<br><br>Said that, \"Cutthroat Island\" is indeed an entertaining modern (in 1995) pirate movie, with a good story. The successful franchize \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is an improvement of \"Cutthroat Island\" with better technology, budget and cast. But the stories are equaly entertaining and funny. In the end, forget the bad ratings of professional critics and have a goodtime watching this film. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"A Ilha da Garganta Cortada\" (\"The Cutthroat Island\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[28,36]},{"title":"One of the all time greatest pirate films ever made!","rating":10,"date":"13 July 2003","review":"One film I added to my \"Best Films of 1995\" list!!<br><br>I still don't know why this film was never a hit.  I mean it was no Best Picture contender, but it was a great action film and it was Renny Harlin at the top of his game!<br><br>Geenea Davis never looked better and director Renny Harlin has never made a more action packed film since Cutthroat Island or after Cutthroat Island!<br><br>I saw the film 2xs when it first hit theaters, then bought my copy as soon as it it video (this was before DVD came into play then I up-graded my copy) and I loved it then and I still love it!<br><br>It's just a great ol' adventure story about a female pirate (Geena Davis looking really good) and her companion race against their rivals to find a hidden island that contains a fabulous treasure.  Whats up against her besides her nasty uncle is a crew that is sceptical of her leadership abilities, so she must complete her quest before they mutiny against her.<br><br><br><br>I think the reason so many critics hated it was because it was a woman doing what men only thought they could do and a woman doing it better!<br><br>The plot had strong action, great lines and a strong plot with a fiery woman's point of view, with lots of action and romance with that ol' B movie adventure fell that still to this day keeps me on the edge of my seat no matter how many times I watch it!<br><br>Bravo Renny Harlin and Geena Davis!!<br><br>Who knows with a stroke of luck and a few movie buffs like me who love this little undiscovered lost treasure of a film it may just one day see the light of day as a un-song hero of pirate films and become a cult classic!<br><br>One can only hope!","user":"HCG714","rank":[40,55]}]
