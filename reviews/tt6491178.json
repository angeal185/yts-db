[{"title":"All the 'I was dragged across concrete' metaphors were taken","rating":1,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"I just feel empty inside. It wasn't just 2hrs and 40 min. long was it?...I'm just at the end...of the first time,..I think?..but I don't think it will ever end. This is my Sisyphus eternity just beginning. The credits are going to roll, then there will be this flutter...and poof I'll be back to the beginning. I'll be forced to watch this...back to back to back..forever. What did I do to deserve this? Please help me!!!\nSeriously..I didn't think 1 Star was possible with this type of cast, but apparently it is...I wish you luck if you're about to dive into these waters.","user":"mdesrosiers-28152","rank":[49,79]},{"title":"one of the best of '18/19 that no one will see.. Unfortunately","rating":9,"date":"22 March 2019","review":"This is a slow burn in every possible way. Much more related to his previous film cell block 99 than his Bone Tomahawk before that. It's a step by step play the entire film almost 0 editing and everything falls right in order of the story and it's the strongest point of the film. Some might yawn at the long run time but In my opinion it's justified. I was never bored or needed to pause to take a break for the entire 2 hours and 35 minutes of showing because at any point you think it's going to drag across concrete and fall flat on itself it gives you just enough to continue the show and boy does it become a show... But without giving away anything at all I can say it was worth my time and if you liked his previous work it's worth yours as well. The acting is top tier all around and the script is probably one of the most creatively worded I've ever seen with humor all over it just because of it but in a great intentional way. Just a shame only a few lucky ones will get the chance to see it but I'm glad this Writer/Director doesn't do wide release because we'd be seeing a different version and probably not for the better... and I applaud him for giving Vince Vaughn the roles he deserves he knocked it out of the park alongside Gibson. 9/10","user":"ryanwcar","rank":[339,622]},{"title":"So Disappointing.
