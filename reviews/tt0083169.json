[{"title":"War games","rating":7,"date":"13 February 2006","review":"\"Taps\" presents a twist in the way students in a military academy of certain reputation perceive how honor is, above all, the thing to live for, even over all other qualities a man could possess. The teachings of this military institution, molding young men 12 to 18 years old, have a profound effect, especially in the intense Brian Moreland, who is a clear favorite of the academy director, General Bache.<br><br>Harold Becker directed \"Taps\", which is based on a novel by Devery Freeman. The action of the film takes place in the fictional Bunker Hill Military Academy, that has just been sold to private investors who want transform the site into condominiums.<br><br>With a history of having molded young minds during its distinguished history, Gen. Bache is horrified by the mere thought of losing the academy and the young people he has helped to involve in the rich life of the military. After a tragic incident that involves the killing of a townie, Bache suffers a heart attack, leaving the academy in the hands of people that are seen trying to undermine the fallen leader.<br><br>Brian Moreland, the serious minded young man, takes it into his own hands to take care of what he thinks would be Gen. Bache's reaction in saving the school by getting the rest of the students left at the academy to hold it hostage and not give in to the upcoming changes, or to other people who don't have the same purpose in mind.<br><br>Timothy Hutton is about the best thing going for the film. This young actor brought the right amount of seriousness, courage and valor to the role. This film is basically the big screen debut for Sean Penn and Tom Cruise, who went to build spectacular careers of their own. George C. Scott, another excellent actor is seen as Gen. Bache, but unfortunately, he doesn't have much to do and only appears in the opening sequences. Other familiar faces in the cast, Billy Van Zandt, Giancarlo Esposito.<br><br>\"Taps\" is a film that shows how some young minds will act when they follow to the letter things they have learned in theory in the classroom. It also recognizes how honor could get a well meaning person to do things that he will regret later on and how it can cause harm to innocent young men that go along with these new leaders.","user":"jotix100","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"Once upon a time during the Cold War","rating":4,"date":"4 August 2001","review":"I first saw Taps when I was only 11 and I loved it. But at eleven I liked it for its militaristic attributes rather than its 'fight for honour' motif. <br><br>I recently, aged 31, saw it again, and, predictably, liked it for entirely different reasons.  Firstly, as someone else on this sight mentioned, the film is quite beautiful to look at.  The cinematography is quite stunning actually, and if you don't believe me, watch it again.  Secondly the direction, writing, and editing is tight, controlled and technically fairly solid.  <br><br>But what made this film for me was the impressive, inspired acting by the, at the time, young cast.  I was captivated by the core trio of Cruise, Penn, and Hutton.  If charisma were a concrete substance these three would have garbage bags of the stuff stowed in their cupboards.  <br><br>The script was thoughtful, and, importantly, believable.  The ending was very powerful......when I was eleven, but once seen, lost it's effect on subsequent viewings.","user":"dcs84","rank":[31,37]},{"title":"Mixed feelings","rating":9,"date":"17 November 2004","review":"Having graduated from a military academy and later joining army ROTC myself it was almost like I was living back at my high school again. Especially due to the fact that I was a company commander my senior year and had my best friends as platoon leaders and XO. I got a much different take on the movie than most of you. It is one that was much more prevalent in the military academy I to than ROTC. Rather than a view of \"misguided youths\" (I would argue the point that they were misguided) I saw the movie as fight between the old and the new. The old conservative ways versus the post Vietnam War era generation. Whether to preserve conservative tradition or to continue with social liberalism. In the movie the fight was about tearing down the academy to build condominiums. In real life where I was, it was about turning our military academy into a normal prep school. In my case the fight didn't get violent, however like the cadets in the movie I picked the losing side.<br><br>In the movie I was heart broken that the governor would send troops to the school rather than try and work out a peaceful compromise when he saw the measure that people were willing to go to in order to protect their school. In real life I was very disheartened to see the old cadre of retired military officers get sacked and replaced by \"soft\" civilian administrators. It all hit a climax when one of my life's role models, a retired USAF Major and our companies tactical officer, spoke out against some of the changes being made and got himself sacked. For me that was George C Scott, Penn and Cruise were my friends and platoon leaders in my company and the crisis between the old ways and the new ways were very much the same. The movie reached out to me possibly more than any other. It was seeing my teenage self all over again.","user":"pazmasta","rank":[82,107]}]
