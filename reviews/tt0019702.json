[{"title":"All Things Considered, Quite Extraordinary","rating":9,"date":"18 March 1999","review":"Considering the technical limitations confronting Hitchcock (the part-sound/part-silent format; the bulky, graceless early sound camera; a leading lady who barely spoke English, etc.), \"Blackmail\" remains one of the director's most impressive productions. The visual and sound quality is excellent, especially for a 1929 film, and already Hitchcock is using distinctive camera angles to create memorable effects. (Notice the shadowy interior of the Artist's loft, and the way Hitchcock swoops the camera about to convey Alice's disorientation after the murder.) I also love the way Hitchcock depicts the Blackmailer's flight after his climactic confrontation with Alice and the Detective. We never see the Blackmailer at all - the camera remains frozen on the face of the Detective, who reacts to what is going on. At the moment the Blackmailer shatters the window, the Detective lets out a shout, and the camera - as if startled by the commotion - dollies backward. We immediately cut to the busted window, with a posse of lawmen rushing toward it. It's a wonderful device (what other director in 1929 would have approached the scene in this way, I wonder?). The performances in \"Blackmail\" are remarkable and eccentric, in the best sense of the word. Donald Calthrop and Cyril Ritchard, playing the disheveled blackmailer and the lecherous artist, etch themselves in your memory. Anny Ondra is fine as Alice, gamely committing herself to the role, even though she was pantomiming lines. Her dazed reactions at the climax of the murder sequence are shocking. She's like a demented robot, yet the behavior rings true for me. Lastly, let me say I admire John Longden's performance most of all. His role as Frank, the detective, is in no sense that of a traditional film hero. He often bullies Alice, turns moody and childish during arguments and is willing to pin murder on an innocent (albeit not very nice) man. Longden realizes all the not very appealing attributes of Frank's behavior (how he sneers when the tables finally turn on Calthrop), but he also makes clear that he loves Alice and is trying to protect her. He is clearly devastated as he talks with Alice in the phone booth and realizes she is indeed guilty. In summary, few of Hitchcock's 1930 British films are on a par with \"Blackmail.\"  The depth of its characterizations will remain unmatched until \"Rebecca\" a decade later. Reflect on how \"Blackmail\" compares - technically - with America's first sound film and you start to see the true measure of Hitchcock's genius.","user":"Fangus","rank":[31,32]},{"title":"Creative, Subtle, & Suspenseful","rating":1,"date":"1 June 2001","review":"While remembered as the first sound picture made by Alfred Hitchcock (or anyone else in Britain), there is much more to \"Blackmail\" than merely historical interest.  It reveals the director's subtle creativity, with a carefully structured story that also produces some real suspense, with one of Hitchcock's best cameos and an entertaining chase sequence as bonuses. The movie has a unique feel, as Hitchcock was still using many silent film techniques at the same time that he was experimenting with sound.  Not all of this works perfectly, but it does not detract from the film's many positive features.<br><br>Alice White (Anny Ondra, voice dubbed by Joan Barry) goes out for the evening with her boyfriend, who is a police detective (John Longden).  When they have a series of minor quarrels, Alice decides to go her own way, and meets an artist friend.  The artist's intentions are obvious, but Alice is innocently unaware.  When he brings her to his studio, there is soon an unpleasant confrontation that sets in motion a turbulent series of events.<br><br>The story is carefully constructed not just to produce suspense but also to raise interesting questions in the viewer's mind.  Alice feels a terrible sense of guilt and fear over what has happened - communicated to the viewer in a variety of creative ways - but of what is she really guilty?  The behavior of the detective boyfriend is partly well-intentioned, but he certainly is not faultless.  The moral ambiguity is often subtle, because it takes a back seat to the suspense, and it takes a couple of viewings to appreciate all that is going on.<br><br>There is a particularly nice symmetry to the beginning and ending, pointing to the greater significance of the action in between.  The opening sequence (filmed in silent movie style) shows the detective and his partner dealing with a suspect in a routine way, not caring about him as a person.  In the final scenes, when the detective must help Alice make a final report on everything that has happened, he sees his job in a far different perspective.<br><br>\"Blackmail\" is of the darker type of Hitchcock, like \"Notorious\" or \"Vertigo\".  While clearly made in a different era, it has the same kind of depth and craftsmanship that distinguished those later, more well-known masterpieces.","user":"Snow Leopard","rank":[47,51]},{"title":"Remarkable piece of cinematic history","rating":7,"date":"25 March 2007","review":"Hitchcock's Blackmail might have been a total train wreck in the hands of a lesser talent. Instead, it is a remarkable piece of cinematic history, and still tremendously entertaining after 78 years. The film was partly shot when Hitchcock learned that he would have access to sound equipment. His female lead was a talented German silent picture actress, whose accent was too heavy for sound, so an off-camera reader had to be used, plus a decent amount of expensive film had already been used and had to be integrated into the 'talkie' as well.<br><br>All considered, the movie is probably the best example of the transition from these two cinematic paradigms that can be found.<br><br>The silent portion of the film establishes John Longden's character as a hard-nosed young Scotland Yard detective. Anny Ondra plays the lovely young lady who is engaged to him,and who soon becomes the center of our attention. One night after they argue over some petty matters, they part company and Anny meets up with a male artist friend, who, unbeknownst to her, is interested in more than just pleasant conversation. Frank (Longden) spots them leaving the restaurant and follows them for a while. The artist coaxes Alice (Ondra) up to his flat, and things take a sinister turn in short order.<br><br>Over the second half of the film, the plots unfolds, and the emotions and consciences of the protagonists are sorely tried.<br><br>What immediately blew my mind was what a great silent director Hitchcock was. Shouldn't have been too surprising since Hitchcock has always struck me as a master cinematographer. The first 20 minutes of the film are completely silent,and there are no interruptions from distracting story boards. Nevertheless, through incredible use of lighting, camera work, and evocative acting, you understand everything that is going on clearly, and are drawn straight into the edgy atmosphere so familiar to those who appreciate the work of this great director.<br><br>The acting is mostly very good. Only Longden sometimes seems to over or under-act his part, and Ondra is really wonderful all the way through. I was not surprised to learn of her lengthy and productive career both before and after this film and will now look for more of her work.It is also interesting to see how the actors adapted so readily to the new medium. Although some have said that the sound portion of this film seemed over-acted because the actors were still clinging to silent film conventions, I really can not agree. Some of the characters (Alice, for example) required very evocative, rather physical performances, and I can't imagine how she could have done better.<br><br>Highly recommended for the amazing photography, exceptionally professional though very early use of sound, and the typically perfect pace.","user":"mstomaso","rank":[25,26]}]
