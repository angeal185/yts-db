[{"title":"Leave the Boots on.","rating":3,"date":"21 August 2019","review":"Janie (Sarah Hollis ) accidentally kills her husband Frank (Will Leon) while having a discussion about his infidelity. The neighbor (Ben Morrison) who looks like the Geico caveman blackmails her for sex. Frank's brother Chuy (Jc Currais), rhymes with Baby Huey, consults an old Mexican (Pepe Serna)who uses GPS Tarot cards to locate the dead brother. He performs an Aztec ritual (he looked more Inca) to bring him back from the dead (something that would have come in handy against Cortez). Frank comes back and is not a total zombie, but he does want to kill his wife.<br><br>The film moved on the slow side. No great special effect. Characters were okay, but they needed to pick up the pace.<br><br>Guide: F-word. Sex. Brief nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Toe Headed Fugly Strippers and an Unwatchably Bad Movie","rating":1,"date":"7 September 2019","review":"No two ways about this one. It sucks. Poorly made and acted. And if you're gonna have strippers why not get some hot ones?<br><br>Go into any strip bar and you'll find a hundred hungry to get on celluloid.<br><br>This movie wants to be cool and stylized but it's just made by untalented people.<br><br>Plain and simple.","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[2,3]}]
