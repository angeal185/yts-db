[{"title":"Surprisingly good!","rating":8,"date":"8 April 2001","review":"If someone checks out the trailer, one might think, \"Another MTV-produced teen flick.  I think I'll pass on that.\"  Well, I went into the theater not thinking it was going to be bad, but I expected more of an amusing film that isn't really high on ingenuity.  True, \"Varsity Blues\" has those standard teen elements like wild drinking parties, the school slut, etc.  But it never overuses those elements.  It's more of a compelling comedy-drama about football that delivers a fine message about sportsmanship.  You have a pretty good idea how it's going to end up, but it's the way it's executed that makes it special.  Jon Voight is absolutely terrific as the no-nonsense coach.  He's the kind of character you want to stab in the chest every minute he's on screen, and Voight was a perfect choice.  The film dabbles with elements of the sport that probably hit home to some high school football players.  Voight's character has only one goal: winning.  And he doesn't care how he gets to that goal.  If he has to shoot drugs into every one of his players, he's going to arrive at that goal.  And I'm sure there are coaches out there who have that selfish goal.  Then James Van Der Beek comes along, and his character is not really concerned with winning or playing football in the first place.  But he likes football, has fun with it and simply wants to play a good, honest game.  If the team wins, good.  If it doesn't, so what.  He has a good locker room speech at the end of the movie.  <br><br>\"Varsity Blues\" is funny, moving and wonderfully acted.  It might appeal more to teens and young adults, more than the older ones, but I still suggest everyone check it out.","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[27,32]},{"title":"A pleasant surprise","rating":8,"date":"31 March 2000","review":"Since this is a teen-oriented film, I must confess that I wasn't expecting this to be very entertaining.  However, thanks to a generally intelligent script and a great job by Jon Voight, this turned out to be surprisingly good.  As you would probably expect in a teen movie, there are some scenes that seem juvenile and pointless, but thankfully, this film manages to limit these needless diversions.  The central story, although a familiar one, is well written and rather interesting.  Definitely worth checking out.","user":"Tito-8","rank":[27,33]},{"title":"Fairly entertaining, despite all the cliches","rating":6,"date":"16 April 2001","review":"Like a number of other reviewers, I though \"Varsity Blues\" wouldn't amount to much more than \"Dawson Plays Football\", MTV-style. Well, it's not -- it's actually quite good.  It deals fairly realistically with the trials and tribulations of Dawson . . . sorry, Mox (James Van Der Beek), the backup quarterback more interested in \"Catcher in the Rye\" than in his own playbook, who is forced to become the starter for his team.  The movie's filled with cliches:  the town obsessed with the football team; the overweight, goofy lineman; the slutty cheerleader with the heart of gold; the arrogant coach; the teacher straight out of an early 80's Van Halen video; etc, etc.  Surprisingly, there's enough twisted and wrinkles thrown into these cliches to make the story seem pretty fresh, if not entirely original.  You know how the story's going to end, but you're not always sure how it's going to get there, and that's what keeps it interesting.<br><br>Van Der Beek is very good, much better that I ever thought I'd give him credit for.  Also good:  Paul Walker as the original starting quarterback, and Amy Smart as Van Der Beek's smart girlfriend.  They played real characters as opposed to stereotypes, and I thought their performances really made the movie.  Surprisingly, I thought the weakest link was Jon Voight as the head coach.  He was a cardboard villain, no substance to him whatsoever.  I kept waiting for the film to explain why he wanted to win so bad, why he'd push his kids with such inhuman cruelty . . . and besides \"because he wants to win\", an answer was never given.  Too bad, although I think this was more the fault of the script than of Mr. Voight.<br><br>It's certainly not the best movie ever made -- for that matter, it's not even the best football movie ever made -- but it's still good. It has heart, and most of the performances make this film a cut above most of the \"Teen Films\" that are out there.  A fun rental.<br><br>B-","user":"MadReviewer","rank":[15,18]}]
