[{"title":"Low budget garbage.","rating":1,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"Well the concept isn't horrible, but whomever put this garbage together doesn't know how to make a movie. High score rating is obviously from friends of the cast and crew.","user":"psxexperten","rank":[14,24]},{"title":"Absolute Crap","rating":1,"date":"9 July 2019","review":"A more fitting title should be \"A solder and a Coward\"'. What complete waste of time.","user":"indrajitic","rank":[6,11]},{"title":"Unusually Bad","rating":2,"date":"23 August 2019","review":"Unfortunately this movie did not deliver on ANY level. The plot was potentially a good one about the closing days of WW2 in Europe but the weak story line and wooden actors were doomed from the start. The cast was very small with each playing multiple roles and they simply could not carry it off.\nThe SFX were third rate which was right on par with every other aspect of this movie.<br><br>If you can find the strength to sit through the movie, take an extra 3 minutes to read the closing credits that will acknowledge the endeavours of the entire family of the writer/producer/director (Jason Mills). Talk about keeping it in the family!\nThere was way too much \"Drone\" footage and it transpires that the Drone was owned by another family member (probably an xmas gift).\nIn summary this creation had no redeeming features and it is to be avoided at all costs!","user":"morrisdentith","rank":[5,9]}]
