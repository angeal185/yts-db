[{"title":"A Solid Watch","rating":8,"date":"27 June 2019","review":"It was recommended that I watch this by a friend of one of the filmmakers. I don't usually watch a lot of movies as that I'm more of a television series viewer. This very much reminded me of a series you may see on Netflix or Hulu and that's where it may have been better suited. I feel the filmmakers tried to pack too much into an hour and a half film. This content would have certainly been better explored over the course of 10 or so hours. Nonetheless I still enjoyed it and thought that cast did a stellar job. If you like intellectual drama that plays more like a television series than a traditional movie, give this one a go.","user":"jonathanianbloom","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"A dream within a dream","rating":9,"date":"22 June 2019","review":"I didn't know what to expect going into this, and it's not your typical horror movie. If you're expecting lots of blood or jump scares, you probably want to skip this one. If you like a slow burn that is something akin to reading an E.A. Poe story while drinking absinthe, than this may just be the movie for you. Great performances by a great cast. Colton steals the show!","user":"sarahannelovescats","rank":[20,26]},{"title":"Nice Indie Flick","rating":8,"date":"21 June 2019","review":"I think horror is probably the wrong category for this movie. It's more of an intellectual thriller and I think that's why so many people seem disappointed by it. Yes, it's a bit long and you have to pay attention to everything that's said for the movie to make any sense, but I think that's kind of the point. Like all indy movies, there are problems, but f you like cult movies that make you think, this is a good watch.","user":"jamesadamfoster","rank":[18,24]}]
