[{"title":"The Invoking 2: Where are they going with this franchise?","rating":3,"date":"30 October 2018","review":"So I wasn't impressed with The Invoking (2013) but didn't think it was as bad as the awful IMDB rating suggested. It was just a standard generic low budget horror film.<br><br>I was amazed to discover that it's become quite the franchise, in fact it's still going. Heading into part 2 I expected the worst and pretty much got it.<br><br>Oddly The Invoking immediatly shifts gear and instead of being a standard film is an anthology movie with several short stories. Why a franchise would change so dramatically I can't figure out but it certainly hasn't done it any favours.<br><br>The story lengths vary, ranging heavily. In fact the last one is probably around the 60 second mark!<br><br>None are very entertaining, they aren't connected and leave you confused as to quite what the point was. The cover just like the previous movie is dishonest, you will not find the yellow eyed entity here nor the house shown!<br><br>I like anthology movies, some have really surprised me in quality but The Invoking 2 is yet another failure. I hope the franchise turns itself around as thus far not only are the movies bad but they have no identity at all.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Better than you'd imagine soundtrack<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Weirdly built<br><br>Simply not very entertaining<br><br>Not becoming of a franchise<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>The fact that we get films like this but have no Trick r Treat 2 breaks my heart","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Honestly quite pointless.","rating":2,"date":"8 October 2015","review":"The first film was quite bad, in all honesty. Now that we have the sequel, of which I was curious about, wondering how they could possibly continue the first film. \"The Invoking 2\" Took many wrong turns, turning into a very low, very weak, and even very pointless film.<br><br>First off, there's multiple stories. RLJ took yet another anthology turn, making it even more pointless, and now worn out than ever before. The films has around six stories, all of which were low. Each story revolves around a string events, those being paranormal activity in each one. All the stories seemed to each have constant clichés, clichés of which we've all seen billions, of trillions of times before. From the simple characters on each story, all the way to the stories themselves, they all managed to give every horror / paranormal sub-genre cliché in the book, annoying, boring, and even angering the audience. On topic with story, the unbelievably pointless factor that threw this entire film straight off track. This is supposedly the sequel to the first \"Invoking\" film - Don't be fooled. This film literally had nothing to do with the first film, once again, this was made up, and made into an anthology, making the title a complete set-off, as well as making it even more pointless than it already was to begin with. The film didn't have much charm, or entertaining factors at all. This entire film just seemed to be a long, dragging, and even confusing ride into complete, and utter pointlessness, succeeding in absolutely nothing. There was no tension, no resolved story, no story to even START with; once again just a bunch of clichéd, recycled stories plastered together, and called a false sequel. Aside from that, this film, either way still wasn't great, called a false sequel, or not. It just didn't cut it, not even a small fraction.<br><br>In conclusion, my curiosity got the better of me. This film had literally nothing but pointlessness going for it. No tension, legit scares, good, refreshing story. Nothing. All the stories seemed clichéd, and just added to the fact that this film was flat out boring, seemingly trying to be thrilling, but in face failed, leading to disappointment. Not to mention, as said before, these shorts seeming to just be pasted together, making no sense, and leading to confusion that tended to be annoying. Overall, this film wasn't good. I honestly wouldn't recommend this. Find another good film that'll manage to make actual sense!","user":"InDyingArms","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"equally boring","rating":3,"date":"2 December 2015","review":"The Invoking 2 doesn't have anything to do with the equally boring The Invoking (2013). That was about a house with some dark family secrets. This one takes the anthology format, does nothing at all with it and adds some dull \"paranormal events\" and only in about an hour's time. It is the type of rubbish you'd find in a college film class without any art leanings. The acting is non-existent and so is the story-line. Cheap special effects don't help much either.<br><br>\"U-Turn\" - A man picks up a silent hitchhiker and finds another accident on the road.<br><br>\"Insane\" - A filmmaker with his guide in an abandoned asylum are haunted.<br><br>\"Alone\" - A druggie woman at home is bothered by the image of her double.<br><br>\"Do Not Disturb\" - A serial killer in a hotel room gets weird cards from a ghost.<br><br>\"Natal\" - A crazy woman at a cabin is driven nuts by the sound of scratching.<br><br>\"Melissa\" - A girl dials 911 to tell them about a masked man near her home.<br><br>You'd probably have more fun watching the old 1970's horror anthologies like The House That Dripped Blood (1971), Tales from the Crypt (1972), Asylum (1972), From Beyond the Grave (1974), The Vault of Horror (1973), and Trilogy of Terror (1975).","user":"osloj","rank":[3,3]}]
