[{"title":"Judge the documentary, not the man.","rating":10,"date":"18 February 2019","review":"This documentary is put together very well. If you read most of the reviews it will be made obvious that they are about Suge Knight himself. The documentary uses 2 main elements, Suge Knight's own words and documentation to substantiate his claims. A review should be unbiased. Not being able to stomach the main character is a irrelevant. Don't watch the documentary if you cannot stomach it's content and definitely don't write a review for a film you didn't finish. It's a shame that people cannot get passed their own self righteousness and judgements to learn about a culture they know so little about. They just end up building metaphorical walls.","user":"jthrasher-23680","rank":[17,27]},{"title":"SitDownMiami","rating":1,"date":"9 March 2019","review":"Be Hubble &amp; remember where you came from, SugeKnight. This show was pointless in my opinion &amp; filled with lies instead of #Facts. Again, I hope you don't take this to heart or personal....Just a MANS opinion to another man. pEAcE","user":"huotjaioo5","rank":[6,20]}]
