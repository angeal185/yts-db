[{"title":"Nope, don't go see this one","rating":2,"date":"18 March 2014","review":"From the makers of Disaster Movie and the likes comes a new low.<br><br>The story is a failed rip-off from The Hangover where 4 women: the rich neat sister, the weird one, the loose one and the one about to be married head to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party, their booking went all wrong so they just go out to get as drunk as they possibly can. What follows are seemingly random scenes akin to the stories my wannabe hip uncle tells at birthdays.<br><br>Still, if everything else was great it could have been saved. Unfortunately this isn't the case. The acting ranges from bad to mediocre. The editing only makes it worse, where sometimes people respond 2 seconds too late to shocking news. And the camera is horrible, they went for the handy-cam way of shooting the movie which makes for crappy quality and constantly gives you the feeling that you're watching some embarrassing home video that didn't quite make it to the funniest home videos show.<br><br>If after all of this you still want to see it, watch the trailer instead as anything remotely funny or worthwhile is in the trailer.","user":"swo0","rank":[40,51]},{"title":"if you watch comedy, you wont recognize this POS","rating":1,"date":"13 July 2014","review":"Wow...I've never seen a movie that tries so hard to be funny yet misses every single time. At no point did I laugh, smile, grin, or chuckle. Even worse, it wasn't even the kind of crappy movie that you can laugh at how crappy it is. The funniest part of the last hour and 40 minutes of my life is when I read a reviewer say its a \"female hangover with a few more laughs\". In order to find this film in any way funny you have to be on whatever drug that aforementioned reviewer was on...my guess is laughing gas, and lots of it. I have literally found two separate funerals I have attended in my lifetime funnier than this movie...FUNERALS!!! (Long story on the funerals)","user":"kevymac66","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Absolute rubbish","rating":1,"date":"24 May 2014","review":"Worst. Movie. Ever. I had high hopes from the trailer but what I found was a pathetic mix up of Hangover, Bridesmaids, and Springbreakers. The acting was awful, the supposed 'handy cam' viewpoint annoying and unrealistic. I only kept watching it out of a dark fascination of how far could their train wreck go. Blood, defecation, sex toys, gratuitous violence, it goes far in all aspects and in extreme bad taste. Nothing humorous at all in this movie unless perhaps you're really into toilet humor. And throughout all the mishaps the girls remained make up and hair perfect with nary a streak of dirt on their clothing. It's completely ridiculous. Save a couple hours of your life that you won't get back and avoid this movie.","user":"gnat100-574-261421","rank":[12,20]}]
