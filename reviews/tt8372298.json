[{"title":"No horror no thrill but a good drama","rating":5,"date":"22 March 2020","review":"Don´t expect any horror and thill. It´s a drama movie which contains a good portrait of a traumatized woman. Not more or less.","user":"jamsven","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Went down badly","rating":3,"date":"18 March 2020","review":"In what could have been a very interesting exploration of Pica, the psychological disorder, the writers chose to tack in some arbitrary larger causation ark and it simply did not work.\nThe performances were great, all around, the visual style and pace aren't the problem either.<br><br>Unfortunately the characters are one-dimensional caricatures who are not explored enough to justify the actions of themselves or the lead.\nIn the end, the curiosity of the main theme is played down to focus on an apparent moral message.<br><br>It's great when movies have a message, but when they fake it, it undermines the whole experience.\nIn this case it appears they had no idea what they were trying to communicate and this leaves you feeling very cheated. More so than if they had simply presented a stylised series of unconnected events.","user":"kepeb","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"First review in my life","rating":10,"date":"9 March 2020","review":"I never felt the urge to leave a review here due to many reasons, English is not my native language and I'm bad with describing my emotions accurately, but this film drove me to this point. You want it to end good for this girl so bad, cant say i have the same struggles as her but i GET it and in a way I cheered her on even though its all so horrible. Cried my eyes out at the ending because its was all right for the first time in her life and we got to see the light burst out of her beautiful eyes. Exceptional acting by Haley Bennett, the visuals are to die for. Will be one of my all time favorites.","user":"u-me-can-b","rank":[37,59]}]
