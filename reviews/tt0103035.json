[{"title":"What a great comedy, a classic!","rating":8,"date":"7 August 2001","review":"I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it, although the script is not brilliant the cast made a great effort and made it very convincing, James Belushi plays nice guy convict Jimmy Dworfski as he plans to escape prison for the weekend to see the Chicago Cubs in the World Series, getting his fellow in-mates to cover it up. While out he finds business executive Spencer Barnes (Charles Grodin) filofax and takes over his life. Belushi &amp; Grodin are great together in this feel good comedy, as a lover of Baseball I was drawn to this even more, but if you're not you'll still find it just as enjoyable. This is the best James Belushi film I've seen!","user":"BatmanTheGreat","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"the illest","rating":10,"date":"1 July 2003","review":"this is probably one of my favorite movies ever made, (sentimentaly anyways).  james belushi is a perfect fish in this flick.  the baseball undertones are great, not to mention walters daughter, jewel, who is just a 4 alarm fire.  belushi and charles grodin have an undeniable chemistry together.  is it a little chessy?  yeah.  was it the early 90's?  hell yeah. is it a great little flick?  betchorass it is.","user":"suprflycat","rank":[24,31]},{"title":"Fun flick for veg'ing guys","rating":6,"date":"13 April 2003","review":"\"Taking Care of Business\" is a sort of \"Trading Places\" knock-off with Belushi playing an irrepressible and always upbeat con who escapes from prison to attend the World Series and stumbles into the identity of a lost workaholic exec (Grodin) after finding his Filofax personal organizer. A rather ordinary but lively B-movie romp, \"TCoB\" makes a fun watch for guys in need of a little decompression after a hard day's work. (C+)","user":"=G=","rank":[12,14]}]
