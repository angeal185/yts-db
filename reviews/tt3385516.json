[{"title":"X-Men","rating":7,"date":"12 February 2020","review":"Suffering from bizarre narrative choices and weak character development, X-Men: Apocalypse is an otherwise passable and occasionally great installment of the franchise, mainly due to the continued strong performances and glorious action set pieces.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[38,39]},{"title":"Apocalyptically bad","rating":3,"date":"20 May 2016","review":"I personally thought Days of the Future Past to be the best of the series. And as it turns out, Apocalypse is the worst one to date.<br><br>The only bright spot in all the awfulness is Quicksilver, whose slo-mo scene is at least as good as in the previous movie, if not better. Other than that, everything else goes from mediocre to outright terrible.<br><br>The main villain's motivation is bland and stupid. (Yeah, he just wants to kill everyone and rule the world.) The way he \"persuades\" other mutants to join him is absolutely unbelievable - he basically just offers to increase a mutant's power and in return demands help to kill billions of people. Sounds like a fair deal. What's offputting is that the extent to which he augments his followers' powers is not constant. Like, Magneto gains the power to control pretty much all the metal on the planet at once, while Psylocke gains another special effect on her CGI laser beams or whatever it is that she emits. Apocalypse's abilities in general are largely undefined - at times he is shown pulling matter from objects around him to construct something, and then in the next shot he just makes solid objects like armor out of thin air. Another ridiculous thing was that they tried to make Isaac more intimidating by giving him thick soles so that he'd look taller, which is noticeable. What is more, his lines are cringe-worthy, but the problem is, so are everyone else's. Same boring clich√© dialogues like \"It's your home. We will help. Join us, Eric. I see good in you.\"<br><br>Yeah, forgiving Magneto like it's nothing after he helps to kill millions of people and destroy entire cities is included in the package. Also, he changes his mind about the whole \"destroy the world\" thing after Mystique tells him for the 100th time that he is her family and she still sees good in him.<br><br>Some of the characters' looks are still beyond ugly. I can actually see why they chose to try to keep the Beast and Mystique in their human forms more, except for saving the actors from the extensive make-up procedures. The thing is, these characters look absolutely god-damn atrocious and are painful to watch. I mean, Lawrence is annoying and redundant when she is on screen anyway, but when she is also blue, it just becomes vomit-inducing.<br><br>Recent 2016 comic-book blockbusters also did not enjoy good scripts, but at least they had high-quality gripping action scenes. This is not the case here, as fighting is mostly goofy and bland, and at times it is clearly visible by the actors' motions that they are being pulled by the strings. Or being drawn in cheap CGI.<br><br>This is actually sad. Singer's previous movie, DotFP, was outstanding. The recent Deadpool, who ostensibly shares the universe with the X-men, was awesome. And now we get a horrible, outrageously stupid and pretentious CG-overdosed mess. Let's hope the next one will be better.","user":"realmuthaf","rank":[314,525]},{"title":"A Gripping but Flawed X-Men Movie","rating":7,"date":"6 June 2016","review":"X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place  about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start  to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of  things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the  good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these  movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really  emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the  film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside  Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger  X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver  has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is  handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is  terrific, but the second half brings it down.  Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and  others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and  I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse  Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant  compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain  who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are  thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems  uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses  the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants  were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire  sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the  cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do  much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could  have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final  battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem  is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming  apart, making it hard to care about the situation.   Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and  Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and  Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing  for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just  brings the film down from the really good first half.  X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-.","user":"ssangams","rank":[132,213]}]
