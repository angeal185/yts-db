[{"title":"A Simple Yet Engaging Drama","rating":25,"date":"25 February 2002","review":"This movie doesn't have a lot of great visuals (with the exception of a quick shot of Kevin Kline's cute, naked butt). It doesn't have fast-paced action.....But the story and the acting make it a great film. Kline, Spacek, and Bedelia put in some great performances, and they make this film an intense drama, with their subtle and realistic portrayals. It's certainly not the best film any of those actors ever did, but it is truly a joy to watch them in.","user":"santsa70","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Such a beautiful film!","rating":10,"date":"27 June 2002","review":"I've watched this movie at least 30 times, and I never get over how amazing it is.  Sissy Spacek, Kevin Kline, and Bonnie Bedelia are so compelling, and I pine for Ocean City over and over again!  This movie will take you back to every \"what if\" you ever had.  A classic!","user":"allieg8r94","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Violets Are Blue","rating":10,"date":"29 November 2005","review":"I have seen the movie so many times and still love it. I think the Theme Song is great (as well as being a tearjerker). If you have ever let a girl get away or lost her to someone else, this movie really hits home. If you know Ocean City, Md.; it will make you long for a vacation. Sissy Spacek, Kevin Kline and Bonnie Bedelia give excellent performances. This movie gives a great impression of Ocean City and the scenes on Assateague are excellent. If you haven't seen this film I would recommend that you try to find it or at least watch for it on TV, (though, I haven't seen it listed lately, on TV). If you are a Sissy Spacek fan or have visited Ocean City, I recommend this film, you'll love it.","user":"gwy1932","rank":[9,9]}]
