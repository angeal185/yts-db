[{"title":"Love this movie!","rating":15,"date":"15 March 2003","review":"How great was this movie? I fell in love with it from being made to watch it in Health class in 11th grade. I love films about adversity within races, and this movie was a classic. Herman Boone has to bring blacks and whites together for a highschool football team to play with each other. Of course, it's the 70's and racism is still rampant. I love the message that people will mesh anyway despite outside complications. Julius' and Gerry's relationship was really profound and special. It crossed a lot of lines. Denzel was remarkable as Coach Boone. He took no crap, yet was scared to lose his position underneath. There was tension everywhere and it worked for the film. The players were really memorable to me. Blue, Rev, Sunshine, Petey, and Louie Lastik were adorable and hilarious. A great ensemble cast effort. The guy who played Yoast was good as well, because he had to learn to overcome prejudices he had that he never knew he did. Even better, was the fact that it's a true story which makes it all the more sweet. I watch this movie over and over and can practically say every line by heart. Great, great film. The Titans really were greater than the gods of Greek myth, and these guys were greater than any stereotype.","user":"QueenMakeda84","rank":[119,137]},{"title":"A powerful inspirational film","rating":10,"date":"30 January 2005","review":"Remember the Titans is much more than a story about a high school football team. It is a true story about two men who overcome their differences and help an entire town deal with frustration, anger, and mistrust. Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) is the head coach of the football team at the black high school while Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is the head coach of the football team at the white high school. In 1971 the high schools are integrated and Coach Boone is chosen to become the head coach of the football team while Coach Yoast is demoted to assistant coach.<br><br>Remember the Titans is a powerful film with incredible performances by both Denzel Washington and Will Patton.","user":"Ree59","rank":[85,99]},{"title":"TOUCHDOWN!!!!!","rating":29,"date":"29 September 2000","review":"By looking at REMEMBER THE TITANS you are probably saying \"oh geeze, another football movie.  How can this one be any better than the last one?  The only good recent football film is RUDY.\"  Well, after seeing this film, you'll be taken by surprise, just like I was.<br><br>In 1971, in Alexandria, Virginia, the town's high school football team, the T.C. Williams Titans, are very popular.  T.C. Williams High School current football coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton), is nominated for high school Hall of Fame.  But a few weeks before the start of the school year, a white store owner shoots and kills a black man who was suspected in stealing a product.  This causes a racial seperation between blacks and whites in Alexandria.  Then just before the start of the football season, Coach Yoast gets demoted to Assistant Coach in place of Coach Boone (Denzel Washington). What's bad is that Boone is black, and Yoast is white.  Most of the town's residents are angry, and even some of the players are willing to ruin their football career's to quit the team to make a statement.  But at the start of football camp, Coach Boone won't take any racial diversity.  Boone treats all of his players equally, he has his football camp practices appear to be a mixture between boot camp and group sessions.  If the player misses catching a football, he has to run a mile.  If the player doesn't know anything about the person of the opposite color that they are rooming with, they have homework to get to know one another.  With this, it creates a special bond between these men.  Men who act more mature and humane, unlike most of the residents of Alexandria.  But when Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased and the true meaning of teamwork is born.<br><br>The way to make a great sports movie is to have it be adapted from a true life story.  Like PRIDE OF THE YANKEES, HOOSIERS, and RUDY, all are films that show that what appears to be a sport, is the true triumph of the human spirit.  I really did enjoy the characters in the film, since they are factual, they have very humanistic qualities.  While one loves to hum \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" another gets excited while listening to \"Act Naturally.\"  And although you can guess what happens in the end, you don't care.  You enjoy and like the character's so much that you are cheering for them.<br><br>I highly enjoyed the acting in this film.  I think if Denzel Washington should get his long overdue Oscar for Best Actor, it should be for this film.  He teaches his team that black or white, these men are a team, and that the only way to win is teamwork.  Washington gives a bravura performance, that it will stun the people who think that Washington usually plays \"racist\" roles.  I also enjoyed Will Patton a lot, he's not playing the cliche coach who gets demoted, and wants to ruin the new head coach. Instead, he understands the message that Boone is giving to the team that he helps as much as he can to help the team succeed.  I thought Patton's role is the best assistant coach role that I have seen since Dennis Hopper's role in HOOSERS.  And the football players are also great, the ones I thought stood out were:  Preston Brant (Jerry Buck, the team's captain), Donald Adensun (Petey, the team's running-back), Kip Perdue (Sunshine, the team's quarterback), Craig Kirkwood (Rev, the team's defense player), and Ethan Suplee (Lastik, the team's leading defense, and by his size, he should be!)  I was glad to see Suplee change his roles in his career.  The last time I remember seeing him, he was the vicious skinhead along with Edward Norton and Patrick Furlong in AMERICAN HISTORY X.  In REMEMBER THE TITANS, he's the exact opposite, he's the first white player who makes friends with the black players!!!<br><br>Director Boaz Yakin and producer Jerry Bruckheimer should be commended for this film.<br><br>I am pleased to see Jerry Bruckheimer made a really enjoyable and intellectual film, which is the complete opposite of the type of films that he's famous for.  In fact I think this is the first one intellectual film Bruckheimer has made! The message that it sends out is really powerful, and if it doesn't convince you to change, then you are probably dead.  And director Boaz Yakin does a fantastic job with this film, that along with Cameron Crowe, Wolfgang Petersen, and Ridley Scott, he should be nominated best director.<br><br>This is quite a film, in fact, I think this is the best football movie that I have ever seen!  I really really enjoyed this film, and as I left it led me to believe in the message that this film was sending to it's audience. And this being only \"PG\" and put out by Walt Disney Pictures, I would love to see both junior high schools and high schools to show this film to it's students.  If they did, then chances are, the violence in schools will go down.  And it took Jerry Bruckheimer, Boaz Yakin, and Walt Disney Pictures to do it.  Great job guys!  Don't miss this enjoyable film! ***** (out of five)","user":"Brogan","rank":[95,112]}]
