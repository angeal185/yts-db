[{"title":"Horrible Movie","rating":2,"date":"30 August 2018","review":"Acting was horrendous, the camera kept on zooming to the actors faces unnecessarily at times...\nBruce willis acting role was pointless and did not add any interesting factors to the movie.<br><br>The story line is more than boring, i recommend anyone who is thinking to watch this movie to wait until it's shown on tv 10 years later for free.","user":"daylami-49855","rank":[87,108]},{"title":"A total time waster. I got pulled into seeing this only cos of Frank Grillo n Johnathon Schaech....","rating":2,"date":"12 September 2018","review":"Normally i avoid the current Bruce Willis films. Of lately Willis is jus doing horrible cameo appearances in horrible films n his photos r all over the dvd covers including his name n glimpes of him in the trailers.\nComing to the film, the synopsis, the cast n trailer was good but the film was terrible.\nThe villain Johnathon Schaech is shown attending to his old dad who's a decorated veteran, Schaech's repeated dialogue regarding an eye for an eye n his facial expressions conveyed that our villain might be doing the heist for some vengeance but alas the heist, the action and the end was meh.\nAlso when Frank Grillo discusses with Willis about the robber, Willis' face and body language looked as if Willis knows about the heist n the robber......\nWait, i dont want anybody else to waste their time in seein this awful film.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[56,68]},{"title":"Worst movie ever?","rating":1,"date":"1 September 2018","review":"So, I saw all the bad reviews, but I still went to see it. I'm a fan of Bruce Willis I figured it cant be that bad. \nI'm not sure why this movie was made, weak plot, horrible acting by everyone. The whole movie just didn't work. ,it was so bad that a few people actually walked out, I even left just after the big shoot out. weather it was the end or not. \nIt was almost painful to watch.","user":"tgsausa","rank":[62,81]}]
