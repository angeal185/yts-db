[{"title":"Silly, but not funny and inconsistent!","rating":4,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"Silly, but not funny and inconsistent, really says it all!\nShambolic with no original ideas.\nLocations (council block beautiful gardens and brand new empty garden shed) not inkeeping with the story settings and lack of blood after the crime, all are too noticeable as the plot is weak and does not grasp.....\nNot a comedy, looks amateurish/student production.\nPS\nThere were 5 (out of 9 only votes) giving this film \"full marks\" i.e. 10 Stars.......!!!????\nSince my vote 4 **** (+ this review) there is a 6th 10 Stars rating. Those can only come from people with a vested interest!\nNo-one with genuine unbiased view/taste can rate this film a 10.","user":"MIVANABBE","rank":[12,18]},{"title":"Started Very Well","rating":6,"date":"7 May 2019","review":"A funny film in places, if you like black comedy, British trailer trash like Shameless, you will like this","user":"jrmcveigh","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"A day in the life of a manc","rating":10,"date":"9 February 2020","review":"I honestly thought this was a fly on the wall documentary.
