[{"title":"Masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"30 September 2019","review":"Rip peep<br><br>\nFirstly, the other reviews which criticise peep for his drug use and face tattoos are great examples of the close-minded and judgemental people that Gus' mother, Liza, mentioned in his eulogy. Please, whoever it may be that is reading this, don't prematurely pass judgement on others, you never know what someone may be going through. But apart from that the movie is great. It is well directed, very informative and was a pleasure to watch. The runtime was a little daunting for me at first but watching it was never dull and so the length wasn't an issue for me.","user":"rorywhite-91012","rank":[114,167]},{"title":"This is something that needed to be put out.","rating":10,"date":"11 November 2019","review":"First off, Gus was a light in this world. And the small minded people who judged him for his appearance were the type of the people who did help him. He was such a beautiful soul, and I know I didn't know him personally, but he gave himself to his music. And every real artist who writes their music. And pour their hearts in souls in it, leave pieces of themselves in the music. And through listening to their music and connecting with it, we get to know the artists. Gus was, like many people, hurting. And like all of us hurting souls he found vices to help forget and ease the pain. He left the world way way too soon. I knew he was going to go places farther then I could have imagined. And it breaks my heart when I listen to his music and remember, he isn't here anymore. I hope that wherever he is now, he is finally not hurting anymore. That's all I can wish for. Rip Gus. Lil Peep was one of the ones who understood.","user":"chachafluke","rank":[41,56]},{"title":"RIP Gus","rating":6,"date":"16 March 2020","review":"I'm not the biggest fan of Lil Peep, I have listened to his music but he seemed like a nice dude so I gave this a watch. Real sad to hear about what happened in his early life and his struggle with mental health and drug abuse.<br><br>The ending with 911 call was quite hard to watch, but the people on the tour bus shouldn't be given the time of day, the man he was with at the start, talking about how everyone are clout chasers, I felt that was true.<br><br>And whoever toke the photos at the end, the photos of Gus' lifeless body, he ashamed. That part made me mad because absolutely not respect","user":"wbuttle","rank":[5,5]}]
