[{"title":"Hilarious and campy...","rating":4,"date":"30 December 2015","review":"\"Zombie Shark\" is one of those types of movies that are so bad that it is actually fun to watch. And it makes you wonder just who comes up with the idea for such a movie.<br><br>As a movie shown on the SyFy Channel then you know exactly what you are getting yourself into, both entertainment-wise and effect-wise.<br><br>A group of young people travel to an exotic Island for a vacation, but they come to an island where the waters are filled with zombie sharks, and soon the infection spreads to land.<br><br>Yep, it is yet another one of those wacky movies that SyFy Channel is widely known for. And you either hate them for the questionable movies that they might be, or you love it for its glorious campy cheesiness.<br><br>The effects in \"Zombie Shark\" was awful, especially the CGI animations. It just baffled me that a movie made in 2015 can have such inadequate, outdated and lousy CGI effects.<br><br>As for the acting, well, it was as to be expected. And with Jason London at the lead, you were in for a fun, albeit campy shark thrill-ride.<br><br>All in all, a fun enough movie if you enjoy these SyFy Channel movies.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Not as fun as a punch in the face!","rating":2,"date":"16 February 2016","review":"Misty Talley directs this film written by Greg Mitchell... my initial thoughts are that perhaps they shouldn't have bothered. <br><br>Three 'hot' chicks and a boyfriend go to Redplum Island for a weekend getaway. Locals don't call the island Redplum anymore, they refer to it as Shark Island... what could possibly go wrong you ask? Well, near the island is an apparently closed down research facility... still wondering what could go wrong? Well in those few sentences I've just used I've created more tension then in the entirety of the film! OK, so the research facility hasn't closed officially, they've been testing regeneration and they've been testing on sharks because they have a similar genetic make-up, apparently. The test subject, project \"Bruce\", escapes and starts attacking other sharks around Redplum island. Initially the attacked sharks are killed but they soon come back to life for more blood fuelled mayhem. The residents aren't safe; even if they aren't gobbled up by the sharks anybody who is bitten by a shark and survives becomes a zombie further endangering the populous of the island. Even with the help from the head of security at the research facility, Max Cage (Jason London), it's going to be a tough fight for survival. <br><br>The CGI is dire and embarrassing at best. How can a film from 2015 look so poor and cheap? I knew this was going to be a poor film before I started watching, it's a Sy-Fy film so of course it was going to be bad. It's typical of the poor films they pump out but at least some of those bad films at least have one or two redeeming features, maybe an original story, maybe tongue in cheek humour - this film had nothing redeeming and the film took itself far too seriously which is it's own downfall. The acting is pathetic and the characters seem to do things which will leave you shouting at the screen in frustration. Jason London is perhaps the most seasoned of the actors in this film and I struggled to believe him. The script is bad, the plot is predictable and the... oh let's face it, it's all pretty poor. <br><br>In summary, I think somebody at Sy-Fy had some money left over from one of the \"Sharknado\" films and decided they had better spend it. That person probably had a nagging girlfriend or relative that desperately wanted to be in a movie but had no acting experience. They also had a friend who promised to write a brilliant story. Combine those things and hey presto you have this film; a film that you could only enjoy if you were drinking heavily and not really watching the film at all but it was on in the background. Sorry, 2 out of 10.","user":"one-nine-eighty","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"This fish is off","rating":4,"date":"23 July 2015","review":"Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 had a scene where a zombie takes on a shark at sea. The strikingly most original thing about that movie. Maybe that was the inspiration for Zombie Shark or maybe it was the more recent Zombeavers which almost the Citizen Kane for this genre of films.<br><br>Three hot girls and one boyfriend go for weekend island getaway in the Gulf of Mexico. As Becky Andrews in a hot bikini she discovers a dead shark washed ashore that suddenly comes to life as Zombie Shark and attacks the humans around the beach.<br><br>It seems the island is near a secret research facility working on 'Project Bruce' involving regenerating human flesh based on shark DNA. However Bruce gets loose infects other sharks who become zombified. When they attack humans they come back as George Romero style lumbering zombies.<br><br>A mercenary joins to the girls to stop Bruce and other sharks in infecting the rest of the world<br><br>The story is mildly intriguing, it rolls along nicely. Andrews looks great in a bikini, there is some comic relief here and there. So far so Zombeavers. However the production values are on par with the usual SyFy channel output. The CGI sharks are cheap and nasty looking, the mechanical sharks are not much better and there is one rubber shark head that looks like plastic puppet. The story goes from being inspired (lumbering zombie gets head lopped off by a flying shark) to downright horrendous.<br><br>Still the movie is crazy, surreal, horrible even good in parts. Its worth watching with a lazy eye.","user":"Prismark10","rank":[2,2]}]
