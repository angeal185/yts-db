[{"title":"So disappointing.","rating":1,"date":"19 March 2018","review":"I ignored the bad reviews and went anyway. Disappointing is probably an understatement. This movie is a disaster. Not only is the acting incredibly awful, especially from some otherwise accomplished cast members, but the original storyline was all but abandoned. I read the book several times, and even I was confused what was going on in this film. There was no explanation for any of the concepts, character development was nonexistent, special effects were plentiful but meaningless. The most fascinating parts of the book were eliminated, or only presented so quickly that it was difficult to understand why they were happening and how they related to the story. This movie could have been SO great - there was incredible potential here, and Disney and the director literally wasted it all.","user":"barbara_4553","rank":[475,548]},{"title":"I want to gouge out the part of my brain that remembers this movie","rating":1,"date":"12 March 2018","review":"I HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys flying lettuce, terrible acting, giant Oprah in a mermaid costume, or awful confusing plots with terrible direction. Disney - as someone who had to sit through this film I respectfully request that you use your Marvel money to build a time machine and give 2 hours back to any audience forced to see this abomination.","user":"cdlarsen-41638","rank":[541,629]},{"title":"Strike 2","rating":2,"date":"18 March 2018","review":"I was excited when this was announced as this was one of my favorite books growing up and I still enjoy re-reading this series. However, I also kept saying \"I hope Disney doesn't screw this up again,\" after the travesty TV version they made in the early 2000s.<br><br>Lo and behold, they managed to screw it up again.<br><br>Let's start with the few bright spots (and calling them bright spots is even generous). First, I did enjoy the visual depiction of the tesseract. Also, the casting was pretty good. Storm Reid was well cast as Meg, and Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which were also portrayed well, despite that they drastically downplayed Mrs. Which's character.<br><br>Now, the bad (and there is a lot of bad). Mrs. Whatsit was changed into a completely negative character who seemed completely inept and pessimistic. Important points in the book (Ixiel and Aunt Beast, for example) were completely ignored and given only cursory mentions so fleeting that you barely even notice it.\nThe Man with Red Eyes is turned into marionette who literally collapses on screen. I get that in the novel he was a \"puppet\" of IT, but the depiction in the movie was laughable.\nThe ridiculous storm scene when they first arrive on Camazotz came out of nowhere and was so ridiculously portrayed. First, they're struggling to find Charles Wallace, then they go through this ridiculous storm sequence, and when they make it over this wall (which again, was nowhere in the source material), that concern for Charles Wallace is completely gone until he pops out of nowhere saying \"here I am.\" And are Meg and Calvin relieved to see him? Nope. It's more like \"meh, okay.\"\nThe movie completely left out how Calvin and Dr. Murray got back from Camazotz. All of a sudden, they're just back. Poof, no explanation.<br><br>I get that certain stories require work to adapt: I didn't get particularly outraged with some of the changes \"Prince Caspian\" and \"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" made in the Narnia series because those were short novels whose structure required adaption to make them cinematic. I wasn't necessarily pleased with all of them, but given the structure of the books, it was understandable that some work had to be done.\n\"A Wrinkle in Time\" was different. It's a very linear story which already was very cinematic and could easily translate itself from page to screen. But instead of a faithful adaption, the filmmakers decided to ignore 90% of the source material.<br><br>Strike 2, Disney. You've now screwed this same story up twice.","user":"BillyFromSoddyDaisy","rank":[239,280]}]
