[{"title":"All around enjoyable murder mystery and human interest drama","rating":7,"date":"1 January 2003","review":"In \"Blood Work\" Eastwood plays an FBI agent, recovering from a heart transplant, who is asked by the sister of the murdered  woman whose heart he received to find her killer. The result is  surprisingly even and interesting murder mystery in which we see Eastwood piece together the evidence pointing to the killer while dealing with heart transplant issues and making nice with his pro bono client. The film has fewer plot holes than most murder mysteries; leans more toward human interest than derring-dos; and is another example of Eastwood successfully pushing out the age envelope in a self-directed film product. Recommended for more mature couch potatoes into murder mysteries.

Here is Clint, 72 years old, and actually doing the right thing; being the old sort of Dirty Harry-esquire type of cop while still being realistic with himself. Truth be told, he won't do movies forever, much less be a cop with almost all the right moves, and here we see him as FBI Agent Terry McCaleb in the beginning try and climb a fence to catch a code killer (which resonates from past Eastwood projects) and he collapses from a heart attack (sad but oddly accurate). He retires, and two years later a woman comes forth to him asking for help in finding a killer. <br><br>And anyway, what makes Blood Work so fascinating (if only up to a point if seen more than once) is that it's a well crafted thriller, one that has the usual police procedural from many years back, a bit of a romance with Wanda DeJesus, and comic relief from Jeff Daniels. So, if you decide to see this latest installment in the sprawling career of Clint Eastwood, keep in mind that it has all the style, music, and nostalgia even in donuts that it had back in the day 30 years ago. And maybe it's just me, but it will be hard not to grin when you see him grab a gun.

We follow that of FBI profiler Terry McCaleb on the trail of a serial killer who likes to play games with him, before his heart eventually gives up on him during a chase. He's a cardiac patient that receives a heart from a murder victim, and the donor's sister asks him to come out of retirement (which is two years after the heart-attack) to use that second chance to help find her killer.<br><br>After an excellently dark, brooding opening it goes onto settle for a cruising old-fashion, but by-the-numbers thriller. It's the eerie mystery that invokes the tension, not the small-added slabs of violence and action. It's a character story. Nothing surprises, but its elaborated make-up and cluey puzzles are absorbingly plotted by Brian Helgeland's elegantly dry screenplay, as we watch the psychical and mental decay first break down, but eventually go on to help rebuild our main protagonist. Mainly through his bond with the lady he's helping out. Even a connection is kind of hinted between the killer and Eastwood's ex-profilerÂ… like the one in 'Tightrope' (1984). The relationship that unfolds and expectations that arose, especially after the killer's unmasking and his cunning intentions being revealed is unnerving in that endearing sense. The psychological torment and involvement is well-judged too. This observation can be seen in Eastwood's rock-like performance, which still shows cracks of vulnerability.<br><br>Looking comfortable in front of the camera, behind is exactly the same with his economical direction driving the way. Edgy suspense is well-place and timed amongst a gritty backdrop and dreary colour scheme. Lennie Niehaus' soothingly savoury blues score, Tom Stern's sharply pastel cinematography and Joel Cox's swift editing strengthen the already professionally competent production. First-rate performances engulf the feature. Wanda De Jesus strong-willed turn is amiable. Jeff Daniel's lazy; oddball (almost comic) performance is a fine, versatile addition. A cynical Paul Rodriguez and a solid Dylan Walsh are good as two jealous detectives. Tina Lafford is pleasingly sound as a detective/good friend of McCaleb and Anjelica Huston is fiery blunt as Dr. Bonnie Fox.<br><br>A satisfyingly better than average thriller fable headed by the ever-reliable Eastwood.","user":"lost-in-limbo","rank":[26,29]}]
