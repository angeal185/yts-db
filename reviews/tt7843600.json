[{"title":"Best to watch this after the Netflix doc, but they're both good","rating":7,"date":"3 February 2019","review":"Two documentaries about the Fyre Festival debacle came out days apart, Netflix's Fyre and Hulu's Fyre Fraud, and each shines in different ways.<br><br>The Netflix documentary approach is a methodical chronology. It describes what happened as it happened and how people saw it at the time. It really puts you into the day-by-day experience.<br><br>Fyre Fraud takes a different approach. It actually sketches out the basics of the entire thing in the first 15 minutes, then builds upon the various components to create a whole.<br><br>The titles actually hit at the different approaches. Fyre describes the Fyre Festival as a slow-mo disaster, only at the end fully revealing the shadiness of Fyre's charismatic creator, Billy McFarland.<br><br>Fyre Fraud, on the other hand, immediately establishes Billy as a sleazy con man, and portrays Fyre as a series of shady transactions. Netflix portrays the festival as a disaster, Fyre Fraud as a crime.<br><br>Fyre Fraud spends a lot of time framing the Fyre Fraud hysteria within the current culture. It's the sort of pundit \"hot take\" that is easy to poke holes in, but it's sometimes persuasive. Fraud also has an interview with Billy, although the guy is to slippery to offer much satisfaction.<br><br>If you only wanted to watch one Fyre documentary, go for the Netflix one. But after you've seen it if you want more details and a different angle, Fyre Fraud is well worth your time.","user":"cherold","rank":[32,35]},{"title":"Frustrating yet Very Entertaining","rating":8,"date":"22 January 2019","review":"One thing I found endlessly frustrating is that there is a sit-down interview with the Zuckerberg wannabe/Con Artist who gets to trot out his highly fabricated version of what happened but he is repeatedly asked direct questions which he never appears to answer - but it's hard to know because it's a quick cut edit and on to something else. If he doesn't answer 'You lost a box of keys to $2 Million worth of houses? Why didn't you tell that to the guests?' - I want to see him sit there and squirm for as long as he did in the interview. But overall, it's a fascinating spectacle to watch, as was the other Fyre documentary. I don't despise the type of people that are featured in this film: cell-phone zombies that begin every sentence with 'Literally..' and describe everything as 'Amazing'... but I do enjoy watching them actively make themselves a victim of their own narcissism.","user":"genious-35413","rank":[36,42]},{"title":"The Culmination of Emptiness","rating":6,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"Interestingly, \"Fyre Fraud\" was released on Hulu a few days before the Netflix documentary on the same subject, the latter of which is the first one I watched.<br><br>I found it so compelling that I rushed to watch \"Fyre Fraud\", having read that both docs had plenty of interesting footage to offer, with this one including an actual interview with the con artist behind the scam, Billy McFarland.<br><br>Clips of the interview are inserted here and there, but to be perfectly honest, do not provide much insight or reveal anything shocking, besides providing somewhat satisfactory cringey moments where McFarland seems to be sweating bullets and is seen stuttering in embarrassment after being asked certain questions that he obviously won't/can't answer due to ongoing lawsuits. The tone is not overly confrontational, but they did not shy away from asking tricky questions.<br><br>While the Netflix piece had a well-organized, countdown type of structure that documented the lead-up to this disastrous event in great detail then depicted the event itself, both with plenty of on-site footage, \"Fyre Fraud\" uses a different approach, instead focusing on everything surrounding the event and the more philosophical questions that this literally empty shell raises: is this, to a greater extent, the result of a culture of emptiness? And while \"Fyre Fraud\" is certainly inferior as far as narrative structure is concerned, it digs deeper than the Netflix doc in its study of \"influencers\" and millennial culture. While they do not get that much screen time, there are two interviews with influencers who attended the event (no clue what their names are) who, after being candidly asked what an influencer is and how they would describe their \"brand\" (which is basically themselves and the \"lifestyle\" that they document, one heavily filtered picture at a time), both answered \"positivity\" after hesitating for a moment, struggling to find a meaning to something blatantly meaningless.<br><br>There are several other people being interviewed, only a minority of which are also interviewed in the Netflix doc. As such, it was interesting to get different perspectives and, in many aspects, both documentaries are very interesting in their own right and could very well have been merged into one lengthy piece. Anyhow, as I was not familiar with the lead-up to the event and how it all unfolded, I'm happy I got to watch both docs in that order, as \"Fyre Fraud\" really focuses on the fraudulent aspect of it rather than all the cringe-worthy logistic and administrative failures that led to the disaster. My suggestion would be to watch both docs, starting with Netflix's. That way, with \"Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened\", you'll get a really satisfactory depiction of the facts, including plenty of on-site footage prior to the event and during the event, and then, with \"Fyre Fraud\", you'll get a better picture of the aftermath, as well as an interesting, more in-depth sociological analysis of the psychological and behavioral traits of a delusional generation obsessed with flashing pictures of a luxurious lifestyle that a serial con man was able to successfully exploit.<br><br>On its own, \"Fyre Fraud\" might feel a bit incomplete if you're looking for actual footage of this disaster. However, as a complement to \"Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened\", it is highly satisfactory and completes the Netflix piece's deficiencies in terms of social commentary.<br><br>That being said, if you have to choose between the two, I would suggest \"Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened\".","user":"plpregent","rank":[16,18]}]
