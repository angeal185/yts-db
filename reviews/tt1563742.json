[{"title":"Don't Overthink it, Just Enjoy it","rating":7,"date":"20 July 2018","review":"I will start this review off by saying I love, love, love the original. I spent weekends at my grandma's as a child with little but a VHS player and a collection of old movies and it was always one of my favorites. That being said, when I first learned about a remake, I was ecstatic! Though it definitely didn't blow my socks off, it certainly didn't disappoint. It also helps that I am quite fond of Anna Faris' unique brand of comedic presence. Her portrayal of overworked, under appreciated Kate who spins a vengeful, yet well intentioned, situation into a mutually beneficial one was very endearing. Eva Longoria, as her friend, was a nice addition to the cast. I also have to praise Eugenio Derbez, whom I have never seen before but definitely plan on familiarizing myself with. His character Leonardo is not easily forgettable and incited most of my laughs. Swoosie Kurtz as Kate's eccentric, disillusioned mother is always a treat to see as well. Long story short, if you are expecting this film to be exactly like its predecessor, your expectations are too high. Here we have a crisp, modern take on the 1987 classic and it is one that should be appreciated and revered, even, especially for lifelong fans. There is humor, humiliation and in the grand scheme of things, a ton of heart that will just make you feel good. Not to mention perfectly placed homages to the original (including costumes and dialogue, among others) and it is just as fun, if not more! All in all, a decent way to waste a couple lazy hours, in this reviewer's opinion.","user":"icanbeaghost","rank":[49,67]},{"title":"A charming gem. -a bit predictable, but funny and entertaining.","rating":8,"date":"24 July 2018","review":"This movie is nothing complicated. It's simple, light comedy and easy to digest.<br><br>You'll never laugh out loud watching this but you will definitely smile without you knowing it. <br><br>I personally prefer seeing sci-fi flicks and superhero movies and I think I ended up enjoying watching this than I care to admit.","user":"josephcaesarsd","rank":[41,58]},{"title":"Don't understand the hate","rating":10,"date":"3 May 2018","review":"Seems like all the other commenters haven't actually seen this movie and are just upset that it's a remake. Yes, it's a remake, but it's its own movie, too. <br><br>As someone who HAS seen this (and loves the original), I thought it stood on its own, differentiated itself nicely from the original while also updating the story in a way that feels timely and fresh. I also found it surprisingly funny, sweet, heartfelt, and utterly enjoyable. A great change of pace from all the cynical, mean-spirited comedies these days and endless parade of Marvel movies.","user":"clsteven","rank":[263,459]}]
