[{"title":"Movie wonderfully depicts 'Innocence, Emotions and Hard work'","rating":9,"date":"18 November 2018","review":"Just like 'Dum Laga Ke Haisha', 'Sui Dhaaga' is also based in small town of UP. After loving the former so much I was very much eager to watch the latter. And I was not disappointed. Loved the direction, acting by the whole cast, background score and music.\nMovie wonderfully depicts the value of hard work and patience which can one day bring glory to one's life.\nAnushka's innocence in the movie won my heart. And Varun's simplicity was a treat to watch. This is truly Made In India. Absolutely loved the movie.","user":"shivjirwankar","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"A simple man's tale.","rating":10,"date":"1 October 2018","review":"Beautiful movie, with brilliant performances.\nLoved the way Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma have portrayed their characters.","user":"nakulgupta1993","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Nice movie. but the ending could have been more entertaining and appealing.","rating":7,"date":"2 October 2018","review":"Nice movie. but the ending could have been more entertaining and appealing.","user":"adityau-13769","rank":[8,10]}]
