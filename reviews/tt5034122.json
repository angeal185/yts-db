[{"title":"Good movie","rating":10,"date":"3 October 2018","review":"Old school. Brings back memories. Very well put together. Not sure why this movie has low rating","user":"nfl-01297","rank":[17,23]},{"title":"Great movie with lots of freestyle","rating":10,"date":"4 December 2018","review":"Most people can't relate to this movie, this movie is for the people who grew up in NYC's five boroughs and Long Island. This is a life style that many won't understand, but for those of us who do it's great. Finally we have a movie that glorifies Freestyle music and it has a decent love story to it. It's nothing groundbreaking or Oscar worthy and it is not trying to be. It's just a great trip down memory lane for some people.","user":"methisal","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"How nostalgia should be done","rating":7,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"Not just of the era, but of a typical 80's romantic movie plot line. Seigel got it right. Cruise is a pretty in pink \"salut\" to the rich/poor theme of the 80's. My biggest contention is that even though the main car in this film (1987 Buick grand national) is a personal favorite, the speed was bought, not built. The soundtrack couldn't be more spot on for the time. As a fan of stand up comedian Sebastian Maniscalco, I waited longer than I expected for his villainy to make an appearance BUT the wait was worth it. Gio's best buddies were a nice bit of spice. Likable but not overbearing characters. This isn't benvolio and mercuchio after all. The time spent paying homage to the culture and style of the 80's is well done but over all I feel the pacing was splintered with attention being spent on too many various aspects of the time (stealing stereos and Italian family and racing and rich/poor and sex and and drugs and and and)<br><br>It doesn't go where you think it will which is a nice change. If you're looking for a typical movie hero, you won't find it here. You'll find sacrifice and humility. Not bad all in all. A movie I was looking forward to and one that delivered in ways in didn't expect.","user":"thikskin-269-9130","rank":[5,6]}]
