[{"title":"Entertaining parody","rating":8,"date":"30 March 2019","review":"Many of the user reviews here are unduly harsh. SuperLopez is a Spanish parody of Superman: light entertainment, and if that's what you're looking for, it's quite fun. The lead actor is good, as is the rest of the cast. There are a lot of funny scenes and dialogue; it's not perfect, but few films are.<br><br>One random example: after the news breaks about the runaway train rescue, the Lois Lane-type character says there's no way there could be a Spanish superhero. \"Who's the villain, punctuality?\" If you find that line funny, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you don't, then maybe it's not for you.<br><br>Be sure to watch it in the original Spanish with English subtitles, which are well done.","user":"CaptnCnck","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"It's a funny parody","rating":10,"date":"2 April 2019","review":"From someone who's never heard about Super Lopez before: I found this movie on Netflix and it's a great entertainment. Fun, light and well done. I'm Brazilian and didn't know this superhero even exist and I found hilarious. I watched with my husband and we both enjoyed it. It's a superhero parody and if you watch it without expectations you'll have some fun, too. I gave it 10 for the effort to make some good parody (and to correct the ratings. This movie doesn't deserve 5,4).","user":"vslampert","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Good Fun","rating":7,"date":"10 April 2019","review":"An enjoyable light hearted parody of Superman. The English audio and sub titles don't really do justice to the original Spanish script but still worth watching. A welcome counterbalance to the \"serious \" super hero genre.","user":"s-hicks","rank":[6,6]}]
