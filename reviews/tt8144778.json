[{"title":"A must see film for athletes and fitness enthusiasts","rating":7,"date":"3 May 2018","review":"Just fantastic to be able to watch these incredible athletes. They capture it all ... power, endurance, functionality, flexibility, the entire range of human exercise physicality. Its really a must see for those into working out and exercising. You will find the movie extremely inspirational. A 10 rating in that regard.\nOn the other hand, everything else in terms of filming was quite weak. The movie was choppy and poorly directed. Overall, I give this film a 7 out of 10 and again, a must see for those into fitness.","user":"heleninnamorato","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"Inspiration","rating":8,"date":"23 August 2018","review":"I loved this documentary, it really focuses on the hard work and commitment that these athletes have. It was emotional and inspiring in equal parts.","user":"luttrell1973","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Good apart from the lies","rating":6,"date":"12 January 2020","review":"This is a very good film, one which I have watched quite a few times but as other reviewers have stated every now and then the film talk to the makers of Crossfit about the use of drugs in the sport and all the time they are saying no that none of the big names are taking something, they are, 100% they are taking performance enhancing drugs.\nIt would have been better if they had said yes we know most of the athletes are taking something and we are trying to stamp it out.<br><br>Stop treating the audience like idiots.","user":"kjjames81","rank":[2,3]}]
