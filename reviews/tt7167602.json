[{"title":"No kids movie","rating":9,"date":"6 April 2018","review":"I started watching expecting to fall asleep midway. Instead I stayed awake way past my bedtime because the story was so interesting. \nIt's best if you watched Flashpoint Paradox first (which is another excellent movie by the way), but it's not really required.\na bit gory, but it's refreshing to see a movie where it's not afraid to kill important characters. \nWhy is DC animated movies so good, yet the live action movies so bad I wonder.","user":"suwandani","rank":[30,34]},{"title":"Better than the live-action movie","rating":9,"date":"28 March 2018","review":"Ultra violent, good voice acting, nice story. If only the sequel to the live-action movie will do as well.","user":"therealguy13","rank":[49,65]},{"title":"Better than the Rest","rating":8,"date":"15 May 2018","review":"So I just finished Suicide: Hell to Pay. It amazes me that a cartoon did a better job at Suicide Squad than the movie. Warner Bros. animation needs to give their film department some tips.<br><br>On the negatives, some of the dialogue was corny. But that's a small nitpick in an otherwise great animated film. The voice acting was pretty spot on. I cant wait for the next DC animated film.","user":"leantwon","rank":[21,26]}]
