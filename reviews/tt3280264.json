So, overall it is very good movie, definitely better than average Hollywood movie.<br><br>If you love this movie you will probably love \"Our Little Sister (2015)\". If you ask me I would say that \"Our Little Sister\" is better.<br><br>This is my first review and I hope it helps. I wrote it just because there was none :)","user":"Toma11","rank":[5,7]}]
