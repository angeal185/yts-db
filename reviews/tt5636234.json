[{"title":"At least it was short.","rating":13,"date":"13 March 2019","review":"Of course there's bad acting and terrible cgi, what would you expect? I didn't expect one of the 3 kids to have gray hair, wearing his hat sideways to appear young and another to be a stripper in a one piece bathing suit acting like an intellectual prude. That helped distract me from the lack of story and action. There is a giant plot hole that I won't mention because I don't want to spoil it but over all it's exactly what you would expect from a movie with this name. I'm not sure why they say it's a comedy but I did laugh once.","user":"TheMeanGreenMidget","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"How not to make a movie","rating":1,"date":"26 May 2018","review":"Oh dear what a total piece of crap this movie is, the special efffects out of a child's paper mache lesson! The shark was so badly made it was comical a rating of 0 if I could rate it that. The actors were awful it was a pain to watch them, how this got to dvd is a laugh it needs to be binned along with mr paper mache shark.","user":"ArchieIsCool","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Absolute Gem with a capital G .... jk this movie is a war crime","rating":1,"date":"5 July 2019","review":"Your watching a movie called Sharkenstein .... what do you expect ... a gem that's what. In all seriousness though, this is hands down one of the worst films ever made. Most people watch movies like this for fun to see a terrible movie, but the truth is this movie is so bad, it will upset you that someone decided to spend money on it. Do yourself a favor and watch the first 10 minutes, get your laughs, and turn it off. The acting is more linear than a Super Mario game and has the production value of a Grand Slam from Dennie's.","user":"blackanthony-30942","rank":[2,2]}]
