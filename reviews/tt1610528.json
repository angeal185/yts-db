[{"title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","rating":1,"date":"4 July 2010","review":"Awful, just so utterly awful, you'd think the film-makers were about to throw couple of thousand dollars on a fire, and then thought to make this instead. As a joke. I just can't believe that the actors could keep a straight face throughout all of this.<br><br>The only thing I learnt from this movie is that all satellites make bleepy noises in orbit when they're being accessed.<br><br>The rogue mega-laser tearing up a street and a couple of buses was pretty funny, but the best humour comes when the plane is coming almost at street level over the city, people are running terrified, and a young woman stops to look over her shoulder. And we get a close up. She has a look on her face like she has mild indigestion. And then she continues running. Class.<br><br>If they'd pitched this as a comedy I might actually have bought it!","user":"phildesign","rank":[41,45]},{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"14 August 2010","review":"A few movies are so bad they're good. This one is so bad it's just awful. The title is awful. The plot is awful. The sets are awful. The CGI is awful. The bad guys are awful, and not even in the way that bad guys are supposed to be awful. The good guys are awful, too. The directing, lighting, sound, music, editing, casting, costuming, locations, visual effects, stunts and camera-work were all awful. The writing is especially awful. The TSA must have been awful to let the bad guys on the plane with so many guns. Holding phony airplane steering wheels, shaking them around while pretending to control the plane and clipping the tops of buildings and radio towers while flying at 27,000 feet is awful. The beginning is awful. The climax is awful. And without spoiling the ending, believe me, it's awful. Everything about this movie is so awful, that it doesn't rate a superlative of any kind: even the awfulness of this movie is awful.<br><br>注意走私犯：本文是一个你想穿上你的盒子。","user":"craighan","rank":[26,30]},{"title":"A Complete Disaster!","rating":2,"date":"2 July 2010","review":"I've just wasted 90 minutes of my life sitting through this unoriginal film about domestic terrorists skyjacking a passenger jet airline. The plot was nothing new with ransom demands to be met or we will crash this airliner etc... The acting was terrible, it's no surprise I hadn't heard of any of the actors before. The special affect were so laugh out loud it looks as though a high school kid had done it for course work. <br><br>I would love to know what these filmmakers are doing next, so I can avoid it.<br><br>Any good thing to write about about this film? No! <br><br>Straight to DVD then to the Bargain Bucket is where this film will end up, A Complete Disaster!","user":"mjoldfield","rank":[13,14]}]
