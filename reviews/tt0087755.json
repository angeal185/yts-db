[{"title":"\"That'll teach ya to mess with a lady!\"","rating":14,"date":"14 August 2001","review":"I distinctly remember seeing \"Muppets Take Manhattan\" in the movie theater when I was 8 years old--following the film, I immediately demanded that my parents purchase the soundtrack LP (yes, on vinyl!). I loved this movie then; I love it still.<br><br>Actually, it's my favorite among the first three, classic Muppet films; \"Muppet Movie\" is great but overlong, while \"Great Muppet Caper\" is terrific, but seems a bit dated now. \"Muppets Take Manhattan,\" on the other hand, never fails to entertain me, still makes me laugh out loud (the purse-snatching scene; Kermit in his Bert Convy 'fro), and even tugs at my heartstrings.<br><br>What's particularly nice about this adventure is that it's an affectionate love letter to Hollywood musicals of yore, without being overly parodying. The musical comedy cliches are presented in a matter-of-fact manner; just as we were expected to suspend our disbelief when Ruby Keeler went out onstage a nobody but \"came back a star!\", we suspend our disbelief to encompass a group of talking animals putting together a big budget Broadway musical in 2 weeks. These kind of hoary plot devices are presented straight-faced, without any self-conscious \"winking\" or irony.<br><br>The songs are all pretty darn terrific; the show-stopping \"Together Again\" finale is as good as any contemporary musical number of the last 20 years or so, while \"It's Time for Saying Goodbye\" always puts a lump in my throat: it's sentimental without being maudlin. The finale, \"He/She Makes Me Happy\" goes from being sweet to comically over-the-top in less than 3 minutes, and it's a joy.<br><br>The expected parade of cameos work well within the structure, without being intrusive. My particular favorites are Liza Minnelli's (the whole Sardi's scene is wonderful), Linda Lavin's (another terrific comedy moment: \"YOU are Mr. Enrico Tortellini of Passaic, New Jersey!\"), and Joan Rivers' (another gem). The Muppet performers are their usual, endearing selves: lovable, warm, likable. The \"love triangle\" between Kermit, Piggy and the human Jenny plays surprisingly well, and Piggy's jealous reactions are hysterical.<br><br>These days, \"family entertainment\" usually means disgustingly white-washed pap that anyone over 10 or 11 would find either sedating or inane. (Disney's live action \"101 Dalmations\" and its sequel spring to mind.) The Muppet movies proved that a G-rated film could be intelligent, witty, funny and entertaining for all ages. It's a formula that has yet to be improved upon, and \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\" just might be the best example of it.","user":"TJBNYC","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Enjoyable mostly on nostalgic terms, and great with an audience","rating":9,"date":"15 September 2000","review":"Throughout this film, you might think this film is just for kids. Well, it is mainly pointed towards them, but it's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience. This time around, the Muppet gang try to get on Broadway, with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced, leading them to splitting up. But Kermit won't stop, and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia! <br><br>It's a send-up, in part, of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical, only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments (Lou Zealand's boomerang fish; Gonzo's water-stunt display, the whisper campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart too. The Muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream. <br><br>While not as totally original in scope as the Muppet Movie, it's got many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations all over Manhattan, and even some intonations of inter-species dating (and marriage)! Cameos include Liza Minneli (\"a frog?\"), Elliot Gould (as the cop), Brooke Shields (propositioned by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So get ready to sing-along, or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.","user":"Quinoa1984","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"The Pinnacle of Muppet-dom (contains quotes, may or may not be spoilers)","rating":10,"date":"26 April 2005","review":"When I first saw this film in the 1980's, I was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since I considered myself grown up and out of the \"Sesame Street/Muppets\" age. I honestly don't remember if I liked it at the time or not. However, somewhere in college I watched this film again, and it wound up going (and staying) into my personal Best Films Ever collection.<br><br>This film is LOADED with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the Muppets. I mean, obviously the Muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there's humor geared towards both generations. But come on...Janice is accidentally overheard telling someone \"I don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it IS artistic\"...there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with Kermit the Frog then the father doesn't want to hear it...Gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and afterwards says \"I think we're engaged now\"...these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling. Add to that very smart dialogue, very smart New York/Broadway \"wink wink\" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on \"kid-level cheesy\" whatsoever...this film is a masterpiece! I don't throw \"10\"'s out on a regular basis...but this one deserves it. Over 20 years later, this film totally holds up, perhaps even more so. The Muppets never were and never will be again, as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is. ---Q","user":"milkshakeboom","rank":[10,12]}]
