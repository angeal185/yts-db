[{"title":"You broke rule number 2.","rating":1,"date":"7 January 2019","review":"Why did people dislike Oceans 8?\nI believe this can be explained with Danny Oceans 3 rules:<br><br>Don't hurt anybody.\nDon't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it.\nPlay the game like you've got nothing to lose.<br><br>Upon being paroled Debbie Ocean immediately steals a bagful of items from a department store and then commits credit card fraud by re-booking a hotel room after the couple have left.<br><br>The latter breaks rule number 2, the couple didn't deserve it. They were just innocent people enjoying a holiday.<br><br>That sets the tone for the whole film, Debbie Ocean is a common thief who is smug, entitled and not very likable.<br><br>Danny would be ashamed.","user":"colbj-49411","rank":[305,364]},{"title":"Misses every target","rating":3,"date":"5 July 2018","review":"It's not funny, the characters aren't charming, and worst of all for a thriller - there's no suspense. Even the sound tracking lacked punch. The characters also lack believability - they don't convince anyone they are criminals, hackers, grifters or anything of the sort. I can't really think of anything good to say about this film - it'll genuinely put you to sleep.","user":"drael64","rank":[700,880]},{"title":"All Cast and No Substance","rating":1,"date":"9 June 2018","review":"This is one of those awful films consisting of too many famous people acting out a plot that has no backbone in the vain hope that their collective fame will patch the holes in the story. I wouldn't wipe my ass with this script.","user":"ami-48108","rank":[709,939]}]
