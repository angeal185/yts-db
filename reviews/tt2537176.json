[{"title":"If you liked the first one you will like this too. This is for a select group. Very graphic. I say C+","rating":5,"date":"16 September 2013","review":"\"Tell me you like me!\" Katie (Dallender) is an aspiring model living in New York. Trying to make a more professional portfolio she accepts an offer for a free photo shoot. Things are going well until they ask her to take nude shots. Refusing, she leaves but the crew finds her and does the unthinkable. Now all Katie has on her mind is revenge. If you have seen the first one you will know what to expect. If you haven't I should warn you this is extremely graphic and violent and not for everyone. There are intense scenes of torture and mutilation but because the woman doing these things was raped by the people she is doing this to it makes it hard to feel sorry for them. If you liked the first one you will like this too, but again if you don't think you can handle it don't watch it. This is for a select group. Overall, not as good as the first but mainly because the rape and abuse of the woman seemed worse and that isn't fun to watch. I give it a C+.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[28,36]},{"title":"Vengeance is a real bitch! ◆≈≈6/10≈≈◆","rating":6,"date":"6 September 2013","review":"It's a title that sends instant recollections of one of the most brutal &amp; torturous horror films ever made, a title that is infamous to all horror junkies alike. I still remember from when I was a child, pulling down the original I Spit on Your Grave (1978) VHS tape from atop the entertainment center where it was poorly hidden from me. Those visions that were burned into my young mind still remain fresh almost three decades later, it was one of the most unflinchingly dark, utterly disturbing, nightmarish and uncomfortable films of the century. I would have to say the rape portrayed within is as nasty and uncomfortable enough to match any other film I've ever seen. I can only imagine the reaction of some of the audience members during screenings of Meir Zarchi's cult classic in its theatrical release in 1978.<br><br>When Steven R. Monroe decided on the remake in 2010, my curiosity was unparalleled and my expectations were high to see the difference of interpretation of the times, considering how much the horror genre has evolved and changed over all these years, sort of building up a mainstream tolerance with the addition of more and more films in the vein of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, Saw and Hostel. Audiences have become well accustomed to the level of violence, somewhat similar to the original \"I Spit\". That said, Monroe blew the doors off theaters with his masterful remake in 2010 which very much lived up to it's predecessor and in some ways even far surpassing it, much of the success lied on the shoulders of the superb performance of young Sarah Butler, certainly her breakthrough performance.<br><br>Taking all of that into account, it's a safe bet that most viewer's expectations going into \"I Spit 2\" are going to be set pretty high considering Steve Monroe is again in the director's chair. There is one thing worth noting here and it's the fact that unlike the original film written by Meir Zarchi and it's remake which was essentially a carbon copy of Zarchi's script with Stuart Morse's name attached, I Spit On Your Grave 2 is a completely fresh reboot from writers Thomas Fenton (SAW IV) and Neil Elman, a producer with a few Sy-Fy channel scripts under his belt. These changes are definitely noticeable as the \"I Spit 2\" sequel serves up slightly less graphic rape scenery and to some extent lacks the very sharp uncomfortable edge that the first two films leave you straddling. In no way am I saying it doesn't deliver the expected smörgåsbord of graphically violent and downright uncomfortable scenes, it did, but it failed to affect me mentally like other films of this kind often do. It didn't quite fully enrage me during the rape scenes, possibly because I wasn't able to fully connect with Katie's character. Not that this makes this a bad film, but it did play a large role on how emotionally charged I was at times during the film and seems to leave the audience too unattached to receive the kind of emotional payout that its predecessors delivered on. <br><br>As the story goes, Katie (Jemma Dallender) a very beautiful young woman looking to break into the modeling business ends up with a phone number of a photographer Ivan (Joe Absolom) and after a quick call she agrees to come downtown for a photo shoot free of charge. When Katie shows up, things don't go as planned when they insist she pose nude, she abruptly leaves, but not before getting the attention of Ivan's brother Georgie, who becomes obsessed with Katie. Later that night, Georgie (Yavor Baharov) , who got Katie's home address from the release form she had turned in at the beginning of the shoot, ends up at her door with a handful of pics that were taken before the nudity issue arose. Katie reluctantly takes the pics and after some urging finally gets Georgie to leave, only to awaken in the middle of the night to see Georgie sitting in her dark bedroom filming her. They immediately struggle violently and in the process, make enough noise to draw the attention of a neighbor/boyfriend Jayson (Michael Dixon). After stabbing Jayson, he binds and rapes Katie while her boyfriend lies watching on the floor bleeding out. When Georgie calls his brothers for help, Katie ends up being smuggled out of the country and sold out for further sexual abuse and torture by some seriously sick-minded individuals. Left for dead, badly beaten, battered, bruised, and broken, a stroke of luck gives her the chance to regain herself and take brutal vengeance upon all who harmed her, torturing each of them similar to the way in which they abused her, only she's so, so much more motivated.<br><br>Everything else was all pretty tight, production values, cinematography and score were all befitting for the making of a solid horror flick, but in the end it's just not on the same level as the remake. It's worth a look for horror fans just as long as it's clear that \"I Spit 2\" is going to be a decent step down from the revenge masterpiece that preceded it.","user":"Thrill_KillZ","rank":[64,96]},{"title":"Torture and Revenge","rating":6,"date":"24 January 2014","review":"In New York, the teenager Katie Carter (Jemma Dallender) is an aspirant model that works in a restaurant. She is advised to prepare a portfolio with a professional photographer to have a chance in the fashion world but she cannot afford to pay about two thousand-dollar for a session. She sees an advertisement of the photographer Ivan (Joe Absolom) offering free photos and she contacts him. She goes to his studio and his brother Georgy (Yavor Baharoff) welcomes Katie while their brother Nicolay (Aleksandar Aleksiev) is sleeping in a corner. Ivan asks Katie to wear less clothes and she gives up of the session. <br><br>On the next day, Katie is surprisingly visited by Georgy that insists to give a flash memory with her photos to her. Katie accepts and during the night, Katie is surprised with Georgy in her room. She screams and the super Jayson (Michael Dixon) comes to her apartment but he is stabbed to death by Georgy that rapes Katie. Georgy calls his brothers and Ivan drugs Katie to clean the mess. When she awakes, she is in the basement of a house being successively abused by the brothers. Katie escapes but she discovers that she is in Bulgaria. Detective Kiril (Georgi Zlatarev) does not trust on Katie and calls his acquaintance Ana (Mary Stockley) that offers to take Katie to a shelter to have a bath and then to the American Embassy. But when Katie arrives in the shelter, she discovers that she is back to the same basement she had fled.. The brothers sell Katie to the violent middle-aged Valko (Peter Silverleaf) that tortures her before raping. Then the brothers bury Katie in a box in the basement; but the floor collapses and she survives in old catacombs and helped by Father Dimov (Valentine Pelka) that offers food and clothes to her. When Katie is physically strong, she plots an evil revenge against those that have tortured her. <br><br>\"I Spit on Your Grave 2\" is a rough movie about torture and revenge and not for everyone since sensitive viewers will certainly be shocked with the violence. Movies about revenge are usually attractive, maybe because many people do not believe in justice any more, and \"I Spit on Your Grave 2\" is no exception.<br><br>The storyline is the same of the original movie and its remake, i.e., woman is abused and tortured by many men and succeeds to escape from her captivity and kills them one by one. However, the story and screenplay is different from \"\"I Spit on Your Grave\".<br><br>All the cast has great performances but the unknown Jemma Dallender is impressive. The plot has holes – for example, why Kiri has not connected to Nicolay that was murdered in a night-club, or why he did not connect the dots to Ana after having a conversation with Father Dimov? The conclusion also disappoints but this movie is not bad. The problem is that as I have previously mentioned, the viewer must have stomach to bear the cruelties. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Doce Vingança 2\" (\"Sweet Revenge 2\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[26,36]}]
