[{"title":"Rampant","rating":8,"date":"13 February 2020","review":"I love zombie movies and this is definitely one of my top favorites. It has all the scare and excitment you need without all the constant jump. Everything is quite predictable, which is absolutely refreshing to not have to overthink things. Action packed and comical at times, it is definitely worth the watch. For those of you who dislike subtitles, please give it a shot. The subtitles are short and to the point. It wont leave you missing out on any part of this zombie filled adventure.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[36,37]},{"title":"A swashbuckling period film with demons (hybrid between vampires n zombies). Crispr?","rating":8,"date":"18 February 2019","review":"I love Korean films n Train to Busan is my fav zombie film.\nWell, this is not as good as Train to Busan but nonetheless it is better than most zombie films produced left right n centre in Hollywood.<br><br>A prince returns home upon hearing that his elder brother has taken his own life.\nWhile the king is busy with his concubines n the minister of military plotting to overthrow the dynasty, our prince has to face assassins, rebels, cries of poor peasants n hordes of demons (hybrid between zombies n vampires).\nThe demons r fast, terrifying n downright creepy.\nThe cinematography is top notch n the action scenes involving the sword fights r awesome. There is tons of decapitations, slicing of arms, legs, etc. but the gore is restrained.\nThe prison escape scene with the demons behind is pretty tensed n frightening.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[40,49]},{"title":"Better if watched before new 'Kingdom', 2018 series","rating":7,"date":"5 March 2019","review":"Better if watched before the new 'Kingdom' 2018 series, shows this movie could have been made better too, but the new series is so good that this movie paled in comparison. I don't know which one came first, but the series ended up the better of the two, by far. Still, it's worth the watch for any zombie enthusiast....and korean zombies even better. So if only have 2hrs to watch then this novie very good choice, but if you have 8hrs then go for the new series, 'kingdom', also korean language with subtitles plus season 2 just about ready I think...close maybe and S03+ not far fetched.","user":"safsurfer","rank":[22,31]}]
