[{"title":"For all its impressive rap-battles, the film makes it clear that the real battle is inside; when it comes out, it's incredibly compelling.","rating":7,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"'VS. (2018)' is a compelling and, at times, emotionally resonant film that focuses on a troubled teenager (played by a guy who doesn't even come close to passing for seventeen) who, after being bounced around from foster home to foster home, finally finds an outlet for his inner anger when he stumbles upon the Southend rap-battle scene. It's an engaging and enjoyable time throughout, one that's brought to life with confident - if ever-so-slightly unremarkable - filmmaking and is based on an assured, effective screenplay. The acting is surprisingly good across the board, especially from the lead (who makes his feature debut), as it feels totally naturalistic and adds to the piece's realist aesthetic. It also bolsters the subtle and generally excellent character-work - which is what really drives the feature. The focus on character even runs through the flick's lyrically-accomplished and occasionally challenging battle sequences, which ultimately show an excellent understanding of the culture and even aim to dismantle some of its most toxic of tropes. While these sequences are the loudest and most energetic, they're rarely matched by the sheer power of the picture's quieter moments - a fine feat, indeed. When the two worlds collide in the impressive - if slightly convenient - finale, you'd be hard-pressed not to get a smile on your face. 7/10","user":"Pjtaylor-96-138044","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"Taken by Suprise","rating":7,"date":"16 April 2019","review":"I never knew this was out and I do like a bit of battle rap now and again but was so moved by the story and the performance it has inspired me to review this (which is something i never normally do). But all I can say is wow I was glued to the monitor watching it, I paid Â£3.5 rent it on google play and it was money well spent, for a small film it did really well. Highly recommend watching it even if you do not like battle rap.","user":"raymie-08464","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Way better than Bodied, but also just good on its own.","rating":9,"date":"19 June 2019","review":"It's not a YouTube film so obviously the production value is better. It's got a good story and very human characters, the battling is icing on the cake. Shotty Horroh plays a believable villain as Slaughter. I liked the ending too. If you like battle rap you'll like the movie. The cameos are great fan service and the soundtrack was well-curated. They even threw in some of Shotty's music, which I enjoyed. I'm glad they didn't make it a comedy, I thought Bodied didn't do as good a job with characters or the ending. There are some lines that reference 8 Mile, and I haven't seen it in a long time but this movie gives it a run for its money IMO. Just needs some time to settle.<br><br>I bought the character development and the altercations were well-performed. It's not a bad movie, not sure what the fuss is about.","user":"ggrdisruptor","rank":[3,3]}]
