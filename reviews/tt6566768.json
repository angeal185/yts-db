[{"title":"ok but...","rating":5,"date":"13 April 2019","review":"While I thought the characters were developed well in the first part of the film, the ending was extremely rushed. I read and loved the book but I felt these characters didn't stay true to the underlying themes within the novel that made it so great. This film doesn't really show the true effects of fear on Bigger and key elements were changed that once again took away from how wonderful this film could have been. I was disappointed.","user":"kelleyjohnson-04058","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"A beautifully made film, but lacks the depth and thought-provoking character of Richard Wright's novel","rating":6,"date":"28 April 2019","review":"Finally the new adaption of Richard Wright's classical novel is here, ever since I read the book and I found out a movie was being made, I have been looking forward to this. That said, I hade very high expectations of it, seeing that the novel is so captivating and in every sense great.<br><br>The first thing I noticed that differed from the book, was the main character, Bigger Thomas. In the movie he has green hair, nails painted black and wears trashy clothes, something that is supposedly ment to showcase Bigger's world view. But let's be honest, it is nothing but ridiculous. Furthermore, he and his family does not seem to suffer from the same economic and racial struggles as in the book.<br><br>Moreover, there is little that shows a society that treats Bigger and other Black people less worhthy, as the book does. This is a vital failure as the whole novel builds on these themes and is the underlying factors behind Biggers actions later on. This misstep makes the movie lack depth and meaning, as well as failing to to fully deliver the measage. Now this film is a modern adaptation, and society has come a long way since the 1930's, even though there are still inequalities. The movie doesn't really emphasis this either, as the only attempt comes from modestly showing some police brutality in the ending.<br><br>Moving on, the ending feels very forced and quick as well, and it wouldn't have hurt to add another 30 minutes to it - especially just to get to see that famous courtoom scene from the novel. It was truly disappointing not to see it as it was one of the things I looked forward to the most. This movie suffers greatly from the lack of a good script.<br><br>However, the script may be poor, but the directing and cinematography sure isn't. Director Rashid Johnson pulls a rabbit out of the hat, saving this movie from being a total disaster. The lightning and colours are very nice and helps display the dark setting of the film. As well as great camerawork and some good looking scenes. Just imagine how good this could have been with a good script.","user":"nyancatcandy","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"It's good and then it's not.","rating":5,"date":"10 April 2019","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but since I did not find any sound review here, here it is.\nThe movie builds up great, great character development, good acting, intriguing plot; and then the third act begins, and it's all downhill from there. All buildup and character development stare into abyss upon an obvious climax. The realism that was there in the first two acts dies in the third act, and questionable choices are made in the plot, which makes you doubt whether there are different writing teams for Native Son. P.S I haven't read the book.\nI think this will suffice.","user":"chaitanyamaheshwari","rank":[16,22]}]
