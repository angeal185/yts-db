[{"title":"This sucks.","rating":3,"date":"9 December 2019","review":"The premise is cute. Make a film reboot about the reboot phenomenon that's about \"itself\".\nEverything else blows. We have two 50 year old men playing characters created as and meant to cater to grunge stoner 90s kids. The jokes that are new are barely worth a chuckle. The rest of the crap is, well all re-joked. And the \"adventure\" aspect of the movie is gone. Doesn't feel at all like a destination. Just feels like locations where they can squeeze in whatever lame old SNL celeb is required at the moment.\nKevin Smith was decent once upon a time, but he got old and his writing did not. Clerks was quirky, Mallrats was decent for a dumb youth comedy. But I should've known better after I sat throughTusk.\nSorry, Id have like to like this but Jay &amp; Silent Bob are relics of a long gone era. Everyone wants nostalgia to work, but it's just like opiates. The second hit doesn't get you as high as the first. Nostalgia just quickly feeds the addiction you can't explain. Then it's on to the next one.","user":"therealjzn-84637","rank":[201,313]},{"title":"Kevin. I love you. STOP MAKING MOVIES NOW.","rating":1,"date":"10 December 2019","review":"Clerks 2 was brilliant. Everything after that has been one terrible film worse than the last. Please stop. You are destroying your own legacy with these outings. Love you man. Now rest and do something else. Please.","user":"FrankMichaelOrlando","rank":[175,276]},{"title":"Some laughs but not nearly enough","rating":5,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"I'll open with the simple fact that if you're not familiar with Kevin Smith's body of work, don't bother with this one. Every joke and reference will fly over your head. Having said that...<br><br>I actually went to a roadshow screening of this with Smith and Jason Mewes in attendance. Even with seeing those two live and getting a sweet intro, the movie just didn't do it for me. At the same time when it points a finger at the reboot model of Hollywood and mocks it, this movie falls into the same traps as bad reboots. If it were a clever take on the reboot model (22 Jump Street), that would be a different story altogether but instead it's just the same plot all over again with the same jokes all over again.\nThat might be the most disappointing thing about this movie, the comedy. While there were moments I was laughing, so many of the intended jokes were either references to old jokes from Smith's previous films or line for line repeated jokes. This movie isn't Smith saying, \"hey! I came up with some new jokes for these old characters\" more than it's him saying, \"remember all these jokes that were funny 20 years ago? Well....here they are again!\"\nI will call out one scene where I thought to myself, \"I wish the movie was as good as this scene\" and that's the scene with Ben Affleck reprising his role of Holden McNeil. That scene was funny, heartfelt and concise. Flashes of the Kevin Smith of old with dialogue. While there is more heart in this story than the first Jay and Silent Bob movie, it's handled with the same subtlety as the comedy, beating you over the head with it.\nOverall, I will say that if you love Kevin Smith's filmography and cherish every one of those films, go see this movie and laugh your ass off. If you're hoping that this movie is Smith's return to form, you'll be greatly disappointed. It's a Kevin Smith's Greatest Hits Tour, the question is, \"how much do you like his music?\"","user":"d_stack04","rank":[83,126]}]
