[{"title":"Good cast, and a sweet story once it is allowed to open up.","rating":7,"date":"22 February 2014","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, there is a lot of story here, and the acting is really good; especially since the movie begins with no real focus, or direction. Within the first 30 minutes it is not a great movie, and the character development seems forced, but once they get past that the story is allowed to open up, and become more real. Some of the story is meant to feel ethereal, but there is no heavy hand pushing any beliefs or opinions, you are left to make your own decisions on the actual characters, and their fates. Deep down this movie is about pushing past the limitations that we set upon ourselves, and that it really is OK to live your life for you. There are many layers, and seeing the world through the eyes of young Vallie Sue, we are seeing her fears, and we watch her learn to stand up for herself, and her Brother, and take the steps she needs for herself. I Enjoyed this movie a lot more than I had expected, the camera work, and lighting feel weak, but the acting more than makes up for it most of the time. I am glad that things did not escalate too far, this movie leaves you unscarred, even though there are plenty of things that could have been much more painful. I recommend this for a good afternoon drama. Don't expect to be blown away, but you might at least enjoy meeting the people.","user":"face-819-933726","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Bittersweet and worth checking out but too many story lines are left open and it left the movie feeling unfinished.","rating":26,"date":"26 February 2014","review":"\"Anything's possible in Tardust.\" Vallie Sue (Michalka) is a small town girl with normal problems like everyone else. Her mother Tammy (Silverstone) regularly leaves her and her brother alone while she tries to find a new husband. Her brother hangs around an Indian who everyone says is dangerous. She has a few friends but her best friend is an imaginary cowboy who lives on the old drive-in screen in the town she lives in. In the middle of all this Valley does all she can to find herself and break free of the town to follow her own dreams. Going into this I was expecting a religious themed movie. If you are thinking that as well you will be disappointed. While there is a few moments of that this is not a religious movie at all. That said the movie is good and entertaining and I did end up liking it but it is not a happy movie. The only real complaint I have with this is that they had too many stories going on at once and not all of them got resolved. Not just minor ones but major ideas that get you interested but leave you hanging. When you watch you will see what I mean. Other then that though the movie is worth seeing. Overall, bittersweet and worth checking out but too many story lines are left open and it left the movie feeling unfinished. I give this a B.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Excellent film","rating":10,"date":"20 February 2014","review":"I really enjoyed Angels In Stardust. Though the title may sound like it could be a religious film, it is not. It is a coming of age film that includes suspense, intrigue and seemingly impossible dreams. The setting, a town built on an abandoned drive-in movie theater parking lot call Tardust (Stardust with the \"S\" missing), had me chuckling from the beginning. After the first 20 minutes of character development, the film really opens up. Alicia Silverstone (Tammy) is brilliant in her performance as a white trash mother raising children in a run-down trailer park community. In my opinion, it is her best performance ever in film. She had me crying in a number of emotionally moving scenes. Other times I was feeling shocked at how she treated her children and at her desperate attempts to improve her life. Billy Burk is amazing at fulfilling the roll of the wise Cowboy and AJ Michalka (Valley Sue) is perfect in her role as Tammy's responsible teenage daughter with dreams to be a writer. I was intrigued by the story and how Valley Sue's life weaves between fantasy and reality and at times, I was not sure where she was. The film is a blend of drama, comedy, mystical (or metaphysical) and personal challenge. It contrasts the harsh reality of their poor socioeconomic life with the hope created by the fantasy of dreams.","user":"rybrrdm","rank":[18,25]}]
