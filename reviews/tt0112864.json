[{"title":"Die Hard With A Vengeance is not only a great movie, it is arguably the best masterpiece sequel of all time!","rating":10,"date":"15 October 2015","review":"Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) is the third film in the popular Die Hard franchise, which re teamed Bruce Willis with John McTiernan, the director of the first film. It is my second favorite Die Hard film in the franchise. It feel's fast paced, more realistic and more action movie to me. It is not boring or slow, I love the characters: John McClane, Zeus Carver, Simon Gruber, Joe Lambert, Connie Kowalski, Charlie Weiss, Katya and Mathias Targo. No CGI real action sequences, real explosions, real stunt performances. McClane fires a power line, severing it in to the helicopter blowing up the chopper to pieces amazing my personal favorite scene. I love this movie to death, this is my movie and it is my personal favorite action film. <br><br>Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) is a near-perfect summer movie. It is one of my personal favorite action movies. It is so good as the first one, I couldn't decide which one I love to Death: Die Hard or Die Hard With a Vengeance. I love this movie to death it is my number 1 favorite action film in Die Hard series and action films. I love the original Die Hard to death but I love this sequel much more. That's my personal opinion. This franchise effort is a gleeful no-brainer with nonstop action. Die Hard With A Vengeance I really do believe is the greatest action sequel and a true masterpiece to the first movie. It gives some additional action pleasure, as we get to watch action heroes Bruce Willis get smacked around for 128 minutes. <br><br>In this third outing with John McClane, we are faced with yet another mad bomber on the loose. Jeremy Irons plays Simon, an East German Special Forces Colonel-turned-terrorist mastermind and the older brother of Hans Gruber, who has a score to settle with Detective McClane. Simon's bombing game comes complete with crafty riddles, which must be solved in a specified time or everything goes boom. McClane has no choice but to play. Along the way, he picks up an unlikely accomplice named Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson), a Harlem shopkeeper. Together they tear all over New York trying to head off disaster. Sure, it's all perfectly preposterous, but DIE HARD 3 has been directed with breathless intensity by John McTiernan, who certainly has a way with wrecking things. Was he very destructive as a child? Loved the spectacular subway crash, John. That hair-raising taxi ride through Central Park wasn't bad, either. I love the fact that they are saving kids from school. Charlie try's to disabled the bomb in school while Kowalski and Lambert are saving those kids stuck in the building I love that scene. McClane and Carver are desperately searching for the code for the bomb to disabled it, I love it to death. Don't forget to fasten your seat belts for this ride. It's often said that McTiernan and Hensleigh simply ignored Die Hard 2, and in terms of direct plot and dialogue references, this may be true, but they still give Die Hard 2 a nod by having an attendant humor--often almost \"goofy\" humor--in many action scenes. One of the most direct nods occurs with McClane \"riding\" something of an explosion (of water this time). This is one of the more hilarious scenes of the film.<br><br>Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 American action film and the third in the Die Hard film series. It was produced and directed by John McTiernan (who directed Die Hard), written by Jonathan Hensleigh, and stars Bruce Willis as New York City Police Department Lieutenant John McClane, Samuel L. Jackson as McClane's reluctant partner Zeus Carver, and Jeremy Irons as Simon Peter Gruber. <br><br>Twenty years ago, after two blockbuster movies and a five-year wait, the \"Die Hard\" franchise roared back into theaters with the explosive \"Die Hard with a Vengeance.\" <br><br>The movie was released on May 19, 1995, and it was an instant classic, thanks to a smart script, exciting plot, and the absolutely stellar chemistry between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. But not only was \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" a great movie, it was also arguably the best of its kind: unstoppable, and untoppable.<br><br>Die Hard With A Vengeance was filmed before CGI made it possible to create scenes like this without breaking a single window, this moment is utter, terrifying perfection.How often do you get an action flick where the heroes spend the entire first half of the film solving puzzles to save lives? In a franchise that distinguishes itself with action that toes the line between \"creative\" and \"ridiculous,\" \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" stays on brand, in the best way.<br><br>John McClane and a Harlem store owner are targeted by German terrorist Simon Gruber in New York City, where he plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building. 10/10 Score: bad Ass Seal Of Approval my personal second favorite Die Hard action movie.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[106,118]},{"title":"This Die Hard is the fastest moving of the trilogy.","rating":9,"date":"8 July 2005","review":"I like this one about as much as I like the first one. The first one had a better plot and was more tense, but this one moves at a very fast rate and it seems like it is over before it begins. A vast improvement over part two, this movie once again finds McClane in the middle of an emergency situation. This time, unlike part two, though it is very reasonable that he is involved as Irons character is the brother of the lead villain of the first Die Hard. Throw in a very funny Samuel L Jacksoncharacter and you have the makings of a great film action wise andcomedy wise too. This one centers around a mad bomber, threatening to blow up several places including a school if officer McClane does not play the game. McClane must do whatever the bomber says and boy does the bomber do a lot to get our hero down. Great action is a given as our hero desperately must try to find the bombs. Multiple car scenes a cool scene on a boat, and loads and loads of gold thrown in for an exciting ride. Irons is great as the villain, as was Rickman in the first one. Truly this is one fast moving ride that will keep you well entertained throughout.","user":"Aaron1375","rank":[89,100]},{"title":"The buddy action film has never been better.","rating":16,"date":"16 April 2003","review":"*** 1/2 out of ****<br><br>When one thinks of buddy action pictures, Lethal Weapon is immediately the first film to pop into your mind, since it virtually birthed the genre. Another choice would probably be Midnight Run or Rush Hour, the latter of which somehow took pop culture by storm (I recall my friends going around, shouting \"My daddy once caught a bullet...\").  So often left in the dust, probably because it was the third film of a trilogy and strayed quite a bit from its predecessors, is none other than Die Hard: With a Vengeance which, off the top of my head, is the best buddy action film I've ever seen.<br><br>How can this be?  Better than Lethal Weapon 1 and 2?  Better than Rush Hour? Hell, I'll even say it's better than Die Hard and Die Harder.  Here is a film that wisely knows, as a second sequel, not to simply repeat the same material over again.  This has partially to do with the numerous Die Hard rip-offs (namely Under Siege and Speed), so those hooks were gone, and I absolutely thank God John Mctiernan and company didn't suddenly decide \"we'll do Die Hard on a plane!,\" which would eventually be done three times (Executive Decision, Air Force One, and Con Air).  But what the filmmakers have done here is ingenious, they've widened the setting to include all of New York City.<br><br>They do this and still manage to retain the intense claustrophobia that permeated the previous entries, doing so by displaying just how frantic morning traffic is and just how BIG New York is.  As nonsensical as that last statement may sound, imagine trying to get from point A to point B in the middle of a traffic jam.  Mctiernan really knows how to let the tension ratchet up from just the sound of honking horns.  <br><br>Then there's the case of John McClane himself.  This time around, he's at the whim of a madman named Simon who requires him to perform certain tasks or New York buildings will be demolished by explosives. In the first two films, McClane was an everyman, which added much appeal, but he also acted a bit too much like a superhero to work consistently as an everyman, so what the filmmakers have done here is turn him into a jaded cop. He's seen this stuff before, so he's not as scared as he was before.  Willis is great at this role, too, seeing as he's done it before in The Last Boy Scout, but takes it to perfection here.<br><br>Rather, who we now have as the everyman is Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus, and he's a brilliant addition.  Not only is Jackson simply awesome in his role, he's likeable, tough, and hilarious, but he's also easy to sympathize with because he's not an action hero.  He doesn't know how to use a gun, he has no combat training, and he's never had to take on terrorists before.  What makes him so effective is his street-wise nature, and this quality of his works perfectly with McClane's own street smarts AND action heroics, which they combine in their day-long adventure.  These two have a chemistry that at least equals Riggs and Murtaugh and if there's a Die Hard sequel, Jackson needs to come back.     <br><br>Too many action movies give us poor villains who aren't menacing, vile, or charismatic enough to make for effective antagonists.  Jeremy Irons' Simon Gruber is an exception.  He is the best Die Hard villain, oozing charm and snaky intelligence.  This was one of the last few roles of Irons' career I could take seriously.  He's done what since then, Dungeons and Dragons? Pity how his career has taken such a downward spiral.<br><br>And last, there's the story and action.  The plot's a lot of fun, with McClane and Zeus having to use both their brains and brawn to save the day. The contrivances in the finale (the scene with the handcuffs, the aspirin bottle) aren't enough to bring the climax down, though it's true the conclusion isn't as exciting as the rest of the film.  That's understandable though, since the rest of the action is magnificent, particularly a car \"chase\" through the streets of New York which is as unstaged as a car chase can possibly look.  The film moves at a lightning pace that grips you from the opening scene to the very last.  Die Hard: With a Vengeance is an action flick that has it all.","user":"Li-1","rank":[110,127]}]
