[{"title":"Keaton in Heath","rating":7,"date":"15 March 2018","review":"So lovely to see Diane Keaton play a character who thinks she doesn't do anything. I think that feeling is common among givers. They give without realizing they're giving. She's getting to the end of her life and suddenly she realizes she doesn't have anything or anyone. I was moved to see in Keaton's eyes that youthful realization of love. This charming surprise of a film has other hidden pleasures, Brendan Gleeson for instance, his tender wild human is a delight, not to mention Lesley Manville - her scenes are filled with a comic energy that never goes over the top, a real treat. And then Simon Callow as the judge is the icing on the cake. Enjoy.","user":"fanaticusanonymous","rank":[36,39]},{"title":"Interesting telling based on true events","rating":7,"date":"23 June 2017","review":"23 June 2017 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Hampstead. Why do people find it so hard to reconcile themselves to the fact that it's OK to be different. This story takes us on a journey of burgeoning love between a widowed American and a man who deliberately chose to remove himself from society. Putting nothing into society, yet taking nothing out, he is persecuted for his lifestyle and when he is being threatened with eviction he finds support from an unexpected source....namely Emily, played the the wonderful Diane Keaton, who brings her flighty style to this put upon, widowed character. Almost forced into rebelling by Fiona, her busy body head of the tenants association neighbour, Emily discovers Donald Horner, a man who has been practising his lifestyle for 17 years, yet is facing eviction by the developers who want to utilise his plot of land. Based on a true story this film shows the unpleasant side of some people's characters and the nicer side of those who are drawn out from their shells. A feel good film which only had one uneasy moment for me, that was when Emily seemed to change her personality momentarily leading me to wonder where things were going. A good rainy Sunday afternoon film.","user":"Figgy66-915-598470","rank":[33,40]},{"title":"Think of it as a palette cleanser for your jaded movie mind.","rating":6,"date":"12 January 2018","review":"A simple, pleasant and charming oddball romantic tale with great production standards.\nOf course, the truth is, I wouldn't have looked into it, much less touched it, without the name Brendan Gleeson. That he can adapt his 'strengths' to this form of confectionery product increases my admiration for his skills.\nI haven't exactly been clamoring for more Keaton, but she does what she does well.\nI had to hogtie and incapacitate my cynical beast to get through it, but it leaves a pleasant taste.","user":"steveo122","rank":[13,15]}]
