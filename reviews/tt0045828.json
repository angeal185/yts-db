[{"title":"Lively, physically beautiful, with delightful comedy and John Rich's script","rating":8,"date":"7 June 2005","review":"Young Piper Laurie and handsome newcomer Rock Hudson were both featured to great advantage in this clearly-plotted and lively adventure-comedy. Imaginative veteran Nathan Juran directs very accurately and imaginatively, and the acting by George Macready as the ambitious villain, aided by Gene Evans (not quite up to a classical accent) and Kathleen Hughes and that of their opponents played by Edgar Barrier, the crafty Stephen Geray and others is above average for any genre. Adding to the fun is lovely Laurie impersonating a boy, a mysterious magic sword (which in lesser hands would have been a detriment) and its magical unwillingness to obey other than a virtuous owner. There is a prolonged sequence when various magicians attempt to remove the sword--which Macready needs to claim the throne--that has become embedded in a wall, and more physically colorful and beautifully-realized scenes than in any ten mean-streets melodramas of the post 1970s. If you do not fall in love with the spirited Khairozan, as Hudson does in the film, then you are probably dead. If you cannot delight in this youthful and stirring adventure of a bygone era, you had best give Grecianized Near-Easterns, our richest adventure genre in so many ways, a consistent miss.","user":"silverscreen888","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Rock Hudson and Piper Laurie as brave and intrepid protagonists in this adventure set in ancient Bagdad","rating":6,"date":"13 June 2019","review":"Arabian Nights adventure with luxurious costumes , brisk action , fencing and dealing with a tale about a magic sword. More fabulous than the tales of the Arabian Nights , more exciting tan the travels of Marco Polo , more spectacular tan the splendors of Kublai Khan . Harum (Rock Hudson) is a valiant hero of the people who comes to Bagdad to revenge the killing of his daddy and meets Krairuzan (Piper Laurie), a princess masked as a commoner, working against a scheme by a gang of evil bandits attempting to do away with her father, the Caliph . The disguised girl gives Harum a golden sword which, in his hands, makes him a brave heroe . Harum and is doing quite well until a duplicate sword is placed in his scabbard during one of his off-guard moments, and he winds up in chains . His Blade Of Gold... A Legend In Battle! Her Kiss Of Surrender... The Prize Of Victory!<br><br>Oriental adventure with all the usual ingredients , including glowing colour and distinctive photography in Cinemascope . Adventure and stirring movie set in Bagdad , including bandits , schemers , a cunning Calipha , gorgeous dancers , intriguing sheiks , and many other things . Another look at ¨The Golden Blade¨ today reveals it to be a bit short on action but here outstanding the sympathetic and funny Rosetta Jacobs , alias Piper Laurie . Hudson gives a passable acting as an invincible merchant who swears to avenge his daddy and is soon involved the twisted intrigue and mysterious plots . Hudson using the powerful sword in the name of justice managed to spring from this ridiculous camp Oriental Adventure outing to stardom .Rock as the fearless merchant Harun Al-Rashid avenges his daddy's murder in this adventure set in ancient Bagdad and Hudson work is well up to his ordinary high standards , being inspired from the Arabic fairy tales of One Thousand and One Nights . This is Hudson's second adventure in the East , the others were :The Desert Hawk , Bengal Brigade , Spiral road , Battle Hymm , and Thunder of God . Rock was Douglas Sirk's fetish actor including essential titles as Taza , Magnificent obsession , Written in the wind , among others . He is well supported by Piper Laurie who really was a pretty package and she is was worth the price of admission to see her . Support cast is very good such as : Gene Evans , George Macready , Kathleen Hughes , Steven Geray , Edgar Barrier and Richard Carlson as Narrator .<br><br>Colorfully produced by Leonard Goldstein and Universal International , being accompanied by brilliant and glimmer cinematography carried out by director of photography by Maury Gertsman who photographed numerous Universal productions .The motion picture was professionally made by a magnificent director , Nathan Juran, who sometimes used pseudonym \"Nathan Hertz\" who collaborated with Charles H. Schener in several films . Nathan directs it all in stylish Technicolor . Before entering the film industry as an art director in 1937 Nathan ¨Jerry¨Juran won an Academy Award for art direction on How Green Was My Valley (1941). World War II interrupted his film career, and he spent his war years with the OSS. Returning to Hollywood, he turned to directing films in the 1950s. He handled mostly low-budget westerns and sci-fi opuses, as ¨First man in the moon¨, ¨The brain from planet Arous¨, ¨The deadly Mantis¨ , ¨20 million miles to Earth¨ , ¨Jack the Giant Killer¨ , his most famous being The attack of the 50 foot woman (1958) .

In the early 1960s, he journeyed to Europe, where he spent several years piloting adventure epics and spaghetti westerns such as ¨Land raiders¨.

It stars Rock Hudson, Piper Laurie, Gene Evans &amp; George Macready. Music is by Joseph Gershenson and Technicolor photography by Maury Gertsman.<br><br>By Allah! It would be magic, indeed, that this sword were mine at such a time as this.<br><br>Colourful, energetic and costumed with skill, The Golden Blade doesn't lack for effort in the low expectation realm of Arabian Nights adventures. Sadly it's actually TOO daft and goofy when it's not meant to be. True enough that it isn't a film to be taken seriously in the first place, and judging by the performances of Laurie and Hudson, the cast are playing it purely for the undemanding popcorn munching crowd. But once over you just get reminded that there are far better films of this type out there and that the interesting premise, a sort of Arabian/Arthurian blend, isn't fully realised. Not enough swishing and swashing of the titular title weapon also annoys greatly. 5/10","user":"hitchcockthelegend","rank":[6,6]}]
