[{"title":"Do not disturb this one from sitting in Redbox kiosks going unrented","rating":2,"date":"10 August 2013","review":"In this edited-down version of \"New Terminal Hotel\", screenwriter Don Malek (Stephen Geoffreys, Fright Night, 976-Evil, and quiet possibly one of the worst horror film I've ever seen Mr. Hush), still smarting from his girlfriend being murdered, decides to get vengeance while holed up in a seedy motel room andkeeping a powerful movie producer drugged up in the bathtub. Tiffany Shepis is (former Tromette) Ava, his heavily put-upon agent who becomes an unwitting accessory in the macabre little game he's playing. Oh and Corey Haim has a small cameo for no reason whatsoever.<br><br>It's a slowly paced film and I'd only label it horror loosely. However, seeing this after Don's film, Mr.Hush, it can't help but appear to be a better film, if only by default. Worth what I paid to watch it (for the sake of transparency, I get four free rentals from Redbox Instant per month, this is the first one I picked for August) but if you've paid more than me, you'll likely to be horribly disappointed. The film is disjointed, awkward, slow and not particularly engaging.<br><br>Eye Candy: Danielle Fortwangler gets topless, Tara Sukustis shows T&amp;A","user":"movieman_kev","rank":[20,26]},{"title":"Why...","rating":8,"date":"8 August 2013","review":"There should be an extra tax for abysmal theatrical productions. This was a wretched waste of time. My senses want to be compensated for the time spent on this.<br><br>Since there is a requirement for how long a review should be I decided to think if there was any good walk aways from this flic. I guess the fact that it started off a bit confusing but with enough plot development that it kept my attention long enough to watch more was a promising thing. But soon after I realized that I was only sticking around for disappointment. Others may find this as something interesting or entertaining enough with which to pass the time. Unfortunately, I am not one of them.","user":"dezvfx","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"A good waste of 90 min!","rating":6,"date":"14 April 2010","review":"New Terminal Hotel is a film about a writer who explores the dark side of murder while living in a seedy hotel. Various characters come into his life and he disposes of them one by one. Tiffany Shepis plays the Writers Agent, constantly snooping around looking for his latest, greatest script, Eventually she gets too close and gets implicated in his crimes. Some good performances by various cast members create an interesting film with a good brutal conclusion. Corey Haim plays once of the writers victims, his role in the film is really painful to watch cause of his really bad British accent and I was actually quite glad he dies so I didn't have to suffer through much of it. Stephen Geoffreys plays the writer/killer and is pretty solid. Watch Erza Buzzington, he really rips up the screen with his performance, and has some of the best lines in the whole film. Overall it was a good waste of 90 min.","user":"czar-10","rank":[6,11]}]
