[{"title":"Stay away from this stinker.","rating":1,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I won't waste many words on this review, as the poor production, camerawork, sound, and acting in this film does not warrant it.\nIn summary, avoid watching this at all costs, if I could take back the time I spent watching it I still wouldn't - because I have sacrificed it for any of you who happen to read this review.\nHigh score rating is obviously from friends of the cast and crew.","user":"psxexperten","rank":[16,19]},{"title":"Everyone Fantasizes about being abducted","rating":1,"date":"8 July 2019","review":"The film has a lot of boring monotones and needless narration by design. With plastic sheeting being on sale, a house is surrounded by the sheeting. Three neighbor girls get curious and investigate. They get captured and Plot Spoiler, the reason is to be either converted into \"drones\" who serve the beast we never see (low budget) or get fed to the beast. This all requires preparation, sometimes with clothes on and sometimes removed depending on how nice the body and their movie contract.<br><br>At no time was there a tripod ever used and the camera cuts off more heads than Hercules fighting the Lernaean Hydra. The filler talk was boring too. Cheap and bad.<br><br>Guide: F-word. Nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Absolutely dreadful. Who makes these?","rating":1,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"Horribly made movie. I think the only ten out of ten here is a professional reviewer with some vested interests. This movie is no where near watchable. Everything from acting to directing to cinematography are absolutely pathetic.\nSchool kids would have done a better job. They probably do. I'm not going to waste any more time even reviewing this drivel. Best avoid this garbage.","user":"amrahs_tima","rank":[9,10]}]
