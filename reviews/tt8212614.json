[{"title":"A wonderful, warm-hearted movie","rating":8,"date":"17 August 2018","review":"I didn't expect much from this movie, but it turned out to be a real winner. Its success is due almost entirely to the star, Eric Judor, a fine actor who turned what could have been a facile caricature into an often moving three-dimensional character. The man has charisma and to spare, but he played the role in an often understated way that made the tow-truck driver that much more interesting. <br><br>I strongly recommend this movie.","user":"richard-1787","rank":[11,13]}]
