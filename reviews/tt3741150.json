[{"title":"Baffling","rating":1,"date":"29 April 2017","review":"Woeful Brit gangster film which thinks it can put the word Undercover in the title to garner an audience.<br><br>Widowed policeman Michael Clarke (Kris Johnson) is a suspended police officer known for his extreme violence, the undercover hooligan of the title.<br><br>Clarke is sent to infiltrate a notorious London gang chief Terence Turner (Patrick Connolly) involved in sex and drugs trafficking and bring him to justice. His only help is undercover cop DC Baker (Ali Bastian.)<br><br>The acting is pedestrian, the plot is disjointed, the action scenes are awful. A baffling film that made little sense.","user":"Prismark10","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Awful","rating":2,"date":"20 April 2017","review":"Terribly unbelievable plot and dreadful acting make this a must miss.<br><br>The total lack of continuity makes it hard to believe and some of the characters seem to flit in and out with no real purpose. I felt like I'd wasted an evening watching this unfortunately.<br><br>It's another one of those \"Gangster British\" films that gives hope but delivers disappointment. Shame.","user":"pacebos","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Bloody UK crime flick","rating":5,"date":"5 March 2017","review":"The topic is not totally bad, nor the acting or the directing, but something is missing in this UK film. It is too confused and also too predictable, as usual for undercover cop, infiltrated heats stories. What is interesting is that it speaks of illegal migrants brought to England containers. Violent, brutal flick, with a horrible torture scene, and not only. The bad guys are worthwhile and the hero too. I have seen much worse than this film. Sincerely. I am surprised no one has commented it yet. Not bad but no more.","user":"searchanddestroy-1","rank":[4,5]}]
