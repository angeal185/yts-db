They probably should have just rolled that for 90 minutes.","user":"mark-23851","rank":[86,96]},{"title":"The best thing about the movie are the interviews....","rating":6,"date":"20 September 2019","review":".... unfortunately, the movie lacks interviews. The plot of this movie is simple and kind of boring, not going to lie about that. What makes it watchable and funny are the interviews as well as the blooper reel at the end, other than that there's basically nothing funny about the movie.<br><br>I thought the idea of making a Between Two Ferns movie was a good one, and it was, in theory. I just expected something else. I expected more interviews and The Office vibes, but this was just a mess.<br><br>If you like the web-series, you'll probably enjoy the movie, maybe. I'd suggest just skipping through to the interviews, instead of watching the whole thing. 6/10, just because of the interviews and the blooper reel at the end.","user":"Wililjam","rank":[101,116]}]
