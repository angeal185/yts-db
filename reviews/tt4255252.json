[{"title":"nothing to see and boring","rating":2,"date":"14 November 2016","review":"Just came across this flick by seeing the advertisement poster which looked old school exploitation. Perfect example how people can be tricked by posters. <br><br>Clocking in just over an hour even then it's way too long. We follow a girl who thinks she's going to become a werewolf and falls for her female colleague. So far for the story. <br><br>The flick itself is extremely slow. It should have horror elements as it is being sold as a horror but it hasn't any. On part of the lesbian thing going on there are parts were in slo-mo you see both girls having oral sex but with their clothes on. <br><br>There aren't any real effects, just the teeth which reminded me more of a vampire in stead of a werewolf. It tries to be mysterious and erotic but fails completely. For example why go to a fridge at your own place if you know it's empty...it's towards the end that the transformation takes place into a werewolf but cheaply done and too much slo-mo<br><br>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 0,5/5 Comedy 0/5","user":"trashgang","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Total lack of imagination","rating":1,"date":"28 February 2019","review":"Microscopic budget which I'm sure is due to lack of competence. We see a woman sitting at a table while play with her noodles and staring at a wall, walking down a hallway into bath with only a view of the tile floor and her feet, staring into a mirror, walking up a stairway, making copies, two women staring at each other in an office with no dialogue, and a panning shot of two doorways that lasts over a minute of screen time. Artsy? No just lack of imagination and skill.","user":"fjorge-38-321079","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"nothing to see here...please carry on...nothing to see here","rating":1,"date":"10 November 2016","review":"there are low budget films which are good. there are low budget films which are bad. there are low budget films which are bad and funny and then... there are low budget films which just suck...and this is the one which just sucks... it's not bad enough to be funny, it's not bad enough to be artistic or deep...it's just bad<br><br>there's no story...and what meager little plot there is - is so drawn out with the most pointless direction, horrid casting, lack of depth, poor visuals, bad editing, brutal delivery, terrible soundtrack, deplorable art and props, bland and lifeless locations, painful camera work and atrocious dialogue...even what little there is...<br><br>there is nothing to see here and think that it holds the slightest chance of entertainment content is sadly holding on to lost hope<br><br>this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it's coming very close...so the writer/director/actors and everybody involved can feel proud that they have not totally hit rock bottom<br><br>listen people...if you're going to waste your time and effort into making a film...at least make it mediocre enough to be called \"art\" or \"nuveau\" - or whatever the new term for making schlock into something remotely view-able and interesting...this has nothing...<br><br>even being sedated, stoned or drunk offers the viewer no hope of redemption...<br><br>there are plenty of movies which are bad and still more enjoyable than this to watch...and they suck...this just sucks on a totally lower level<br><br>regardless of budget in this case...no amount of money would have turned this sad sorry attempt of nothing into anything spectacular or even half-assed good<br><br>I wasted time awaiting to see what would come out of this...and the only thing that did, is my blatant negative review on something so mind-numbingly crap that any other viewers will have the opportunity to enjoy reading this review much more than sitting for 3 minutes watching your |film|<br><br>I was stuck in a bed - immobilized from an auto accident and was entertained more-so by watching weather reports of rain and the political debate<br><br>when that happens to your viewers, then it's time for you to do something more productive and start selling lemonade at your very own lemonade stand - and hope that you can do better than you did in making this film...good luck on that<br><br>save your time, effort and money - buy some plastic cups, make some ice, cut some lemons and start making lemon juice...because when life give you lemons...you don't make a movie like this - you just don't<br><br>you take those lemons, cut them in half - and squeeze the juice out and sell it with a cup of ice and some sugar...grab your 50 cents a cup and call it a day<br><br>then after you made your 50 cents, you don't invest that hard earned money into making something as dismal and depressing as this","user":"casablancavic","rank":[9,12]}]
