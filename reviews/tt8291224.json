[{"title":"A Masterpiece!!","rating":10,"date":"11 January 2019","review":"If I have to say in one word then it'd be MASTERPIECE. It can very well be a classic...a cult classic like Border. This movie doesn't portray blatant Jingoism but strikes the right chords of patriotism with maintaining the right balance. It is so well done that you'd crave for more even if it ends. Everyone performed very well and Vicky Kaushal was stunning. The movie is very inspiring and everyone especially the young generation should watch it to know what the army men do for them. The movie is not political at all but yellow media will try to demean it for 'certain' reasons.\nI still can't get over the top notch screenplay, direction, background scores, visuals and performances. A straight 9.5/10 (or may be 10/10 if I don't be skeptical) from me.","user":"sghosh07","rank":[269,378]},{"title":"One of the best war movies ever","rating":10,"date":"11 January 2019","review":"This movie is so real.\nDirection is superb.\nVicky kausal is brilliant in his performance.\nScript is tightly bound.\nMusic just complements the action, makes it even better.<br><br>Must watch !!","user":"aloknayak1988","rank":[222,314]},{"title":"A perfect tribute our Indian Army","rating":10,"date":"11 January 2019","review":"Watched a wartime movie after long time but I must say this one was the best I saw till date. This movie has a no nonsense plot which is entirely focused on the operation that was conducted for URI. The best part of this movie was there was no unnecessary romantic scene. Another best part of this movie was there was no unnecessary talks, cuss words to show the army's behavior, unlike other movies in past where half of the time is use to convince the audience why the operations are necessary. This is a must watch movie for everyone.","user":"vishal-kamble96","rank":[172,256]}]
