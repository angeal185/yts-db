[{"title":"Schools out, zombies in....","rating":6,"date":"19 July 2013","review":"Having run into a swarm of questionable and dubious low-budget zombie movies the last couple of months, I really had no particular high hopes for \"Detention of the Dead\", but I was genuinely surprised.<br><br>The movie starts out well enough and drops the action right in your lap almost right away. I enjoyed that and it was great not having to sit 30 or 45 minutes into the movie before action starts to happen and the movie to pick up pace. \"Detention of the Dead\" starts off in a high gear and keeps going at that pace.<br><br>\"Detention of the Dead\" has a good amount of comedy to it to make it a worthy addition to the genre where you would find \"Shaun of the Dead\". While it is not as classic as \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Detention of the Dead\" does manage to leave a good mark on the zombie comedy genre.<br><br>The effects in the movie were nice, though not as gory and detailed as that in George Romero movies or \"The Walking Dead\". But still, for a movie of this type and budget, then the effects and make-up was quite alright.<br><br>The characters in the movie were nicely detailed and equally well performed by the people hired for the various roles.<br><br>Story-wise, then the movie didn't really bring anything new to the zombie genre. But still, it managed to take already established lore in the zombie genre and put it to good use. There were some nice enough, although cheesy, references to be seen here and there, so stay alert.<br><br>\"Detention of the Dead\" is a good addition to the zombie movie library of any zombie aficionado.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"some good and bad parts","rating":6,"date":"9 September 2013","review":"A perfect example of how you could ruin a gory start of a zombie flick into a love story. I have no problem to bring in love into horror but here it overruns the death. And that's the major problem with Detention Of The Dead.<br><br>It has been compared with Shaun Of The Dead (2004) but on that part I don't agree. I never laughed with the jokes because they were again for an American release very childish. The farts, that has to be in every US comedy, how stupid is that. On the other hand when they start talking like in The Breakfast Club (1985) then again I prefer The Breakfast Club because it do has funny situations but here they are trying to make it funny with the sexy cheerleader known for sucking off every guy on school, the nerd falling in love with her and finally does, that's one you see coming from the first minute but hey, there's the weirdo, the goth chick who falls for the nerd and of course the muscled guy who dates the cheerleader. But all situations are so predictable that it even becomes a bit boring. <br><br>The final is a bit better because the zombies are coming in again. Still, the zombies looked rather good and some attacks were really messy and even sometimes gory. An ideal flick to start the evening while necking some brewies with your pals. <br><br>Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0,5/5","user":"trashgang","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"weak stereotypical characters played by too old actors","rating":4,"date":"29 August 2013","review":"Jacob Zachar is geeky Eddie. Alexa Nikolas is goth chick Willow. Christa B. Allen is cheerleader Janet. Jayson Blair is jerky Brad. Justin Chon is stoner Ash. Max Adler is meathead football player Jimmy.<br><br>They are all stock characters being completely stereotypical. The big problem being that they are all too old to be in high school. This is especially true for Jacob Zachar. He's suppose to be a geeky weakling, and he looks more like a haggard teacher. In fact, the only one that could pass for a high schooler is Alexa Nikolas, and just barely.<br><br>This is a weak effort from first time writer/director Alex Craig Mann. It's a derivative story of every other high school zombie movie. There is nothing new in the script or in the directing. Maybe he's trying to parody the whole genre by mocking it with a stupid weak Zombie Breakfast Club. But even a parody would add something new rather than just copying everything.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[7,10]}]
