[{"title":"Should have been a sequel to Malone","rating":8,"date":"20 November 2007","review":"Even though it came out a few months earlier, this great Burt Reynold's obscurity, \"Heat,\" could have easily been a sequel to his other great 80s obscurity, \"Malone.\" Once you changed a couple of small plot points to make the films consistent, you'd still have exactly the same character at the center of each. Burt acts the same, looks the same, dresses the same, and his character in Heat has a very similar background and the exact same skills as the one on \"Malone.\" In fact, the two films even share some of the same lines of dialog (almost). In \"Malone\" the young girl tells Burt's character that he must like violence. Burt replies that \"No, I'm just good at it--there's a difference.\" In \"Heat\" Peter McNichol asks Burt if he's a naturally violent person. To which Burt replies \"No, I'm just good at it.\" I mean, really--could that be a total coincidence? <br><br>Another similarity--\"Malone\" was basically a old fashioned Western in the \"Shane\" mode. \"Heat\" is basically a Spaghetti Western in the revenge mode.<br><br>I love both of these flicks and wish they'd get decent DVD releases.","user":"curtis-8","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"This movie was a bit of a gamble!","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2014","review":"Burt Reynolds has know to be an action hero as well as a wisecracking actor. In \"Heat\", he never uses a gun. Reynolds plays Nick \"Mex\" Escalante, a former soldier of fortune who is also a habitual gambler in Las Vegas. He meets different people, protecting them as well. When teaching one man to be tough, a call girl named Holly(Karen Young) get viciously beaten by a new high roller(Neill Barry) who is back by a pair of giants. Holly demands revenge, but she needed Mex's help. He goes in disguise, takes out the two giant thugs and takes out DeMarco as well. While tied up, Holly comes in, with a pair of shears, and did the unthinkable. Baby(Joseph Mascolo) hears the news on what happened. But he wanted Mex's side of the story since he finds DeMarco accounts kind of questionable. The loophole was Mex doesn't use guns. Earlier, he met a man named Cyrus Kinnick(Peter MacNicol), who knows about his situation: He wants to go to Venice. After training him to be tough, he repays Mex with some money to go. Before they can go further, DeMarco and his goons ambushes them, only wounding Kinnick. He didn't look like much when Mex met him, but he appeared a lot tougher than he thought he was. A gun-less victory is possible when you're a super soldier. Just tell that to DeMarco and his crew. This movie has a lot of action. A little subtle to say the least. But what the hey! 2 out of 5 stars","user":"GOWBTW","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"The showgirls have moustaches and the waitresses can rip the phone book in half!","rating":7,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"This Burt Reynolds starrer had a very troubled production, with punches thrown and inevitable walk outs, it's no surprise to find this is hardly a great film. However, it's not as some would have you believe, a chaotic turd either.<br><br>The password is later!<br><br>Plot has Reynolds as Nick Escalante, he's an ex-mercenary working out of Las Vegas as a bodyguard for hire - amongst other things. When a lady of the night who he has paternal regard for is brutally beaten and sexually dehumanised, it brings Nick into conflict with a young gangster pretender with organised crime connections. All this as Nick battles his gambling addiction whilst trying to achieve his goal of moving to Venice, Italy, for his five year plan.<br><br>You're a peach of a guy. You're \"A\" number one. You're a swell fella.<br><br>Adapted by William Goldman from his own novel of the same name, Heat often threatens to be a very good picture. The characterisations are rich and interesting, the setting ripe for dark deeds and dream shattering, and Reynolds is in fine form. Reynolds was still a star, even if the films he was starting to make in the 80s didn't come close to matching his status. He is badly let down by some very creaky and daft action sequences here, why the director (Dick Richards/Jerry Jameson) didn't just do real time man to man combat is as mysterious as the resultant offering is daft.<br><br>I made $7 million dollars on my 28th birthday. Don't call me kid.<br><br>Whilst the screenplay lacks action (do not enter this one expecting an action fest), the script does have some weighty merit where Nick's interactions with others is concerned, none more so than with Peter MacNicol's (superb) Cyrus Kinnick. He's afraid of being afraid, enlisting Nick to give him a crash course in bravery. They are an odd pairing, but crucial to each other, they give the film its deft slices of humour, and simultaneously holding the key as to why Heat is not a bad film at all.<br><br>Michael Gibbs layers some smart sultry jazz music over proceedings, befitting the Vegas setting, while James Contner's cinematography is also tonally compliant to the sort of desperation feeling permeating the plot. Howard Hesseman and Diana Scarwid aren't given enough time to impact greatly, but at least Karen Young as Holly (lady of the night) strikes the right chords. Unfortunately Neill Barry as chief villain Danny DeMarco is implausibly poor and irritating into the bargain.<br><br>Enjoyment of Heat possibly hangs on if you happen to be a Reynolds fan, to get entertainment from watching him hold court. Viewed as a strong character piece with Reynolds front and center it passes muster, but if looking for something more then you could end up - like many already have- disappointed. 7/10","user":"hitchcockthelegend","rank":[4,4]}]
