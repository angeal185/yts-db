[{"title":"HORRIBLE!","rating":1,"date":"25 July 2019","review":"This was probably THE WORST movie I've ever seen. For some reason it started playing while at my local nail salon. So I was basically FORCED to watch it. I was hopeful in the beginning when I saw Roseanna in it. Still beautiful as always. But that's the only positive thing about this movie. NONE of the characters are likable. In fact, you hate them! The son's scenes are awful. The ones with him and his \"girlfriend\" are down right horrendous. Plot was non existent, and the whole movie was basically torture. Don't waste your time!!","user":"Xtina34","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"A sophisticated and original romantic comedy","rating":13,"date":"13 May 2018","review":"Max Heller is a talented wizard who managed to do a impeccably well produced and photographed film with a budget of 200,000. It is not only one of its amazing achievements. The casting is excellent, with outstanding performances by Rossana Arquette --finally back after the damage Harvey Weinstein inflicted on her career-- and Jay Devore. Originally written by Heller, it is a sophisticated and frantic romantic comedy shot in New York and Los Angeles. Refreshing and fun!","user":"sonia-72775","rank":[5,13]}]
