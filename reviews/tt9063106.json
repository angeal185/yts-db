However to my dismay the characters in this movie is so bad i couldn't keep my ass laughing in some scenes . serious character flaws had reduce this movie a cheap 80's action flick.","user":"AziziOthmanMY","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"Seriously?","rating":3,"date":"16 March 2019","review":"Apparently if one is Malay, this movie is a 10. Otherwise it plays out like a 1970 TV movie. At the bowie knife fight I gave up. I cannot recommend if you are used to higher quality fare, it is clear that team Malay voted this way up... yet this is substandard otherwise.","user":"cheeftanz","rank":[36,49]},{"title":"Weak story, awesome tactical & military showcase","rating":4,"date":"18 March 2019","review":"Putting aside the main actors and their ability to act; this unique gem of a Malaysian movie stands out as one of the best to break the generic genres plaging Malaysia cinema.<br><br>The strength of this movie lies squarely on their faithful interpretation of military tactics and deployment. Which was beautifully done.<br><br>It started strong showing a glimpse of how PASKAL operates and its internal culture. However, I suppose it may be their undoing to introduce personal vendettas making it look like an 80's B rate action movie that would make Jan Micheal Vincent blush. That is the weak link in this movie and killed off a great momentum.","user":"kill_the","rank":[9,13]}]
