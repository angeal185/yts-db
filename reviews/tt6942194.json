[{"title":"Ignore the haters","rating":8,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"This is obviously a low budget horror film. The only difference is that the filmmaker's actually used their budget well. They found actors who are fairly decent and the special effects actually worked quit well. The three witches were scary/ menacing and the cinematography was beautifully shot with vivid colors reminiscent of Suspiria(1977). The movie is well worth your time and money if you're a true horror fan who appreciates well shot/acted b horror films.","user":"justybear96","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"I have seen so much worse.","rating":6,"date":"18 June 2019","review":"If you want a mindless late night movie to watch, this may do it for you. Nothing new here, but enough of the scenes work for me to stay for the whole thing. Not bad :) 6/10","user":"feelinsicc","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Worth watching","rating":6,"date":"22 June 2019","review":"Ouch! Some of the reviews are brutal for this movie.<br><br>OK, so it's not going to be a classic of all time, but it is watchable.<br><br>The thing that lets it down is the lack of really suspenseful build up in some places that are quite pivotal to the story. - it tens to move predictably smoothly from one scene to the next.<br><br>Apart from that, the acting is OK and the visuals are fine.","user":"mjsreg","rank":[4,4]}]
