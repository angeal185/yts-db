[{"title":"Reading the book helps","rating":8,"date":"22 June 2019","review":"I read the novel, which is a collection of letters between the characters, when it first came out. I really enjoyed the film! It has the same feel as the book, which makes sense as the author is also the writer and director. If you haven't read the book, I can see where you may feel it is a bit jumpy.<br><br>The acting is great, Hollander is my favorite actor and I always enjoy James Caan as well. They work well together and I really enjoyed their scenes. The supporting cast is also charismatic.<br><br>The story is, again, enhanced by having read the book I think. We're looking into the lives of these characters, and the events take a realistic approach in not giving a big resolution. I feel this enforces the principle that time goes on, and nothing is ever wrapped up in a big tidy bow forever.<br><br>Overall it is a sweet film about friendship, family, love, growing old, and death. I think it teaches a few timely lessons. It's an easy way to pass a couple of hours.","user":"kne_2011","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"narrow but enjoyable","rating":7,"date":"22 May 2019","review":"Its a drama that does a take on many issues and topics. its an old american emigrating to israel, the holy land, to start a pigfarm, an illdescision in a jewish/muslim area. so he meets grat protests from a lot of religious groups and people.<br><br>at the same time his former wife who still live in newyork ,gets ill, and will die soon. they have a son whos gay, and a daughter that seems to full time student forever.<br><br>its a story about death,birth, relations, friendship, religion, cousine,rituals,traditions, politics, love, hate, and pigfarming<br><br>the technical product is nice, the score lives its own life, the acting are allover good, but what seems to me as a drawback is the fast jumping between the persons and locations. it makes it all seem so incoherent, so if your not in the mood you might leave the show pretty fast. but the playtime is perfect and the story is good so the grumpy old man can recommend a watch","user":"ops-52535","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"An interesting drama for a weekend","rating":8,"date":"26 May 2019","review":"I really liked this, I love Rosanna Arquette and she was amazing in this. It touched on many topics, relatable and believable, family, friendships, religion, age sickness and death, and I have to say this was my favorite James Caan movie in awhile. He became the character and was so believable in this it was very touching. A great movie for a weekend. Good job, loved it!","user":"babycakes-45269","rank":[5,6]}]
