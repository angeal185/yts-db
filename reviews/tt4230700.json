[{"title":"Don't believe the bad reviews","rating":11,"date":"11 September 2017","review":"This film is a drama, not so much a mystery, and it has an actual storyline, with characters who can grow and learn while dealing with life-changing decisions.<br><br>It is not boring, unless the viewer needs either a lot of exposition or explosions. Without going into spoilers, I can say that there are some seemingly implausible aspects, but nothing in the film is actually impossible to believe.<br><br>As already stated, the characters grow and change, and deal with decisions that will impact their lives, and I was pleasantly surprised with the ending, as it was unexpectedly uplifting.","user":"smoke0","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"unexpectedly enjoyable","rating":9,"date":"24 September 2017","review":"After reading so many somewhat negative reviews I hesitated even watching this film - but then, it's actually a wonderful movie. Great actors and great script too. I guess what so many people don't like is that it's not a 'plot movie' - there's none of this 'overcoming obstacles' and stuff - I for one am glad! It's slow and thoughtful. Highly recommended!","user":"keenast","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"Long Short Story","rating":3,"date":"25 September 2016","review":"Spoiler: This female quick change character artist is intriguing but the story becomes quickly stale and boring, as The story dissolves like a snowman as the plot rambles on. Spoiler: Like a bird in flight never landing. The story plot offers a talented person, who returns to earlier romance, fifteen years after walking away. Then, finding no (surprise) warm enchanted welcome from her previous significant other, leaves again. The conclusion comes as the girl prepares to leave after wallowing around explaining her past and revealing her present living and working situation.<br><br>Really? This would make a terrific short story, a quick character study then again, who cares?","user":"drhall-672-138129","rank":[30,42]}]
