[{"title":"Film is highly recommended to watch with the whole family!","rating":9,"date":"16 April 2018","review":"Awesome cartoon! Suddenly it was pretty funny. The humor fits well into the narrative and those 80 minutes that lasts the \"Snow Queen 3\" for small viewers and their parents pass very quickly. \nAnd now a few details:\nAnimation is great. Exactly the same as seen in the first two parts. Interesting songs exactly the final one.<br><br>The characters are the same, but a little older. Heroes involuntarily cling to a history in search of simple family happiness where they have to cope even with the evil from the outside, rather than with their own vices and fears.\n Children watch the cartoon with undisguised interest and quite sincerely empathize with the heroes. Gerda and her new friend Roland acquire new super powers of fire and ice that change heroes from inside. Confrontation of two desires to become strong or remain kind. What will the children choose: good or strength - we learn only in the final! \nThe third part of the \"Snow Queen\" unlike the previous two surprised a beautiful, truly happy ending which I know, will appeal to many viewers. With this the whole trilogy \"Snow Queen\" is perceived as a single, conscious and complete work. I recommend it for both adults and children! Looking forward the Snow Queen 4!","user":"lynn_melanie","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"I really enjoyed the movie and I wish you to enjoy it too!","rating":8,"date":"24 January 2017","review":"The Snow Queen sequel even exceeded all my expectations! I think that the third movie is much better than the second one. After the spin- off about Orm, it was great to see Gerda as a protagonist again – it was especially nice to see how much her looks have changed. She has noticeably grown up and is truly about to rank among Disney's gorgeous princesses. As for the screenplay, Robert Lence was involved in the process of its creation – he is a real master of the American animation and he has worked on dozens of large projects. The results of this collaboration are easy to see: the movie has acquired a good pace and the alternation of lyrical pauses and breath-taking action is done really well – you will surely neither get bored with nor get tired of the movie! The authors tried to tell us how valuable one's family is and that the most important thing in life is having someone to be there for you when your life gets hard. The movie also says that you should never just throw people out of your life and it is never too late to say sorry. The animated movie has plenty of complicated scenes with various visual and sound effects. You can see avalanches going down the mountains, explosions, volcano eruptions, lava leaking through all the cracks, multicolored magic bursts, an armored train of the purest ice, a ship put on skis. Quite a lot of views worth seeing! I really enjoyed the movie and I wish you to enjoy it too!","user":"terletsin","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"Deserve your attention","rating":9,"date":"6 April 2018","review":"With Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice Wizart Animation joins Disney Studios in rejecting scenario, where love saves the day. Gerda and Kai come from a tale by Hans Christian Andersen and the action takes place in the land of the trolls. Wizart Animation aims for the international market and Snow Queen 3 was released in many countries included Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. The film delivers what might be called universal messages. Furthermore, Snow Queen 3 is fully in line with the Disney wholesomeness approach to filmmaking. This film does have its merits! It is strikingly beautiful. The Snow Queen is made in 3-D and it is gorgeous. The fire scenes are especially effective. Rollan with his burning hair and glowing suit is striking, as is Lake Gao, the forbidden lake of fire which Gerda and Rollan must cross. The fire-tossing scenes are vivid as are the scenes where Gerda makes ice formations. Film is highly recommended to watch with the whole family! Everybody finds something interesting in it!","user":"bobby-maddox","rank":[9,10]}]
