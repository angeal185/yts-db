Well Mr. Wallen, you have arrived!! I saw Agramon's Gate yesterday and Abstruse the night before and both are excellent high end independent films with a ton of awards and nominations yet there are clowns voting them a 1.. I bet their mothers are very proud of them and the rude, insensitive and mean comments on someone's hard work.. but congrats to you, I'm home for two weeks and plan on watching all your movies!","user":"callumparker12-639-571085","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Indie feels like more like a studio film","rating":10,"date":"18 February 2020","review":"I see some people spewing and it's really sad, don't they have anything better to do? This movie has a ton of awards and nominations and a bunch of critics giving it accolades but the basement dwellers are hating lol makes you wonder if they're actors not cast or jealous filmmakers.. kudos on a really good story and acting!!","user":"sjuingloi90","rank":[7,12]}]
