[{"title":"I have CF - here's my opinion","rating":8,"date":"19 March 2019","review":"I'm a 35 year old with CF. I was excited about this movie because any representation is potentially great. But I've seen other CF movies, seen it on TV, and it's usually terribly done. Incorrect nonsense, people are on o2 but climbing hills like it's no big deal, the severity isn't properly shown, etc.<br><br>This movie manages to mostly stay away from that. Is it 100% accurate? Of course not. It's still a Hollywood film. It's not a documentary. That being said, this does a better job than any other CF fiction I've ever seen. It includes a lot of the real things that CFers deal with: all our therapies, nebs, vesting, the ports, the G tubes, the o2, surgeries, the isolation, the survivor's guilt, and many others.<br><br>A lot of people in the CF community have been up in arms about two CFers getting together despite the bacteria concerns. While I understand the hesitation, I personally know four couples where both spouses had/have CF (had because some have died). We need to look at this as a real situation because it is. There's a lot of isolation in CF, and reaching out to the only people on the planet who can truly understand you is only natural. As long as both people are consenting adults, know the risks, and go for it anyway, we need to respect that.<br><br>I appreciate that this movie tackles both the reality of CF and the controversial subject of CFers breaking the six foot rule. This is a very real film, and not once did I feel offended or roll my eyes. Not 100% accurate, no, but I feel seen. I feel represented. Absolutely worth seeing, and i look forward to seeing it again.","user":"emilymarshmallows","rank":[746,769]},{"title":"Five Feet Apart, but close to my heart","rating":10,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"A wonderfully written story, played by such talented actors. The little details that make it just that little bit more intense. The right expressions that make it just that little bit more touching. The right words that make just that much of a difference. I held my breath through the whole movie, waiting for it to go wrong. I felt so immersed in the characters, and their stories. Their pain, their longing, their restrictions, they hit me right in the heart. And if that isn't a sign of a good, emotional movie, I don't know what is.","user":"twisty-25251","rank":[26,27]},{"title":"it made me cry","rating":8,"date":"11 July 2019","review":"I loved this movie. The story is very beautiful. It gives you hope of life and takes it from you. the Romance in this film is beautiful. My eyes did not bleed because of a film a while ago","user":"thabitalfadhli","rank":[14,14]}]
