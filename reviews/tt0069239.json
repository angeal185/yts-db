[{"title":"Stars comments on the comments","rating":2,"date":"2 April 2006","review":"Hi everyone, I'm Jan White and I starred in this little opus 35 years ago. Just want to comment on a few of your comments and add a little info that I know.<br><br>1. I am not sure if that was Marilyn Eastman because I don't think I ever knew full names of two of these gals playing cards.<br><br>2. I wish I too knew what happened to Joedda she was a lovely girl.<br><br>3. The Title of \"Season of the Witch\" was given to \"Jacks Wife\" aka \"Hungary Wives\" because of the featured Donovan song in the film. Not to compete with \"Halloween.\" My film came out first with the name, I remember when I heard the subtitle of \"Halloween\" I couldn't believe they would use the same name as my film.<br><br>4. I am not a teckie, so don't know all the technical things your talking about. I did lend Anchor Bay the 16 mm print I have of the original release of \"Hungary Wives\" which was the first release of the film and it is 98 minutes long. I have never seen a longer version and to my knowledge it does not exist. This DVD release is longer I believe, because they took a few clips they found and patched them in.","user":"janinawht","rank":[109,113]},{"title":"Interesting failure from Romero","rating":18,"date":"18 June 2000","review":"Despite the fact that this film is by George Romero and it's sold as a horror film, _Season of the Witch_ (aka _Jack's Wife_ which is, in my opinion, the better title) isn't really a horror film.<br><br>Or, at the very least, it isn't a *straightforward* horror film and anyone going into this expecting Romero's typical gore and suspense will definitely be disappointed.  The closest the film comes to typical horror are some wonderfully eerie sequences involving a man in a grotesque satanic-looking rubber mask (exploitatively depicted on some of the older videocassette sleeve covers for the film) trying to break into the main character's house.<br><br>What this film amounts to is the story of one woman who finds herself dissatisfied with the daily plod of her existence as a respectable wife in a respectable suburb.  She feels herself aging.  She's secretly bitter toward her husband and her friends.  It's never really clear what she wants exactly because she doesn't seem to know herself, but she does become intrigued by a woman in the neighborhood who claims to a witch.  She meets with this woman and, though she's afraid of black magic, she's inspired to explore it on her own.  She goes out and buys a book on the subject and some witchcraft paraphernalia and then begins casting spells from her kitchen.<br><br>Despite the non-gory subject matter, there are some things in this film that bear the distinctive signature of Romero and his influences.  There's a keen visual wit on display, particularly in some scenes involving mirrors. There are some odd hallucinatory dream sequences here that come straight from the more supernatural side of Italian horror (particularly the opening scene). Many of the scenes are ramshackle and crudely staged, but not in an altogether bad way.  Rather, they almost recall a documentary.  There's genuine tension (but not \"horror film\" tension).  You don't know where scenes are going to go or what the characters are going to do or say next. You never really get inside many of the characters, but they're offbeat and watchable (particularly the young student-teacher, who's into drugs, casual sex, and some pretentious post-late 60's philosophy).<br><br>Not everything in this film works.  It's badly edited.  Much of the acting is weak.  However, the film does have an intriguing, almost New Wave, experimental-like cadence.  It's rough and full of jagged edges, but, in that respect, it's really no worse than Jean Luc-Godard at his most indulgent.  Even more so than _Martin_, this is Romero's \"art film\".  If it were a piece of music instead of a movie it would be slow, discordant and lo-fi.<br><br>This is recommended for all Romero admirers to see at least once.","user":"oliverkneale","rank":[25,27]},{"title":"Excellent","rating":10,"date":"22 December 2014","review":"I just re-watched Season of The Witch. I hadn't watched it in years. I found I had the time to analyze it 100%. Jan White playing Joan Mitchell (the lead), was too pretty and young for the role...but it worked. Why? Because her husband married her and put her on a shelf...as perhaps a trophy wife. Joan's friends are WAY too old for her. It seemed they bordered on being senior citizens, whereas Joan wasn't. No wonder she was bored. Her husband hardly paid attention to her and she had to fit in with women decades older.<br><br>Joan has a 20-ish year old daughter, Nikki, and she makes an appearance and you never see her again. We get an all too brief glimpse of the kind of dynamic they have. Nikki's friend and TA, Gregg, takes a liking to the older Joan. Joan and Gregg have a small affair. He kept referring her to Mrs. Robinson in the Graduate. You could actually feel Joan's angst in the whole film. Being bored and frustrated, the viewer hopes that she has the affair with the younger Gregg. There is an unkind scene where Gregg teases one of Joan's friends. Jan White is such a good actress you can feel her anger toward Gregg in this scene. Again, in praise of Jan White, you can see how comfortable she is with Gregg. I felt that if she ended up with Gregg, he could fulfill her. I thought she would kill him for making her have feelings of unbridled sexuality.<br><br>It takes Gregg to make Joan realize how unhappily married she is. I won't give away the ending. But, the film is a great character study. We see Joan coming apart in front of our very eyes. The witchcraft thing is secondary. The poor woman is fighting for her sanity and self esteem. Director George Romero is genius at letting the viewer FEEL. Someone said it was slow paced. YEAH...but we get to feel what Joan is feeling. That's the beauty of it. It's not a horror film!! Great movie making on the part of Jan White and George Romero. It worked for me. I think a lot of reviewers expected Night of the Living Dead results. It isn't that kind of film. More of a thinking person's study. I'm so amazed. Kudos.","user":"backbaybos","rank":[9,9]}]
