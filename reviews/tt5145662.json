I wasn't really a fan of the special effects, You could tell what was real and what were special effects. This Movie was only Meant to entertain rather than educate<br><br>I like that this Movie promotes teamwork, and standing up for others and covers bullying. I really liked the lighting and scenery, I think the music went well with the scenes. Most of the time the acting was good.<br><br>I liked the storyline but I think it could have been a little better if there was some changes to the script as there were many slow, low-energy conversational scenes that were a bit boring.","user":"ChrisLFinch","rank":[2,8]}]
