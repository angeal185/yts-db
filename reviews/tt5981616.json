A subjective interpretation of existence, life and death in a prepetual motion, repeating themselves one after the other culminates down to the one moment. The moment of realization. The film captures the struggle of a young writer, an addict, trying to escape by searching for his mother in a far away place.","user":"mohd_ali_1","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Beautifully done.
