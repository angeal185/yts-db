A majority of the film takes place inside a church confessional. At first, I was concerned about whether or not I would enjoy the movie because of this lack of changing scenery. However, it's very character-driven. The dialogue offers different perspectives on some prejudice commonly directed at Catholicism. The film could be difficult to appreciate if you can not empathize or relate to any one of the characters or what they're going through.","user":"zachmirer","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Something to make you think","rating":7,"date":"26 January 2020","review":"The movie has a calm, but very enjoyable pace. Nemrow is brilliant and manages to pass to the viewer a wide range of emotions. He makes us think and entertain us at the same time.\nThe dialogue between the two priests is a real highlight and something I will remember for a long time.<br><br>Very enjoyable","user":"pietro1605","rank":[2,2]}]
