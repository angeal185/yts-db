[{"title":"So refreshing","rating":10,"date":"18 June 2019","review":"It was nice to see a movie that didn't have a social or political agenda behind it and didn't pander to people who are easily offended. This movie showed that not everyone likes being a sensitive soft person. I really hope that movies can continue to break boundaries like this because it's a refreshment of our ability to enjoy humour without taking it personally. Plot was awesome and solid and the humour made it unbelievably enjoyable.","user":"lefteri-38218","rank":[374,557]},{"title":"Politically-Incorrect Fun","rating":7,"date":"27 June 2019","review":"While watching this film, one might constantly wonder \"How did a film like this get made in 2019?\" Shaft is a wildly politically-incorrect film. It feels like a mediocre 1980s action comedy, but it is almost always fun to watch. Jessie T. Usher struggles to compete with Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Roundtree, which makes the film uneven. Jackson breaks no new ground with his performance, but he is a consistent delight to watch.","user":"sme3","rank":[161,245]},{"title":"Refreshingly unapologetic!","rating":7,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"Nice to see a film without an agenda to push. Shaft was entertaining from start to finish. Good action, good comedic timing, and Samuel L Jackson is awesome (as usual). If you are one of those modern day sensitive snowflakes, this film might not be for you though.","user":"ryangale-13474","rank":[56,82]}]
