[{"title":"Well made, but so boring.","rating":5,"date":"21 May 2016","review":"I will never give up on a film, within reason, but there were times during this that I either wanted to fall asleep, or just switch off. I wanted to see it, purely because it had Fiona O'Shaughnessy, a girl who's quickly become one of my favourite actresses, hugely talented, and that voice, she is fantastic, but even she couldn't inject the spark that failed to light this film. <br><br>A film that crosses over so many different genres, it's attempting to be avant garde, psychological, black humoured, it does bits of each, but isn't particularly strong in any. The music was great throughout, acting spot on, maybe it was the direction, just a bit slow.<br><br>This should have been awesome. 5/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"NIna For..........never.","rating":6,"date":"19 May 2016","review":"I felt that this was an interesting premise and I really enjoyed the first half hour of the film. However I have to admit that ultimately by the end I was left with an overall feeling of disappointment and missed opportunity.<br><br>The overall highlights were the scenes between the main character Rob, Cian Barry, and Nina's parents. Nina's first appearance is also striking but I felt the scene itself was too rushed and the build up and gradual indications that Nina was in the background could have been handled with greater subtly which would have created more tension. However after this excitable rush to reveal Nina the second half of the film drags so there are definitive issue with the pacing of the film.<br><br>In some instances the casting was also far from ideal. The actress who played Holly, Abigail Hardingham, was a very natural and engaging presence, hanging on in there with the relationship despite all of the bizarre difficulties because she wanted to appear \"dark\" and not \"vanilla\" and to be committed to her first real boyfriend (although in reality the actress is too pretty to have been \"left on the shelf\"). However Holly is given no back story and due to the underwriting of her character we become increasingly frustrated that the motivations of Holly become blurred in the second half of the film as her love for her rather dull boyfriend starts to become diluted.<br><br>There are two serious problems with the film. The first is the casting of Fiona O'Shaugnessy as Nina herself. The character as written and acted is a highly un-haunting presence. Nina as portrayed in the film is lacking in charm, beauty or personality. Her mocking baby like voice is so irritating that you'd have probably been glad to see the back of her not be so haunted by her to the extent that you couldn't move on from her!! Not to be ungallant but Ms Shaughnessy is also much too old to be playing the fantasy girlfriend role – more suited to the bitter divorcée! -and this unbalances the whole film.<br><br>The last half hour was a bit of a drag and the other serious problem, the \"twist\" ending of switching over the \"curse of Nina \" to Holly, was silly and felt tagged on. The Writer/Directors., the Blaine Brothers, should have had the conviction to retain faith in the subtext of people being unable to move on from a relationship.<br><br>If we had a much sweeter and charming Nina and a more grown up conclusion ( perhaps along the lines of Morettoi/Grimaldi's \"Quiet Chaos\" ) in which eventually Nina disappeared because the main character was able to finally move on we would have had a poignant conclusion and a more consistent tone to add to the humour and interesting premises. Instead the filmmakers resorted to immature gimmicky that betrayed the original theme of the film.<br><br>So maybe next time gentlemen make a film that has the conviction to respect people's intelligence rather than assuming film goers need juvenile sarcasm and a twist ending?","user":"kboote","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"A multi-layered psychological drama...","rating":9,"date":"30 October 2015","review":"...with a bit of Rom-Com/Horror thrown in for good measure.<br><br>We all bring baggage into a new relationship - this film makes the invisible visible and takes you on an enjoyable journey through the process of 'letting go': grief, loss, flights of fantasy, darkness, obsession. It's a haunting story of the impact we have on each other, regardless of whether we acknowledge or even see it happening.<br><br>Some people are attracted to the Horror elements (i.e. the blood) but don't be put off by that if you're not a Horror fan. I'm not. And the level of gore is appropriate for the telling of this story: being haunted by an ex- who appears in bed with you and your new partner every time you attempt to have sex.<br><br>Nina Forever will make you feel, but then it will make you think. Must see!","user":"ben-1251","rank":[35,57]}]
