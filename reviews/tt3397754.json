[{"title":"A captivating story","rating":22,"date":"22 August 2015","review":"This film tells the story of three parents, and their four teenage children who live chaotic lives in New York.<br><br>I didn't think I would like \"Ten Thousand Saints\" at first because their world is so different from mine. The father, played by Ethan Hawke, is an irresponsible parent beyond imagination. He even shares illegal drugs with his son, which is really beyond me. Yet, soon afterwards the characters grow on me and I care much about their well-being and happiness. Hailee Steinfeld's character as a pregnant teenager really stands out, the things she has to go through is tough even for an adult. The scene that she confides that she does not remember what Teddy looks like is quite breathtaking.<br><br>\"Ten Thousand Saints\" has great character development, and an captivating story to go with it. I certainly hope there will be a happy ending for the children in the untold future.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[20,28]},{"title":"Very Good Movie","rating":8,"date":"17 September 2016","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, yes pretty much everyone in it is screwed up but it's also very realistic. Their depiction of bored boys in Vermont in the 1980s is dead on. What happens after is very interesting with the East Village, CBGBs and the relationships and how they progress. I recommend this movie and had no problem \"figuring out\" who was adopted etc. Then again, I like movies that don't spoon feed everything. <br><br>I'm suppose to write 10 lines of text but don't want to include any spoilers. All the actors did a great job, especially Ethan Hawke and I love seeing Julianne Nicholson again in a movie. She is such a natural actress. I wasn't big on the actress who played the rich New York mother, however.","user":"sarahames","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"I like the story and the punk rock influences behind it.","rating":7,"date":"16 August 2015","review":"Can't help but to love a movie that reminds me of old school New York. Was it really that great? That's how I remember it to be. Than again, I'm not old enough to have struggled on those streets, Squatting in houses and being semi homeless for my art, which the movie glorifies. <br><br>They did a pretty good job at recreating late 1980s NYC with tight shoots to leave out how alphabet city has change and to keep how it stayed the same, using Super composites of CBGBs, old trains and even phone booths, plus old shots of world trade. It's cool that technology allows us to do that now.<br><br>The movie's focus on that time period sometimes feels force with one liners explaining how that moment of the late 80s was about to spawn what that neighborhood next to Thompson Square park is now.<br><br>I thought it was interesting that the actual band, Army of One is showcased in the movie, though not the center focus of the movie, it's about their tour Guitar player Jude and his life, based on a book that I did not read. <br><br>Ethan Hawke as Jude's dad Les was charming and funny <br><br>It's a hardcore punk version of Juno in a lot of ways, but all together a coming-of-age story with a lot of layers to it as it Centers around Jude and his friendships with other kids. It was a great ensemble cast. <br><br>Definitely worth checking out.","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[16,22]}]
