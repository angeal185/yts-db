[{"title":"embarrassingly bad","rating":1,"date":"28 February 2015","review":"Every cliché in the first 15 minutes just awful. Even a bad movie can be watchable if the characters are at least believable.the long haired ninja cop finished this piece of garbage for me.I have to blame the director I suppose.....the acting was straight out of B movie school....laughable. It's a shame really as the story line could have worked out and it could have been a reasonably good action type movie but alas too much wrong from the beginning.....back to school on this one folks......... Maybe on a cold rainy night with absolutely no choice, but there again...........maybe not..a good book and a large scotch would be better.","user":"alexralston-37082","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Terrible:Vida Guerra Gets Wasted In This Mess","rating":2,"date":"11 March 2015","review":"this is such a terrible film from start to finish i feel bad for all the actors involved in this and what was John Morrison doing here he should get back to wrestling acting is not his game.<br><br>the story is hilarious it is the same old one man show with a new angle every time now in this film a good cop goes against entire corrupt police force by himself.<br><br>cheap cgi stunts bad music and lousy performances by everyone hey is there even a script for this may i ask who wrote this and how is this movie allowed to be released this is pure torture on the audience even the lead hero is just muscles and no brain.<br><br>when i checked this out i usually like some b movies but this is a x or z grade film to be honest i never cared for the cast but i got mad when i saw Vida Guerra she was playing a role of a cop for those of you who don't know who she is i suggest you look her up online she is a talented model and actress why did she even signed this nonsense.<br><br>hey those you-tube fan made films are better then this any day calling this a film is a insult the final climax is so laughable i mean the whole rocket launcher thing on blowing up just one bad guy wow they went too far.<br><br>this film is mockery of each and every single police worker out there in the entire world just what were these makers thinking have they totally lost it.<br><br>American Justice 2015 has failure written allover it what a shame hey you want real American justice good film with epic American action heroes try bad boys 1,2 those are classics i tell you by the way i am not even American but stay away from this my rating is 2/10.avoid it","user":"FilmMan47","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Total garbage!","rating":1,"date":"1 January 2016","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I can recall watching. Poor acting, cliché script lines, and background music at complete odds with what was happening in the movie. The script is so predictable that there isn't a single moment of suspense. Even the lines delivered by the actors were poorly delivered and the scowls on the face were contrived. There have been other movies that follow this plot line and some were dramatic and exciting, but not this one. At no time was I ever \"pulled into\" the story and wishing for characters to succeed, or anything else. This looks like something a high school class drama class would put together, and I'm sure they wold do a better job. If you're after rubbish non-thinking garbage to watch then you may enjoy this, but if you're after a movie that is truly entertaining skip this movie altogether. Life is too short to have to suffer through this crap.","user":"watchmanz-22199","rank":[2,2]}]
