[{"title":"Kurt is Santa","rating":9,"date":"22 November 2018","review":"My new favorite Christmas movie! I have lived to the perfect age, long enough to see Kurt Russell protray Santa and he is perhaps the best, most endearing, Santa I have seen in many a moon. Both my son and myself hope that Netflix will make this an annual event and perhaps a series of Santa movies with Mr. Russell!","user":"belendakay","rank":[414,438]},{"title":"Oh no ho!","rating":9,"date":"22 November 2018","review":"Excellent fun!

Anyone not liking this is definitely on the naughty list!<br><br>Kurt Russell probably had more fun with this movie than anything else he has ever done.<br><br>Going to be a Christmas classic...you'll see.","user":"stanforddjkl","rank":[259,283]},{"title":"The Ending Scenes Will Warm Your Heart","rating":10,"date":"22 November 2018","review":"This was a truely great film, and Netflix outdid themselves. The story is well written, the jokes are funny, the elves are cute, and Kurt Russell as Santa Claus is an amazing fit. Mrs. Claus was the best surprise! Everyone in our family, from aged 3 to 65, enjoyed watching on Thanksgiving morning.","user":"dwebster83","rank":[281,313]}]
