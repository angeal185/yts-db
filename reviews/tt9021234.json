[{"title":"Don't fall for it.","rating":4,"date":"26 May 2019","review":"It's lifetime / oxygen channel (esque) with a really thin western wrapper around it.\nIt's not a totally horrible movie. They're just spinning it as something it's not. And that's a LIE.<br><br>It doesn't rate me spending more time typing about it.","user":"decaturskid","rank":[27,45]},{"title":"need more movies like this!","rating":10,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"I have no children in my home and I am not an old lady but I am sick of the dirt in most of entertainment today. From the profanity to the push of the liberal agenda - it makes me ignore most movies and television shows. This is why INSP is such a great network. This movie is not only entertaining but keeps it clean and political free. This world needs more of this!","user":"karlemaye","rank":[11,16]},{"title":"five miles of family adventure","rating":8,"date":"27 May 2019","review":"This one is definitely worth the watch , I enjoyed the story line and the actors done an excellent job in their roles to bring this story to life , worthy of the cowboy movies of yesteryear ,Adam Baldwin was an excellent choice for the shooter green , I thoroughly recommend this movie","user":"paulinelongford","rank":[12,20]}]
