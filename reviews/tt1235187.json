[{"title":"A story that was screaming to be told","rating":10,"date":"22 January 2019","review":"Agreed there are a plethora of riveting stories crying to be told about this period that should always be part of our memories and awareness as a generation of Holocaust and camp surivors leaves us. This is the first time I've seen anything address the struggles and experiences of bi-racial children in Germany at this time.<br><br>Theirs was a struggle to belong and reconcile their German identity with the atrocties in their personal and social world.<br><br>Stories like these are few and far between and when one see the ridiculous scores some have given this film it is no wonder. I agree with other reviewers that 'Sadly, I suspect this very departure from \"the norm\" is why this film is being unfairly downvoted'.<br><br>In a nutshell, there were many groups targeted under Nazi rule...we simply don't hear about them, short of some peripheral mention. And their attitudes and struggle for identity is worthy of understanding. I also commend Amana Asante for daring to tell this story, because within the black community (and others I'm sure) the backlash to this film has been fierce, which is precisely why we need more films like these that shatter the status quo. We are applauding you Amana and all of the wonderful team who worked on and acted in this quality film.","user":"skpn123","rank":[39,60]},{"title":"Well I enjoyed it anyway.","rating":8,"date":"22 January 2019","review":"Why it has such a low score I do not know, I found it rivetting and very sad in parts to watch, but would say to anyone watch it, you will not be disappointed.","user":"finesherry","rank":[34,53]},{"title":"An Eye Opener","rating":10,"date":"2 February 2019","review":"An absolute brilliant movie that moved my soul!! It shows love knows no color, creed or belief. We were formed as humans to love and fight and know no limits be it good or evil. The painful moments in this film is my eye opener to the fact that the world was and is still is an extremely cruel place. How are we suppose to belong .....???","user":"arnoldarrons","rank":[32,50]}]
