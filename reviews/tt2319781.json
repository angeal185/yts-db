[{"title":"Great story line","rating":10,"date":"18 January 2013","review":"My Family really enjoyed this short film. The film is about 20 minutes long. I showed it to some of my friends and they also thought the film was very good. The story line was really interesting, it has the making of a very successful film. Great Plot for a New Horror Film. The story line could also be success as TV series. I myself really enjoy American Horror Story, this story could easily be written to compare itself to American Horror Story. the plot of the story comes from a real location in south Jersey. Being form Jersey and having read about the myth about the Jersey Devil and were it's from. Makes the story for me more interesting. With all the different horror films and TV shows, this one could reach the top because its story is from a real place in Jersey.Two thumbs up!","user":"haley828","rank":[6,13]},{"title":"Little lake of terrors","rating":4,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"\"Blue Hole\" is an American 12-minute live action short film from 2012, so already over five years old and this one was written, directed and produced by Erik Gardner, maybe his most known work to date, also thanks to the awards recognition it received. The formula is pretty simple here. It's basically several very short films put in one. A couple is near or inside a remote cabin, one of them ends up getting killed and the other in their grief and loneliness are possessed by the evil spirit of a nearby lake that has them sacrifice somebody else in their hopes to get back the loved one. Of course there is no hope. Oh well, I think the loved one returns and kills the former partner too? I am not sure actually. But the scene when the first male character is caught implies it. All in all, I cannot deny it gets a bit repetitive quickly, despite being such a short film only. That's why overall I have to give it a thhumbs-down. It's not even worth seeing for fans of Kris Kristofferson as his son plays probably the least significant character of the entire film towards the end, clearly included only for his (father's) name in the cast here. I would say the acting gets better the longer the film goes whhile the writing gets worse. Watch something else instead.","user":"Horst_In_Translation","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"don't waste 12 minutes of your time!","rating":1,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"Very bad movie. 12 minutes of nonsense.
