[{"title":"Great","rating":10,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[42,45]},{"title":"A blockbuster how it was meant to be","rating":10,"date":"6 December 2004","review":"Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.<br><br>Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is. <br><br>Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend. <br><br>It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?","user":"belzebuebchen","rank":[209,276]},{"title":"My favorite movie of all time!","rating":10,"date":"19 August 2018","review":"This movie has everything: action, a good cast, humor, a wonderful soundtrack (John Williams) a good pace and a good script.
