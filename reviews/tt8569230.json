[{"title":"Squandered Opportunity","rating":7,"date":"3 October 2019","review":"This video consists of two distinct narratives ... blended into a single documentary. One is comprised of interviews with some of the biggest names in the Whole Foods Plant Based movement (T Colin Campbell, Caldwell Esselstyn Jr, Thomas M Campbell and Michael Greger) on the benefits of such a diet ... while the other features a wonderful whole foods cooking demonstration/instruction by narrator and director Craig McMahon.<br><br>It's an ambitious undertaking ... all told the video is over four hours long ... but there is a huge problem. The doc bounces between interviews and cooking so much it becomes distracting and even annoying. It's like trying to have a serious conversation with someone that keeps changing the subject. This is disappointing because both narratives had great potential.<br><br>I wish McMahon could have foreseen this unfortunate synergy and in turn released both halves individually ... as compatriots ... in the same package ... because this would have been really instructive and beneficial.<br><br>More so, had this documentary been available on DVD this would not be a problem as DVDs have chapters while the Amazon Prime viewing app on Roku does not ... which means you are constantly fast forwarding.<br><br>In the end the interviews are OK ... but it's the cooking demos that make this worth enduring a little frustration. Sorry Craig ... please consider a redo.","user":"chrissso","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Great documentary!","rating":10,"date":"30 June 2019","review":"A lot of people seem to hate this documentary just on the basis of it being about whole plant based eating without oil. Whatever, I enjoyed watching it. Lots of cooking videos. Very helpful for those who want to transition to a vegan lifestyle and how to cook whole plant based foods.","user":"johnzocco","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Long but fruitful","rating":10,"date":"6 September 2019","review":"You pay a lot of money to go on a weekend retreat that teaches lifestyle cooking with prominent lectures. I watched this for FREE on Prime Video. Lots of cooking demos that deconstructs complicated recipes that meat eaters enjoy into simple, healthy, inexpensive meals. Loved that they got THE prominent, credentialed, decades of experience, rockstars of medical research and medical practitioners to explain the science and outcomes from Cornell University, etc of the 40 plus years of the China Study and scores of the most recent research. Yes, probably newbies should look at Forks Over Knives or Diet Fiction or the soon-to-be-released Game Changers first. THIS is practical and informative and the cooking demos are fabulous. I watched in four sittings.","user":"ebainink","rank":[4,5]}]
