[{"title":"Horror anthology in Hong-Kong style","rating":7,"date":"10 December 2017","review":"Always Be with You directed by Herman Yau is a interesting horror anthology from Hong Kong that require you to really know about Asian culture to fully appreciate or else it will come out really weird.The movie is well shot and the acting is good but i'm afraid the horror element is not as strong as you may though.There some creepy moment here and there but the strongest point of the movie is the drama between characters.","user":"phanthinga","rank":[1,8]}]
