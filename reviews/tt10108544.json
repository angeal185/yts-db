[{"title":"Great Story","rating":8,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"I don't watch movies more than once these days, but I'm definitely going to watch this one again. I'd read the screenplay! I appreciate the depth in this love story. It's definitely a fluffy romance, but it is also a film about navigating through other issues in life - issues people get stuck in all the time. Career. Family hurt. Past relationship hurts. Corine's biggest issue was not believing that she can live the life she wants. Simple story, yet profound. I'm grateful for this story. Such a realistic portrayal of relationships. Either the editing or the two lead characters' acting skills were a bit off, but it didnt ruin the story. They still did a good job, but I was crying more than they did on film. The script was so good! The supporting actors were phenomenal! Yvette Randall Brown? The best friend dude/new father - love him! Love all the wedding scenes. Very diverse. Realistic. Bring back the creative crew and make another movie. Make sure to advertise with \"from the folks who brought you \"Always a Bridesmaid\" comes a story...\" so I actually watch it. So happy I lucked upon this film today.","user":"taraanders-76509","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Pleasant surprise for a first time screenwriter!","rating":9,"date":"29 September 2019","review":"Yvette Nicole Brown wrote this movie, and she did a fantastic job! The cast was beautiful, the acting suberb, and the subject matter was deep! We often get in the way of love by being defensive, guarded, and we end up self sabotaging. We need to relax...that's why it's called FALLING in love. Yvette, I hope you end up writing more movies, we more content like this. Props to you, lady :)","user":"luckypenny-53236","rank":[8,21]},{"title":"Typical","rating":4,"date":"21 March 2020","review":"A average typical black low budget film honestly they turned my man from black lightning into a simp she said no charge her don't beg her to marry u plus y all these movies got to make these over the hill women act trashy by twerking and sticking their tounges out sad alqays have to make black men into Simps","user":"bearsdown-63388","rank":[1,2]}]
