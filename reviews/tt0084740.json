[{"title":"Why a Spaniard liked this outstanding film.","rating":10,"date":"16 October 2002","review":"After \"The Spirit of the Beehive\" Erice retakes post-civil war Spain through the eyes of a child (and later a teenager in this case). Not only the director recreates admirably the atmosphere of those gloomy years in my country, but also succeeds in showing the relationship between a bitter, low-spirited father and his vital daughter. Wonderful cinematography and sets also contribute to create a masterwork in which every camera move, every dialogue line and every fade constitute a brilliant piece of its own. An absolute must for all cinema lovers.","user":"jsorribe","rank":[23,24]},{"title":"A rare little gem","rating":9,"date":"30 November 2000","review":"Victor Erice's little masterpiece earned itself a permanent place in the repertoire of Spanish film-making. Not surprisingly: Franco was dead and Spain had bravely struggled out of a difficult transition to form a now much-respected democratic and modern nation. If art - whether literature or cinema - is to reflect that important step in a country's advance, perhaps \"El Sur\" (The South) is one of the four or five Spanish films of the last twenty five years which best marked that change. <br><br>Beautifully filmed in natural lighting, even in the interior of an old rural house (Ezcaray, La Rioja), the deep feelings transmitted between daughter and father reveal a delicacy so often missing in more banal entertainment. Young Sonsoles Aranguren and Icíar Bollaín play delicious roles which swing rather uncertainly from late adolescence to young womanhood as the daughter who attempts to fathom out her father (and in so doing, herself) with an extraordinarily powerful performance which obliges the intelligent viewer into the film. And Omero Antonutti plays the exact counterpart, carefully balancing his role such that he never overshadows his \"daughter's\" interpretation. The scenes and dialogues are enchanting, never over-acted or otherwise exaggerated; at all moments Erice maintains full control over the film's development, giving just enough touch of exquisiteness and sensitivity, allowing the film to move unhurriedly through simple but moving scenes to the predictable outcome. <br><br>Here indeed is moving theatre-cinema: the understanding spectator will leave with a certain mixture of feelings if he knows a little of Spain and its people; he will not leave unmoved, cold.","user":"khatcher-2","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"most beautiful movie I've ever seen","rating":10,"date":"2 May 2003","review":"It must be almost twenty years since I saw this movie (and I saw it only once, when I was in Japan), but the memory of this movie remains in me like an old haunting dream from childhood.  Cinematography at its best.  I think, for the first time, this film made me think that the best media for poetry is not words, but vision.<br><br>I would want to recommend this to anyone who loves \"Spirit of the Beehive\" and thinks it cannot be surpassed.  But alas, I don't know how you get this movie in USA with English subtitle.","user":"ay9a","rank":[23,26]}]
