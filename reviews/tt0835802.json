[{"title":"A light hearted comedy","rating":3,"date":"3 August 2018","review":"This film tells the story of a 18 year old man who falls for a woman who saved him on a beach.<br><br>It is enjoyable to see so many recognisable faces and even big names in an independent project. The family portrayed in the film is quite eccentric, and the atmosphere of the film is light hearted. I enjoyed it.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"Enjoyed","rating":7,"date":"23 July 2018","review":"My husband and I enjoyed this movie.

I'm glad I took the shot. It wasn't one of those bizarre, pretentious things, but a funny, followable story with endearing characters. I found myself laughing a lot.","user":"penniweninger","rank":[10,12]}]
