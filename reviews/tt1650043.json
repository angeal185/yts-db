[{"title":"Loved it!","rating":10,"date":"27 March 2011","review":"My 8 &amp; 9 year old kids wanted to see this movie. They've read the entire series. After seeing the low rating on IMDb, I was expecting this to be another disappointing kids movie. I have no idea why the rating is so low, this movie was hilarious. I'm a 34 year old mom and will say that this movie made me laugh harder than I have in a very long time. Don't let the low rating keep you from seeing this one! This movie will make you laugh. This movie will make your kids laugh. It's a great movie for the whole family. I thought it was better than the first wimpy kid movie and so did my kids. I am not going to spoil it for you. See it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.","user":"jamieleehardy","rank":[57,67]},{"title":"Liked it better than the first!","rating":10,"date":"30 March 2011","review":"My kids, ages 7 and 4, loved the first Diary of a Wimpy Kid movie, and couldn't wait to see this one. I really liked it too, so I was actually looking forward to this new one. I was not disappointed, and neither were my kids! It had us all laughing! As much as we liked the first one, we liked this one even more! I'm even already looking forward to seeing it again! I'm not sure why people are so hard on this movie, as it is a kids' movie...I'm not sure what they are looking for. I wasn't expecting anything huge from it, just to be entertained, which I was, and both of my kids loved it! If you are expecting an Oscar performance with a deep story line, this isn't a movie for you. However, if you want to take your kids to a funny movie that as an adult you can enjoy as well, I highly recommend this movie!","user":"janaiwalter","rank":[34,41]},{"title":"The easy to follow movie easily scores 4 out of 5 among the movies in the same league. Go to the cinemas for some laughter-packed fun!","rating":8,"date":"23 March 2011","review":"Most adults do not have a high expectation for family movies like this, isn't it? After all, they are not those movies that contend for this award or that recognition. Then again, isn't it fun to have some great family fun once in a while at a movie like this?<br><br>The \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" series is quite a big hit here in Singapore. Following the release of the first movie in this series last year, it received some criticisms on the pace and the low sense of humour but still managed to pull off a profitable $500,000 at the local ticket box office. This is indicative of its positive reception, probably owing to the vast number of readers of the illustrated novel series of the same name. As a result, Singaporeans are privileged to have \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules\" released a week ahead of its official theatrical release in view of March school holidays. <br><br>Typically, the young readers can relate to the obligatory activities and school life of Greg and friends. There must be someone in school that somewhat resembles Fregley, the queer one that often disgusts everyone. And also the puny but talkative person that cannot wait to show off what he had accomplished with his wits, just like Chirag Gupta. What about the most beautiful girl in class that everyone just can't wait to get close to? Lastly, let's not forget the die-hard BFF who does everything with you and even go through a distasteful sleepover. Even the older ones in the cinema could somewhat recall classmates who are fitting into these characters. With the talented child actors, they make these characters come to life and really lovable. There is great chemistry which makes it a joy to watch the development of the story.<br><br>This time, the movie has a pretty tight storyline and gave the audiences some really great laugh! The content is largely humorous, whether it's the quirky behaviours of the kids, the older brother Rodrick or even the Heffley parents. Comparing it to other movies in the same league, this movie stands out with better humour. One of the potential pitfalls of a family movie is having jokes that are too hard for children understand. In this case, they manage to dodge away from the potential pitfall as the jokes are pretty relatable to the children. Even the adults cannot help but to laugh at the goofiness. Enjoy some simple and good humour! One of the important factors that helped to increase the entertainment value was the 2-D sketches. They were incorporated seamlessly into the storyline and are both intriguing and eye-catching.<br><br>As suggested by the title, this movie is more focused on the brothers' relationship, a further development from the first movie of the series. Rodrick was more than an annoyance; he showed the \"older brother\" side more this time. Be it manipulating his little brother to achieve his motives, or embarrassing his little brother for his own pleasure, or even to passing on his little brother the \"good\" stuffsÂ… aren't these again, pretty relatable to everyone? Exactly, we're back to it again: relevancy of the movie is indeed the biggest selling point of the movie.<br><br>As the movie winds up, it continues to stir our interest and leads us to a less sighted side of the brothers which is dear and heart-warming to watch. Upon watching, you'll probably nod to yourself and say 'indeed, blood is thicker than water'. Despite the older brother not wanting to befriend his little brother initially, at the end of the day he is still always there for him and vice versa. With more diaries to come, this series will definitely gain greater popularity among the young readers.<br><br><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>","user":"moviexclusive","rank":[27,35]}]
