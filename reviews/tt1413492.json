[{"title":"Jarheads","rating":22,"date":"22 September 2019","review":"This film is so overrated. I don't even think Hemsworth is any good of an actor but in this case he is more ridiculous than ever every moment in this film. Also he's on screen a lot and seeing how bad he is diminishes the film.","user":"tremoncyprian","rank":[106,140]},{"title":"Don't watch this","rating":12,"date":"12 October 2019","review":"Instead I suggest you watch battle Royale II if you are interested in justice and Afghanistan. 12 Strong was 12 Stupid.","user":"larsenmarkez","rank":[89,117]},{"title":"Jingositic nonsense","rating":1,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham.","user":"johnpendarvis","rank":[179,245]}]
