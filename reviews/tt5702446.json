[{"title":"Why Does the Widow need Money??","rating":4,"date":"17 March 2019","review":"The main premise of this movie is so ridiculous that it destroys anything else good in this movie. The death benefit for a US soldier is 100K! This should have been enough to pay off the mortgage and then some. Then there are other benefits, such as widow's pension etc. So ridiculous, I couldn't even finish watching. Too bad. Good acting, nice music, all wasted.","user":"zenewiczpp","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"A faith-based movie arrives this weekend and it is worth seeing ...","rating":8,"date":"8 September 2018","review":"I was privileged to be given access to a streamed copy of this new picture due to be released tomorrow. The film focuses on a mother and daughter whose husband and father were killed in Afghanistan in 2014 - a loss which neither have dealt with as they try to continue a normal life.<br><br>But life does go on - people enter our lives, circumstances overwhelm us, and life feels like it is crashing in on us. But even in the midst of crisis God continues to offer His love - we may not see it, may even run from it, He offers His love if we will listen.<br><br>Finding God's grace in the midst of a busy life is sometimes difficult. There may be pain, waiting maybe hard, and finding Him will often require tears. Such is the case for Amber and Bree as they find God's grace in the middle life's difficulties.<br><br>If you do not yet have a movie in your sights for this week, let me suggest that you consider seeing God Bless The Broken Road. It will be worth your time.\n_____________\nThis review is based on a free screening provided by the publisher for the purpose of creating this review.

This assumption here would be totally wrong. Years ago there was a dramatic film about Vietnam Vets called \"Coming Home\" which addressed the issues facing those veterans when they came home. It was a powerful film. This one is just a little short of it in a different dramatic story line.<br><br>This film goes into the still going Afghanistan war and updates the story adding a crisis of faith to it. This plot addresses the crisis of a widow who lost her husband in Afghanistan, and nearly lets it destroy everything she has in her life. Her focus is on what she lost and not what she still has. Despite having a lot of help being offered to her by family and friends, she nearly loses everything. It is because she can not bring herself past her husbands death.<br><br>She has a young daughter to raise alone. death. While her friends and relatives are there, and keep offering her help, she will not open up about her personal dilemma and withdraws instead. Then the broken road starts to being in pieces that can fix her problems and she ignores them at first too. For instance, it is late in the film before she finally opens the last letter her late husband wrote to her.<br><br>The characters that help her throughout are her friends and neighbors at church, her mother-in-law, a race car driver, and a garage mechanic. They help despite her not letting them into her life with her daughter, who is the most important piece of her life still left. The race car driver has his own issues to address as well. The character who reminds me of the returning vet in coming home is the wheel chair bound Afghanistan vet, who needs to share something with her, but she keeps shutting him out.<br><br>The main weakness of this story is that while the daughters grandma is there to help her grand daughter and has to deal with losing her son in the war, there is no mention of grandpa, almost like he never existed as far as I can determine. I have to guess that for some reason Grandma is widowed. Andrew W. Walker as race car driver Cody Jackson is good support for Lindsay Pulsipher as Amber Hill (and this films center is Amber). Makenzie Moss as daughter Bree Hill has a solid performance as the 4th grader. LaDainian Tomlinson debuts as Pastor Williams and his scenes are good. The films cast is all solid. <br><br>I am glad to see a film looking at the loss here at home of an Afghanistan vet, and pray that some day we will be out of this conflict. It is now the longest conflict in our history. Afghanistan became totally ignored the last 10 years, too often by a US Media more interested in creating gossip for it's own agenda, versus reporting on real events.","user":"DKosty123","rank":[18,30]}]
