[{"title":"7/10","rating":10,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"I think people critique this film way too hard for what it was. \nMaybe they were expecting the next 8 mile?\nIt was more party x meets sex drive and totally worth the watch. \nKyles acting was actually really good and I would love to see him in other movies. \nGive it a chance; haters gonna hate.","user":"saliaga08","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"8/10","rating":8,"date":"31 August 2018","review":"Not overly substantive, but great for a lighthearted laugh.","user":"owenne","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"unexpectedly great.","rating":8,"date":"29 August 2018","review":"Really didnt see me liking this movie that much. KYLE does a nice job especially his flow which evident on his EPIC freestyle burn lol. I did have an issue with the actor chosen as his friend, he seemed a bit over the top to me and i feel if his role was cast better this could be a cult classic. his inclusion makes it more of a cheesy movie in line with the wiz ans snoop highshchool movie. SPOILER ALERT best scene hands down is DMX in the strip club now thats how you have a cameo lmao","user":"goobsgreat","rank":[11,17]}]
