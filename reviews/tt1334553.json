[{"title":"Really creepy good fun","rating":8,"date":"29 March 2011","review":"Viewed at the Festival de Film, Cannes 2010<br><br>To spoil or not to spoil, that is the question. NOT spoil! The summary tells you all you need to know and anything else would be a revelation and defeat the object. Basically, David Hyde Pierce plays his Frasier character Nils as coming from the dark side. He's whacked out all right, but only slowly do we discover just how whacked and out he is!<br><br>The Perfect Host is not a horror film, although it's easy to see how it could have been made as one, but a psychological, cat and mouse thriller of tables (dining tables?) turning and being turned as small time hood meets major lunatic!<br><br>Given the vast majority of the film takes place in one setting, the film does come over as a bit staged at times, but that also adds another dimension because staging itself plays a big part. After all, Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce's character) is staging the perfect dinner party and is not about to let some uncultivated intruder spoil things.<br><br>And then come the twists...<br><br>The Perfect Host is a little film that slips under the radar, but if you enjoy good thrillers, want a different take on the home invasion genre, just enjoy watching David Hyde Pierce (and he is most watchable) being creepy, then it's well worth a look.","user":"Simonster","rank":[99,109]},{"title":"Unique and great showcase for 2 actors.","rating":8,"date":"30 May 2011","review":"Caught this on On Demand last night on a whim, and I am really glad I spent the overpriced ticket on it. David Hyde Pierce must have had a ball with this and Clayne Crawford is a very solid performer. He reminds me of a young Ray Liotta in \"Something Wild\". I hope to see him in some more high quality films, because he deserves a good career. I am in total agreement with the only other reviewer here so far; this is a film that to describe too much about really would spoil the twists.<br><br>The trailer even gives a bit too much away so if you have not seen it; trust me, if you have ON Demand and you enjoy Black Comedy have a go without watching the trailer.<br><br>The entire plot twists and setup is absurd, but if you don't nitpick too much as I am wont to do you will have a great time watching two talented actors for a fast paced 90 minutes.<br><br>I would have even rated this higher like a 9, but I didn't want the \"incredibly surprised cause I had no expectations\" factor to add too much to my numerical rating of this gem of a film.","user":"somf","rank":[83,96]},{"title":"David Hyde Pierce At His Best!","rating":10,"date":"25 June 2011","review":"The Perfect Host is a brilliant thriller about Warwick Wilson, a seemingly accommodating, middle-aged man, who loves hosting dinner parties for his unique group of friends.<br><br>Criminal at large, John Taylor, cons his way into Warwick's home and has an unforgettable, albeit, surreal night, full of wine, music and dance.<br><br>David Hyde Pierce and Clayne Crawford give superb performances. Writer / Director Nick Tomnay created this wonderful gem. It is certain to receive high praise from those who enjoy psychological thrillers.<br><br>The On Demand preview is riddled with spoilers. I recommend not watching the preview before viewing the film.","user":"poetjoey","rank":[63,78]}]
