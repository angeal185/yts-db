Horrible, Horrible,Horrible!","user":"v-ley","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"The acting is appalling!","rating":1,"date":"27 September 2019","review":"I rarely write reviews, but I had to put one here. I don't even know how this garbage ever got made. This unknown looks nothing like Frank nor does this girl favor Ava Gardner. The acting is so stiff, it's as if they are just reading the script verbatim with no feeling at all. I watched 15 minutes of this and I had to turn it off. No way I was going to waste any time or my life with this trash. You would do better to watch a cartoon.","user":"karonorama","rank":[3,4]}]
