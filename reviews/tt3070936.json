[{"title":"Why can't they do this with more Broadway shows?","rating":6,"date":"7 December 2013","review":"Shrek only ran on Broadway from 2008 to 2010, but in that small time frame producer Jeffrey Katzenberg apparently saw fit to create a DVD of the show. If not made for any other reason than to cash in on the Shrek film franchise, this is an immensely entertaining and hysterically funny show. I for one am very glad they made it available for home viewing. It's the next best thing to seeing a show live. <br><br>THE CAST<br><br>SHREK played by Brian d'Arcy James. Mr. James is perfect for the role and makes it his own while still calling to mind the film character. His voice is also terrific, and he gives us the show- stopping number \"Who I'd Be\", which is definitely the best song in the show. <br><br>Fiona played by Sutton Foster. Oh, how I love this woman. Her voice is beautiful! She can go from being ridiculously goofy and then suddenly convey genuine emotion in her songs. I love the song \"I Know It's Today\" and her antics in \"Morning Person\" are hilarious. <br><br>DONKEY played by Daniel Breaker. Donkey is one of the favorite characters. Breaker brings a sassier edge to Donkey but he's still that ass that simultaneously annoys us and makes us fall in love with him. <br><br>LORD FARQUAAD played by Christopher Sieber. To me, Sieber stole much of the show. He is on his knees the entire time with little legs dangling in front of him, which is quite amusing. As painful as that could have been, he makes it look effortless. <br><br>PINOCCHIO played by John Tartaglia. You may recognize him from the Playhouse Disney show \"Johnny and the Sprites.\" I suppose playing a puppet is referencing the fact that he does all the puppeteering for the show. <br><br>THE MUSIC<br><br>The music, unfortunately, never reaches the heights of \"The Lion King\" or \"Wicked.\" However, there is still something to recommend here. Several standout songs, including the already mentioned \"Who I'd Be\" and \"I Know It's Today\" are particularly good. The opening song, \"Big Bright Beautiful World\" is a good start, and Donkey's first song \"Don't Let Me Go\" is outrageously funny. The catchiest song is probably \"Freak Flag\" which is also very humorous. While these songs probably won't be considered classics anytime soon, they are cleverly written and are highly suitable for this show. <br><br>The show is probably suitable for ages 10 and up. There is some off-color humor here and there, but most of it would probably go over the kid's heads. (The transvestite wolf.) The gassy humor is obviously aimed at them. I, for one, could have gone without the fart/belch sequence. However, even I admit it was a little amusing. Donkey says 'damn' and 'hell' once each, but I think that was the extent of the language. <br><br>I very much wish that this DVD would be the start of a new trend. Having Broadway on demand in our living room would be fantastic. Will someone please film the \"Pippin\" revival next?","user":"OrinP","rank":[26,30]},{"title":"Very good","rating":10,"date":"13 October 2018","review":"I thunk shrek is love shrek is life.

After watching \"Phantom\" at the Royal Albert Hall and then this one as a presentation on Netflix, I'm hoping that more will be saved for always. This is not the world's greatest musical, but it is full of life, wonderful characters, and a nice edge to it. It has two or three very good songs and lots of topical material. The two leads in particular capture the Disney original and are able to poke fun at themselves. If there is a downside, it does go on a bit long and the fairy tale characters aren't used quite as much as they could be. I remember seeing Prince Farquhar on the Tony Awards and was amazed at his dexterity, playing the entire part on his knees. I would imagine that most of the theater goers already know the plot but the magic still gets us from the get go.","user":"Hitchcoc","rank":[8,12]}]
