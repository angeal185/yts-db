[{"title":"Kids were bored 5 minutes in.","rating":1,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"This movie is terrible. My kids picked it out at the library so it was free, and that's the only positive I can say for it. It appears that the entire movie is very poorly animated animals typing on keyboards and talking nonsense. The only reason I'm even bothering to write this review is that right now the movie rating is at 9.7!  Don't bother watching this movie, it's not even worth it to see how bad it is.","user":"shunney-28539","rank":[34,40]},{"title":"Its just bad.","rating":1,"date":"30 July 2019","review":"Nothing positive to say about this movie. Animation is garbage and the  rating of 9.7 is pretty misleading....","user":"lil_penpen-96-807113","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Wars of the zoos","rating":10,"date":"8 August 2019","review":"This is a great movie about zoos and wars and even Matt Damon was a good actor in downsizing bought it for my son at his request","user":"yomaam","rank":[3,7]}]
