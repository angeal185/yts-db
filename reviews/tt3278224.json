[{"title":"Any aficionado of storytelling and the art, love and purpose of communication will not want to miss this","rating":10,"date":"20 May 2018","review":"Nearly every aspect of this work-of-art is perfectly complemented. Lost language and love, dying and the persistence of opportunity slipping away-so poetic and enchanting. Many movies strain for the type of majesty \"Sueño en otro idioma\" accomplishes seemingly effortlessly, but only one or two a year ever surface into mainstream society.<br><br>Bravo to Ernesto Contreras, cast and crew.","user":"robcox1980","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"A dark movie about a dying language and a living hatred","rating":10,"date":"20 October 2017","review":"The Mexican film Sueño en otro idioma was shown in the U.S. with the translated title I Dream in Another Language (2017). It was directed by Ernesto Contreras.<br><br>This is a fascinating movie, based on a plausible situation. An indigenous language--Zikril--<br><br>is vanishing. When the movie begins, there are only three people who can still speak Zikril. Soon, there are just two. A young linguist, Martín (played by Fernando Álvarez Rebeil), wants to preserve the language. The problem is that the two men who can speak Zikril hate each other. José Manuel Ponce plays Isauro, and Eligio Meléndez portrays Evaristo. By amazing good fortune--for Martín--the most beautiful woman in Mexico, Lluvia (Fátima Molina) is the granddaughter of one of the men.<br><br>The plot of the film revolves around Martín's attempts to bring the two men together so they can have a conversation in Zikril. That will allow Martín to record them and save the language for future generations. Of course, bringing them together means unraveling the reason that they are apart. Naturally, the reason isn't anything simple. It's a complex set of events that have remained buried until Martín arrives.<br><br>We saw this fascinating film at Rochester's great Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum. It was shown as part of ImageOut, the wonderful Rochester LGBT Film Festival. Unfortunately, this movie is best seen in a theater. The vegetation in the rain forest in which the film is set is astounding. However, even if you lose that aspect of the film, the basic story line will compensate for this. I recommend that you find this movie and watch it.","user":"Red-125","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"Such a moving and wonderful movie","rating":9,"date":"24 April 2018","review":"I'm not sure about the translation since I watched it in Spanish but I can tell you that this movie is an absolute piece of art. I watch a lots of movies and never liked a movie so much I felt obligated to write about it. \n***spoiler alaret***\nSuch a wonderful way to show the true love. The sacrifices, and the forgiveness of Don Isauro gives a whole new meaning to love. The way you can compare what true love actually means, even if it's forbidden in compare to a none existing man &amp; woman \"love\" is just beautiful. There is such a perfectly placed balance between Don Isauro's kindness and Don Evaristo's cruelty. In this movie you get to learn to understand each character, their emotions, their concerns and the way they confront their life and its challenges. Each character is perfectly developed which results to an understandable action and reactions from each one of them.<br><br>I'm not a great writer but I really enjoyed this well made movie and I absolutely recommend it.","user":"mahsa-mn","rank":[11,14]}]
