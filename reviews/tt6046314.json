[{"title":"Unfinished business","rating":7,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"Hardly a realistic plot to narrate, with great perspective though mostly because of Julianne. And somewhere between small doses of suspense and greater of humanity, the film leaves us with the feeling of unfinished business, as if the director wanted simply to proceed without the emotional strength, this movie could bring. It got flat at this very moment anyone expected the power behind the facts. Anyway, it was no waste of time, enjoyable but ...something finally was missing.","user":"vasileioskyvellos","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"I must have pretty bad taste","rating":7,"date":"3 April 2019","review":"Because I thought this was a pretty good and touching movie. One test I have, when watching a movie on cable, is how many times I pick up my phone to check the net. I didn't during this one. I will not give spoilers but it's based on a novel ... so the outcome is not a script thing but an adaptation. I thought the performances were compelling enough. Don't be discouraged by other reviews. Make up your own mind.","user":"scott-1657","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"Artless hackery","rating":4,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"When I read this book in 2001, I was struck by how cinematic the writing was. The story was tragic and operatic--perfect for film. Why it took so long, I don't know, but this movie is a major disappointment. Weitz had a brilliant cast and Rene Fleming's voice to work with and he wasted both of them.\nThe most powerful moment in the book is when the guerrillas are going to execute a hostage and the singer faces them down and blasts them with \"O mio babbino caro\". Violence is impossible in the face of such beauty and the entire dynamic of the situation is changed. Choosing to cut out that scene was the first indicator that this director/screenwriter was clueless about this material. \nThe final assault that frees the hostages was just bad action movie crap. We need this scene to be operatic: the saddest aria in the repertoire blasting on the soundtrack as the assault plays out in slow motion--the death of each of the characters we have grown to know devastating us as we watch them gunned down one by one with all the tragic pathos of a great opera. \nPatchett's novel deserves better.","user":"phahof","rank":[28,44]}]
