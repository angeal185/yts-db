[{"title":"Didn't live up to its potential","rating":4,"date":"31 October 2019","review":"This movie could have been lots of fun. Given the premise of making fun of a typical Hallmark type Christmas movie there was potential. But it didn't get that funny. The 2 sisters sound silly at times. And things actually end up like a boring done to death Christmas movie. There was no magic like a Groundhog Day type fantasy.<br><br>The cast includes real life spouses Brant Daugherty and Kim Hidalgo. He is better when not acting cutesy. Don't get how the fantasy and reality blended together.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Awful","rating":2,"date":"5 November 2019","review":"So bad I couldn't even finish watching. The acting was terrible and the plot insanely stupid.","user":"lhmosca","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"not a dream...a nightmare","rating":1,"date":"29 October 2019","review":"I am in no way connected or related to anyone in this film, so I am free to be truthful about it. It has all the elements for a 10 star Christmas movie except one.\nIt has absolutely no story. In spite of great actors, great location, great directing the plot was the worst I have seen in years. No real humor, no chemistry between the stars, just cliche after cliche after cliche and no story to connect them. Definitely not worth the time.","user":"ronbokirk","rank":[14,22]}]
