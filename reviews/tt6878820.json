[{"title":"Loved it!","rating":10,"date":"20 February 2018","review":"I absolutely adore this movie and the young new actors! It was nice to see some fresh new faces on Disney. The overall production, the songs, the acting, the whole thing kept me and my kiddos entertained (even my \"too cool\" teenager got into it!)<br><br>Can't wait to see what Milo and Meg become in the future!","user":"stacershyla","rank":[28,38]},{"title":"Fun family movie","rating":6,"date":"20 February 2018","review":"Considering this is a Disney Channel TV movie, and not a theatrical film, it was very entertaining! The leads Milo Manheim and Meg Donnelly had great chemistry and their acting (including Bucky, Trevor Tordjman) was great, which you don't usually get with DCOMs. Even some of the leads in the ever-popular Descendents were lacking, so it was refreshing to see some better talent in this movie. I liked the overall tone of the movie and the cheerleaders reminded me a bit of Bring It On, in how they enthusiastic and sometimes corny they were in talking about cheerleading. One negative- I felt that the costuming and setting was a bit over the top. I understand this was done intentionally to portray the differences between the two worlds of humans and zombies, but the pastels and bright neon pink and green was just too much for the eye to take. <br><br>The music was good, a little cookie-cutter, but the song Someday was particularly sweet and effective in setting the tone and message for the movie. I thought it was a great statement for young kids on how racism is bad and we should be more accepting of other people/culture/differences, and I loved how Disney put it in the context of Zombies- fun and inspirational! I am curious to see if this gets a sequel and interested to see where they take the story next.","user":"aubie87","rank":[14,21]},{"title":"I Loved It!","rating":10,"date":"18 February 2018","review":"I very much enjoyed the movie.\nI am 14, and even I enjoyed the plot and development of the entire thing.\nThe movie has a lot of older humor and idealistic attitudes to it that I very much enjoyed. It feels as if the whole movie was a more childish take on racism and personal values on being different and taking pride in who you are as a person.<br><br>Since it has come out I have watched it a total of three times-two of which were the premiere night!","user":"kayleighcoots","rank":[22,38]}]
