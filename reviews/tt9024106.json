It was a sad day and quite a mess. I am voer it now and not bitter because I had intended to give birth, but also see what happened as a sign. After all, God created bitter melons and did not stop me from eating them. With the looseness and thinness of my blood the muscles were relaxed to the point that my bad gave up on the baby. It was a natural abortion.<br><br>The lady actress in this film does a fine job and the scenes are professionally shot. I cannot understand why people would hate on abortion for others when God allows it.","user":"johnathankaled","rank":[228,349]}]
