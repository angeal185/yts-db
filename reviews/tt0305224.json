[{"title":"Jack definitely takes over Sandler, Anger Management is good for a few laughs","rating":7,"date":"23 November 2003","review":"I saw this movie in the theater with my father and I have to say even though Sandler can annoy me most of the time, this is one of his better comedies. I think he owes that to Jack Nicholson's performance, since Jack can carry a film so well he also makes the jokes into perfect cues and great laughs. Adam does a good job as well, both actors worked very well together and actually have great chemistry. I think everyone would agree that their version of \"I feel pretty\" was just so awesome and beyond hilarious. It was also nice to see that this wasn't a typical Sandler film filled with predictable cameo's of his friends, so it showed that he could carry the film without doing the common predictability.<br><br>Dave is a man who designs cat suits for fat cats, he has a beautiful girlfriend, Linda, and seems to have it together, only he's actually pretty taken advantage of by his boss and Linda's ex boyfriend. He lets a lot of things go. One day when he is on a plane, he is accused of \"assulting\" a flight attendant and racist marks, despite the situation actually being the opposite. But he is sent to anger management anyways and is being mentored by Dr. Buddy Rydell, a bit of a psychotic, but this proves Dave's \"internal\" anger and turns out to prove that Dave does need help and who might be crazier in life.<br><br>Anger Management is sometimes a bit silly, but I love this comedy, it's always good for so many laughs. Buddy was just so awesome in that scene where he has to pull his car out of the parking spot, but there is another car blocking him and he just handles it \"his way\", you'll have to see. Adam and Jack were great together and I would recommend this film for anyone. Like I said, it's not a typical Sandler film and really works well.<br><br>7/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[69,84]},{"title":"Sandler at his most restrained","rating":7,"date":"3 September 2007","review":"This is a pretty good romantic comedy with silly bits tossed in (like the squeaky toy bear). This is the first Sandler performance I've really liked a lot, and while Nicholson is really just tossing it off, let's face it, his throwaways are frequently better than the best from most other actors. Here the match - Sandler at his most restrained, Nicholson getting sloppy - works very well, as each becomes a complement to the other, which is wholly in keeping with the characters and their situation. The supporting cast is also doing very well. And the film is well-made: possibly even too much so, as for instance with the cinematography, which is of a high quality that would suit a heavy dramatic film.<br><br>There are definitely some laugh-out-loud high moments along the way, and very few low moments. Not a great movie, but definitely a movie you can spend an evening with and think it money well-spent.","user":"winner55","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Hilarious, in bizarre way","rating":8,"date":"3 February 2005","review":"Let me just say one thing, before I comment on this film: Jack Nicholson is a star. I've heard bad things about his personality, lifestyle, bla bla bla, but, the fact of the matter is (no matter what kind of selfish bean he may be) he is a remarkably good actor. The way he can put so much life into his character, how he can make you believe this was an actual event, is amazing. He made the terrible \"About Schmidt\" a watchable (barely) film. And in his earlier effort, \"Anger Managemenet\", he plays the most annoying man ever to be put on screen (including that utterly stupid Gilligan) but, this time (thankfully!) to a brain-bustingly hilarious effect. <br><br>Dave Buznick is played by Adam Sandler, a calm, relaxed, cool man (despite his \"troublesome\" childhood) who is, after a roll-on-aisles hilarious scene, given \"Anger Managemnt\" therapy for 20 hours, with none other than \"the\" Buddy Rydell. It turns out this two had a past meeting...<br><br>One great thing about this film, which is rare (sort-of) in comedies, is the acting. John Tutorro plays the hilarious \"Chuck\" anger pal to Dave; Allen Covert (star in basically all of Adam Sandler's movies) plays mr.\"big-weener\" Andrew; Jack Nicholson is the unbelievably annoying Buddy, and John Mackenroe even gets off the Tennis courts to make an appearance as a hilarious client to the \"therapy\". Some of the most standout funny scenes include a bizarre male-prostitute car-scene, the gut-burstingly funny scene in the plane, and when Buddy and Dave go on a terrible, morally unethical (yet damn funny) scene in which they kick the crap out of a bunch of Monks. All in all, \"Anger Management\" is a hilarious, annoying, feel good film that deserves to be watched by all. <br><br>Overall: **** out of ***** (4 out of 5)","user":"jofitz27","rank":[17,20]}]
