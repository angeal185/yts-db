[{"title":"Decent horror film.","rating":6,"date":"28 November 2019","review":"Pikovaya dama. Zazerkalye is a decent Russian flick, amazing locations inside the boarding school and outside between a beautiful but mysterious forest and a lake. The cast was just ok, the score is weak and the script sometimes is stranger and illogical, but the film is funny with a creepy cinematography. Watch it if you are looking for a teen horror film.","user":"jp_91","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"laughable but not funny","rating":1,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"What a joke of a movie. I can't say the actors were bad but the people speaking and moving on the screen were terrible at trying to act. This is someone's attempt at filming something interesting and it did not work at all.","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Worst acting,","rating":1,"date":"22 December 2019","review":"My first time going to a cinema watching a horror film where the crowds was just silent it felt like everyone was asleep. A quarter left half way through the movie. How this movie got above 3 stars rating blows my mind.","user":"fazren-23599","rank":[4,7]}]
