[{"title":"Decent adaptation of H.P. Lovecraft's short story.","rating":6,"date":"20 May 2003","review":"Sandra Dee (the original GIDGET to you beach bunny fans) is Nancy Wagner, a virginal blonde student at Miskatonic University who meets Wilbur (Dean Stockwell), the grandson of a warlock who was lynched years earlier.<br><br>Wilbur shows interest in the Necronomicon and in Nancy, because he needs both to open a gateway for demons called \"The Old Ones\" to enter our world. He invites her back to his secluded home in Dunwich, where he keeps her drugged, plots to sacrifice her on a seaside altar and fights with his senile, ranting grandfather (Sam Jaffe). A strange-looking, barely-seen, multi-headed flying monster that sees things in negative (and looks kind of like GHIDRAH!), is kept locked in the attic, but escapes for the silly finale.<br><br>It's amusing to see the once-wholesome Sandra Dee saying sex is \"great\" and simulating orgasm while being groped on an altar, but she should also get credit for delivering a decent performance. Ditto Ed Begley in his last role as a heroic professor. Stockwell is so soft-spoken and weird it's hard to gouge just how good (or bad) his performance really is.<br><br>Compared to most recent H.P. Lovecraft adaptations, this isn't half bad and it all looks very cool and colorful. Roger Corman was the executive producer. Director Haller also made DIE, MONSTER, DIE, which was based on Lovecraft's \"The Colour Out of Space.\"","user":"capkronos","rank":[42,47]},{"title":"The Dunwich Horror: More than a little disappointing","rating":3,"date":"19 October 2018","review":"I remember reading Lovecrafts classic The Dunwich Horror back when I was a boy, I always enjoyed his works and nobody else could write quite like him.<br><br>As I grew older and my movie obsession truly took hold I was astonished how bad almost every Lovecraft adaptation was, seriously awful stuff.<br><br>It's taken me a longtime to get round to the original 1970's movie and I can confidently say I'm more than a little miffed.<br><br>Starring Dean \"Quantum Leap\" Stockwell and Sandra Dee this is a very loose streamlined version of the tale and it simply isn't very good.<br><br>Upon investigation it turns out that The Dunwich Horror has been adapted quite a few times and I can only hope the others are better than this.

It seems that Dean is the grandson of a powerful wizard, and the illegitimate son of a woman who is finishing her days in the padded room of an insane asylum. Sandra Dee and her huge helmet of blond hair accompany Dean back to his isolated farmhouse where she is quickly drugged, talking about sex, having orgasms on altars and dreaming about strange beings (who rather resemble Manson Family members) who chase her along the misty sea cliffs. Suspicious friends arrive to help the stoned Miss Dee, who has no desire to be rescued from her creepy new boyfriend or his awful perm. But the well meaning friends learn some shocking truths about Dean anyway: he has a twin brother, and if looks are anything to go by, then their Daddy was a mutant sushi dinner.<br><br>There's some pretty decent creepy moments to be found in this film. The mood is nice and eerie, the atmosphere as thick and creepy as the fog that lies thick along the coastline beside Dean's house. We don't get to see much of the Twin Brother, but the POV shots are nice, done in blood red negatives. Dean Stockwell delivers a truly icky performance as the not-quite-human Wilbur who succeeds in seducing virginal Sandy, whose Good Girl image goes bye-bye here pretty quickly. The ending is a tad rushed and somewhat silly, but everything leading up to it is nice and tense, with minimal gore and some haunting sound effects. I give it a fat 8 on a scale of 10.","user":"Gafke","rank":[51,61]}]
