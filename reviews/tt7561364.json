[{"title":"SALT AND PEPPER TOO","rating":4,"date":"9 July 2019","review":"Title serves the recipe for this film with some salt and pepper too it goes down fairly easy......tidy Welsh backyards (college years memories) serve as a background where noisy Mediterranean barbeques can spoil the tranquility...Suki,s nightingale voice looks promising....happy to see Jennifer Gray...she kept being so tiny I thought that in the guest 0house scene she would run and jump on taller Suki so that the latter would play late Patric Swazie and lift her up","user":"vanmust","rank":[3,13]}]
