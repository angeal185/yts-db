[{"title":"Wow - that was unexpected!","rating":20,"date":"20 March 2014","review":"I'm so happy I stumbled upon this! I saw a small trailer on BBC2 an hour before it started and as soon as I saw Bill Nighy was in it - it went straight onto my schedule.<br><br>BBC Original Drama's have been good in the past and have only occasionally pulled in big names so I wasn't expecting what happened next.. Hollywood a-listers started popping up... Christopher Walken, Winona Ryder, Helena Bonham Carter, Ewen Bremner and a cameo from Ralph Fiennes - Jeez, it's a cast list that any film-maker would love to have.<br><br>They all have main to supporting roles and it feels like a classic Hollywood-scale movie, but filmed with the production quality of a British TV drama.<br><br>Bill Nighy is absolutely fantastic, like a cool but older James Bond type who has retired to a sleepy island. Christopher Walken is... Christopher Walken and Winona Ryder suddenly has my heart, she looks great and has fully matured.<br><br>The film revolves around a former British 'Civil Servant' played by Nighy (we all know what 'Civil Servant' really means) who lives on the privileged Turks &amp; Caicos island. He is recognised by an American (Walken) and is suddenly drawn into a mystery surrounding a company called Gladstone who are about to buy up lots of land on the island.<br><br>I've given this a 10/10 because for a TV Drama, which is it, it certainly punched above its weight and the quality of actors on display is outstanding. Watching it on BBC2 HD was simply fantastic and most of all - it came out of nowhere and cheered me up on a Thursday evening.<br><br>It was for all intents and purposes - a damn good surprise and seeing Bill Nighy and Christopher Walken back to his best, playing off each other is just awesome. I hate the BBC for squandering British TV License fees on IT systems that don't work and for taking BBC3 off the air, but I would have paid to see this at the cinema.<br><br>Turks &amp; Caicos is refreshing, fun and mysterious.","user":"GodsPrototype","rank":[52,65]},{"title":"A slow burning cracker","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2014","review":"I was thrilled by the first episode and expected a lot from the second. And got it.<br><br>The acting was impeccable. It was so good I missed it the first time I saw it. It seemed so natural. <br><br>The pace was slow, steady and intriguing but there were little hints as to the plot, pointers if you will, all the way through. Don't miss a second.<br><br>I watched it alone last night - my wife was babysitting grandchildren - and I was so fascinated that I saw it again with her tonight. It is even better the second time around. She actually clapped at the end.<br><br>Nighy is brilliant, giving more information in a look that Skippy ever did. Yet he never answers a question.<br><br>My wife and I talked it over for about an hour afterward.<br><br>The third episode is awaited with some anticipation. Page 8 was brilliant and T&amp;C has kept up the quality. <br><br>Well done to everyone involved.","user":"harvey-954-515948","rank":[27,36]},{"title":"Worthy successor","rating":9,"date":"22 March 2014","review":"The first instalment of what has now turned out to be a trilogy, Page Eight, made me long for more and David Hare has certainly delivered. The second episode, Turks &amp; Caicos, is perhaps a bit slower paced and less spellbinding than Page Eight, but it has all the ingredients that made its predecessor such a breath of fresh air: a carefully crafted plot line, believable dialogue, excellent acting, a total absence of fist fights and explosions and a willingness to question the path the Western world has walked in the post-9/11 world.<br><br>After his escape from England, Johny Worricker is lying low in the Turks and Caicos islands, a British overseas territory with an American currency. Big men with big money are thick on the ground and Johnny soon gets drawn into a mental chess game with them that threatens to expose some unsavoury secrets about the business aspects of the 'war on terror'. He soon has to fear for his safety again and re-engages some old friends in England to get to the heart of the matter.<br><br>'Turks &amp; Caicois' grew on me after repeated viewing. Because of its slower pace and the fact that most of it take place on a small Caribbean island, it feels more like a good stage play than the other two parts of the Worricker trilogy. I relished the well-crafted dialog and subtle gestures and expressions of the actors so much that I actually watched the DVD twice on successive nights.","user":"ochichornye","rank":[30,42]}]
