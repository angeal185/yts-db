[{"title":"Just a masterpiece, like any Clouzot's work","rating":10,"date":"31 July 2012","review":"It appears that the outstanding director Henri-George Clouzot was unable to make movies short of being masterpieces. \"La Verite\" may be defined as the \"European Rashomon\", and, well aware that my opinion will be considered a sacrilege, I venture to say that Clouzot's film is even better than Kurosawa's celebrated masterpiece. In fact, the essence of both \"Rashomon\" and \"La Verite\" lies in the quest of the truth of a story, reconstructed through a sequence of flash-backs.<br><br>\"La Verite\" narrates the trial of the breathtakingly-beautiful-sexy lost girl Dominique (Brigitte Bardot), for the murder of her former boy-friend Gilbert (Samy Frey). Everybody (Dominique herself, her former friends and various lovers, her enemies, notably her own sister, as well as lawyers and prosecutors) states his own version of the facts, but what is the actual truth? To simplify the question: is Dominique just a ruthless killer, or was she a weak, enamored girl, victim of Gilbert's selfishness and bullying? As always in Clouzot's movies, \"La Verite\" is extremely intense, packed with a profound and uncompromising psychological study. The almost obsessive pace of events gives no break to both the characters and the audience. The script is first-rate, with plenty of cynical sense of humor, in spite of the dramatic facts told.<br><br>Brigitte Bardot was a great actress, endowed with an outstanding talent. A careful viewer could easily get it even from BB's performances in minor movies, like, say \"Mademoiselle Pigalle\". Here, under the sound direction of a genius like Clouzot, she is just sensational in a highly dramatic role. Of course, also the acting by the remainder of the cast is excellent, especially, needless to say, by the legends Charles Vanel and Paul Meurisse, as the two lawyers.<br><br>Possibly, the main credit of this fantastic movie lies in a gelid, sarcastic, misanthropic representation of human society. Arguably, this is the trade-mark of Clouzot's style, together with suspense, which here is present but not exasperated like in his other works. The world of the adults is wholly despicable, permeated as they are with hypocrisy, with prejudice and fear, especially in sexual matters, and with sickening cynicism, as masterly represented by the lawyer Paul Meurisse.<br><br>However, the youngsters are no better than the adults. They are just fatuous, selfish, conceited loafers, only able to utter pseudo-intellectual chats. As a matter of fact, when Dominique founds herself in dire straits, none of her young friends moves a finger to help her. And Dominique often appears even worse than the others. From some point of view, she might be considered a totally negative character.<br><br>So, what's the point of Clouzot? I think that's not an issue. He just shows what he sees; that's the style and the aim of one of the greatest artists in the history of cinema.<br><br>\"La Verite\" is a total masterpiece. It is impossible to be disappointed. Highly recommended.","user":"pzanardo","rank":[30,32]},{"title":"\"La Vérité\" kept its promises in regard to Bardot the actress","rating":8,"date":"24 July 2005","review":"Henri-Georges Clouzota director of the older generationwas known for his uncompromising temperament, and, working together, he and Bardot attempted to rid her of the two-dimensional image she had been saddled with, as well as those two cumbersome initials which had come to represent so much <br><br>Although the film was not Clouzot at his best, \"La Vérité\" kept its promises in regard to Bardot the actress Her innate talent was finally recognized by the press in its entirety <br><br>Clouzot attempted in his film to contrast the unrelenting morality of the French courts with the new, amoral life of youth; the truth, Clouzot shows, becomes distorted through the legal process Dominique is the victim not only of her own self-indulgence but of a scheme of values in which she has no place <br><br>Clouzot admired Bardot's acting capacity  \"she has a very large range,\" he said \"She can pass with ease from comedy to drama and even to tragedy.\"","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[27,32]},{"title":"Passion and Justice","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2007","review":"This comes as a surprise entry in Brigitte Bardots filmography. Surely the blonde siren wasn't everybody's first chance for a female lead in a Henri-Georges Clouzot film; then again, the role she is playing fits perfectly. Dominique Marceau is a pretty young girl eager to leave her parents home and live with her sister in Paris. Other than her, Dominique is living out her lust for life, hanging around with friends, with parties, drinking and casual affairs. By coincidence she encounters her sisters fiancée, a very serious young musician. Eventually they fall in love, but Dominique can't be faithful and Gilbert (Sami Freys character) cannot adjust to her way of life. They break up, reunite, and break up again  with Gilbert more and more being ridiculed by her affairs with other men. On the other hand, Dominique cannot let him go either, and when he suddenly loses all his passion and returns to her sister, Dominique makes a decision. This is all told in flashback sequences during the trial in which Dominique is accused of Gilberts murder. The people participated in finding the truth, Clouzot tells us, are incapable of leaving their personal convictions and moral perspectives out of the court. Whatever the verdict may be, Dominique won't leave as an innocent. - \"La Verité\" has some memorable scenes, not least the one where Gilbert is conducting Strawinskys \"Oiseau de Feu\" on television, which blends over to the next scene while the music continues without a break. While being a serious drama about passion and justice, Clouzots film still makes good use of Bardots erotic energy  and yet there is never a moment where the images make the story irrelevant.","user":"Thorsten_B","rank":[25,30]}]
