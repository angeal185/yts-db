[{"title":"Not for all people","rating":8,"date":"21 February 2019","review":"I really like this movie, is a melancholic movie, sad, and reflective\nit is slow, and it could have different readigns, it reflects in a stressful way what the lead character is going through I understood what Sarah Jessica Parker whas trying to communicate, because all the movie is run by her and the way she expresses emotions.\nCould be that you have to be in a certain place in life to understand this movie and feel connected to the character.\nI like it, is not a movie for entertainment, is a movie to reflect.\nThere were a lots of cliches of artistic movies, but that is fine with me.","user":"oso-caro","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"No Happy Ending...","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2019","review":"Is this why viewers are disappointed? No happy ending? This movie has so much more to offer than just some silly love story. It is about life, all good and bad, all its flaws and imperfections, about struggles and battles we endure every day. It is truly a masterpiece. Fantastic performance by Sarah Jessica Parker. She is so uniquely talented and not a bad singer either. Love the eyes. Two thumbs up.","user":"sylk1973","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Death & The City","rating":1,"date":"10 November 2018","review":"90 minutes of my life wasted watching SJP walk around NYC in her Louboutins and Manolos.I was hoping her character would die so I could of watched a real movie.","user":"hongkongeight-903-507412","rank":[47,60]}]
