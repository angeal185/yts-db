[{"title":"The girl was kinda OK","rating":6,"date":"30 July 2019","review":"I'd tap that but she was not anything special either. she was a beach to start and was 8 years of trouble after that (but the dude does not age at all) but what I really care about and came here to ask is about the wedding organizer/employee at the banquet hall. What was her name?? Where else has she starred in? She was so thin and attractive. One sweet woman. Help!","user":"kashtynandel","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"A man stands by his woman","rating":6,"date":"23 August 2019","review":"Seriously. The story is different, sometimes cheesy, and that the girl is just OK makes the story even more touching. the parents have personality.","user":"conaghernaoki","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"In short Amazing","rating":8,"date":"14 September 2018","review":"It does not take long to forget you are reading subs, that is the intensity of this movie. Every time you know what will happen next, you are wrong. A true gem from Japan, with A+ acting. It is so draining that I wont watch it often, but it will for sure be on the repeat list. Basically boy falls in love with feisty girl who falls into a coma.A definite worth the money to see, I now have a copy.","user":"wommeee","rank":[5,6]}]
