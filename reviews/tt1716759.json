[{"title":"Not too bad, but also not worth sitting through","rating":4,"date":"18 December 2011","review":"Regular people get themselves into trouble by making poor decisions that snowball, with tragic consequences. Think \"Go\" without the fun, or a somewhat less intense \"Requiem for a Dream\"; though not nearly as inspired as either of those. <br><br>Relative unknown Tyler Johnston is effectively brooding as a troubled teen whose bad luck intersects with that of seasoned lead Luke Goss, who does an adequate enough job as the adult counterpart. Michael Eklund deserves the most credit for his small but expertly-detailed part as the catalyst (I can't wait to see him in something bigger).<br><br>The premise is somewhat original, with well-written dialog, but the story ends up less compelling than the slight potential felt in the beginning. Unlike the good examples from this genre, there's little to no great memorable truth, lesson, or even a poignant moment, really, to emerge from the characters' messes that might give you a reason to be glad you watched. Some editing missteps also cause the movie to drag too often.<br><br>They were going for pure tragedy, but didn't realize that a good tragic story still needs entertaining hooks. This movie maintains a rather homogeneous tension level from beginning to end, which gets old and ends up feeling more like a flatline.","user":"equazcion","rank":[19,27]},{"title":"A very good inde-movie that deserves to be seen. Very gritty and real. I am really shocked at how much I enjoyed this. I say B+","rating":8,"date":"28 February 2013","review":"\"I've got three months before this whole thing blows up in my face.\" Brian (Goss) is having a bad day. First he gets laid off, then gets in a fight with his wife, then finds out the savings he thought he had isn't as much as he was expecting. He stops at a bar to think and finds an old friend who says he can help. Risking everything Brian gives him all he has. When two young kids interfere with the plans everyone's life is affected. Going in to this I had no idea what to expect. I was very surprised with what I got and really really enjoyed this. The movie is tense and you aren't really sure what character to root for and it stays that way for just about the entire movie. Equal parts drama and action, this a the most realistic movie of this type I have seen. You will see what I mean when you watch this. I just put it in as background while I was doing something else but found myself 100% involved about 20 minutes in. I really enjoyed this. Overall, gritty, real and de-pressing...see what I did there. I give it an B+.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Normal movie","rating":7,"date":"14 May 2012","review":"It's quite good movie. Not even it is quite small budget movie, it contains good cameraman work, good producing and work of actors. All visualization is good and all movie is comparable with big budget movies. From the technical side - movie won't disappoint viewers.<br><br>But story have some disadvantages. All storyline is quite clear, but for me some acts of characters looked inadequate for their current situation. And because these acts is a piece of story, the story starting to look to me not so hard, serious and shocking. But the last 15 min will shows, that all movie lead you to situation without salvation. After all - our all life contains a lot inadequate act and decisions, and Pressed story could become your story (in the worst variant).<br><br>As I sad, all movie is quite calm and slow. There aren't a lot of action, car chasing or big \"booms\". But all that calmness to me created scary atmosphere, because it looked so real and it could took place in my neighborhood.<br><br>In summary I can say, that Pressed is normal movie (100% not bad, but is it good - it's a question for each viewer).","user":"dede_petras","rank":[12,20]}]
