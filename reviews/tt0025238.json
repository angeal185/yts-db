[{"title":"\"That's my ship, the Arizona.\"","rating":22,"date":"22 July 2006","review":"\"That's my ship, the Arizona\", says Pat O'Brien in the very first line of dialogue in this 1934 Warner Brothers feature. Indeed, much of this motion picture was filmed aboard the famous battleship that is now a national monument on the bottom of Pearl Harbor.<br><br>Another prominent feature of \"Here Comes The Navy\" is the USS Macon, the U.S. Navy's last dirigible. If the elderly battleship USS Arizona was a leftover from World War I, the USS Macon represented the cutting edge of technology in 1934, much as the Space Shuttle does today. The giant airship crashed into the Pacific Ocean less than a year after this film was produced, fortunately, with the loss of only two of her 100 crew members. Although the service continued to operate much smaller and less expensive non-rigid blimps for many years, the loss of the USS Macon put an end to the Navy's rigid airship program. There can be little doubt that many of the USS Macon's crewmen seen in this movie were still aboard at the time of the crash.<br><br>Of course, the principal feature of \"Here Comes The Navy\" is the crackling byplay between perennial rival/buddies James Cagney and Pat O'Brien, both of whom were at the top of their form here. As usual, Cagney plays the brash wise-guy while O'Brien is the steady, authority figure bent on channeling Cagney's energy into the right direction. It is a formula they were to repeat in several more movies, most famously in \"Angels With Dirty Faces\".<br><br>Caught between Cagney and O'Brien is Gloria Stewart. This was the same Gloria Stewart who would later be featured in the 1997 version of \"Titanic\". Stuart did a reasonable job here, even though she was inevitably upstaged by her two dynamic co-stars. But then, Cagney and O'Brien could easily steal scenes from anybody.<br><br>\"Here Comes The Navy\" is a treat for Cagney fans (and there are still plenty of those out there). It is equally a treat for history buffs. Originally intended as a showcase for the contemporary Navy, the movie is now a time capsule of the service in a bygone era.","user":"robertguttman","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"an absolute must for historians","rating":8,"date":"22 March 2006","review":"This review is so glowing because this film is one of the most important films, historically speaking, I have ever seen. While it is yet another Jimmy Cagney film in many ways, it shocked me when I saw that the film was set aboard the USS Arizona--the famous ship that was completely destroyed with most of its crew at Pearl Harbor just a few years later. Seeing Cagney and crew walking about this doomed ship is a rare opportunity to see the ship that still rests at the bottom of Pearl.<br><br>Later, to my utter amazement, the USS Macon (one of the US Navy's dirigibles) makes an appearance as well! This huge airship was to be destroyed in a storm only a year later, and once again the real ship was used in parts of the film. This is once again an amazing opportunity to see the ship.<br><br>So, combining the two rare opportunities with a pretty decent Cagney film gives you a film well-worth seeing. For those who don't care about the historical aspects of the film, I give it a 7--it's still pretty good and worth a look.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[29,34]},{"title":"The first of eight James Cagney - Pat O'Brien collaborations is a good, often funny drama with impressive Naval equipment used in location shooting.","rating":7,"date":"14 October 1998","review":"Besides James Cagney and Pat O'Brien, there's also beautiful Gloria Stuart (63 years before her triumphant return to the screen in Titanic (1997)) as the love interest, and Frank McHugh providing comedy centered around his mother's false teeth. In a fight over a girl with Navy man O'Brien, Cagney is knocked out when his girl distracts him. And when O'Brien later steals his girl, Cagney is so angry he joins the Navy with the hope of getting even.  Talk about holding grudges!  After 3 months of basic training (shot on location at the Naval Training Station in San Diego, California), Cagney is assigned to the battleship U.S.S. Arizona, the ship O'Brien is on.  The Navy allowed location shooting on the actual ship, which is the same one sunk at Pearl Harbor and is now in the harbor as a memorial.  It's an impressive ship with unbelievable firepower and we see the big guns being loaded and fired in maneuvers.  Meanwhile, Cagney had met and wooed Stuart, but she turned out to be O'Brien's sister!  And O'Brien caused a rift, another reason for Cagney to get even with him. Because of a bad attitude problem, Cagney eventually is transferred to the dirigible U.S.S. Macon at Sunnyvale, California.  Again, the actual airship is used and it is an awesome sight as it is pulled out of its hangar, dwarfing everything in view.  As luck (and the script) would have it, the ship tries to land in windy weather but aborts, with O'Brien hanging on to a mooring line as it gains altitude. Cagney disobeys orders and climbs down the rope with a parachute to try to save the man he doesn't yet know is O'Brien.","user":"Art-22","rank":[14,16]}]
