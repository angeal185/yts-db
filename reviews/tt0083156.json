[{"title":"Not the WORST film Franco ever made","rating":2,"date":"2 January 2005","review":"This movie is basically the infamous Jess Franco having a go at the American-style slasher films that were big in the early 80's, and what's most remarkable about it is how unremarkable it is. It's pretty violent, but except for one nasty knife exit wound there's nothing here that hasn't been done in hundreds of American slasher movies. Why this movie got singled out for a banning in Britain is beyond me. The most lurid thing about it is the original (very misleading)Spanish title \"Colegialas Violadas\". If they had tried to market it in Britain or the US under a title like that (which literally translates to \"Raped Schoolgirls\") I could see them banning it, but as far as I know it's always gone under the pretty innocuous English-language title \"Bloody Moon\". Besides there are no schoolgirls here. It's set at an adult Spanish-language school which seems to cater exclusively to incredibly dumb and slutty German and Scandinavian women. And no one would need to violate these girls--they're more sex-obsessed than the horny male teenagers in \"Porky's\". Why they're learning Spanish god only knows (other than to pick-up Latin disco kings at the cheesy club next door), but these girls are so stupid it's a miracle they ever learned ANY language beyond primitive clicks and grunts. One of these geniuses actually lets a masked guy she has just met tie her to a log in a saw mill (\"This is kind of perverted, isn't it?\"). You can pretty much guess what happens (she isn't rescued at the last minute by Shaggy and Scooby).<br><br>The girls are being stalked by two of the reddest herrings imaginable. One is a burnt youth in a Mickey Mouse mask (Walt Disney must have rolled over in his cryogenic chamber)who killed a girl years back but has been released into the care of his sexy sister for whom he harbors strong incestual feelings (Franco himself plays the psychiatrist who releases him). The other is a gardener who is always laughing maniacally and coincidentally wielding the exact same implement that has just been used to kill the latest victim. The best thing I can say about this movie it is it is so over-the-top with its dumb victims, obvious red herrings, and ridiculously gory murders that it might have actually meant to be a parody of the slasher film. It also has some competent cinematography and is relatively zoom free. It's certainly not the WORST film Franco ever made.","user":"lazarillo","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"a must for Francophiles","rating":13,"date":"13 August 2000","review":"okay, so this isn't as good as most Italian Gialli, but to be fair, it is head and shoulders above 90% of American slashers of the early-mid 80's.<br><br>Jess Franco certainly delivers the goods with this one, with lots of bloody stabbings (including a girl stabbed in the back, the knife protruding through her nipple), strangulations, a hedge trimer attack, and an awesome band saw decapitation. the German title of this film is \"die sage des todes\" which translates into \"the saw of death\" so they must have been impressed too. it's not too original, the basic \"girl stalked by a sex maniac\" but, Franco filters the standard formula through his own twisted vision and throws in some incest to keep things lively. also, the film ends with a great twist,twist ending that wraps things up nicely, no sequal here! be on the look out for the Franco Cameo at the beginning of the film, he's the doctor.","user":"sangue","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Great slasher film.","rating":7,"date":"1 October 2003","review":"\"Bloody Moon\" is a great slasher film from the master of exploitation Jesus Franco.The plot is obviously inspired by \"Halloween\" and \"Friday the 13th\".The acting is pretty average,but there is plenty of gore to satisfy fans of splatter.There is for example very bloody power saw decapitation plus some other killings which involve chainsaws,razorblades and knives.The music score is pretty appalling and the film's theme tune is incredibly annoying.Overall,the film is moderately entertaining,so if you're a Franco fan give this one a look. Here is the plot:\"Bloody Moon\" takes place in a Spanish language school,where pretty female students are murdered by an unidentified stalker in a variety of grisly ways.","user":"HumanoidOfFlesh","rank":[12,16]}]
