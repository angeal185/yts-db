[{"title":"Are you afraid?","rating":10,"date":"26 July 2005","review":"Seen when I was very young, this \"made for TV\" movie became the vehicle which drove all my fears. These fears, once irrational, were validated one unforgettable night. Up until that night, during bedtime, it was only instinct when I asked my mom to leave the hall light on. After seeing this movie, I had an image, and the creepiest music to plead with her not to never turn it off again! This movie plays right into those dark corners of legend. Why we don't just reach under the bed without looking first. Why, as we lay awake, closet doors need to be constantly observed. I was eight years old, and truly ripe for the scare of my life!<br><br>The movie begins with a cats meow and haunting music. The score of this movie is absolutely penetrating and perfect. This is not an overstatement. I can think of very few I would call it's equal. This music accompanies Sally (Kim Darby from True Grit) as she unwittingly, and unknowingly, sets free demons from a bricked up fireplace. They set about, slipping through the dark corners (and there's plenty of them), searching to get Sally's soul. Sally is isolated and alone. As frightening events start to mount up, and with no support from her workaholic husband, Sally begins to doubt her sanity.<br><br>Darby has a quiet demeanor that lends itself to her rising panic. When the \"creatures\" do finally appear, they seem to have come straight from a casting call from hell. The ending is absolutely unforgettable. I am far from alone in the opinion that \"Dark\" made quite an impact for it's time.<br><br>I am now 40. Don't like to have ANY lights on when I sleep. Can watch this film, or any other horror flick without strategically placing a body part to obscure the view. However, a few slight noises.....a scratch or a whisper, and my defenses still go up. The blanket is always on the ready. All because of a few film makers decided to take \"TV movies\" seriously. I thank them. I think.","user":"SimplySteve","rank":[74,80]},{"title":"Things that go bump in the night can be very scary!","rating":8,"date":"21 May 1999","review":"I'll always remember when the first advertisement for this movie was shown. It was on the old ABC Wednesday Movie of the Week (1973) and came right after the flick for that week ended with the announcer saying \"Next on the ABC Wednesday movie of the Week\". A clip of William Demarest telling Kim Darby \"Some things are better off left alone\" then a few other quick clips concluding with the announcer saying \"Don't be Afraid of the Dark\" as a lit Flashlight in pitch blackness is snatched up by something which the viewer is given only an eyeblink glimpse of. WOW!   It was definitely worth the week long wait. This was hands down the scariest Things that go bump in the night made for TV movie ever!    Throughout the years it's amazing how many people I've met have seen and remember this movie. Sometimes all it takes is to say \"Did you ever see the movie with the guy who played Uncle Charlie from My Three Sons\" and they'll immediately say \"DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK.\"!","user":"yenlo","rank":[44,48]},{"title":"Childhood trauma-inducer","rating":28,"date":"28 August 2002","review":"I saw this when I was 8 years old, and whenever someone asks me what the scariest movie I've ever seen is, I tell them about this one, but nobody seems to know what I'm talking about!  I'm so glad to see that I'm not the only one who saw it and was creeped out! Another movie from those days that had the same effect was \"Trilogy of Terror,\" when Karen Black gets a Zuni fetish doll in the mail and it comes to life and chases her around her apartment---both these movies had a profound effect on how I looked at staircases and other places where little creepy things could be hiding. I'm looking forward to the remake.","user":"eaphelps","rank":[46,52]}]
