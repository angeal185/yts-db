[{"title":"Wtf did I just watch","rating":1,"date":"10 August 2017","review":"This was by far the worst movie I have ever watched. I was bored and it was on Netflix. But dude!!!!! Just awful. Whoever rated this movie as 10's clearly are morons or they worked on the film and trying to boost the rating. The movie is just non stop stupid. If I could give it a negative number I would. It's just really bad. Not a single person in this movie should ever be in another movie and they should be ashamed for making this one. It's just so awful, makes no sense, and is a complete waste of time.","user":"smicyus","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"The most wonderfully horrible movie ever made","rating":1,"date":"12 August 2017","review":"I don't know any other way to put it. This movie isn't just bad, it's shockingly bad. It's wonderful in it's horribleness.<br><br>The raw acting talent of the foliage on the set are matched only by Mindy Robinson's cleavage. <br><br>The special effects are so bad that it makes a low-budget SciFy channel movie look like the latest Roland Emmerich mega flick. <br><br>And the dialog, well, I think I can give it a pass based on the assumption that each scene was written by a different person just minutes after the previous scene was shot.<br><br>All of this could be forgiven were it not for the fact that the entire story is just disjointed, doesn't resolve anything, and didn't appear to be going anywhere anyway.","user":"jd-creativeguy","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"I'm a former Marine... disgraceful.","rating":1,"date":"22 September 2018","review":"This is quite possibly the most disgraceful, unrealistic film I've ever seen in my life depicting military in general, let alone my proud Corps. Trust me skip this.","user":"Rattrapk-124-544812","rank":[4,4]}]
