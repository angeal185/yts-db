[{"title":"It's not perfect!","rating":7,"date":"1 August 2018","review":"Tonight I choose to check this film out. Honestly, anything A24 releases is always good! That said, I really liked this film. However, it's not perfect. I really didn't understand the main characters initial motivation for why he was doing, what he was doing, girl aside. His thirsty choices didn't really make much sense to me. <br><br>However, on the technical aspect of the movie. I really loved the flow of the film and the editing. Also, the soundtrack is sweet! the cinematography, colour, and acting was spot on. This is a film I would still recommend and would give it another watch even with the minor flaws. Because it's entertaining and has a real summer nostalgic, crime, a dark coming of age feel to it. <br><br>I'd give this a 7 out of 10.","user":"CreativeSpark","rank":[39,43]},{"title":"Stylish but shallow","rating":4,"date":"1 September 2018","review":"If given some other writer's screenplay and a directive to restrain himself, director Elijah Bynum could probably make an excellent film. It's true that he blatantly rips off other directors here (Martin Scorsese and P.T. Anderson, most notably), but in doing so it's undeniable that he has proficiency and panache with a camera and, more importantly, a fine ability to work with actors. I'm sure he'll earn an opportunity to direct a second picture soon; although this movie was a critical failure, I can see this being a big hit with the teenagers it's clearly intended for.<br><br>The flaws of Hot Summer Nights all derive from its erratic screenplay, which is derivative, juvenile, and incredibly hollow. Bynum has chosen to have the film be narrated by a mostly unseen fringe character--a 13-year-old with a preternatural omniscience concerning the town's gossip. This narration is obnoxious and unnecessary--the best stretch of the movie is the 50 minutes or so where the narration disappears completely--and all it yields are unfunny riffs on sex that belittle the movie's female lead; an air of legendary, larger-than-life status that doesn't quite match the actual movie we're presented; and some incredibly trite observations about class consciousness in a New England tourist town. <br><br>That last one is worth thinking about for a moment. The film is introduced as a conflict between haves and have-nots, with townies opposed to summerbirds in a vein similar to Breaking Away or The Outsiders. We're shown preppily dressed vacationers with \"white clothes and white teeth,\" and we're meant to focus on the advantages these privileged people have over our main characters. But the division as presented in this film never rises above mere cliquishness. There's no real material difference that's ever explored in any meaningful way--which is to say, even the \"townies\" seem pretty well-off to me.<br><br>That's one thread that never goes anywhere, but if you start pulling at that thread then the whole thing starts to unravel and you realize you've just got a pile of old rags that was temporarily gussied up to look like something more impressive. Bynum knows how to blend impressive camerawork, solid performances, and a fun soundtrack into something entertaining, but he's put extremely little effort into developing his characters or crafting a meaningful story. That's a shame because Timothée Chalamet, Maika Monroe, Emory Cohen, and the rest of the cast are all very talented and compelling young actors. They nearly succeed in making it seem as though their characters have plausible motivations and consistent personalities, when ultimately what's really going on here is that Bynum just wanted to remake Goodfellas with teenagers.<br><br>What drives Daniel Middleton? What does his father's death really have to do with anything? Why does he make the reckless decisions that he does in spite of sound advice to the contrary? What exactly is he trying to prove? What other paths are there for him in life? What other desires, interests, fears, and influences does he have? If you start trying to understand Daniel's character, you see that there's absolutely nothing beneath the surface. Likewise with McKayla. Hunter is given a sliver of nuance, but the action climax--which steals directly from Boogie Nights and Goodfellas--renders all of that moot. This is a movie in which the last word will be given to a 13-year-old speaking wistfully about his sex fantasies. Stand By Me this ain't.","user":"nehpetstephen","rank":[45,56]},{"title":"A '90s-esque coming of age story goes dark","rating":9,"date":"28 July 2018","review":"When a story focuses on a central character coming of age, I'm immediately hooked. With the addition of the backdrop of the film being set in the 90s, that only added to my excitement. Hot Summer Nights is one of A24's latest distributions and this studio has had quite the track record over the last few years. Personally, I believe this film will be one of their most polarizing releases of 2018, but I think it's a fantastic little indie gem. If you enjoy stories of an innocent youngster who gets swept up in something they think they can handle but really is about to ruin their life, then this film is absolutely something I would recommend to you. Here's why I highly recommend Hot Summer Nights, but also why that recommendation may come with an asterisk for some viewers.<br><br>Following Daniel (Timothée Chalamet) as he spends his scorching hot summer in Cape Cod, he finds himself caught up in drug dealing, an unlikely relationship, and no way out of either. Both of those things find a relation to each other and spiral into an overall film that feels like a fun 90s flick, meshed with the harsh realities of underground drug deals. The premise of this film is what truly hooked me and although the storytelling itself is quite conventional, the execution kind of blew me away. From the performances to the surprises, Hot Summer Nights is a film that doesn't let up, even with its slow pacing.<br><br>Timothée Chalamet continues to prove himself as an actor and this role is nothing short of superb. Even if this film isn't for you, I have a feeling you'd still praise him in this role. His performance, along with his chemistry with both Maika Monroe (who is also as fantastic as she always is) and Alex Roe is simply electric. From the subtleties he brings to this character, to the raw and unnerving outbursts in certain sequences, Chalamet creates one of the most memorable characters of the year, in my opinion. If you're able to enjoy a film by the core performance alone, then I think you'll love this film as I did. Outside of this character, however, is where I fear some viewers may become uninterested or bored.<br><br>There are a lot of moments of characters just hanging out and spilling their life stories, but it works in the context of the film. There are some viewers who will absolutely find these conversations boring, but I was blown away by the performances, so that wasn't an issue for me. There are slow movies that I find boring, but when dialogue can drive it and make for an exciting, slow, yet dramatic experience, that's my kind of movie. So here's where I caution viewers. If you aren't willing to be swept up in a film that's filled with dialogue and not much excitement (for the majority at least), then I would look elsewhere, but personally, I think you'd be missing out.<br><br>In the end, Hot Summer Nights is easily one of my favourite movies so far in 2018. The dramatic tension between characters completely sucked me in. Chalamet leaps off the screen and the very solid writing and direction by first-time feature filmmaker Elijah Bynum is something worth noting as well. I will definitely be on the lookout for his next outing. Hot Summer Nights is a true story for the most part, but you can tell that things have probably been tweaked to make for a better film. This film will probably go unnoticed by most, and that's a shame. I loved my experience with this movie and I can't wait to revisit it.","user":"kjproulx","rank":[24,31]}]
