[{"title":"Good little film. Enjoyed it. Good script.","rating":6,"date":"10 November 2018","review":"The story was good, the script as well. Acting was very good. Cinematography, editing, production design were not developed and merely technical, which was a pity as they took away from the good acting instead of propelling it..<br><br>Other reviewers are hung up on the religious aspect. To me it was not so much about religion as it was about a person's convictions being tested.<br><br>Well done to the actors.","user":"DroogEditor","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Cheaply produced, but well made.","rating":6,"date":"11 November 2018","review":"The story of the Pastor and the Pro is much better than the seeming intrigue of the set up. The performances of the main stars are pretty good. Campbell is believable in the role of a working girl trying to tempt a virginal pastor, and Cox plays a convincing single pastor torn between holiness and self righteousness. The extras are cartoonish and the production quality is poor, but the writing is pretty strong. The struggles of the main characters seem real and their responses seem true to the characters. The movie was very funny, but not the farce that the title would suggest. The use of dramatic irony is funny and effective. A couple of the jokes don't land, but I feel that is more an issue of the edit and sound quality than of the writing, acting or directing. All in all, one of the better low budget, faith focused films I have seen.","user":"chipsqueak","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Totally Different","rating":9,"date":"1 February 2019","review":"I was curious about this movie based on the title, with low expectations.<br><br>Very pleasant surprise. Female lead was great with a lot of witty clever lines, making for an interesting combination of humor and drama.","user":"bshpx-01456","rank":[4,4]}]
