[{"title":"Garbage","rating":1,"date":"17 January 2019","review":"This movie is garbage wtf. It went 0-100 real quick . Hardly showed any of their relationship or them getting to know each other. Literally, one date, kissing. Fine. Next date at the cabin, \"oh I like you so much blah blah\". Then out of nowhere, BOOM, he's crazy and stalking her at her house and the babysitter's. So much left out. So many questions. Waste of time. Horrible movie.","user":"dep-93","rank":[39,47]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"17 January 2019","review":"Don't bother! The acting was awful as was the way they laid the storyline. Sad this was based on true events and they didn't give that poor girl justice by making a decent movie.","user":"knovi","rank":[26,32]},{"title":"The acting was SOOOOOO bad!!!","rating":2,"date":"23 January 2019","review":"This movie had potential, it was based on a true events of a woman who suffered a great ordeal at the hands of an abusive man.<br><br>The actress was SOOOOO bad it made this \"suspenseful\" movie a comedy. This entire movie was rushed. I mean.... David telling her that they were a match made in heaven after the first date? Come on! Give me a break. The only time the actress was good was when she was playing dead.","user":"yarixac","rank":[23,29]}]
