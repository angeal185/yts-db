[{"title":"On My List of \"Top 10\" Westerns","rating":9,"date":"27 March 2005","review":"Although a small movie, \"The Culpepper Cattle Company\" is arguably one of the top ten westerns of all time. It takes a fairly basic but relevant coming of age story and sets it in the American West. But the \"been there-done that\" stuff gives way to something that has extremely heavy Peckinpah influences. Like \"The Wild Bunch\" (and Bo Hopkins gets to reprise his Clarence \"Crazy\" Lee role) this becomes a violent anti-violence film with blurred lines between \"good guy\" and \"bad guy\". As with Peckinpah's \"Straw Dogs\", moral ambiguity is the theme and it is not until near the end that the four drovers, pressed to finally take a moral stand, redeem themselves with a final act of personal responsibility. <br><br>In addition to a good characterization from Hopkins, Geoffry Lewis plays the wrapped a little too tight \"Russ\" with an over-the-top Gary Oldman-like flare, and Luke Askew does a masterful job as the drover who provides early clues that these are four guys who have had to subordinate their basic goodness in order to survive in this environment. Billy Green Bush plays \"Frank Culpepper\" who remains focused on business to the exclusion of any lost causes. Bush played the likable \"Elton\" in \"Five Easy Pieces\" who was responsible for the classic Nicholson line: \"don't tell me about the good life Elton, the good life makes me want to puke\".<br><br>Also exceptional is the cinematography and the production design. Back in the ancient 1970's, only the high budget pictures had production designers. The others had to rely on the cinematographer to make sure the art director, the set designer, and the make-up/costume people were all on the same page; so that the picture had a consistent look. Ralph Woolsey was one of the better cinematographers at keeping all these elements under control.<br><br>It became popular after Robert Altman's \"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\" (1971) to replace the well-scrubbed Roy Rogers look and portray the west as dirty, dusty, gritty, unshaven, and tattered. Woolsey eagerly embraced this realism in 1972 and gave us two of the grimiest features we are likely to see; the excellent \"Culpepper Cattle Company\" and the somewhat lame \"Dirty Little Billy\".<br><br>The shootout scene in the saloon (midway into the film) is more climatic than the final scene. Not until \"The Unforgiven\" has there been so much action-so fast-on such a tiny set; yet Woolsey captured it all and the post-production people assembled it into a neat and logically sequenced package. So you can follow the whole thing with very little confusion.","user":"aimless-46","rank":[39,42]},{"title":"True look at the Old West","rating":10,"date":"26 November 1998","review":"I feel this is possibly the best Western I have ever seen.  It portrays gritty people with simple outlooks to life. I believe this must truly show what the west was like - simple, rough, dirty, bad fitting clothes, etc.  I was raised on Disney movies and when you compare this to them you get a real feel for what happens when a kid decides to chase a dream in the world of adults.  My favorite line is when the kid tells one of the cowboys that being a cowboy is the greatest job in the world.  The guy responds, \" Kid, being a cowboy is what you do when you can't do anything else\".<br><br>I suggest this as required viewing for anyone with an interest in the Old West.","user":"TonyMan","rank":[29,32]},{"title":"very well done and largely unheralded","rating":8,"date":"30 January 2005","review":"I first saw this film in the 70s, and ranked it as one of the best westerns I'd ever seen. Watching it again 25 years later, it's as good as ever. The performances are great across the board, and the story, characters, and photography have a hard edge that gives the whole thing an air of authenticity. This is how I imagine the real west must have been: a tough life, with quick and often violent justice and retribution. It hardly ever shows up on TV, which I can't understand.<br><br>The performances of Geoffrey Lewis and Billy Green Bush are spot-on. I couldn't believe this was one of Lewis' first movies; he portrays the semi-psychotic Russ Caldwell perfectly.<br><br>As mentioned in other reviews, the climax is slightly flawed, abrupt and stretches credibility a bit, but it's still effective. I would have liked one more final scene with the Kid and Frank, though.","user":"bjguilfoyle","rank":[9,9]}]
