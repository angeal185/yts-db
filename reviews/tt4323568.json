[{"title":"Wow. Powerful. Raw.","rating":10,"date":"22 September 2018","review":"I had no idea what to expect when I watched this movie. All I knew what the title and some cast. The writing was so real &amp; raw. The format of the side by side frames was brilliant. Rather than a back &amp; forth we saw the emotion in real time. The ending was unexpected &amp; I felt the powerful message of forgiveness. The teen actor portrayed pure raw feelings of guilt that invaded his soul. The boy was lost in the unknown &amp; in the moment of finding out who it was, he made the decision to face what he did. If only this would be a reality. But for the purposes of a movie, it's a great movie for teens &amp; youth groups to watch for an open dialogue about gun violence. The consequences of our actions. The ripple effect of violence &amp; even accidents. It's worth a watch for all ages.","user":"reddawn329","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"love the heartbeat","rating":8,"date":"19 July 2018","review":"Love this story shown from both sides of a tragic accident, and dealing with the fallout and new hand\"s\".\nI absolutely fell in love with the song, lyrics by Jeremy Kagan, sung by Johnny Hawthorn, Love provides at the close.

The acting is well done but the storyline, starting with good intentions ends up being more Hollywood than LA. All in all it makes an important point about all those involved in a pointless shooting even though the final scene is totally ridiculous. (Why does it take forever for the wife to get out the bedroom?)","user":"bubbakid","rank":[2,7]}]
