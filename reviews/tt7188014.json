[{"title":"More Horrible than you can Imagine","rating":1,"date":"19 May 2019","review":"OMG. This movie was clearly make without union knowledge. It's filmed in parking lots and on the street so no permits were neededas well. The entire production is under the table.<br><br>It's cheaper than cheap. How much did they pay Jay Mohr to show up for 10 seconds?","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Rather watch paint dry ....","rating":1,"date":"28 February 2020","review":"Someone actually wrote this nightmare ! It was produced by no less than 16 mugs ranging from \"producer\" to \"executive producer\" to \"co-executive producer\" etc. etc. How much they got back for their investment only their accountants know, but not much by the looks of it! PLEASE avoid this garbage unless you are masochists ... Is this how LOW Hollywood has sunk ?","user":"adabsiz","rank":[0,0]}]
