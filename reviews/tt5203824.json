[{"title":"Should be mandatory viewing, not that it will make any difference in this corrupted world.","rating":8,"date":"3 March 2019","review":"For the quality of the documentary it deserves a high rating. It's extremely well done, with tons of data that are easy to understand as it's all well explained. The documentary itself is not something that will cheer you up, quite the contrary, as we're all just witnessing how we slowly, if you can call slowly a century in earth's time, destroying our planet by poluting it like there is no tomorrow. Recycling is the only solution. Banishing plastic completely would be better but we all know that's just utopic as there is too much money involved. The negative reviewers on here just prove that stupidity is all around us and it's not going to get better as the population will reach 10 billion by 2050, and so tons and tons of more polution. Glad I have no children.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"I don't have an agenda","rating":7,"date":"26 January 2018","review":"I mainly enjoyed the documentary, could be a bit more well produced though. It should be, in my opinion, more about the plastic in the ocean per se, the consequences, direct and indirect, the study cases (and there are thousands of those), as it was in the first part, and less about the human self-destruction with garbage (2nd part).<br><br>All in all this documentary is a 50% of good scientific proof of the damage plastic is to our environment/our possible future, and 50% of opinion journalism. I don't dislike the opinions, but most are uninformed and there are some scientific errors here and there.<br><br>Still I give it a positive review, as it can achieve its goal into showing people what our mindless action can do to the environment and, in the midle/long term, to us! I would recommend it, but be aware of some sensasionalistic opinions.","user":"Alexandregbarata","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Impeccable !
