[{"title":"I loved it!","rating":2,"date":"2 October 2013","review":"This film tells the story of two dancers who dance their way to their dreams despite the adverse circumstances around them.<br><br>I have not heard about this film before watching it, but I was blown away by the whole experience. First, I was impressed by the diversity of the cast. Asians have always been underrepresented in American films, and \"Make Your Move\" gives the scene a refreshing change. The dance scenes are consistently impressive, energetic and vibrant, delivering a wow factor like no other dance film I have watched. <br><br>The two leading characters are charming and beautiful. They do look like a couple! BoA is really beautiful, and she can really dance. \"Make Your Move\"well consolidate her superstar status in Asia, and hopefully break her into the Western market.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[21,31]},{"title":"Could be better but satisfied.","rating":9,"date":"7 January 2014","review":"Before watching this movie, I expected nothing but dances, it did not disappoint me. We all know what BoA and Derek Dough can do. It makes you wonder what chemistry an Asian pop star can make with a ballroom dancing master. <br><br>This movie has given modern dances a new definition. It is not an era with just hip hop dances anymore. It shows you tap dances and dances with drums(Cobu) could be the next \"hit thing\" as well. <br><br>Let's be frank though, the story is weak, like I expected. Characters have minimal interactions, I almost couldn't feel the relationship between them. If you are looking for a movie with a well organized flow of story line, sorry you can probably skip this title. <br><br>It really depends on which perspective you use to view a movie, to decide whether or not it's worth your time. I watched this movie entirely for the chronography, and of course, BoA and Derek Dough. If that's something you are looking for as well? Go for it.","user":"shui_yu_jai","rank":[12,18]},{"title":"Cheesy story, not really worth watching unless really bored","rating":3,"date":"2 May 2014","review":"I am rather disappointed. I knew before watching that it's going to be a cheesy romeo and juliet plot but i expected there to be at least some sparkle. Unfortunately... The movie is made up of loads of indoor scenes which are not NY at all, plus couple aerial views of the bridges and a shot where Derek in the Borough Hall/Court Street area. Okay, the dance moves were fun and cool from time to time but not new or brilliant, with the production team and actors that the movie had, I expected much more. Derek Hough and BoA are both cute, but no they cannot act. They just do not have that sense of presence, at least not in this movie. BoA obviously is not a native English speaker, which fits her role, but she tries too hard to be effortless and smooth, and that makes her lines mono-toned. U-know's guest appearance totally disappointed me as well, that act could never be a headline in any club and definitely not up to standards of a dance movie. In real life, I doubt any club owner would fly such dancer all the way from Korea. That suit vest thing showing his chubby arms are making the scene even worse. Last but not the least, that pony-tail guy totally reminded me of Maria in the film \"Din Taoï¼šLeader of the Parade\"... I'm not giving the movie a one -star just because it was fun running into the crew in W Hotel two years ago...","user":"loklinspirit","rank":[9,14]}]
