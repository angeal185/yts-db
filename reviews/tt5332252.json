[{"title":"Thank you all!","rating":10,"date":"11 February 2017","review":"I wanted to personally thank everyone that has watched the film. Your support and views of the film on Amazon are appreciated. And I invited others to screen and review. (You can watch directly from IMDb)<br><br>The film was shot on a micro-budget with professional and amateur actors from Los Angeles, Chicago and Indiana. Principal photography was done in and around Warsaw and Goshen, Indiana. We were also fortunate to have great music done for the soundtrack by Lotus, Luke the Knife, Steel Wheels, Beard o' Bees, Amelia Eisenhauer, The Motet and more. Clocking in at just under an hour we feel so lucky that a project of this scope and length has found a home on Amazon. As independent content producers it is wonderful to see the landscape evening out. Thanks for supporting indie film!","user":"brent-kado","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"Terrible Attempt at a film","rating":1,"date":"3 April 2020","review":"OMG I LOVE and support indie films 100% but this was sad to watch. The poor guy who thinks this movie of his is the greatest thing, is completely diluted and has wrapped himself in \"yes men\" and people on his payroll. There's no continuity to this poorly acted, erratically edited and confusingly directed \"film\". It really has the feel of a grade 6 school assignment that received a failing mark ... sorry buy back to summer school.","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[1,2]}]
