[{"title":"Visually stunning","rating":6,"date":"6 January 2016","review":"I sought this out because of my love for View From A Blue Moon. While that one really affected me and I found riveting with its sunning blend of imagery and sound, this one I was less taken aback by. The images are nice, but they do not compare to surfing in the ocean. That is definitely not fair, since this was never going to be like that film, but I guess I am comparing them because both were films that were based on one person's intense passion and sport. I do think the music here was quite good, even if I was hoping for a different genre and selection of music. Ultimately, there's not much more to say about it. This kind of film will only appeal to a very specific type of group, and no doubt they will enjoy themselves.","user":"Red_Identity","rank":[0,0]}]
