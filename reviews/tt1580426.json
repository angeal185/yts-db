[{"title":"A real good watch........Great ending to.","rating":8,"date":"7 August 2011","review":"Just saw this and thought I would give it a review as it entertained me. There is a lot of hardcore scenes due to one characters O.T.T. maniac tendencies. It really is enjoyable and reaches full speed at an admirable pace. I won't bother re-rewriting the plot synopsis posted with the film, just tell you that you can expect all the same rules as the Bill Murray film about the same situation, just here we see a more sinister side to the event. We also have three very troubled people trying to figure out why this is happening to them, on this day. The climax is cool and don't turn your head too soon when you see the first credits role.OK?","user":"suissenavy","rank":[37,54]},{"title":"Old Storyline, Great Story of Redemption, Awful Twist in the Last Scene","rating":8,"date":"20 November 2012","review":"In Mission City, Kyle Halsted (Dustin Milligan), Sonia Logan (Amanda Crew) and Michael \"Mike\" Weeks (Richard de Klerk) are interned in a rehabilitation facility run by Bob Simpson (Benjamin Ratner). One Wednesday, they have a pass to go outside the site and Kyle visits his sister Charlotte Halsted (Alexia Fast) at the Mission Secondary School but she does not talk to him. Sonia goes to the hospital where her father is terminal, but she does not visit him. Mike visits his father at the Maximum Security Correctional Facility where he is prisoner and the man does not talk to Mike.<br><br>During the night, there is a storm and Kyle, Sonia and Mike have electrical shocks and on the next morning, they awaken on the same day. When they realize that the Wednesday is repeating over and over again, their first reaction is to have fun with dangerous situations. Soon Kyle and Sonia disclose secrets and they decide to use the days to resolve personal issues mending their lives. But Mike decides to route through a criminal life believing that on the next morning, everything would be over.<br><br>A couple of months ago, I started watching \"Repeaters\" on DVD with family and friends at home and we decided to stop. Today I have just watched alone and despite the old storyline of many other movies, I found a great story of redemption of youths that have the chance to rethink their lives and mend their lives. Unfortunately there is an awful twist in the last scene that I prefer to ignore. The question is, what would the writer and the director be thinking including such stupid last scene? A sequel? My vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Labirinto do Tempo\" (\"Time Labyrinth\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[15,21]},{"title":"Like Groundhog Day on Halloween","rating":8,"date":"18 October 2014","review":"Yes, it is impossible to talk about Repeaters without mentioning Groundhog Day - a charming family film where a sardonic Bill Murray has to relive the same dull day again and again until he can find a way of somehow - literally - moving his life forwards.<br><br>Groundhog Day was a happy-go-lucky sort of affair, filled with light-hearted 'what if' scenarios. Here, in 'Repeaters,' we're presented with a similar premise, i.e. what happens if you're stuck in a day. However, the results are far from Groundhog-like.<br><br>This time there are three central characters who keep reliving the same day and they're all in a recovery centre, trying to get over various addictions. Then, once they discover their new 'power,' they hardly use it to help the homeless. Therefore we're treated to what people with very dubious morals would do if their day had absolutely no consequences whatsoever.<br><br>It's a great film. The performances are perfect from all characters, the setting it suitably gritty and it's not too long. However, it's not one for the faint-hearted. It covers pretty much all the nastiest adult themes you can think of, so, if you're looking for a 'feel-good' kind of movie, you better steer clear.<br><br>Bottom line: Groundhog Day + comedy = Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day + action = Source Code, whereas Groundhog Day and nastiness = Repeaters. Not one for everyone, but if you're looking for some gritty sci-fi/thriller, definitely give this one a go.","user":"bowmanblue","rank":[13,18]}]
