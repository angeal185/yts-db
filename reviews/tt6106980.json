[{"title":"A Colorful & Honest Love Story","rating":10,"date":"11 April 2019","review":"Saw this movie last night with my lady. Really enjoyed it! Easy to put yourself in the shoes of these characters. We can all relate to the experience of being really into some one who may not be that into you (or the other way around). There is an artistic touch to the way this story is told that can't be ignored. Excited to see what Ann Lupo does next.","user":"krismoorenyc","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"Relatable and magical","rating":10,"date":"5 April 2019","review":"Most relatable love story i've ever seen! Plus wildly imaginative. Lupo is a star!","user":"holly-10501","rank":[7,13]},{"title":"Thought-provoking and fun to watch","rating":10,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"Ann's vulnerability and authenticity make the movie as entertaining as it is thought-provoking, and totally original. It's very \"real\"- deserving of its title!","user":"franktheanteater","rank":[4,8]}]
