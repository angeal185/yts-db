This one was fun and well filmed. In my opinion, this pleasantly made slasher film had very little faults. I liked the mystery behind it as well, it did a great job at keeping the reveal of the film a secret. Mostly the mystery surrounding the killer's identity or if it was something supernatural. Great job to all involved!!","user":"kyleallencole9","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"It's terrible but it's still fun","rating":6,"date":"22 January 2019","review":"I had a fun time with it, my prewife disagrees. It's dumb but in a good way. Have a laugh and watch!","user":"saphira_dragon-80270","rank":[6,10]}]
