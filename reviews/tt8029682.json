[{"title":"Failing Grade!","rating":2,"date":"10 March 2018","review":"Trust me, I love a good Lifetime movie. This is not one of them. Bad acting. Worse storyline. Totally implausible, even for Lifetime. This is a fail.Big time!","user":"Lucystone91","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Laughable","rating":1,"date":"30 August 2018","review":"Worst acting. How is the Lifetime channel still on with these pathetic shows. Who is funding this garbage?\nCouple breaks into home and he heads staright for a kitchen cabinet first. LOL. Then, the husband opens a wooden box and says Kelly or whatever her name is, he's stockpiling for something. In the box is a Dremel tool and prescription bottle. Oh man, I am tearing up laughing.","user":"chiltonjh","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Nothing we haven't seen before, but likely way better","rating":2,"date":"24 June 2018","review":"This movie is one of the many Lifetime thriller movies we have seen a lot of times with some love violent weirdo who is calm and sweet from the outside and totally disturbed on the inside. This is the basic content of \"Bad Tutor\".\nI think the casting of Alex Frnka is the biggest let down and mistake of this movie. Her lips and teeth are creepy to look at and the way she is acting is like in a kindegarden / high school play. With her the movie falls to a cheap unprofessional\nproduction which isn't worth watching this one more than once and should just disappear in an archive. Vanessa Marcil isn't her best too in \"Bad Tutor\" but it's something you can overlook because the distraction is more by Alex Frnka. The story is acceptable but has its illogical moments and holes. I wouldn't really recommend it","user":"CarfelMA","rank":[6,8]}]
