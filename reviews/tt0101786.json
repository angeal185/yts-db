[{"title":"When you need comedy, you get Ed O'Neill!","rating":22,"date":"22 July 2004","review":"Dutch is fantastic because Ed O'Neill, the star of the movie, is a fantastic comedian, and an underrated one at that (but then again, Hollywood does recycle the same cast over and over, so it's no surprised you never see him in too many major motion pictures). And though Christopher MacDonald, who play's Doyle's father is a real creep, he is a great comedian as well, and you just can't help to laugh whenever this guy is around (uh...that's a good thing).<br><br>This is the early part of John Hughes's transition into strictly doing family films. He passed the teenage films (the brat pack series), then films with slightly younger supporting and main casts (Uncle Buck, Curly Sue, Dutch), and then went straight for the youngest-aged family film series (Home Alone, Baby's Day Out, etc). The early part of the John Hughes family film series, which started somewhere around 1989/1990 and continued into the early 90s, are comedies that I still enjoy watching (I haven't cared to watch many of his later movies because Baby's Day Out and Beethoven, etc. just doesn't interest me). They had two great elements: the social commentary (though it tends to be repeated in many of his films/screenplays), and the comedy element. <br><br>Disappointed that his father (Christopher MacDonald) is in London (on a supposed \"business trip\", which translates into a holiday with a woman instead of his son) and won't be spending time with him on Thanskgiving, spoiled-brat Doyle (Ethan Embry) decides that he doesn't want to spend the holiday with his mother, either. They don't get along well, especially considering he is more like a mirror of his incredibly obnoxious father, while his mother (Jo Beth Williams) is a sensitive, kinder woman who just wants to get along with her son. Don't worry, 'Dutch' is on the case!<br><br>\nDutch (Ed O'Neill) is sort of a bafoon character (as we see from the introduction at the party where he engages in something like a mini version of Peter Sellers in 'The Party'). But, he's a good-natured fellow with a heart of gold. He'd have to be to make a promise to Doyle's mom that he'd bring the boy home for the holidays (Doyle goes to private school).<br><br>\nIt proves to be no easy task. Not at all. Since Doyle doesn't want to come home at all, let alone with his mother's goofy boyfriend. Doyle despises Dutch because Doyle comes from major money (Dutch works in construction) and sees himself as a much classier person than Dutch (who can get pretty gross when he wants...if only to annoy Doyle). But, Dutch is going to do whatever it takes (and it takes a lot) not only to keep his promise to Doyle's mother, but to try and get the tense little boy to lighten up and see that the world is not entirely against him. So there, you have the typical elements of Hughest: 1) social commentary via class divisions; and 2) unecessary youth angst. <br><br>With a guy like Ed O'Neill, who even offers some great slapstick comedy, you can be sure that you'll be in for a lot of laughs. This guy truly is one underrated actor.","user":"vertigo_14","rank":[26,30]},{"title":"Excellent comedy about an unlikely friendship between a teenage boy and his mother's boyfriend","rating":9,"date":"25 July 2006","review":"DUTCH, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy about an unlikely friendship between a teenage boy and his mother's boyfriend. If you ask me, Doyle (Ethan Randall) was an absolute snob! That kid really need to learn respect! However, in my opinion, every mishap that occurred on his journey home with Dutch (Ed O'Neill) was absolutely hilarious. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, and production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this comedy about an unlikely friendship between a teenage boy and his mother's boyfriend.","user":"Catherine_Grace_Zeh","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"I can do something you can't...pay for my breakfast...","rating":12,"date":"12 February 2004","review":"Although it has similarities to 'Trains, Planes and Automobiles', it is absolutely original.  The two lead characters work so well together and off one another that it's hard to remember sometimes, Ethan Randall is just acting.<br><br>Basic Plot: Dutch (O'Neil), is dating a beautiful rich woman who is going through a separation with her well-to-do husband.  She has a son named Doyle (Randall), who attends a boarding school far enough away from home, he has been requested to come home for Thanksgiving, by plane.  He declines, and refuses to see his mother for the holidays. Instead of getting upset, she sends her, 'heart's bigger than his brain' for a boyfriend by car to go get her hurtful son.  Once he arrives, he finds that this twelve year old is more problem than expected, and the road-trip that leads them from where they began to where they end up, is a truly heart-warming and funny story.<br><br>Hughes brings us characters in this that make you feel for them all.  As in all of his films, for the most part, but to a certain degree even more so in this.  A gradual escalation from hateful to loving, from cold to warm, and from angry to happy.  It's most assuredly one of the best scripts ever written.<br><br>I give it a 9 out of 10 (10 being the highest). I don't give it a full ten, because there are some slow scenes, I could have done without, but they do help the movie keep its sincerity.<br><br>And that's my review.","user":"Pookyiscute","rank":[18,21]}]
