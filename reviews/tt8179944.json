Want to know where they got this kid!","user":"horrorcon7","rank":[11,19]},{"title":"Very david lynch.I found the movie mesmerizing.","rating":6,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"Simone policano is one f the main reasons to see this film.She's jsut perfect.The strange tone and odd structure made this for me daring and adventurous.It's a real art-house mindbender.Those other negative reviews are the individuals who line up 4 hours ahead for every damn marvel movie.","user":"dbartkewicz","rank":[10,17]},{"title":"Do not waste your time","rating":1,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"The worst movie ever.
