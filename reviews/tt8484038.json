[{"title":"An insanely terrible movie","rating":1,"date":"23 January 2019","review":"Considering the writer and director has the same last name as the two lead actresses, I'm assuming they are probably his daughters and that this is some sort of vanity project. Since the writer/director is some sort of celebrity chef, though I've never heard of him, I wouldn't be surprised if it was self funded and maybe even filmed in his own house. The acting is subpar on every level from every person in this movie, the script is laughable and sounds like it was written by an alien, and to cap it off, it isn't even creepy or scary in any way. I watched it \"free\" on Amazon Prime and I felt ripped off.","user":"bachemar","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Definitely in my top ten of all time stinkers.","rating":1,"date":"4 January 2019","review":"I saw this movie like a month ago but couldn't rate it then because that option was not available yet at that time. And so I've been checking it every day since then as I felt it was my obligation to warn people on how bad this movie is. I've seen thousands of movies so I don't remember them all, but the once you remember are or really good or really bad. Somnium is so bad you wonder how they managed it to make it so terrible. Joseph Ciminera, the writer/director, didn't search too far for his casting as he used his own daughters to play the main characters. The acting was just terrible, close to the worse I've ever seen before. But not only his daughters, the rest of the cast is also awful. I wonder where Joseph Ciminera got those people from? Maybe he went to his local pub and picked a couple randomly promising them a couple beers if they wanted to appear in his movie. Never mind the story, as it doesn't matter with such awful acting. Actually there is absolutely nothing positive about Somnium, not the story, not the acting, not the sound, not the filming, just nothing. Definitely in my top ten of all time stinkers.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"wise old explorer","rating":10,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"Every time I see that guy (man who told him \"To do nothing\") he is either low-key always playing the wise old explorer.","user":"ayobamiisreal","rank":[2,2]}]
