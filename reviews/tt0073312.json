[{"title":"Underrated Woody Gem","rating":9,"date":"5 May 2004","review":"As a huge Woody Allen fan, I was delighted and surprised by this film.  I have scarcely heard anyone mention it, but for my money it is the single most comically dense of all of Woody's films.  There are so many truly impressive/hilarious/memorable one-liners that I'm amazed people don't quote this movie left and right. The setting, costumes, accents all add to the hilarity of the film--truly reminiscent of a Marx Brothers romp.  Really outstanding among his pre-Annie Hall films.  Only rivaled by Bananas in my opinion for simple laugh value.<br><br>Unlike any other of his films, this deals with his \"deep\" questions of death/metaphysics in an unflaggingly light and comical fashion.  For instance:<br><br>Sonja: But judgment of any system or a priori relation of phenomena exists in any rational or metaphysical or at least epistemological contradiction to an abstracted empirical concept such as being or to be or to occur in the thing itself or of the thing itself.<br><br>Boris: Yeah, I've said that many times.<br><br>Not Woody's \"best\" film (see Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors), but perhaps his most laugh-filled. Satisfying throughout.  I give it a 9/10.","user":"dweis007","rank":[62,66]},{"title":"A thinking comedy","rating":10,"date":"11 May 2001","review":"One of the funniest movies of all time. The War &amp; Peace and Chekov slant gives it a great feel. Allen and Keaton are at their best, and funnier than Grace &amp; Burns, Hepburn &amp; Tracey, etc..<br><br>One of the better lines, \"To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering one must not love, but then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love, to be happy then is to suffer but suffering makes one unhappy, therefore to be unhappy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness. I hope you're getting this down.\"<br><br>This classic comedy is very rarely known, and worth watching it over and over.","user":"muddog123","rank":[54,58]},{"title":"The last of Woody's uneven (but still hilarious) comedies","rating":10,"date":"11 October 2001","review":"\"Love and Death\" is one of my favourite Woody Allen films, right up there with \"Manhattan,\" \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" and \"Deconstructing Harry.\" Sure, the jokes are scattershot and don't always work, but when they do the film is a gut-buster. (\"A tremendous amount of wheat!\") Parodying everything from Russian literature to foreign films (especially those of his beloved Ingmar Bergman), it's also one of Allen's most overtly philosophical films with characters breaking into syllogisms and formal arguments at the most unlikely moments. Students of philosophy should get a kick out of it.<br><br>That said, it is accessible to just about anybody. Almost nobody does fish-out-of-water comedy as well as Woody Allen (see also \"Bananas\" and \"Sleeper\"), and Diane Keaton shines as usual as the promiscuous object of his desire. And look for Jessica Harper in a small role as the cousin who rattles off a convoluted list of romantic entanglements worthy of Chekhov.<br><br>This was the last step of Allen's formative period. After this, his films would get a lot more focused.","user":"craigjclark","rank":[35,38]}]
