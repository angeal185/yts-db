That material is completely missing from the movie. Too much screen time for the Kamli friendship angle. Boring. The drug addiction part dragged on way too long. \nI wouldnt consider this movie a biopic as it was only focused on portraying Sanju as an innocent victim of the unfair media coverage. The guy has repeatedly made bad choices in his life and we are supposed to feel sorry for him. Yaawn. \nMelodramatic background music was annoying. \nRanbir's acting was good though. Would surely win him many awards. \nCant rate it more than 5 stars. but its an ok movie compared to other junk that bollywood churns out.","user":"gokul0801","rank":[161,227]},{"title":"Terrible movie","rating":1,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"Pure fiction.
