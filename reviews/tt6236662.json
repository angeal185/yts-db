[{"title":"Family dynamics woven in a struggling artist theme","rating":9,"date":"15 February 2020","review":"I love watching drama films that dive deep into family dynamics in a real and relatable way. All things together in this film drew me in, which is a big accomplishment for an indie film - the cinematography, directing, writing, acting, and story. Most of us can relate to the themes in this film - coming of age artist trying to find her own voice &amp; place in the world, and parents who think they know best for their kids, giving guidance that comes from their own experiences in life. Hats off to Catherine Dudley-Rose and her team for creating an engaging drama film.","user":"lbruhnca","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Emotional symphony","rating":9,"date":"9 December 2019","review":"I was truly affected by this film. Both musicians, the daughter and the father, were so believable. It's the kind of story that feels lived in, very real. It's a complex and artful film, but quite accessible. Anyone who has ever felt the pressure of a parent or their own ambitions can relate. It's an intelligent, well crafted and beautifully acted film. Musical, both in that it's set in the world of music and also has musical rhythm's in it's structure. I found the movie involving and an emotional tour de force. Bravo!","user":"directortim2012","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"The Power Of She","rating":8,"date":"4 February 2019","review":"This beautifully shot film entices the audience with a father-daughter relationship that wrestles with the balance of one's dreams. The story written and directed by the talented Catherine Dudley-Rose brings elements of parenthood and humanity to light by exploring the strengths and weakness of each character . . . and providing pieces of reality connecting us to the film. I especially loved watching and supporting a film with so many women in leadership crew roles as well as a young woman using her gifts and talents on screen.","user":"ambuehl2000","rank":[6,12]}]
