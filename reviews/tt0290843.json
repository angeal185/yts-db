[{"title":"Not That Bad, Clearly Made For T.V.","rating":4,"date":"11 May 2007","review":"This movie was not amazing but it was okay. It was one of those movies that you watch when you really have nothing else to watch and it just happens to be on T.V. There were some of those tearjerker, I love animal scenes. They were admittedly over the top and cheesy. But lets face it I gave my dog a hug anyways!It was a very typical \"made for T.V.\" movie. I think the guy that commented on this previously took the movie a LITTLE too seriously! I mean clearly it was inaccurate! It starred the woman whom I only know of because she was on a few episodes of Gilmore Girls. This movie is simply a way to kill time and in no way should it reflect upon the police force, FBI or S&amp;R teams. It also in no way should have prevented the previous commenter from watching Animal Planet (It wasn't THAT bad)","user":"leggo_my_eggo","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"To TC-4 (markviilin@aol.com): too technical but no real opinion !","rating":23,"date":"23 January 2007","review":"I'm referring to «This movie is an insult to real handlers and their dogs., 22 October 2002 -- Author: TC-4 (markviilin@aol.com)» I might candidly agree to all the «technical» arguments regarding dogs training. To a layman like me, they seem founded. But aren't they a bit too «limited», precisely by the dog training experience ? I mean, isn't that movie judged ONLY through that prism ? I would have wanted a personal opinion about the other aspects of that movie. There must be some... even if it's by no means the «greatest movie for TV ever made»! Personally, I found it «original» BECAUSE of the roles played by the dogs. Also, who but other «dog experts» could or would agree with the flaws denounced -- however accurate they are...? And I would tend to think that they really ARE! As a layman, of course. Cheers!","user":"jussssst","rank":[5,10]},{"title":"Sent Packing","rating":6,"date":"2 February 2009","review":"**SPOILER** Overly complicated made for TV movie about this new \"nut\", or \"psycho\", in town who has this strange habit of kidnapping five year old girls and causing them to suffocate to death while their bereaved parents and rescue workers try to find them before the oxygen runs out.<br><br>Rescue dog handler Brenna Shaw, Sherilyn Fenn,first comes across this dangerous lunatic together with her dog Brie as he's in the process of dropping little Zoe Hendricks(Alicia Ducasse), whom he just kidnapped, into a nearby stream.
