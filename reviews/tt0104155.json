[{"title":"A shapeshifting demon haunting the sun soaked desert roads n looking for miserable souls is truly eldritch.","rating":8,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"I first saw this in the mid 90s on a vhs.\nRevisited it recently.\nThe film is about a shape-shifting demon (Robert John Burke)\nwho gains power through ritual murders n has to keep moving to work the rituals mainly targetting only those who have nothing to live for. Of course he does get to sleep with attractive females, including Chelsea Field.\nThis film has a very creepy feel throughout n the desert roads along with the house where the first murder takes place has a very isolated n eerie feel.\nThe director did a fantastic job. This film has awesome photography of the desert.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Cryptic, bloody, fascinating","rating":27,"date":"27 December 1998","review":"Very dark, gory, mystical film with strong, haunting atmosphere, much in the spirit of Stanley's work for occultist rock band Fields of the Nephilim. A demonic entity hitchhikes across the desert taking possession of bodies with which to commit ritualistic murders - the crime scenes, their walls minutely detailed with glyphs and sigils painted in the victims' blood, are stunningly effective. Skeptical detective finally enlists the help of an old shaman who knows the creature's vulnerabilities and the killer is stopped - or is it?  --Really remarkable; anyone who enjoyed Stanley's earlier \"Hardware\" should make the effort to find it.","user":"angelynx","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"HAUNTING","rating":9,"date":"5 September 2003","review":"If there ever was a film which deserved to be called HAUNTING - it's this one. Excellent music, wonderful dream-like atmosphere, masochistically-grim mood verging on nihilism, mystical overtones, a sympathetic supernatural yet human 'villain'... it's just wonderful. Disturbing gore, genuinely creepy scenes, the setting unlike anything you've ever seen before- this is one of the unsung, unknown masterpieces of the '90-ies (thinking/feeling man's)horror film at its best.","user":"dogstar666","rank":[37,52]}]
