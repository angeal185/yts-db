Clearly he wanted one of the bad guys to follow him. And the plan worked perfectly, except, nothing happened. It turned out there was no kucking plan.

Poor acting and story line. Cringe lines as well. Seriously, worse movie ever. I had to sign up with Imdb just to write this review. Whoever is involved please dont make movies anymore.","user":"afzan-42747","rank":[21,26]},{"title":"Truly bad","rating":1,"date":"4 August 2018","review":"Really, oh my God, what utter drivel!! The main male Chinese actor is so so bad. The story line so ridiculous and obvious. Who in the hell is telling these people to act in these utterly stupid movies!","user":"vmm-44628","rank":[37,51]}]
