[{"title":"The discovery and adventure of coming of age.","rating":10,"date":"22 July 2001","review":"Starring Phoebe Cates (Mrs. Kevin Kline, who knew?), as in \"what ever happened to\", and Bridget Fonda just as her career took off, Shag is sweet, warm, funny, nostalgic, and above all, wild.  I saw a trailer for this on another DVD and added to my list of \"must haves.\"  It was well worth it.<br><br>Cates is Carson McBride, about to marry stuffy Harley Ralston (Tyron Power, Jr.).  Her best friends, played by Bridget Fonda, Annabeth Gish and Page Hannah (yup, Darryl's sister) surprise her with a weekend in Myrtle Beach as a last fling.  Cates is funny enough, but Bridget simply overpowers the other female leads with her boundless charisma.<br><br>They meet a couple of local boys who change their lives and have one heck of good time in the process.  Speaking of \"what ever happened to,\"  Scott Coffey's Chip was the most enjoyable male character in the film, cute as a bug and delightfully innocent and whatever happened to him?<br><br>Too many films of this genre are souless, heartless and mindless.  This one is the rare exception, and gives you a chance to remember the discovery and adventure of coming of age.","user":"budmassey","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"Where the boys are","rating":8,"date":"26 November 2005","review":"I watched this movie only to get a look at Tyrone Power, Jr., and ended up enjoying it immensely. Set in 1963 before the assassination of JFK, four young southern women go to Myrtle Beach for a last hurrah before college and, in one way or another, their lives change. Phoebe Cates is a virginal brunette engaged to uptight Tyrone Power, Jr., but winds up falling for Robert Rusler; Bridget Fonda is a comely blond looking to win Miss Sun Queen; Annabeth Gish is everybody's pal who wants to be somebody's girlfriend; and Page Hannah is the plain daughter of a senator hoping to keep her daddy's liquor cabinet locked and his house clean so nobody knows she and her friends were there. The movie culminates with a shagging (some kind of dancing) contest.<br><br>I suspect that some of us old-timers might like this movie even more than the teens and twenty-somethings - it sure brings you back to a time when kids talked about getting to second base, going all the way, and asked questions like, Have you ever put your tongue in anyone's ear? Shag captures the atmosphere of fun and hilarity one only gets at an early age and away from one's parents. The sound track is fabulous. Highly recommended if you want to feel young again.","user":"blanche-2","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"one \"chick flick\" for the history books","rating":8,"date":"27 March 2003","review":"I saw at the bottom of the page, that \"if you like this title we also recommend American Graffiti\". So true, so true. Of course, it can't be compared to \"graffiti\", but it's a movie with many laughs and adorable characters.<br><br>I saw this movie last night, maybe for the tenth time or something. I had a good time as always. Then of course, I am a very nostalgic person and if your favorite movie is \"Matrix\" or \"Minority report\" you might not like it.<br><br>The title is a little confusing since there aren't that many dance scenes, but I honestly don't care. I'm just looking for a temporary time machine with the course aimed for 1963. Besides, the dancing moments of the movie are quite enough.<br><br>Shag takes off with four friends going away to Myrtle beach for a weekend of total fun. Luanne is the proper one who is almost always upset or embarrassed, and she kind of takes the \"leader\" role, since they are all going in her car and staying at her fathers (the senator's) house, (where you can't sit on the furniture's, use the phone or drink the senator's bourbon). Pudge is a nice girl who has held everything back all her life, but no more! She is also the one who is responsible for the most \"shagging\" in the movie. Melaina (Fonda) is the wild one who dreams of a career in Hollywood since she is \"neither marrying Harvey nor going to college\". Carson (Cates) is the sweet and unexperienced girl who IS marrying Harvey. Also, when the movie begins, she thinks that they are going someplace else. But the girls have other plans and they are determined to take Carson for a weekend that she will never forget. One last fling together. A plot like this CAN'T go wrong.<br><br>Anyway, by the end of the movie they are all different people, and they have learned that things are not always as they seem. You have control of your own destiny. Carson meets Buzz (the lines that these two people have are unbeatable), Luanne gives the audience a real \"necking-surprise\" and Melaina finally meets Jimmy Valentine who she considers to be her key to a life of luxury in Hollywood. ( I laugh every time Jimmy does his \"move\"). The story which I like the best though, is the love that develops between Pudge and the \"navy\" boy Chip. They are just so good people and  the conversations between them so sweet and innocent. You really feel happy for them. It would be a crime not making them a couple. <br><br>This movie has a great ending. The kind which makes you wonder what happens to the people in the film. You actually care about them.<br><br>The acting is terrific. Bridget Fonda gets a lot of room and maybe it's because her character is the most interesting one. This was before she became a star. I think Phoebe Cates is one of the most underrated actresses ever. Just think about it, how she effects an audience. When she opens her mouth you can't look away. It's like she is born to make these parts. She isn't acting. She IS her characters. \" Yes, I am wild. I guess I've been wild all of my life, without even knowing it\". One of many great lines in this movie.<br><br>\nThe one thing that always impresses me in these movies is the setting. They actually make it look like in 1963. The cars, the clothes, the colors, the buildings. It's incredible. <br><br>If you like these kind of movies, and haven't seen this one, you should be ashamed of yourself! Grade: 8/10","user":"dogge84","rank":[19,23]}]
