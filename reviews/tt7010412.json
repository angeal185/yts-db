[{"title":"Simple and good!","rating":8,"date":"14 August 2018","review":"Realism, sensibility, erotism, love, humor, irony and mistery in a balanced way. This movie is a great inspiration for who wants to know how to tell a story with a good narrative, simplicity and interesting characters. A real good surprise in black and white from Taiwan.","user":"andrebatucadabsb","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Watch it slowly or simply don´t watch it","rating":8,"date":"29 June 2018","review":"The movie is brilliant in my opinion, but it´s for selective audience in terms of being patient, bias removal, expectation removal and active reflection. The movie reflects a good popular story of how sad society could be driven by money and power. Although this movie reflects Taiwanese society, this picture could repeat anywhere in the world. Some people said there is an illogical detail about how a person can lift up a dead body into the Buddha statue. You should think a bit... here is the workshop and they have tools to lift heavy things around, as heavy as big copper statue and he is the owner, don´t you think he could not think about that? People who are perceived as good people and do good course in life could actually be the one who hide their guilt the most clever and in a manner that society could not even imagine about, such as the example of Kevin who hid his ex girlfriend dead body (his crime) in the Buddha statue (his work for compassion symbol).","user":"tekoepost","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"A Precious Maiden Work","rating":8,"date":"23 March 2018","review":"The idea of the way of telling is novel, but not limited to the novelty itself. From the playful bystander perspective to the uncontrollable subjective emotion release, this film can be said that it is a perfect example of a narration assisted narration.\nAlong with the pioneering, not rough photography, and valuable original score, a series of technical additions not only adds to the richness of the story, but also makes the mood of the film more touching.","user":"e-70733","rank":[8,15]}]
