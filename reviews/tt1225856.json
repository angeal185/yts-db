[{"title":"Ignore the low ratings - worth watching","rating":7,"date":"9 June 2018","review":"I enjoyed this film. Intriguing and puzzling with several plot twists. Reminiscent of Jacob's Ladder in some respects. It's a mystery/thriller/suspense film, not horror.","user":"djbaxter-980-742507","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"True Indy filmmaking","rating":10,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"Let me start by saying i worked on this film. <br><br>For the haters. Get over yourselves. <br><br>We made this movie when we were 23 years old as a senior thesis. It was a 3 man crew making everything happen <br><br>Carlos Ferrer, my friend, spent ten years on this film. He wrote, directed, shot, wrote the score and did all the cgi on his own. Which is unheard of. <br><br>So put that into context when you watch it. <br><br>While it might have quiet, slow times (I'll agree) but we did what many wish they could do. <br><br>Whether you hate it or like it. Realize that it was a crew of three and a director that literally did everything that usually takes a actual film crew to make.","user":"jenks-art","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Engaging, deliberate, surprising, suspenseful, rewarding.","rating":7,"date":"13 August 2019","review":"It begins like a film you might think you've seen before, but then turns into fresh territory and offers many small surprises, in a film that begs for the viewer to do some of the detective work, then surprises again. The score falls somewhere between a Leone and a Hitchcock picture, which is saying something since the writer/director wrote the score. All the performances make sense by the end and there is a satisfying climax. I agree with the viewer who said this reminds of Jacob's Ladder but it's not the same story either. Rewarding for a thoughtful Indie film lover.","user":"stevetowsley-2","rank":[1,1]}]
