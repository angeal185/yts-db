[{"title":"A vivid excursion into the film-makers' disturbing minds","rating":1,"date":"14 April 2020","review":"Even after a string of recent disappointments from European producers, I did not think it could get any worse than Calvaire. Well... I was wrong. This cinematic excrement (spoiler: pun intended) is a qualitatively new level of low. In a nutshell, this is a repulsive cocktail of nearly all imaginable degeneracies further refracted by the psychotic mind of its characters. This \"thriller\" has as little to do with the genre it is claimed to represent as with art in general.","user":"yakov_sannikov","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Stay away from this movie!!!","rating":1,"date":"12 April 2020","review":"One of the worst movies I ever seen!
