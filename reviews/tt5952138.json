[{"title":"Wrong approach","rating":4,"date":"20 September 2019","review":"In the novel, the character of Merricat unravels slowly. It dawns on you that all is not as it seems and that our narrator is indeed, quite disturbed. Here it's all presented immediately. The plot, such as it is, and the characters and Merricat's flaws are revealed in the first five minutes. It's supposed to be a gothic horror/mystery story. Here it's unrealistic farce.\nFarmigga is a very good actress and does a good job here. With a better director she may have been great, but Merricat is over done with her silly body movements, all displayed far too early.<br><br>The music too, presents it as a near satire. The structure doesn't work either, with the Last Tuesday cards etc. Why? It's not in the book and not necessary. The writer doesn't seem to represent the material faithfully. Its as though he's misunderstood its tone.\nAdmittedly, its a tough novel to recreate for the screen. In better hands, it could work but this approach is certainly all wrong. It's an unrealistic pantomime. It aligns occasionally but its too late to save it. The only redeeming qualities are the cinematography and the production design. I did like the nod to Alien with the exterior close up of the cat with the house in the background with the hint of the Jerry Goldsmith score. A few seconds of homage, perhaps suggesting Merricat is the Alien and the house, the Nostromo? An odd homage but its there.<br><br>Charles is over the top in key scenes. Again, certain behaviors are not in the book.<br><br>Even Crispin Glover feels miscast. A very good actor. Just not here. You can't blame the actors'. The director, writer and producer must bear the brunt of this failure.","user":"anthonyjlangford","rank":[38,46]},{"title":"I have mixed feelings....","rating":5,"date":"19 May 2019","review":"This movie has no true genre. I was expecting gothic horror, but perhaps that was fault in having never read the book. It certainly was not scary (zero chills), nor was it suspenseful. But it does leave us pondering how equipped we are to handle human cruelty, both in enduring it, and in our capacity to forgive. Do we isolate ourselves or do we try to push forward? Or do we completely unravel and seek revenge or play out our hurt and rage until it has been avenged? These are questions this movie will leave you pondering, and of course much depends on our lot in life, our finances, our social support, our inner strength and many other factors.","user":"wildsparrow16","rank":[25,30]},{"title":"Good movie","rating":8,"date":"19 May 2019","review":"I have read both bad and good reviews about this movie, and I have decided to side with the good reviews. Like any other movie, this one had many WTF parts, and scene where you're gonna want to pause and think \"okay what?\"\nBUT HOWEVER, the acting in this movie was absolutely outstanding, Alexandra, Taissa, Sebastian and Crispin did the roles absolute justice.\nOne more thing, if you're here for the thriller/horror, don't bother. This movie is pure drama. It's thriller in the sense of \"creepy\" but otherwise it's just Drama. Loved the directing. LOVED the acting too.","user":"nouralwani-64579","rank":[64,84]}]
