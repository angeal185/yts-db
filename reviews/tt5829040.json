[{"title":"What did I just watch","rating":2,"date":"17 August 2017","review":"There was only one other user review here, so I just had to leave another one. This is probably the most pointless movie ever. I think it is supposed to be funny and sure it may have gotten me to lift the corners of my mouth a few times, slightly. But the whole time, and yes I finished watching it, I was waiting for the movie to go somewhere, so have a point, to, I don't know, start really. What bugs me the most is Toni Colette's part. She is in my eyes a great actress who can do amazing things. Molly Shannon on the other hand is one of those actresses I usually avoid (the other two I didn't know). But how did Colette end up in this part? Did she have to fulfill a contract? And what did Adam Levine doing in this movie? He seems so out of character. The acting overall is lame, the plot is empty, the things that happen make no sense, especially ending up on the boat with the kids. That part just didn't even looked as if it belonged in this movie. All in all, one tip: don't watch this. gave it 2 stars cause I've seen even worse than this, but more it sure doesn't deserve.","user":"treborquest","rank":[27,43]},{"title":"When the moms' found each others arm and shoulders!","rating":6,"date":"24 October 2017","review":"First it was 'Moms' Night Out', followed by 'Bad Moms' and now this. But this was not as same as those two. Somewhat a different film. It kind of mix of fun and serious. I thought it was kind of inspired by 'Big Little Lies'. Only the settings and the characters, but the rest of the tale was fun version. Though not entirely funny film. There are some serious talks about the life, but then goes off the reality for a second. That terrible mix of commercialisation and art, did not do any good.<br><br>It was not all about them. I liked the husbands' parts too. What they had talked and what they have learnt, all were interesting and inspiring. Beautiful characters and the performances. Short film and a decent one. It did not do well among the film goers, but I think those moms deserve to return. I would love that, only it has to get a better storyline. Surely it won't happen now. Overall worth a watch, a decent film than what you have seen, heard about it.<br><br>6/10","user":"Reno-Rangan","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"The REAL Bad Moms","rating":8,"date":"22 March 2018","review":"Listen, if you are a parent, you will love this movie. The characters are REAL! They're just like you! (But they're WAY FUNNIER!) \nI laughed often and well and I identified with so much. \nThe actors are all fantastic (except that guy from Maroon 5 who is just OK.) Bridgett Everett is amazing. Toni Colette is amazing. Rob Huebel is amazing. <br><br>Its clever and lovely and the soundtrack is fantastic. <br><br>If you don't have kids, or you're born after 1995, you should probably watch something else because you just wont get it.","user":"Fujiko-san","rank":[10,16]}]
