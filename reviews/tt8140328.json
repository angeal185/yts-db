In this case if you want to see it done where the actual film is worse than the dog fim withing a film, than this is for you.

It's an interesting paradox, but it's something I never got.<br><br>Honestly It all felt like 3 people wandering around a town and complaining, elevating their ego, arguing, sure they got rejected but it never felt like that visceral \"gut punch\" sort of way, one of the reasons is the characters are so poorly developed, cliched and badly acted, thus I was never fully on board, in their perspective, I was at a distance the whole time, never could take anything seriously, the characters really needed to be better developed, they didn't feel real at all.<br><br>I love Alex's mindset as a person on his channel etc., but this is really disappointing. Apparently this had no script and just an outline and it was shot in a few days. Of all films and places this is exactly the situation to have a tight, precise script, you don't have the luxury of loads of takes to \"find\" the scene, time is of the essence and it would of helped to have a clear vision in terms of the script to guarantee a solid film, but this isn't. It felt like he recorded his 3 friends as they wander around park city and then decided to cut it into a film after the fact, it's a bit of a mess and doesn't really go anywhere, doesn't strongly say anything.<br><br>i do not get these films that go for the \"unscripted\" aspect, just have a rough outline, improv it and think it'll be good. What were you expecting? Pre planned writing is what makes the film compelling and memorable, provided you know what you're doing.<br><br>The acting is bad, really bad, my goodness that redhead is one annoying character, oooohhhhh boy! Maybe that seems to be what you were going for, but I loathed every moment watching her, I should hate her but be at least interested to see what happens to her, like Adam Sandler's character 'Howard' in 'Uncut Gems', he's awful! but my God I want to keep watching him.<br><br>The cinematography is average with it's \"run and gun\" style, some of the locations are pretty nice but they're few and far between. Let me be clear, I love Alex and his channel on YouTube but I have to be very honest, it's right, just, and it'll hopefully motivate him to try harder. Honesty is the best policy, no? I found this film forgetful, Alex didn't have a script, shot it in a seemingly run and gun way, had bad actors in it, what more can I say? It's unfortunately really bad.<br><br>The overarching stakes aren't compelling either, they lost what they never had: selling their film. It's more compelling when you lose something you had, just a side note.\nIn order for this film to be the \"absolute hell..\" that was advertised in the description on IMDB there needed to be WAAAAAAYYYY more conflict, visceral, compelling conflict with strong stakes. There is one 'meh' conflict when the producer guy says no to their film after they show him their trailer, the rest is mostly them arguing, that's not conflict, there are no winners and losers in an argument, conflict has losers, their stakes come to pass, it's impactful, arguing isn't! What I also needed was to really feel why this meant so much to them, why did selling this film be so internally, emotionally important in specific ways for these characters. The red head may of hinted at it, but it was vague and as I said, she was annoying and I really didn't care much for her, egotistical and vein.<br><br>And of course it's distracting they're never once in the festival watching films, or at their films screening.<br><br>There were a lot of onlookers looking into the camera in the film...did Alex shoot the characters breaking the 4th wall to get around this? eh, that's a pretty smart idea, kudos.<br><br>Oh, and Tommy Wiseau wrote and directed 'Neighbours' after the room, a little inaccuracy I noticed in the dialogue.","user":"richardadesmond","rank":[1,1]}]
