[{"title":"Unbelievably bad. Really.","rating":1,"date":"22 January 2018","review":"I never thought I'd dislike something so much as to give it a one-star rating, but in this case I had no choice. This \"documentary\" is little more than a string of stock-footage and public-domain shots of rotating radio telescopes, NASA control rooms, TV-news animation backgrounds and home-brew CGI, with a droning voice-over that could've been---and probably was---compiled by lurking around a few of the cheesiest alien-conspiracy websites. The production values are so bad, and the lack of substantial content so profound, it baffles me how anyone was persuaded to have anything to do with it. But what's REALLY incredible is that I saw this on Netflix. Netflix! They were actually showing it! Why? Well, I suppose it couldn't have cost much to license. It's awful, though. Really.","user":"ander5151","rank":[24,24]},{"title":"Wow","rating":1,"date":"26 January 2018","review":"The narration is very monotone and sounds hypnotic in a rather creepy way. Like some one has stated early, the video clips are not original and used over and over again. I completely lost interest early on when they did the voice over for Nikola Tesla; a Serbian man. Whilst talking about a signal he received, the show went and used a voice actor putting on the accent of an English peasant. Honestly, what the hell!? The guy sounds like a bad actor in Eastenders or something.","user":"james182108","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"Wow.. definitely intended for the dumb","rating":2,"date":"11 January 2018","review":"Is anyone even supposed to believe this crap? \nThe majority of \"facts\" in this documentary can be easily debunked with 3 seconds' worth of googling. Eerie music and \"scary\" backgrounds just make this documentary even more hilarious to watch. Genre should be changed to Stoners Comedy.","user":"Zix7","rank":[15,15]}]
