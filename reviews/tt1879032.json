[{"title":"A really dumb comedy that I thought was very funny. If you like smart comedy & intelligent jokes then avoid this. I say B+","rating":7,"date":"30 June 2013","review":"\"The people who went to church and prayed and missed out on a lot of fun stuff got sucked straight to heaven. The rest of us, well we're screwed.\" While out bowling one night Lindsey (Kendrick) and her boyfriend Ben witness the rapture. When they get home they find out that both their moms have been taken while their fathers are still here. Trying to move on with their lives they start a food cart. When that doesn't work they take a job with the anti-Christ (Robinson), but with a hidden agenda. This is a movie I was excited about mainly because of the cast. I have to say that I thought this was very funny and I laughed throughout the whole movie, but it is my kind of humor. Mainly a lot of random things happening and some really stupid jokes that make me laugh like a man getting killed by a huge flaming rock and the wife mad because he was holding the eggs when he died. If that kind of humor appeals to you then watch this and laugh. If you are into more intelligent humor then you may not like this. Overall, a stupid movie that I thought was very funny and I laughed a lot. I give it a B+.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[32,45]},{"title":"Perfectly Droll Entertainment Dripping With Sarcasm & Random Humor","rating":8,"date":"11 June 2013","review":"The movie does not pretend to be something it is not. Some may feel the ending fell flat and/or the actors seemed bored by the childish humor. I believe it was all very intentional.<br><br>The blatant absence of political correctness was, in my opinion, incredibly refreshing. Every now and then a good punch in the face is needed to wake up from incessant exposure to overly cautious censorship forced on us by societal standards. Words will only offend if they are allowed to do so.<br><br>Those who have a droll sense of humor, enjoy random comedy and do not have a tendency to take everything seriously, will find this entertaining. Then again, perhaps one must be exposed to copious amounts of idiocy and/or eye-rolling ignorance to fully enjoy such a dry, sarcastic treat. Whatever the case, if you can keep an open mind, I would certainly recommend this for a good laugh.","user":"DrollDame","rank":[36,59]},{"title":"Fun, Satirical look at the Rapture that never actually came","rating":9,"date":"25 June 2013","review":"8.5 of 10. Films mocking the biblical end of the world are in short supply, so short that I can't even think of anything similar outside of some Web cartoons. This has a little of everything, including zombies, animated talking grasshoppers (locusts), and speaking crows that insult everybody. Great film to relax and laugh to.<br><br>That's not to say it can't and, hopefully, will be done better. It does seem sky-breakingly original in a Hollywood controlled market that seems to fear openly satirizing Christian/Jewish/Muslim beliefs beyond the people who don't question them in any way or use them to get power and wealth.<br><br>The actors clearly have a lot of fun with this and get into their parts without any fear of becoming toys of the antichrist or Satan. It's something like a much less cartoonish Team America World Police set in the present.","user":"in1984","rank":[32,52]}]
