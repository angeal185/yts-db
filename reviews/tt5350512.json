I had to turn it off within 10 minutes as everything about the film is awful. The lighting, the production, the direction, the acting, just everything screams low budget.<br><br>This film does not give any credence to the British Film Industry. I firmly believe that whoever bankrolled this endeavor did so as a tax break and that the person who gave this 10 out of 10 is either (1) a left leaning, tree hugging hipster moron with no life experience outside of the liberal London neo-political bubble, (2) someone that is a 'little too close' to the film itself, or (3) just a troll.<br><br>By the way, you're welcome!","user":"eddovey","rank":[8,14]},{"title":"laughable acting low low budget","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2020","review":"Just a couple of words on this trash...the first review is 10/10 I watched the movie and I have to say that the \"person(s)\" associated with the film who placed this first rating of 10/10 GOOD LUCK! It's a terrible, boring, low budget, badly acted piece of crappolla! What a joke.","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[5,11]}]
