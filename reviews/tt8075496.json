[{"title":"A perfect short film","rating":10,"date":"24 February 2020","review":"This powerful little short film uses food to tell the story of guilt and family. Disney recently released this on YouTube and I can very easily recommend this gem.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[44,45]},{"title":"Bao provides a strong message about motherhood (and parenthood).","rating":10,"date":"12 June 2018","review":"Domee Shi, Pixar's first short film director ever, wanted to share this film as a strong message of all mothers and parents who spends time with their kids as they grow up to live in a better world out there. This short gave me tearful touch since I'm now in college and I understand how parents feel when their own children gone off to college or somewhere else for future career. Also, the passion of making dumplings was a remarkable example of how we see in our childhood with families being together. <br><br>I would give this short an A+","user":"henrypixar","rank":[49,81]},{"title":"How are people not getting it?","rating":10,"date":"18 June 2018","review":"It's a metaphor. The woman (it's a WOMAN, smh) had a dream. Or maybe a hallucination, but they show her waking up, so I attributed it to a dream.\nI, too, gasped aloud when she ate the bao to keep him with her, but overall, I thought it was a clever and entertaining story, told entirely without words.","user":"blueyes-3","rank":[55,95]}]
