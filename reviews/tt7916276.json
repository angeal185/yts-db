[{"title":"Click Bait Movie","rating":1,"date":"19 September 2019","review":"The movie poster shows Boudica in battle dress and the promotional material talks about epic battle scenes. Well the whole movie takes place before Baudica actually becomes queen so she's never actually in battle dress or the head of an army and the epic battle scenes consist of poorly acted skirmishes between 5 or six people.<br><br>I was watching this movie waiting for the preamble to end and the main movie to start when the closing credits came up. Total waste of time.","user":"rickbryantalt","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"Not worth watching.","rating":17,"date":"17 September 2019","review":"I watched this movie earlier today and it lacked pretty much everything that would make a movie good and enjoyable.","user":"gjhghjhjghjl","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"Weak, ineffectual film that's not worth the time or money","rating":26,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"I bought this with high hopes of sharing the story of one of the greatest female leaders ever to exist, only for it to be a complete washout. A bitter disappointment. Do not waste your time.","user":"little_dragon-57553","rank":[4,4]}]
