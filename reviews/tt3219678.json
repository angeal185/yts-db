[{"title":"Awful, Awful Documentary","rating":1,"date":"21 November 2014","review":"The title of this film should have been, Ashleigh Ball: Attention Whore and other losers. It seems like the only people that they interviewed for the Bronies were socially inept, in other words, losers. They interviewed a \"tough\" mechanic and a man from the army in order to show how tough the fans are, however, both men seemed to ill-fit in a 'normal' crowd and both confessed, through their criticisms of what society expects from a boy, that they envy women and even wish they were women. Most of this I found mildly compelling. The interest ended there.<br><br>Most of the scenes in this film are of Ashleigh Ball, a voice actress who voices two of the Ponies in the My little Pony Cartoon. She bursts onto the scene, parading herself in various outfits and plugging her band. She talks about herself extensively and pretends that she thinks the Bronies are weirdos and that she thinks the interest in the show is bizarre, however, due to her poor acting ability, it is overwhelmingly obvious that this is her dream come true. She sees herself as the star of the show even tho all she does is provide the voice of two characters. She is not involved in the writing, or anything else to do with the production of the show, but she seems to feel like the most important person in the room whenever Bronies are mentioned and she reads about her characters and watches video and looks at fan made pictures for hours to feed her inner narcissism. If anything, this was a documentary about how entitled, connected and privileged Ashleigh Ball is.<br><br>I was interested to hear what the psychologists had to say until I realized that they were far from objective. Their own son is a Brony. Terrible work, No focus, hard to watch.","user":"titus227","rank":[24,46]},{"title":"Bronies: look at how original I am, I watch a little girl's cartoon!","rating":1,"date":"22 July 2014","review":"Facts to know: I love this cartoon, I love the art community and fanworks around it, being a part of it is really and always a great experience. but then there's bigmouthes with an ego the size of the moon who want to make the fandom a part of their lives, and take everything about it seriously.<br><br>That's not the state of mind of MLPFIM's philosophy to begin with, and from what I watched, it's like the brony doc : awkward teenagers dancing and bragging about their \"redefining masculinity\" bullshit.<br><br>This is so awkward, one must have courage to still look at a little pony after watching this.<br><br>I'm sorry Ashleigh.","user":"darkdoomer-163-739368","rank":[20,39]},{"title":"Abhorrent documentary","rating":1,"date":"28 January 2015","review":"There is so much to explore about the artistic, creative, politically engaged and friendly, real nature of the MLP fan community, and artistic collective. <br><br>This documentary is not reflective of the brony community, nor the fandoms affiliated with interests of the world of my little pony. It does not matter if you're from Anonymous or a member of the furry fandom, friendship and harmony is a philosophy that united us.<br><br>But this fake documentary destroys this aspect. This documentary focuses on a few, selected, fragile people nobody heard about in the community, and they are used to represent this community. I do not label myself as a brony but remain a true fan of the work of Lauren Faust, still I know them well, and I can affirm with no ambiguity that the \"bronies\" from this documentary are mostly actors, or briefed for this shooting, and I accuse Madness Films rightfully to have made all this up in order to depict bronies as socially inept people falling in the autism spectrum.<br><br>This is not a good documentary, you can not make a documentary about the pony fandom or the bronies. You have probably never watched a single episode of the series, nor even understand the philosophy of the fandom, nor its pre-FiM history. You know nothing about the internet culture, speaking of 4chan, bringing in psychologists... <br><br>In what kind of world you live in, to make such an abhorrent documentary?<br><br>You could have worked with artists and animators to animate a movie of this length with that budget! <br><br>I am disappointed by Ashleigh Balls's and a few bronies for participating into this slanderous and destructive video, funded essentially by fans who expected something true, what you failed to accomplish.","user":"celestiaofcanterlot","rank":[15,28]}]
