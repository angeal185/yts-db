[{"title":"Did this movie even have a script?","rating":1,"date":"27 December 2017","review":"While looking for a terrible horror movie on Netflix, we landed on this gem. It exceeded all our terrible expectations, but it did get me thinking: how does a script for a movie like this get sold? <br><br>To be clear, the first 45 minutes are the incoherent ramblings of four teenagers who in NO WAY would actually hang out with each other in real life. The dialogue is crass, the personalities are so unclearly defined that each character is reduced to nothing but \"hot guy\", \"hot girl\", \"less hot girl\" and \"eyeliner guy\", and literally nothing happens. This rag tag group of discount JC Penney Catalogue models goes out to, for NO reason, check out satanic things before visiting Coachella. You know they're in LA, because the movie is cut with daytime arial footage of the modern city with whispers edited over it. Like I said: incomprehensible. <br><br>So, after 45 minutes and 700 plot contrivances that make you say \"what is going ON?!\", some girl slits her throat. Which the police are totally fine with, by the way, as they let the four witnesses go immediately. They then go to a house. Pro tip: pause the movie when you get to the swimming pool filled with dead crows. I GUARANTEE you that you haven't seen worse special effects in your life. <br><br>Anyway, nothing happens, nothing happens, everyone dies for some reason, and the Modern Family girl is then inexplicably stuck in a room with her mouth sewn shut and no arms. That's it. <br><br>Why? Who knows? There's a time loop in there which my girlfriend and I saw coming a mile away, just because we were thinking of how this movie could possibly be made even DUMBER. The time loop isn't explained and has no bearing on the plot, by the way. <br><br>Yeah. <br><br>Don't watch this.","user":"HeroOfTomorrow","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"a waste of time for everyone involved","rating":1,"date":"18 June 2018","review":"I made an IMDb account just to review this mind-numbingly boring film. Don't approach this film unless you have a gun pointed to your back: the plot might have worked had it not been for the extremely unlikeable characters. I usually like (or at least, can sit through) crappy horror, but I couldn't even sit through this one. Avoid at all costs.","user":"izzyarcticpolarbear","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"Good acting, not the best story line","rating":5,"date":"28 December 2016","review":"Pretty average movie overall sub par story line somewhat offset by good acting.<br><br>I don't think it deserves the particularly scathing reviews on here - the story line was a bit muddled but the acting was actually quite good. The characters are played quite well and the main actress (Sarah Hyland from modern family) does a brilliant job in this.<br><br>It has some scares in it probably not as much as your used to from your average horror movie though. Its kind of creepy but again not as much as your average horror. Where it shines is the few scares it does have are very well placed and managed to give me a couple of jolts. There's a lot in this movie that you have to piece together for yourself - the movie itself doesn't seem to really care whether you got the plot point or got lost along the way and explains nothing.<br><br>All up 5/10 - 7/10 for the acting, 3/10 for the story line.","user":"jjacko","rank":[18,23]}]
