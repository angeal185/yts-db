[{"title":"Beautiful cinema","rating":10,"date":"30 June 2019","review":"A glass of wine would be perfect to describe this movie. My brother told me about it but didn't say much. He told me it was about a guy, his friends, a girl and a garage. He said that it was one of those movies you just had to watch.<br><br>The opening scene and music will draw you in and from there two main actors are introduced. I was hooked from the beginning, trying to grasp where it would go. The dialogue was the best part if you ask me. It was imaginative but not witty, and seemed very natural. The character dynamics will make you laugh and smile. There were many great moments throughout and it did not disappoint.<br><br>Good script, great acting, and fantastic camera work. It was truly beautiful to watch.","user":"nshidbaby1","rank":[1,2]}]
