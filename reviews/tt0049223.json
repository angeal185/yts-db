[{"title":"\"Forbidden Knowledge\"","rating":10,"date":"24 August 1999","review":"I first saw this movie when it originally came out. I was about 9 yrs. old and found this movie both highly entertaining and very frightening and unlike any other movie I had seen up until that time.<br><br>BASIC PLOT:  An expedition is sent out from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a great mainsequence star in constellation Aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers which landed twenty years before and had not been heard from since.<br><br>THEME:  An inferior civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remains of a greatly advanced alien civilization, the Krell-200,000 years removed. The \"seed\" of destruction from one civilization is being passed on to another, unknowingly at first. The theme of this movie is very much Good vs. Evil.<br><br>I first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally. I was just a boy and the tiger scenes really did scare me as did the battle scenes with the unseen Creature-force.  I was also amazed at just how real things looked in the movie.<br><br>What really captures my attention as an adult though is the truth of the movie \"forbidden knowledge\" and how relevant this will be when we do (if ever) come into contact with an advanced (alien) civilization far more developed than we ourselves are presently.  Advanced technology and responsibility seem go hand in hand.  We must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This is, in my opinion, the great moral of the movie.<br><br>\nI learned in graduate school that \"knowledge is power\" is at best, in fact, not correct!  Knowledge is \"potential\" power depending upon how it is applied (... if it is applied at all.) [It's not what you know, but how you use what you know!]<br><br>The overall impact of this movie may well be realized sometime in Mankind's own future. That is knowledge in and of itself is not enough, we must, MUST have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to truly control our own destiny OR we will end up like the Krell in the movie-just winked-out.<br><br>Many thanks to those who responded to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very much appreciated!! I hope you are as entertained by this story as much as I have been over the past 40+ years ....<br><br>Rating: 10 out 10 stars","user":"Chris-180","rank":[166,192]},{"title":"Gets better as it gets older","rating":9,"date":"27 January 2002","review":"While not re-treading the comments or plot summaries of other IMDB users, I thought I'd say that this particular film does get better as it gets older.  While ground-breaking on it's release in 1956, the visual \"look\" of this film has grown over the 46 years since it first arrived.<br><br>True to the pulp sci-fi of its day, the art direction has mellowed into an archetype that has not been bettered to this date.  MGM put a surprising amount of money into the production values (similar to, but better than Universal's \"This Island Earth\").  This is a living \"cover art\".  The indelible images of the saucer passing through space, landing on Altair-4, Robby, and the disintegrating tiger linger long in collective memory.<br><br>This must be seen on the big screen if possible, and in the original Cinemascope format.  I've been lucky enough to see it (it was re-released in the 70's on a double bill with George Pal's \"The Time Machine\"), and the power it carries in scenes such as the Krell machines and the attack of the Id Monster are truly impressive.  Watching it on a television just doesn't come close, although the \"letterboxed\" version is better than nothing. I am a poster collector, and even the advertising material for this film is exceptional.  I see the one-sheet for it every day in my living room, and have never grown tired of it. \"AMAZING!\" is what is says, and for once they got it right.  A true classic of it's type.","user":"Kingkitsch","rank":[67,75]},{"title":"Yes, this IS the best sci-fi film ever made.","rating":5,"date":"5 September 2004","review":"Well, of course, \"Star Wars\" defined the genre, and \"Alien\" and \"Blade Runner\" perfected it; but \"Forbidden Planet\" created it. Argue, if you must, that movies like \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", \"Them\" and \"Five Million Years to Earth\" are the cerebral grand-fathers of the film genre (and I won't disagree with you), but for \"science-fiction-as-plot-driven-action-epic,\" this is it. This is the one.<br><br>It's so unerringly on target, in fact, that it still plays very well even today. The modern audience has to overcome the \"Leslie Nielsen Factor\" (and it is difficult to watch him in a totally straight role), but once you do, the movie is pure enjoyment. Forget about dated plots and special effect. Robbie the Robot is a guy in a suit, yes, but he is thoroughly believable. He even adheres nicely to Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, a trick that the digital robots in this summer's \"I, Robot\" had a great deal of difficulty with.<br><br>And the monster! I defy anyone to avoid getting the willies when the monster first shorts the security fence. Great special effect, then and now!<br><br>Finally, the universal theme of man's (and Krell's) individual flaws inserting themselves into an otherwise perfect system and TOTALLY gumming up the works is as relevant today as it was then. More so.","user":"mfoley","rank":[142,165]}]
