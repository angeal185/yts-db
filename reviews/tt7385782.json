[{"title":"Provocative plot, intimate portrayal of black male kinship and power","rating":8,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"Set in Urban New York, brothers with divine and inherited powers confront their fears and strengths in a set of action packed sequences. The plot is deep and touches on today's social justice challenges linking them to true life American superheroes of freedom. My favorite scenes included the dialogue of friends which revealed the characters dilemmas. The acting was pretty good. The heart of the plot should have been revealed earlier in the movie. However all in all it's a good film, definitely worth watching.","user":"dottieconway","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Better than you think!","rating":10,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"Yes, the editing has tons of flaws and some of the acting is choppy BUT The action scenes have some moments, the dialogue is great, and the chemistry between actors is fantastic. Maybe they could reshoot some scenes and add some CGI to get this in theaters?","user":"k_j_foster74","rank":[3,7]},{"title":"Messages and Jewels for the Black Community","rating":9,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"The film was good and had interesting story line that will challenge what the history books or lack-there-of informed us of black history in America!","user":"edwin_g_bourne","rank":[1,2]}]
