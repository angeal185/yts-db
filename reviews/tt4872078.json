[{"title":"Big Chill? Not even close","rating":4,"date":"17 February 2018","review":"I've never written a review here but seeing this movie being compared to Big Chill, one of the finest movies about relationships ever, I couldn't help myself. I love these kind of movies but this is just bad filmmaking. Soulless, bad written characters and horrible story. Cannot believe that director is best friends with otherwise great Lynskey, cause she's given her one of the the worst roles of her life.","user":"antonio12","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Doesn't Ring True","rating":4,"date":"30 November 2016","review":"The talented actress Clea DuVall makes her major motion picture directorial and writing debut here, and also is one of the featured players in the ensemble cast of eight as well. The group gathers at a luxurious summer home, outside of Savannah, mainly to have an intervention and urge two of their friends to bail out of a very strained marriage.<br><br>There's a lot of talent in this cast and they're effective in their particular roles. However, I found the screenplay to be terribly clich√©d and non-believable on the whole, and the characters to be carping and annoying for the most part, reaching epiphanies during the movie that seemed to come out of \"left field\".<br><br>Are we really supposed to feel for a character who's trying to make the argument that Hitler may have had good intentions in what he did, and thus maybe wasn't such a bad guy? How they left this scene in the film is beyond my comprehension.<br><br>To note, there's lots of explicit language laced throughout the movie, as well as some highly suggestive sexual scenes,<br><br>All in all, a talented cast is rather wasted here as the script and the whole thing just didn't ring true, in my opinion, plus the usual 180's at the end were not worth the long slog to get there.","user":"larrys3","rank":[12,19]},{"title":"Great cast of Thrity-somethings in an amusing film about relationships","rating":6,"date":"31 August 2016","review":"Well...I went to go see the movie because I like all the people that were in it. Jason Ritter, Natasha Lyonne, Alia Shawkat. The talent in the movie drew me in, I wanted to see it.<br><br>It's one of those movies that seems to be for a specific group of people. Like this generations Thirty-Something. Got to point out that the group of actors use look good for Thirty-Somethings, which more points out how different being Thirty-something now is than it was when that show aired.<br><br>But this is not the focus of the movie. The focus is on the intervention, a group of friends who have known each other forever try to convince two of their friends that they're in a bad marriage and need to end it. It's very ironic as you learn real quick, as everyone is tossing rocks when they all live in glass houses.<br><br>It has it's funny moments as the movie is very relateable about life and relationships, as everyone discovers where they are is not necessary where they belong. It makes for a lot of laughs, but sometimes I felt the dramatic performances were rushed to make it more funny.<br><br>The intervention is an OK film, it works for me cause I like the cast in it and the laughs come from a it's so funny it's true situation. I can see it not working for everyone for the same reasons.<br><br>http://cinemagardens.com","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[9,14]}]
