[{"title":"Nepalese donot speak Hindi. We have our own language that is Nepali.","rating":3,"date":"31 December 2018","review":"Please do some research before making movies. If you are trying to potray nepalese character then better not mix its language with some others. Most of the words that Sherpa guys spoke is Hindi for FYI. And Nepalese people dont eat so called Chapati. And we dont even know what Saheb means. Please respect the language and culture of others. Try to get some expert before making such movie.","user":"nikeshluxuryholidays","rank":[14,18]},{"title":"Nice art style but devoid of charm","rating":4,"date":"9 December 2018","review":"Entirely forgettable. Perhaps the English translation loses something but the dialogue is unconvincing and robs the characters, with the possible exception of Tensing, of any likeability. The 3d animation is quite nicely done and the backdrops have a coherent watercolour style but cheap tricks like a lack of interaction between objects and snow make it all look a bit like a thrown together TV show at times. And asking why your captain is sailing south having just crossed the Atlantic from Canada to the eastern med is just one example of several weird moments that throw you out of the story.","user":"robhayden-50932","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Waste of time unfortunately","rating":1,"date":"20 August 2019","review":"Pretty nicely animated, but further in the movie lacking any thrill or sense whatsoever, one of the worst animations ive ever seen, which is quite sad to know that there actually can be one.","user":"karinmosnickova","rank":[0,1]}]
