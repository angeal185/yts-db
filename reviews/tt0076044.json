Along the way, Benji gets implanted with a secret code by the evil Chandler Dietrich.

What Chandler doesn't plan on is Benji getting lost en-route to Crete!!<br><br>Anyway, the film goes on sharing the antics of this tiny little dog-without-a-breed and casts him as a hero.  To find out what happens to Benji and his adorable family, you'll just have to watch!<br><br>Benji movies are so much fun for children.  If you have a pet in the family, whether a dog, cat, bird or hamster, your children are guaranteed to appreciate them more after seeing this film.  There is no nudity, no hard-core language (in fact no swearing at all that I can remember), no violence, and no yucky stuff.  It is a class A children's movie.  Enjoy it with some popcorn and with Fido sitting close at hand!!","user":"Kimta","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"If you love cute dogs and want to see a bit of Greece, too, this is a nice film for you","rating":6,"date":"5 February 2007","review":"Benji, that adorable dog, is supposed to be in a happier situation after the first film. He is a beloved family member and a pampered pooch. When some family members decide to go to Greece, Benji gets to go along. However, there are doggynappers lurking nearby and Benji is almost seized upon. But, being the brilliant dog that he is, Benji manages to escape their clutches and begin exploring a lovely city in Greece and its surroundings. He helps himself to a bit a Greek pasta at a restaurant and has a close call with a Doberman, among other things. Will he be able to find his way back to his family? If you love dogs and family films, this is a good choice. It is mostly Benji on the loose in Greece, where the scenery is a knockout, and where Benji gets in and out of one scrape after another. There are a few iffy passages, where guns are flashed and Benji is subjected to chloroform. However, this is mostly a little dog on the run in a charming movie. Families everywhere, for the love of Mike and Benji, please locate this one for an entertaining evening of fun for your loved ones.","user":"inkblot11","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Cute, Fun Movie, Good for Kids","rating":7,"date":"21 May 2005","review":"I enjoyed For the Love of Benji. It was a cute, fun movie. A Good, Clean Family Film by Joe Camp. I actually liked this, the second Benji film, better than the first one. The plot here was pretty much laughable, but Benji movies aren't about that, they're about letting Benji charm. And that he does. A very good performance here by Benji. You'll laugh, but the dog's work is literally better than a Steven Segal performance I had the misfortune of seeing recently. Also, the film has nice music and lots of pretty Greece scenery. It may help to have seen the first Benji to familiarize yourself with some of the characters.<br><br>Check it out and Have a Doggone Good Time! (Sorry :)","user":"writermangp","rank":[7,7]}]
