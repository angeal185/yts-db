[{"title":"Oh it's kooky!","rating":6,"date":"18 December 2003","review":"Man, these B gems are fun to watch.  Shaw Bros Studios definitely pay homage to the King....Kong that is.  Beware the Mighty Gorilla suit!<br><br>This movie teaches you so much!  When heartbroken, sign up for a dangerous, life threatening expedition which probably means getting only a one way plane ticket.  Danny Lee is good as the hero and for donning those crazy big lapels.  Other times, he looks like he had a fun time with Evelyne Kraft since he's always got his hands all over her!  There's also a weird triangle going on...don't mess with a gorilla's woman.  The big guy likes to watch. Kraft as Ah Wei is pure eye candy and she works well with Lee (I had to laugh at the sappy love chase scenes in the deep jungle...of INDIA??? I thought we were in Peking!).  Also, Shaws pulled out all the budget stops with model  villages and miniscule downtown Hong Kong.  It just gets the film more points in the shlock category.  Laughter ensues during the stampede guns firing at the rear projection screen.  One villager really gets a \"leg\" up during the goofy tiger scene.  15 minutes into this one and you get a feeling who the sleazeball is going to be.  Was it just me or was there a lot of sexual innuendo with Ms Tarzan and the tree/light pole straddling? <br><br>\nThere's also reckless carnage, a crazy hellbent army commander, millions of dollars in property damage...well, maybe $100 worth of model kits.  Watch for that big hairy hand and the kooky Tonka dump trucks.  You know, despite the fact that there's a 6 story massive gorilla in the city, the people of Hong Kong took it very well.<br><br>Great kampy fun here, Shaw style!","user":"InzyWimzy","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Wow!!!","rating":4,"date":"12 May 2006","review":"This is not just any King Kong rip-off... this is a King Kong rip-off from the legendary Shaw Bros! Filmed in Shaw Scope! Shady Chinese guys try to find a giant ape in India. The \"exploration\" is wonderfully ridiculous. Then, just when you and your friends think you can't possibly laugh any more, amidst all the Chinese actors appears a beautiful blonde westerner! Raised in the jungle, she swings through the trees like Tarzan with a crazy scream. Her top is glued on... barely.<br><br>Lots of bad, generic 70's music accompany all of this.<br><br>When she shimmies up a tree, legs akimbo, the hapless Chinese explorer guy gets quite an eyeful.<br><br>She can control all the jungle animals. The tigers, cheetahs and elephants all love to frolic with her. Except the snakes. One nasty snake bites her high on the inner thigh. Pretty close to the danger zone. What's the hapless Chinese explorer to do while she writhes in pain? Why stick his face down between her legs and suck the poison out, of course! The miniature sets are fantastically cheap. Not one of them would have qualified for a Godzilla movie. They don't help matters by offering lots of close-ups of the miniature trees and fake streams. You keep expecting a Lionel train to whistle by.<br><br>Samantha (the girl) doesn't command much of any language, preferring grunts. She is so grateful to the hapless Chinese explorer that they make love in her cave. Cue more 70's music.<br><br>Oh, and Samantha, raised in this harsh jungle since a child, wears a lot of make-up.<br><br>The Peking Man changes size a bit, depending on the sets. He seems to range from 20 to 100 feet tall.<br><br>If you enjoy campy trash, this is a must see! Our group has watched a lot of bad movies together but very few have given us as much joy as Mighty Peking Man.","user":"CMUltra","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"This is a MUST SEE!!!","rating":10,"date":"30 January 2000","review":"Words cannot describe this movie, it must be experienced!  Things to watch for:  the explorers climb a cliff with no supplies, but somehow a huge tent filled with sleeping cots is set up in the next scene; the plane diary is in English in a Chinese movie and although the jungle girl can only grunt, she can read the handwriting in the diary with no trouble; the \"costume\" she wears keeps peeling off when she runs...you can even see some of the glue peeling in a couple scenes; AND, the tree-climbing scene is NOT to be missed!!!!!","user":"mesmeric","rank":[20,26]}]
