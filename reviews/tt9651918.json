[{"title":"Charming and Delightful Romance","rating":9,"date":"9 February 2020","review":"A look a love through five anthological stories. Very relatable with a cast that's on point and some genuinely funny (and awkward) moments too. The jumping from one story to another is a little confusing at first but the film soon finds its flow and all the stories end up working well together.<br><br>It's well written and quirky enough to be charming. A very good film for couples to watch and enjoy together.","user":"npgroup","rank":[59,59]},{"title":"Super surprise!","rating":9,"date":"7 February 2020","review":"I'm not that into romcoms even though I acknowledge they're nice to watch now and then. So, when I had this recommendation from a friend of mine, i clicked on the \"Play\" button after a couple of horror movies. Now, I got to admit, I spent a delightful moment with those characters. I wish I could stay longer as I was in very good company. The director knows his stuff and surprisingly, it ends up being above the typical romcoms. We need more like this!","user":"jasonradar","rank":[58,58]},{"title":"great indie rom-com","rating":9,"date":"5 February 2020","review":"This film has everything you need in a rom-com: the longing, heartache, love-lost, newness, awkward interactions, funny meets, modern romance. All that, along with amazing backdrops, beautiful cinematography, and a fun cast. The locations were so lush with color and the shots were so smooth. Well done.<br><br>Independent film-making has come a long way, and Alex Magana keeps delivering great films that you WANT to see.<br><br>Good job everyone. Loved it!","user":"Orphanejk","rank":[58,58]}]
