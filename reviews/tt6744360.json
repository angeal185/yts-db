[{"title":"A wake-up call. Realistic, raw, heartbreaking","rating":8,"date":"17 December 2019","review":"Hats off to Katharine for her directorial debut. She did a great job portraying someone with mental illness. The truth is heart breaking and painful to watch. It's moving and upsetting. Great film to raise awareness about mental illness, something that should become a casual topic yet there still is stigma about it. It was nice to see Simon Pegg in a modest and serious role. He was authentic and accurate. Juno Temple was captivating. Her vulnerability and internal life are beautiful to watch.","user":"andreastefanci","rank":[12,21]},{"title":"A heart-wrenching and gutting journey","rating":9,"date":"15 March 2020","review":"This vulnerable and raw story tugged at my heartstrings and brought me to tears as I sat alone in the theater at the LA premiere. The performances were extraordinary, and Katharine's direction brought the story to life beautifully, making me laugh at some moments and weep at others. This role was absolutely made for Simon Pegg; it brought out the intricacy and intimacy of his acting in a jaw-dropping way, and Juno Temple met him head-on with no difficulty. A beautiful and eye-opening journey that portrays mental illness in a true and uncompromising way few films manage to do.","user":"thejunkofalifetime","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"Losing the transmissions.","rating":8,"date":"9 March 2020","review":"Leaving the great Art of the Brick, (over 100 works of art,made of Lego!)I by chance found a leaflet for the Manchester International Film Festival. Viewing the line-up,I was excited that the film maker of this A-List cast title was doing a Q&amp;A afterwards, leading to me searching for the transmissions.<br><br>View on the film:<br><br>Detailing in the 40 minute Q&amp;A with Simon Pegg, (who due to filming of the latest Mission Impossible in Venice being delayed,could attend here) that Theo's battle with schizophrenia is based on what a close friend has faced, writer/director Katharine O'Brien makes her feature film debut with a up-close intimate atmosphere tuning into the most difficult aspects of Theo's condition.<br><br>Closely working with cinematographer Arnau Valls Colomer, O'Brien trims away wide establishing shots, instead weaving stylish, jagged dissolves cleverly placing the viewer in the mind-set of Theo's condition not allowing for any room of establishment before being shown at it's most serve.<br><br>Inspired by her musician friends struggle with schizophrenia, the screenplay by O'Brien plays fantastic low-key notes to the relationship between Hannah and Theo, as the shyness which holds her in the recording studio, is broken by her speaking up to support Theo, whose warmth towards Hannah and his music production talents are delicately held with the worst destabilising cases of schizophrenia.<br><br>Finding her own voice in the friendship with Theo, Juno Temple gives a wonderful expressive turn as Hannah, whose fragile view of herself in song writing, is hardened by Temple from Hannah finding strength to speak out and support Theo, whilst Alexandra Daddario sparkles as charismatic singer Dana Lee trying with Hannah to reach the hit song note.<br><br>Although he has treated his past Comedy characters seriously, Simon Pegg gives a superb debut \"serious\" performance as Theo, whose condition Pegg maturely presents as a destabilising weight, leaving the glimpse of his music talents, to play out into lost transmissions.","user":"morrison-dylan-fan","rank":[7,13]}]
