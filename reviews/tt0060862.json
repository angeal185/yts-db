[{"title":"4 soldiers of fortune, one kidnapped wife, one explosive mission.","rating":8,"date":"26 June 2010","review":"The Professionals comes out of Columbia Pictures and it is based around the novel \"A Mule for the Marquesa\" written by Frank O'Rourke. Written and directed by Richard Brooks it stars Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Woody Strode, Jack Palance and Claudia Cardinale. A Panavision and Technicolor presentation it features cinematography by Conrad L. Hall and Maurice Jarre scores the music. <br><br>One of the stand out Oaters from the 1960s that is often forgotten in light of what was to come from Sam Peckinpah three years later. Though far more light hearted than \"Bloody Sam's Magnum Opus\" that was The Wild Bunch, Richard Brook's film has many similarities. Themes of friendship, loyalty, disillusionment and of course the changing of the Old West all get dealt a hand here, with Brooks and his team upping the action stakes in a ball of explosions, gun fights and verbal jousting. Hell! The film is even a touch risqu√©, with nudity, sex and a wife in distress that is not as saintly as one would expect. <br><br>Set in 1917 on the Mexican-Texas border, just after the Mexican revolution, The Professionals' only real problem is the thin story. However, Brooks is not interested in going too deep with his plot, he's more concerned with playing it for thrills and back slapping camaraderie. Which works magnificently due to the impressive cast that has assembled for the movie.<br><br>Marvin plays it restrained as Henry 'Rico' Fardan, the weary leader of the group sent into Mexico to \"rescue\" Claudia Cardinale's (sultry but some fluctuating accent issues) Mrs. Maria Grant from the clutches of Palance's (excellent) Bandido supreme, Jesus Raza. Lancaster is a whirlwind of testosterone as explosives expert Bill Dolworth, while Ryan and Strode are smooth background characters as the conscientious Hans Ehrengard &amp; muscular tracker and bowman, Jake Sharp, respectively. The only complaint about the characters comes with Ralph Bellamy's Joe Grant, the apparently fraught husband who sets the men off on their mission. He's in the beginning and the end of the pic, but it's just not enough screen time to really grasp his make up and thus the character is rendered as underdeveloped. <br><br>Hall's photography is exceptional as he shoots on location at Death Valley, Lake Mead and the Valley of Fire State Park in Nevada. The browns are smooth on the eye and the capturing of the odd rock formations a real treat. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his work, as was Brooks in the Best Direction and Best Screenplay categories. The shoot actually suffered some serious problems such as dust storms and flash floods, thus causing severe delays. But the end result was worth it for the film was a success at the box office. The public promptly lapped it up, yes it's a bit close to the knuckle sometimes, but there's never a dull moment in it. It's basically a ripper of a good time. 8/10","user":"hitchcockthelegend","rank":[25,26]},{"title":"Lancaster - The Whirlingist Dervish Of Them All!","rating":8,"date":"20 July 2010","review":"Columbia Picture's epic adventure THE PROFESSIONAS (1966) is a classic western and ranks among my top ten favourites. But for some strange reason this exciting colourful romp is often omitted from \"great westerns\" discussions. Perhaps it's the setting - or the fact of it not having the quintessential unknown cow-town that is marshaled by an idealistic but embattled lawman who along with his crotchety old deputy is in constant conflict with the powerful local rancher and his cowhands. And climaxing with the rancher sending for the fast gun to take on the Marshall. Of course with many variations these things are usually the ingredients of the classic western. But not so with THE PROFESSIONALS. Here we have an almost complete Mexican setting and four men - each with their individual skills - contracted to rescue a big rancher's wife being held by bandits south of the border. Based on the novel by Frank O'Rourke this completely engaging, beautifully constructed action packed adventure was written for the screen and expertly directed by Richard Brooks. The Oscar nominated Panavision cinematography came from the great Conrad Hall.<br><br>With an offer of $10,000 each, mighty rancher(Ralph Bellamy) hires four specialists - lead by Lee Marvin - to rescue his kidnapped much younger wife Maria (Claudia Cardinale) from the clutches of bandit leader Jesus Raza (Jack Palance). \"Jesus - what a name.... for the bloodiest cutthroat in Mexico\" declares Bellamy. Burt Lancaster is the explosives expert. Robert Ryan is the Wrangler and Woody Strode an expert with Long Bow. On the journey Lancaster is asked his plan with the explosives. With a wry smile he explains \"Well I'll tell ye brother.....if we ever do get back to this canyon, I'll light this fuse...... we'll have ten seconds to get the hell out....and then dynamite, not faith, will move this mountain into that pass.... peace brother\". When they eventually do manage to infiltrate the bandit's lair they set the charges and blow the place up but to their shock they find that Maria and Raza are lovers after all (\"Brother we've been had\") and doesn't want to be rescued. Forcibly taking her with them anyway they make a dash for the border with Raza's men in hot pursuit. After an exciting train chase and a terrific canyon gunfight they finally make it back to the rancher's meeting point with Maria and a wounded Raza. The picture ends with Marvin preventing Bellamy from killing Raza (\"You haven't earned the right to kill him\" Lancaster declares) and then sending Maria and Raza back to Mexico together on a buckboard.<br><br>Performances are terrific! Although Lancaster has top billing, Marvin has the leading role. He is the main protagonist around whom all the action centres and he turns in a splendid stern faced portrayal of the conscientious director of the operation. But disappointing is Robert Ryan who gives a rather subdued performance in a surprisingly underwritten role. Lancaster, on the other hand, is a total delight to watch and steals every scene he's in. This marked a very welcome return to form for the actor and brings to mind his much loved swashbuckling roles in \"The Flame &amp; The Arrow\" (1950) and \"The Crimson Pirate\" (1952). Excellent too is Jack Palance in the unusual role of Raza the Mexican bandit leader and also the stunning Claudia Cardinale in her first American movie. Adding great atmosphere to the whole thing is the infectious music by Maurice Jarre. The french composer's score abounds with wonderful indigenous Mexican folk tunes giving the picture an engaging south of the border feel.<br><br>THE PROFESSIONALS is a top notch western adventure. A sublime and well polished example of the genre that has lost none of its sheen in almost forty five years.<br><br>Memorable exchange from THE PROFESSIONALS ;<br><br>Marvin to Lancaster, who is clad only in long-johns \"You'll have to give up this practice of always losing your pants.....it's undignified\". And Lancaster's response \" Yeah... it's drafty too\".","user":"jpdoherty","rank":[32,34]},{"title":"The Damned Bunch.","rating":8,"date":"25 November 2011","review":"Though not as perceptively grim in tone and style as Sam Peckinpah's epitaph The Wild Bunch, Richard Brook's The Professionals almost certainly inspired the former and was also one of the last great westerns Hollywood ever produced. Made at a time when the 'classical' era was waning, Brooks went entirely nostalgic, creating a story about John Wayne-like characters completely loyal to their cause but also flawed in many ways.<br><br>The cast is superb. The exotic beauty of Claudia Cardinale is great fodder for the main cast of Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan and Woody Strode. Although Ryan and Strode have considerably less screen time, the relationship between Lancaster and Marvin is terrifically fleshed out along with Brooks' steady hand guiding the entire process of four men on the hunt to rescue a millionaire's kidnapped wife only to realize all is not as it seems. <br><br>Despite the fact that this film will forever be compared to the ones it inspired like The Wild Bunch or The Dirty Dozen, it should be admired on its own terms. It is a very entertaining and satisfying film with solid writing, acting, directing and editing along with some stunning cinematography of the American southwest. Compared to today's films, who could ask for anything more?","user":"bobsgrock","rank":[17,18]}]
