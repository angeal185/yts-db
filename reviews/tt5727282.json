[{"title":"Former rivals and best enemies","rating":8,"date":"7 September 2017","review":"I was fortunate enough to see \"<a href=\"/title/tt5727282/\">Borg McEnroe (2017)</a>\" on opening night for the 42nd Toronto International Film Festival. Without giving away too much (especially if you're like me and you didn't know much about this 1980s tennis rivalry coming into it), I will say that this is a fabulous film and everyone involved in the making of it should give themselves a huge pat on the back. They have done an incredible job in crafting a story that successfully explores, analyzes and pays homage to two contrasting albeit equally fascinating personalities in sports history.<br><br>Both of the titular characters are played to perfection thanks to virtuoso performances from <a href=\"/name/nm0345695/\">Sverrir Gudnason</a> and <a href=\"/name/nm0479471/\">Shia LaBeouf</a>, the latter of whom was practically made for the role. Regardless of what you think about Shia, his commitment to any role is always awe- inspiring and here he gives a performance that so perfectly combines loud-mouthed arrogance with an icy determination that he actually makes it difficult for you to route against him. He creates a fascinating character alongside the calm, cool and collected persona of Björn Borg, played exquisitely well by Gudnason. Another performance that deserves a mention is that of <a href=\"/name/nm0001745/\">Stellan Skarsgård</a>, whose quiet loyalty really helps to anchor the film in the more pivotal emotional moments.<br><br>In a lot of ways this film reminded me of \"<a href=\"/title/tt1979320/\">Rush (2013)</a>\", another excellent film that deftly explored an iconic sports rivalry and how each athlete helped to shape the other. Like Rush, \"<a href=\"/title/tt5727282/\">Borg McEnroe (2017)</a>\" transcends the sport at hand to become an exploration of human suffering, resilience and, ultimately, redemption. Aside from the themes at hand, the technical brilliance of the film completely grabs your attention and never lets go until the final frame. In what is the first full-feature length film of <a href=\"/name/nm2178458/\">Janus Metz</a>, he creates a film that perfectly captures a game-changing moment in sports history and the contrasting personalities of the men who changed it.<br><br>I really enjoyed this film and encourage anyone reading this to go see it!","user":"pere-25366","rank":[94,111]},{"title":"Ice vs Fire","rating":8,"date":"9 January 2018","review":"I remember this Winbledon finals like it was last month, what a great mach it was between two iconic tennis players, maybe two of the most unforgettable sportsmen ever. \nTwo men, two opposite personalities, one great match, one thrilling drama well directed by Janus Metz and masterfully played by Sverrir Gudnason and Shia LaBeouf as the opponents, still I have to mention Stellan Skarsgård, the man simply doen't know how to act bad in a movie.\nAfter you watch this one you'll go and search for the real game on Youtube, you wont regret it for sure.\n8 out of 10","user":"nsrporfirio","rank":[36,42]},{"title":"A match made in heaven, or a double fault?","rating":8,"date":"8 October 2017","review":"We are currently seeing a vogue for movies about famous sporting rivalries. I think this was kicked off by the excellent Senna (2010), which could have been a fact-of-the-matter biography of Senna but ended up (wisely) focusing on the rivalry between Senna and Prost, which brought an unintended emotional richness to the story. This was followed up by the almost-as-good Rush (2013) which goes back a decade to tell the story of dashing gentlemen racer James Hunt versus the cold, calculating Nikki Lauder. Now, a Swedish-led production effort is telling the story of one of the great tennis matches of all time: four-time champion Bjorn Borg versus the fiery tempered young John McEnroe at the Wimbledon men's final of 1980.<br><br>As a strange pre-note: I watched Borg vs McEnroe in a completely empty theatre. Clearly, this movie is not getting the attention it deserves. I think it definitely affected my viewing experience; I was able to completely shut off and see it my own way. Which is good, as this film has a real psychological edge.<br><br>In short, it was an excellent movie. Surprisingly so, in fact. It got to the point where I forgot I was watching a film and really seemed to be inside the heads of the two leads, right there with them, through every match, every up, every down, every argument, every triumph. This is quite the achievement for a film based in historical fact that can't take too many liberties with the story. <br><br>Within the first couple of scenes, I could tell this was going to be my kind of movie: a real character study. We see a day in the life of global heart-throb mega-star Bjorn Borg, who is beginning to tire of the trappings of fame. I noticed the filmmaking technique of filming Borg in tight, claustrophobic interiors with shadowy men in suits hanging around in the background. It suggests that his life is beyond his control, is being lived for him, and maybe he wants out ... but doesn't know how to do that. All he knows is tennis, and winning.<br><br>Enter the young and fiery John McEnroe, who is a major blip on Bjorn 'Ice'-Borg's radar. If Borg was the ABBA of tennis, McEnroe was the Sex Pistols. Known for ranting at umpires and crowds, he had whipped London's easily baited tabloid newspapers into a frenzy, they could smell blood in the water, and as McEnroe battled his way into the final with a combination of luck, talent and verve, a fairytale match (and perhaps a major upset) was being set up.<br><br>Borg is unquestionably the main character of this film. I think we get about a 70:30 time share between the title characters. This is something of a shame, as I thought that McEnroe was perhaps the more interesting character. How does a New York wiseguy from a good family and lots of opportunities end up pushing himself into becoming a tennis world No. 1? The movie never really tries to answer this question. It focuses much more on Bjorg's backstory as a trouble kid who was recruited - some might say brainwashed - into channelling all his anger into his tennis. In perhaps the movie's best scene, McEnroe makes the link between them clear, and spots that Bjorg may seem like an iceberg but really he's a volcano waiting to go off.<br><br>Shia LeBeouf was an inspired choice to play McEnroe. LeBeouf has always faced fierce criticism of his acting, his suitability for the kind of roles he wins, and has run the tabloid gamut lately with a string of bizarre stories about his life and behaviour. In scenes where McEnroe rants at the press, you feel LeBeouf is really getting something off his chest here. Also excellent is Stellan Skarsgard, who plays a tennis coach with just the right amount of highly questionable morality in pushing youngsters as hard as it takes to produce a champion.<br><br>My one criticism of the film was the cheesy title cards, which spell out explicitly what's supposed to be happening in the movie with things like \"The rivalry would affect the players for the rest of their lives.\" Show, don't tell, is the first rule of filmmaking. However, the movie's technical excellence - the tennis sequences were utterly spellbinding - and surprising emotional heft and depth make this a wholehearted \"Yes - see it\" recommendation from me.","user":"jpt-154-298566","rank":[49,63]}]
