[{"title":"Average follow-up with Telly Savalas as tough officer replacing Lee Marvin","rating":5,"date":"16 May 2011","review":"Telly Savalas training a group of rebels and misfits soldiers for a dangerous assault in a monastery of France . This is a rugged WWII actioner concerning about an experienced officer , Major Wright , he's assigned by Military staff (Ernest Borgnine) to train a dropout group of murderers , criminals and rapists who get a chance to redeem themselves . Savalas reprieves a bunch of ¨Death Row¨ inmates , forges them into a two-fisted fighting unit and leads them on a deadly assignment into Nazi France .The prisoners are oddballs , rag-tag and undisciplined gang (a large cast formed by Randall Tex Cobb , Gary Graham , Bo Svenson , Tom Mathews and the brothers James Van Patten and Vincent Van Patten ), under command a sergeant (Vince Edwards). The team is hardly trained by the Major Whright . In this film Savalas and his motley group , the Dirty Dozen, are suppose to rescue some scientific and destroy a nerve gas manufacturing installation before the Nazis can make enough to use against the Allies . When they arrive in France are helped by the resistance fighters (Emmanuel) . At the end they must participate in the suicidal mission behind the enemy lines , to wipe the French monastery by means of an assault over a strong position located on the North of France.<br><br>Savalas as Maj. Wright assumes the character of the leader of the Dirty Dozen from Lee Marvin in the classic directed by Robert Aldrich and based on the characters created by T.M. Nathanson , being scripted by Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller. This moving film packs frantic thrills, perilous adventures , relentless feats , and buck-loads of explosive action and violence. The noisy action is uniformly regularly-made, especially deserving of mention the rip-roaring final scenes on the impregnable monastery . Rough Telly Savallas is good as leader of the motley pack together thwart the Nazi schemes, as well as the largely secondary cast with special mention to Randall Tex Cobb . Atmospheric and martial musical score by John Cavacas and appropriate cinematography filmed in Zagreb, Croatia . This is is a wartime typical vehicle and into the ¨warlike commando genre¨ , which also belong : Where eagles dare(Brian G. Hutton) and Kelly's heroes(Hutton ), Tobruk (Arthur Hiller) and many others .<br><br>The exciting and original ¨Dirty dozen¨was followed by various sequels , a trio of inferior Telefilms (1985 , 87 , 88) as ¨Dirty Dozen II¨ by Andrew V McLagen with Lee Marvin and Richard Jaeckel , ¨Dirty Dozen III : Deadly mission by Lee H Katzin and ¨Dirty Dozen : Fatal mission¨ also by Lee H Katzin with Heather Thomas , Erik Strada , and Jeff Conaway ; both of them shot at the same time with similar actors and director , being filmed in Croacia.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"It's worth a look.","rating":7,"date":"2 July 2006","review":"Surprisingly good and fairly entertaining thriller as Telly Savalas (who had appeared in the original as one of the twelve convicts not to mention one of the most menacing members of the group) takes over as Wright, the new officer chosen by General Worden (Ernest Borgnine) to recruit and train twelve convicts (Randall \"Tex\" Cobb, Gary Graham, and Bo Svenson among the bunch that are selected for the operation) to attack and destroy several containers of nerve gas hidden in a French monestary and bail out the six scientists who are developing the gas under the close watch of the German SS.<br><br>I'll admit that I did like the \"Deadly Mission\" a lot better than its' predecessor and there's a few reasons (the performances are respectable, the plot twists some of which are slick, and the characters are actually interesting) to back it up. This movie is worth a look.","user":"mhasheider","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"\"Welcome to WW2\".","rating":6,"date":"13 November 2010","review":"Wow after \"The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission (1985)\" they managed to scrape out another two more late 80s straight-to-TV sequels. I didn't even know there was a fourth, yet alone a third. No more Lee Marvin, instead we have Telly Savalas barking the orders. Actually amongst that tough impression is a reflectively moralistic manner that shows he's not your typical by the book soldier. He pushes his men, but for that he grows attached to them. Again it follows the chewy formula of its influencer's; during WW2 a group of misfit stock criminals facing the death penalty are hand picked and trained up in England by Savalas' character to go on a virtual suicide mission behind enemy lines in France to destroy nerve gas containers hidden in a Monastery. Some familiar faces (some slumming it) do pop up in this group; Bo Svenson (who gets a memorable introduction), Vince Edwards, Randall 'Tex' Cobb, Vincent Van Patten, James Van Patten and Thom Mathews (who'll horror fans might recognize). Also featuring is Ernest Borgnine and Wolf Kahler as a German Colonel. It's a sturdily brazen little action joint, as the drama thickens and it builds up to a thrilling climax battle where the act of bravery and redemption shines through. There are enough bangs, secret phrases, cheerful marching music, character conflicts and tension to be entertained within its quick moving time frame.","user":"lost-in-limbo","rank":[9,11]}]
