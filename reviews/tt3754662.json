[{"title":"One-Dimensional, Low, Low Budget Thriller","rating":4,"date":"4 May 2019","review":"\"Recall\" was especially disappointing in its cardboard characters and flimsy plot line. The roles were uniformly stereotypes, such as the crime boss Sal Ventucci, his nephew whom he doesn't trust, the drug lord, and the two step-brothers who hatch a scheme to rob the powerful Ventucci family of $2 million during a drug sale.<br><br>Not only did the Ventucci clan not protect their money very well, but the two stepbrothers were incompetent in their vague plan to carry out the heist. There was lack of substance in the film's narrative and lack of sympathy for any of the characters.<br><br>In the film' structure, the crime drama was disconnected to a subplot of the personal drama about Mike and his girlfriend Nicole, which is told via flashbacks. That storyline was also poorly developed, relying on a messy ending that never revealed the full story of what happened to Nicole and why.<br><br>The film get bogged down in slow-paced conversations, interminable pauses, and one scene that actually repeats itself in the content: the long, agonizing double sequence (one inside a car followed nearly verbatim in the scene in the bar) where Dale persuades his stepbrother Mike to participate in the robbery.<br><br>The relatively positive reviews that argue that the film has been ranked too low are badly mistaken. The comments on this board are far too generous, and the numerical rankings are way too high.","user":"lavatch","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Plot Twist? What Twist?","rating":1,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"This movie had the potential of being interesting, but there were just too many implausible scenes. (1) The mafia is going to leave two million dollars in an unlocked, unguarded car at night with the keys left in the ignition so that someone can just walk up to it and drive it away? (2) Sal, the aging mafia boss, is going to be so good with a gun that he can shoot to death all of the opposing gang members (with guns) in his restaurant and never sustain a scratch? (3) Nicole was murdered by a gunman out in the dark of night for no reason at all?<br><br>I have no idea why some reviewers say there is a twist ending. I see no twist at all. I just see Mikey stopping along a road at night, getting out of his car, and falling onto the road. Are we supposed to guess that he collapsed from a drug overdose? And are we also supposed to guess that he died there? If so, that's not a twist. He told his step-brother earlier in the film that if he wanted to die, that's the way he would do it. And what happened to step-brother Dale, the other main character? Did the mafia henchman John shoot him? It never showed it. And what happened to Alexis?<br><br>The movie ended without our knowing whether the two main characters lived or died and whether the mafia boss recovered his money. This is what I call a rip-off movie. The viewer watches it all the way through and then, when the credits start rolling, he finds out that there are no definite conclusions. Who can enjoy a movie like that?","user":"gwworkman","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Cringe worthy.","rating":1,"date":"27 June 2019","review":"A go to example for teachers to reference when describing how not to fo things.<br><br>A painful chore to watch...it really could not be anything other than a Canadian film made for television. Terrible in every way from script to acting. A better title could well have been 'Dudfellas'.","user":"jake-97627","rank":[9,10]}]
