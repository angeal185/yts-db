[{"title":"It is real","rating":8,"date":"13 December 2018","review":"Amy (Ashleigh Dorrell ) is an Irish-American going to school in Limerick. She gets a nightshift job at the Limerick Hotel where 10 years ago some gruesome murders happened. They never found the killer.<br><br>Amy is afraid of the dark, a feature that was not utilized that well. The feature demonstrated Stephen King influences, and there were times I thought I was watching the master himself. The soundtrack needed to be more engaging and the revelation of the killer's identification didn't go that well, primarily due to a lack of suspects, Scooby-Doo.<br><br>Nice ghost-slasher.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity even though Amy takes two showers.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[18,29]},{"title":"Better watch season 5 of American Horror Story","rating":3,"date":"18 December 2018","review":"Poor directing, poor acting, dumb story, not original, the only ones who clearly LOVE it is the film crew (7 x 10 stars???). Want so see a Hotel horror movie worth your while? See The Shining, Vacancy, Hostel, Cold Prey or my favorite from 1981(!) The Beyond.","user":"the_real_smile","rank":[24,44]},{"title":"Very good execution of a good thought out plot!","rating":7,"date":"4 January 2019","review":"Absolutely surprising given the ratings some amateurs have left, don't trust its overall score, its a slow burner granted, but its a good plot, a good setting and the acting is good too! You can tell everyone involved was dedicated to this film. Definitely worth the watch.","user":"liampw","rank":[9,15]}]
