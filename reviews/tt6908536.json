[{"title":"Another Chinese Military Might Propaganda film","rating":13,"date":"13 April 2018","review":"As predicted, the Chinese movie industries under the new guidance and new policy of Chinese Communist Party, more and more Chinese military movies would be churned out regularly. These films are all big budget ones, heavily supported and sponsored by the Chinese government that only serve two purposes: 1) Let the Chinese people believe that their military power is so strong, not only just protect their own territory, it could also do some damages abroad anywhere, anytime. 2) Let the foreign countries and the foreigners to see how powerful the Chinese forces are now, and they are ready and capable to deal with any unfriendly situation. <br><br>These are the Chinese \"Main Tune, Main Steam\" movies: Wolf Warrior, Wolf Warrior 2, Operation Red Sea and this \"Sky Hunter\". Wolf Warrior showed you how intrepid the Chinese Army Special Force on the land. Wolf Warrior 2 and Operation Red Sea showed you the joint operations by the Chinese Army Special Force and the Chinese Navy Force. Sky Hunter, sponsored by the Chinese Air Force. <br><br>This \"Sky Hunter\" would give you a general idea about the Chinese Air Force, their \"Air Superior\" should be seriously observed by the Western and the Asian countries. They are more than ready to deal with any challenge from unfriendly foreign countries.","user":"LogicIsEverything","rank":[13,19]},{"title":"Dull, dull, dull","rating":3,"date":"14 April 2018","review":"Pros:\nHas some interesting shots of aircraft<br><br>Cons:\nPretty much everything else. includes\n - Badly done aerial combat sequences. Top Gun was fun, included real aircraft, but the combat wasn't realistic. This has very few \"real aircraft\" shots in it, linked to combat sequences that looked like they were dreamt up by a 7 year old playing with a couple of Tamiya kits\n - Dull plot that seemed to scrape the worst bits from Top Gun, Behind Enemy Lines 2 (yes, that laughable \"being chased by missile\" sequence), and Blackhawk down\n - Flat characters, none of whom it was possible to give a stuff about\nAbsolute bargain basement DVD section for this one.","user":"mike_kitchen","rank":[12,19]},{"title":"Chinese Top Gun - sorry","rating":1,"date":"18 November 2018","review":"Just watch Top Gun then Sky Hunter.\nRace baiting won't improve a poor film.","user":"randyc-76387","rank":[5,7]}]
