[{"title":"Cheap","rating":1,"date":"20 January 2019","review":"Cheap and mediocre documentary on the sexual harassment charges against Harvey Weinstein. No exclusive interviews, no news, nothing that we don't already know. Just 90 long and boring minutes of archive footage we've seen before. Skip it.","user":"bernardoarquivo","rank":[21,24]},{"title":"worst documentary ever","rating":1,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"I was angry after watching this film, not because of Harvey, but because the terrible quality of this documentary. The roughness is beyond apprehension. This movie is not deserve even on YouTube.","user":"new859","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Worthy of watching","rating":7,"date":"7 May 2019","review":"The bad reviews saying it's all been seen and heard before are probably for americans, where this matter was exhaustively coveraged. For the rest of the world, there are a lot of things that are new, many unseen interviews. My only critssism is that at the end it gets a little repetitive, but it is still worthy of watching.","user":"Bela-","rank":[4,4]}]
