[{"title":"Charming Gen-X Buddy Road Film","rating":9,"date":"9 April 2020","review":"This film has stayed with me long after viewing it. It invites you on a cross-country road trip with two characters that are simultaneously familiar and foreign. Highlighting the Technicolor beauty of the American landscape, these two historic friends explore the complex kaleidoscope of Americana as they unravel the mysteries of who they have become in midlife. Beyond the gorgeous scenery, the highlight of the film is the dialogue of self-reflection and deception between these two, running the gamut of politics, relationships, and random oddness that is the hallmark of the intimacy between real friends. A charming film of what skate punk rebellion looks like when Gen-Xers grapple with the new millennium world they find themselves in now.","user":"earthenbody","rank":[0,0]}]
