[{"title":"She was here.","rating":3,"date":"26 February 2018","review":"The film is inspired by true events but does not appear to be based on a true story. Ally (Sydney Sweeney) who doesn't seem to want to be in El Salvador is kidnapped by The Disciples who specialize in trafficking humans. Mom (Lauren Shaw) springs into action, but is not Liam Neeson trained so she gets the help of someone who is. Pretty much it. Less action and tough talk than most white girl gets kidnapped film. Boring compared to other films in the same genre, except for maybe the one where mom hacks into computers to find her daughter. <br><br>Guide: No swearing or nudity. Coerced sex.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Duped","rating":4,"date":"6 August 2018","review":"Sad to see that important stories are often made into worthless movies. This one does not raise any emotions or keep a viewer glued to the screen. The actors seem to be indifferent or are merely disinterested participants.<br><br>For a movie based on true events, this is the worst I have seen. 'Traffik' dealing with the same subject is a much better movie.","user":"pietclausen","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"More fake reviews","rating":3,"date":"16 July 2018","review":"Always amazes me how folks are still duped by all the one-off high rating reviews posted by 'members' who joined just when a film was released, especially those with a zillion \"!\" splattered around their 'review'. Drawing a deep breath this one is at best worth a 3.","user":"primesuspect-75392","rank":[8,9]}]
