Seems kinda shady to me.","user":"friedfrogg","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Booooooooooriiiiiiiing","rating":1,"date":"11 August 2018","review":"Went to see that with my kids. We were all totally bored.

The voices don't really make sense with the characters, the animation is terrible and the only thing worse is the writing! OMG how did anyone read the script for this and think 'oh that's a good movie' - whoever did, needs to be seen by some senior psychologists because they clearly aren't making good decisions.<br><br>If there is one good thing that comes out of this movie, I hope it's that everyone involved with this project decides to leave the animated movie business and do something else with their lives - because it obviously isn't working for them.<br><br>Save yourselves - don't just avoid watching this, ban it from your houses and tell everyone you ever meet (just stop random people in the street) to never watch 'Here comes the Grump'.","user":"msargeant-26624","rank":[2,2]}]
