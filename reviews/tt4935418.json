[{"title":"A mostly successful feature horror debut from Turkey","rating":7,"date":"17 September 2015","review":"Baskin comes from a country for which horror genre outings are quite atypical to see. Despite not having much to compare with locally, it is clearly a passionate and well-made horror even when examined against countries that contribute to the genre much more frequently. Not terrific, but a great start to a young filmmaker's career. <br><br>The film is about a set of five cops who are patrolling their neighbourhood at night. They receive a call for backup coming from a part of town associated with many fantastic and far-fetched story. Upon entering it, they find themselves in a place none other than Hell. <br><br>I was quite entranced by Can Evrenol's direction, it was surprisingly confident for a first feature, daring to aim for difficult scenes and set-ups right off the bat. The opening 15 minutes in the restaurant were my favourites. They use numerous very long, very slow takes, which captured a sense of slow building dread despite the hilarious conversation going on between the cops. His flair for beauty and the abstract persists later on as well, especially in scenes where he combines multiple perceptions of reality (loved the room filling up with water). I am definitely a fan of his after seeing this movie. <br><br>I do think that the first third of the film is its strongest, because oh the sense of undefined dread. Once the cops enter \"hell\", the movie is still entertaining but becomes more of a torture-porn outing, without that much story. I like the reference to the mythological hellish trials and tribulations from Greek mythology, but I would have preferred a stronger plot. The circular reference of the film kind of bothered me, because it is an extremely common trope of \"characters in limbo/hell\" movies (like House Hunting, Haunter, etc), and I would have liked to see something more original. <br><br>The acting was quite fantastic for the budget. All of the cops did a great job, the likable ones managed to be truly likable, the hateable ones easily made themselves repulsive to the viewer. The physically \"unique\" actor who played the master of the hell domain was very creepy and good in his role, with zero prosthetics to boot! Great casting choice. <br><br>Overall, Baskin could have used improvements in terms of storytelling, but it is absolutely worth seeing as a piece of horrific art, morbidly beautiful to watch. 7/10","user":"horrorinpureform","rank":[62,76]},{"title":"a slow descent into glorious hell","rating":8,"date":"10 September 2016","review":"I went to watch this moving knowing that the best was kept for last. The final 30 minutes were promised to be filled with violence and gore. Maybe that is why it didn't bother me to \"wait\", taking the time to get to know the characters and build some anticipation for the final moments. That is also why I wasn't disappointed, as many viewers seem to have been.<br><br>While I \"waited\", I was hinted by the dialogue on how to understand the horrifying last scenes, and what the Hell was going on, no pun intended. The movie leads us to several interpretations of the ending, I'll list mine below:<br><br>**** SPOILERS **** **** SPOILERS **** . .. ...<br><br>1st theory: Arda was traumatized by his friend's death and dreamed the whole thing.<br><br>2nd theory: They were all a bunch of sinners (the prostitutes, the pork eating, the violence), died in a car crash and experienced eternal damnation to hell in a loop.<br><br>3rd theory: Ardra was the son of the Devil. The dream in which he hears his mother having sex refers to the night he was conceived - there is a hand pulling him from darkness, the same hand that reaches for him in the water (amniotic fluid) - his Father's hand. The master of ceremonies is \"The Father\" in the credits. Maybe Ardra's mother was impregnated by the devil (or her possessed husband), which is why they asked their friend (the Boss) to protect Ardra and keep him safe, as if they already knew he was in danger of something terrible happening to him. In the bar, the Boss asks Ardra to look further in the room, to check for a supernatural presence (The Father), which he can and does. Meaning the Boss knew there was something \"special\" about Ardra. The Boss says he's the key to the whole thing and ends up offering a key to Ardra that eventually kills The Father. This could be a metaphor to the fact that the boss knew the truth about Ardra's destiny - after using the key, he returns to his usual dream, but this time the boy in the dream is completely pulled into darkness. Also, after The Father kills the Boss, he bathes in his blood and Ardra does the exact same thing after killing Him. There are a lot of references to sex and breeding, there is even a \"woman\" giving birth to some sort of monster. So birth is a frequent reference in the movie. Frogs in dreams mean spiritual/mind transformation, so maybe that night was the transformation of Ardra into what he was supposed to be - killing the Father and becoming Him, which is why he can't leave in the end and ultimately gets hit by the van - maybe he's finally sent to Hell in the crash, while his friends survive and get on with their lives... but we can't be sure of this. ... .. .<br><br>**** END SPOILERS **** **** END SPOILERS ****<br><br>Baskin is an amazing movie if you want to take the time to interpret it. If not, it's just a slow burner with a gory ending. For me, it was an intelligent film that left me wondering and wanting to find out the origin of all that violence.<br><br>The dialogues were smart and funny, the musical score was intense and well picked, the actors were superb, the effects were very good and the villain was unforgettable.<br><br>Watch the movie while trying to create your own explanation for the gory climax, and you will absolutely love it, like I did.","user":"susana-c-fernandes","rank":[20,24]},{"title":"An eerie, bloody, gory, fever dream!","rating":8,"date":"13 April 2016","review":"I'd had my eye on this movie for over a year. Constantly checking to see if, when, and where it was getting released. The first trailer for it immediately hooked me, and I needed to see this movie. Now I finally have, and I can safely say the wait was worth it. With what little reviews are even out there at this point, critics and keyboard warriors are complaining that Baskin is 'low on plot'. Hearing that as a complaint really grinds my gears. See, there are some movies that are just devoid of enough creativity to generate an interesting plot, and then there are other movies like Baskin, that are that way by design. If you don't like the movie... fine. But, it's REALLY well made.<br><br>The 'low on plot' complaint gets more absurd the more I think about it because so many masterful and classic movies have threadbare plots and nobody even bats an eyelash. In fact, they praise how it does so much with so little. Where's THAT love for Baskin? Writer and director Can Evernol has crafted a wonderfully nightmarish movie that seems to understand the very fabric of a bad dream- a dream you keep trying to wake up from and can't. Baskin makes enough sense from scene to scene that you can follow the narrative as a movie, but there are enough plot threads and details that stick out to give the movie a thoroughly dreamlike quality.<br><br>It dives in and out of deeper dream realms, characters deliver spooky speeches about fate and death. The camera fetishizes details that look irrelevant, so your eyes are drawn in, scouring the scene for clues or hints or something lurking in the shadows. Every scene is atmospheric and moody, giving the movie an uneasy vibe even when not much is really happening. The movie has a simple plot, but that doesn't mean it's a simple movie. It leaves a lot open to your imagination, but not in the way you might think. That concept when married to horror movies usually means that the killers or the monster isn't ever really seen, or that all the gory stuff happens off screen. Neither is true of Baskin.<br><br>It lets you use your imagination when it comes to the story. There's obviously a much bigger and more complex history to the antagonists of this movie, and thinking about what that might be is just as unnerving and scary as watching them kill their victims. And, speaking of victims, by the time our protagonists, a team of five police officers, happen to stumble across their lair, an old abandoned police station- we can clearly see they've been at this for a while. This small cult has killed dozens and dozens of people in extremely brutal and ritualistic manners. Also, I've got to give props to the filmmakers for creating one of the most disturbing looking cults I've ever seen.<br><br>Especially the perfect casting of the cult leader in Mehmet Cerrahoglu. Now, obviously, that name won't mean much to most audiences because this is Mehmet's first and only screen credit. But... oh my god. His performance was deeply unsettling and extremely disturbing. I can see a bright (or dark..?) future for him in horror movies. He's like a new Michael Berryman, and I say that with as much love and fondness for this genre and the actors in it as humanly possible. He stole the whole show away from the well established leads up to that point. Mehmet had dynamic and chilling on screen presence.<br><br>A lot of Can Evernol's inspirations are readily apparent to genre fans. Clive Barker, Eli Roth, David Lynch, and Nicolas Winding Refn- to name just a few. He manages to blend an eerie Euro art-house vibe with a hardcore splatter flick vibe. Actually, no- scratch that. He doesn't blend them- he does something a lot riskier. The first half of the movie is eerie Euro art-house cinema, and the second half of the movie smashes in, rubbing our faces in the anxiety inducing, gross- out, extreme gore, of your (above) average splatter flick. Baskin might not be the bloodiest or most insane movie ever, but just because I- as a genre fan, am jaded as hell, doesn't mean I can't recognize it for the demented and wild ride that it is.<br><br>It's a sick and haunting movie that is more concerned with moods and instantly disturbing imagery than it is with backstory and plotting. The necessary story bits are told through the characters and their interactions, and that was fine to me. I liked that aspect of the movie. Baskin succeeds overall, but excels in leaving you with memorable images of things the average person wouldn't ever want to see, let alone have it stuck in their head. Baskin doesn't look cheap, or low budget. It's immersive and gritty, and it's readily apparent flaws can be chalked up to differing tastes and opinions. Some people like more plot-heavy horror movies, so obviously they might be let down by Baskin a bit, but that doesn't mean it's thin plot is a flaw.<br><br>In retrospect, the movie does feel rather small. It only really has three locations, a restaurant, a highway, and the old not-so-abandoned police station. What makes it feel small is how little actually happens in each location. The movie milks each second it can out of every setting it has, and it's surprisingly effective. In lesser hands, this movie would've been an absolute misfire. But, as is, it's a slick and well made piece of gore-splatter cinema. It's moody cinematography, vibrant colors, and synth heavy score bring to mind an extra bloody and Satanic spun Wrong Turn by way of Nicolas Winding Refn. I couldn't say that like it's a bad thing even if I tried. Baskin is destined for overnight cult status, and genre immortality. I loved it.","user":"NiteOwl94","rank":[32,41]}]
