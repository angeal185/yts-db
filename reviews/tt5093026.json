[{"title":"Watch the Original Fil","rating":5,"date":"28 October 2018","review":"This isn't a bad remake, but McQueen and Hoffman deliver such amazing performances in the original film, this film was always going to find that impossible to get close to. Whilst it's a reasonable stand-alone film and not a bad movie, you just find yourself comparing it to the original at every turn. A classic film, is a classic film and should really be left alone. I'd prefer directors and producers to look at new projects and new ideas. Rehashing movies that have already been brilliantly done, are just a waste of resources. I would advise anyone wanting to watch this movie, just watch the original.","user":"jrbond-57624","rank":[176,239]},{"title":"Lacks the emotional impact of the original","rating":7,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"Having just viewed this film I am at a loss to see why it has been made. It is a good movie in itself but it lacked, for me, the emotional impact that the original carried. Also it does seem to be a straight remake of the original with very few important differences. I love this story and would rate the original as an 8.5, with this one a 7.5 simply because it adds nothing to the story except more blood and swearing.","user":"scdodger","rank":[25,32]},{"title":"Not bad, but it's not good, either!","rating":4,"date":"26 October 2018","review":"Flat characters and unimaginative, choppy direction attempt to tell the story of the friendship of two convicts.<br><br>There's a lot of emphasis on a few brutal scenes yet there's scant coverage of the relationships of the characters. But for the most part it's just a visual jumble. The narrative jumps about and spends too long on lingering scenes and nowhere near enough time on characters and the linear story-line.<br><br>The effects of years of brutality have almost no physical effect on the prisoners who look like they just hopped out of make-up after a good lunch!<br><br>The 1973 version is timeless and a work of cinematic genius. This version will be forgotten in a few weeks.","user":"khunkrumark","rank":[129,193]}]
