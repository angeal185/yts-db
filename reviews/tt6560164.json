[{"title":"It's decent enough","rating":6,"date":"25 October 2019","review":"I don't like comments that offend my intelligence just because I liked this movie. Such as \"if you have an IQ below 40, you will enjoy this movie.\" Well, smart guys, if you didn't like the movie, it doesn't mean that the ones who did are stupid.\nThe movie isn't great. It's good enough and it has some creepy moments. Kiersey Chlemons did a good job. At least she portrayed how would I feel and act if I was in that situation.<br><br>If you want to kill some time and watch a decent movie, then I recommend it. If you are a person with high IQ and want to entertain your brain, then it might be better for you to read a book of astrophysics.","user":"AlexanderTomic","rank":[124,133]},{"title":"Sweetheart: A Successful Exercise in Minimalistic Horror","rating":7,"date":"18 May 2019","review":"Most of this film involves a woman trapped on an island, alone. Still, don't expect this film to be boring. The use of visual storytelling is quite impressive, and while it's not quite a masterpiece, it doesn't drag the way the premise implies it may.<br><br>Highly recommended for anyone who loves horror, or has a Castaway fetish.","user":"nihilistic_tyranny","rank":[80,108]},{"title":"A horrors fan \"The Shape of Water\"","rating":6,"date":"15 October 2019","review":"Blumhouse straight to digital release is a cozy one, perfect for an cold autumn evening. It had one of the aspects that make some of the best horror, in my opinion. Isolation...(I.E. Alien, Predator, The Thing) Better than just a cabin in the woods. This story unfolds on a deserted island. You can run, but in circles.<br><br>I appreciate never getting a full daylight view of the monster. My imagination fills in the blanks just fine thank you.","user":"FIoret","rank":[51,70]}]
