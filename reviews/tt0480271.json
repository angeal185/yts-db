[{"title":"Don't watch this","rating":1,"date":"2 December 2006","review":"First let me start by saying I was a huge Van Wilder fan and enjoy all of Kal Penn's work, be it in Van Wilder, Harold &amp; Kumar, and even American Desi. This film, however, was a disaster. The plot is unimaginative; Taj arrives in a British university and leads a misfit group of losers against a wealthy, socially elite house in an intra-fraternal competition. The object of Taj's affection unfortunately winds up being the girlfriend of his biggest antagonist, the head of the rival fraternity house (see the original Van Wilder for a blatantly similar romantic situation).<br><br>This just wasn't funny at all. I crack up pretty easily and laughed less than 5 or 6 times during an hour an a half. And even then, I was forcing it just because I felt like I forked down $10, and if I didn't even laugh once, I'd have been bamboozled of my money. The only redeeming scenes are those featuring Taj's parents, who are in the film for less than 10 minutes and managed to pull my rating from a 1 to a 2. Every other joke was corny, unfunny, and otherwise dull. The writing and directing were so uninspired that it was actually painful to watch this movie. The problem with this film was half conceptual too, since Taj was only funny in Van Wilder in the limited doses we got. Goofy Indian accents aren't enough to carry an hour and a half long poorly written train wreck, and that's what we saw here.<br><br>The thing that really bothered me was that I could feel Kal Penn's career dying before my eyes. I really don't know how anyone who read this script could agree to do it, especially him, because he was the only actor with a future in this movie. He had at least moderate buzz going for him after a string of decent performances, and then releases this nonsense. I can only hope that movie studios will forgive him, because it was difficult to watch this.","user":"rockeymallavia","rank":[100,140]},{"title":"It really wasn't that bad","rating":7,"date":"13 May 2007","review":"The bad reviews are kind of astonishing. I'm not sure what people were expecting for a National Lampoon's flick. I mean, the things we can compare it to are: \"Adam and Eve,\" \"Going the Distance,\" and \"Barely Legal.\" The series is now just a raunch-fest of low-brow humor. If that's not what you're into, why did you watch the movie? The soundtrack of this movie was priceless, and people who point out the formulaic nature of the story should realize that it was the point. It wasn't a film that took itself seriously. It was a NATIONAL LAMPOONS movie. The series hasn't involved any family friendly humor since Christmas Vacation.<br><br>It's funny for a laugh, and I think people need to lighten up a bit. I'm tough to please, and I thought the movie was worth a few chuckles. The final scene (which I won't spoil, but can tell you it has to do with swords) was the coup de gr√¢ce for this underrated film. I give it a 7, out of 10.","user":"brian090888","rank":[41,59]},{"title":"Oh my god","rating":2,"date":"21 January 2007","review":"After making a great supporting role in Van Wilder and being pretty damn funny in Harold and Kumar, I had kind of high hopes for Kal Penn, but Oh God does this movie suck.<br><br>Short of changing the actor who plays the lead character for a sequel, the worst thing you can do when making a sequel is get rid of the main character who is in this case also the title character (how can it be called Van wilder 2 if Van Wilder isn't freaking in it?).<br><br>A brief synopsis of the story is that Taj goes to England and starts trying to do Van's thing in a posh college, he also somehow gets involved in a dog show. Sounds pretty lame, doesn't it? Well, yeah it is. Not only is it not funny at all, but again there's the completely stupid British stereotypes flying around as if people even found them funny the first time round.<br><br>Don't waste your time","user":"Confidante77","rank":[64,97]}]
