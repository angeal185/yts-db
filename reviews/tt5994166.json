[{"title":"A better movie than its IMDB score would suggest","rating":8,"date":"28 December 2018","review":"The wide swing in positive and negative reviews for At First Light would suggest that the movie is not for everyone. It does not deserve to be savaged by reviewers who expected from it something it was not intended to provide. It is not by any means ordinary low-budget sci-fi fare; the production values and effects are good, and the performances are commendable. It is, in the tradition of 2001 and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, more poetic than expository, and perhaps if it had had the budget of those movies it would be better received. Criticism that it is not sufficiently self-explanatory is misplaced, since any attempt to explain things that are supposed to be incomprehensible would have diminished the movie.<br><br>At the same time it is not perfect: its pacing is too deliberate for modern audiences, and its premise is far from original. But those who are not in a great hurry and who enjoy science fiction will probably come away satisfied with the viewing experience. The movie should have an IMDB rating above 7; 8 may be a little high in the grand scheme of things, but one must do what one can do to nudge it towards where it belongs.","user":"tg5972195","rank":[43,57]},{"title":"A very well made teenage sci-fi/romance film","rating":8,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"I'm 49 and saw this with my teenage kids and I must say, I enjoyed this as much as they did. If you're expecting a huge Hollywood blockbuster production, this isn't it, but it was still a surprisingly very well produced overall low budget B-film. It was very well directed and fairly decently written - aside from a few plot holes and issues. The cast were all excellent and convincing in their roles. The cinematography was on point, and what little SFX there was, it was done professionally, not cheesy like some recent sci-fi's I've seen. This is a fun and entertaining film for the entire family. It certainly leaves the door open for a sequel, and I hope they do make one. A well deserved 7.5 rounded up to an 8/10 from me.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[56,79]},{"title":"Not what i was expecting","rating":8,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"I thought this was a well made film with good characters. Definitely not your usual teeny bopper garbage (that always seem to do really well). Whilst this may have been aimed at a teenage audience based on it's main characters, to me it had a more grown up feel. The reviews suggest this film is a bit Marmite, you either love it or hate it. I loved it and would recommend.","user":"haltny-57743","rank":[27,39]}]
