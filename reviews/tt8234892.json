[{"title":"Knives and Skin (Peaks)","rating":7,"date":"23 October 2019","review":"Now I reckon, since I will be not really in the extreme here (loving/hating), I am losing a lot of people already. But for those willing to read on, let me get into what my thoughts are on the movie, the overall feeling/mood it delivers and what that should mean.<br><br>Now I've only seen Twin Peaks Season 1 (the very first one) and I will review that show when I get around to watch the rest. Why is that important. Without knowing where that show goes and not saying this is a carbon copy, this indeed can be put in the same universe as that show. People act weird, there are many different elements of different genres mixed in. You might think that makes this convoluted or genius. It will depend on your own views and maybe even state of mind while watching this.<br><br>Suspension of disbelief, cliches and a lot of weird dialog not to mention supernatural stuff happening (or maybe not?), it is tough to put a finger on it and pin point where this is supposed to be on a certain scala. Again, it is your taste that will decide which direction you will lean on concerning your view on this. One thing is for sure: it is very well made","user":"kosmasp","rank":[13,25]},{"title":"Like a Fever Dream","rating":8,"date":"8 March 2020","review":"Indeed this movie \"felt\" like \"Donnie Darko meets Twin Peaks for me. It's a very unique film and if you dig deep you'll see it's composed of consistent metaphors. If you want to see something unlike anything you've seen, this film definitely fits the bill.","user":"jennaelectric","rank":[1,7]}]
