There is a certain truth to this: like the Raymond Chandler novel on which it is based, the plot is extremely complicated, and it requires the viewer to mentally track an unexpected number of characters--including two characters that never appear on screen, a pivotal character who doesn't actually have any lines, and a character who is frequently mentioned but doesn't appear until near the film's conclusion. There is not, however, as much truth to the accusation that the film never exposes all the killers: only one killer is not specifically identified, but even so his identity is very clearly implied.<br><br>All this having been said, THE BIG SLEEP is one helluva movie. In general, the story concerns the wealthy Sternwood family, which consists of an aging father and two \"pretty and pretty wild\" daughters--one of whom, Carmen, is being victimized by a blackmailer. P.I. Philip Marlowe is hired to get rid of the blackmailer, but an unexpected murder complicates matters... and touches off a series of killings by a number of parties who have covert interests in the Sternwood family.<br><br>Perhaps the most amazing thing about the film is that you don't actually have to pick apart the complicated story in order to enjoy it. The script is famous for its witty lines and sleek sexual innuendo--much of it lifted directly from Chandler's novel--and the cast is a dream come true. Philip Marlowe would be played by a great many actors, but none of them ever bested Humphrey Bogart, who splendidly captures the feel of Chandler's original creation; with the role of Vivien Sternwood Lauren Bacall gives what might be the finest performance of her screen career; and the chemistry between the two is everything you've ever heard. The supporting cast is superlative, all the way from Martha Vickers' neurotic turn as Carmen Sternwood to Bob Steele's purring hit-man Canino. There's simply not a false note to be found any where. Although the film really pre-dates the film noir movement the entire look of THE BIG SLEEP anticipates noir to a remarkable degree--it would be tremendously influential--and director Hawks gives everything a sharp edge from start to finish.<br><br>Two versions of THE BIG SLEEP are included on the DVD: the film as it was originally shot and the film as it was released to theatres in 1946. The actual differences between the two are fairly slight, but they prove significant. Although the original version is somewhat easier to follow in terms of story, it lacks the flash that makes the theatrical version such a memorable experience; it is easy to see why Hawks elected to rescript and reshoot several key scenes as well as add new ones, and both newcomers and old fans will have fun comparing the two. The DVD also includes an enjoyable documentary on the differences between the films and the motivations behind them.<br><br>I don't usually comment on picture quality unless there is a glaring issue, but several reviewers have noted portions of this print have a flicker or seem a bit washed out. I noticed these problems, but I can't say that they in any way distracted from my enjoyment of the film, and they certainly don't prevent me from recommending it--be it on the big screen, television, video or this DVD. And I recommend it very, very strongly indeed.<br><br>Gary F.

A dying old man has two beautiful, uncontrollable daughters: Vivien (Lauren Bacall), and Carmen (Martha Vickers).  Carmen is being blackmailed, and her father hires P.I. Christopher Marlowe (the beloved Humphrey Bogart) to get the blackmailer off her back.  But Marlowe finds that somebody else has done this job for him: the blackmailer is murdered almost under his nose.  And as he puts it, \"That didn't stop things. That just starts 'em.\"<br><br>I have not read Raymond Chandler's novel, on which this movie was based, but those who have say the title refers to death.  That is never explained in the movie.  Howard Hawks packs so much plot into 114 minutes of footage that the movie feels like it's bursting at the seams.  The story is not incomprehensible as some would have it; while there are many improbable coincidences, there is no element I can point to and say \"That couldn't have happened.\"  (Although I'm still not quite sure how Carmen got into Marlowe's apartment).  True, the plot really is very hard to follow, and Marlowe's periodic explanations of events, without which the movie would indeed be nonsensical, smack more of inspired guesswork than logical deduction.  But the furious pace at which the plot unfolds lends more excitement to the movie than nine out of ten of today's lazily plotted would-be thrillers.<br><br>THE BIG SLEEP's greatest strength is its delightfully droll dialogue.  When Chandler writes the novel and then Faulkner helps adapt it, you expect some verbal fireworks, and you sure do get them.  \"How do you like your brandy?\" \"In a glass.\" - \"You're not very tall, are you?\" \"I try to be.\" - \"I'm getting cuter every minute.\" - \"Such a lot of guns around town, and so few brains.\" - \"Is it any of your business?\" \"I could make it my business.\" \"I could make your business mine.\"  \"You wouldn't like it. The pay's too small.\" - \"She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up.\"  Bogie and Bacall get two of the best exchanges; they have a horse-racing discussion where racy double-entendres are dripping like savory sauce off of every word, and they also get a truly hilarious telephone conversation where Marlowe convinces Vivien not to call the police.<br><br>But THE BIG SLEEP has a harder side that is also effective.  It is shockingly violent for a movie produced under the stern eyes of the Hayes code censors.  The movie is too unpredictable to generate much suspense (you can't dread something you don't know is going to happen), but the ending is one of the most intense, nailbiting scenes you'll ever see.<br><br>The 1940s were not a great era for film music, which makes Max Steiner's brooding score all the more impressive.  The print I saw was very low-quality, so I can't judge the cinematography.<br><br>The acting is wonderful.  Bogart gets to show his chops at one point by switching off the hard-boiled personality he developed for THE MALTESE FALCON and impersonating an antiquarian bookworm.  Bacall radiates class whether she's at ease smoking in a cafe or outwitting a man holding her at gunpoint.  Martha Vickers' Carmen strikes the perfect balance of appealing seductiveness and outright nastiness.<br><br>One final note: this movie is almost Bond-like in terms of the number of appallingly beautiful women Marlowe accidentally encounters, all of whom seem to have a burning desire for him.  Even his taxi driver wants him. Dorothy Malone, whose character name we never learn, plays the sexiest book seller you will ever meet (and yes, she wears glasses; eat your heart out, Dorothy Parker!). Minus fifty points for credibility, plus a hundred points for entertainment.  Regrettably, I cannot promise similar thrills for the female audience; it just kind of depends on how you like Men In Suits.<br><br>Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.","user":"Danimal-7","rank":[139,163]}]
