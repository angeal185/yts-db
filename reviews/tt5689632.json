[{"title":"Starts fine but tails oout into the ridiculous and sentimental.","rating":3,"date":"3 September 2019","review":"Bit of a ridiculous story. Botoxed widowed pensioner Angelica Huston objects to waster brother Bill Pullman making a play for her property. Pullman with his idiot son and a stuttering Julia Stiles who plays the sons girlfriend are ready to complicate Hustons life. Not particulary overly funny and the ending is a bit sugary. Observation the hospital Pullman goes to after being shot by Huston is totally empty of other people. David Morse plays the most likeable character. He swoons after Huston. I would imagine this is a TV Movie for the masses yet in the United Kingdom , the main cable providers (SKY television) are pushing this as their Premiere movie. Money for old rope. Not complete crap but close to it.","user":"bazookamouth-221-898097","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Quailty acting","rating":8,"date":"14 March 2019","review":"The acting is so very fine, this movie is under rated, Bill Pullman is such a talented actor. Don't miss this one if you are into the great acting of actors.","user":"reb91144","rank":[2,6]},{"title":"Not funny, while it was suppose to be exactly that. Uncredible acting performances, lackluster story, slowburning direction. Tv movie quality, at best...","rating":4,"date":"10 April 2019","review":"Wow, actress Anjelica Houston, whom I hadnt heard from in a while. She looked gorgeous back in the days, but those days have gone. Never mind how she looks now, she doesnt act convincingly. At all. Although it is suppose to be a comedy, characters still have to act credibly. Anjelica Houston fails at delivering a credible performance though. Fails big time. And since she is one of only 2 leading characters, this movie is going nowhere.<br><br>It is not terribly bad. It just aint really funny. Bill Pullman is his usual self. He doesnt act bad, but he cant save this movie either.<br><br>The story. Bill Pullman starts digging at a piece of land that supposedly belongs to Anjelica Houston. That spells trouble. Only 2 reviews for this movie. That should warn anyone who is considering paying for this movie. Watch it for free, just to convince yourself this movie looks promising, but fails at delivering the moment you start watching...","user":"imseeg","rank":[1,4]}]
