[{"title":"Frogs Rule!","rating":7,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"This is a funny and cute film that 10-and-unders will enjoy. Of course it's a bit silly, but that's what you'd expect when a teacher turns into a frog. Other than the fantastical premise, the story line is realistic and very well acted -- especially by the children, who have the majority of screen time. The villain of the story is just mean enough to be slightly worrisome, but not horribly scary. Describe it as \"mild peril\"...<br><br>... but without the usual \"rude humor.\" It's squeaky clean. There's no impropriety, no smoking, and no swearing, not even milder epithets or name-calling. Even the innuendo common to so many children's films is absent. Minor misbehavior shows the characters as believable human beings and may (with subtlety) teach something about taking risks.<br><br>It's light. It's simple. It's not really written for adults, but we enjoyed it nonetheless!","user":"TrTm316","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Full of Mixed Messages","rating":1,"date":"26 May 2018","review":"This film is so nonsensical that even children will find that foolish.<br><br>The story of the movie made no sense what so ever. The writer wrote up characters and events without any backstory whatsoever. It had a fantasy part where human transforms into some other animals. And the reason for the transformation was absolutely absurd.<br><br>The script was mixed up with so many things that it didn't even add up sometimes. There was a little girl who seeks more attention from her mother but her mother was unable to do that. There was a teacher who had a close relation with that girl and found alone with her in inappropriate places and situations. But apparently it doesn't seem to bother anyone. This is what bothered me a lot about the film. So I don't recommend anyone to take their child to watch this horrible film.<br><br>Not Recommended.","user":"niaz_islam","rank":[0,6]}]
