[{"title":"The songs are great","rating":7,"date":"8 September 2001","review":"Even though for an adult the story may seem a little silly this is still a great film. Children will adore it.<br><br>This movie has some brilliant songs. I dare anyone who listens to it not to start tapping their feet while listening to 'bad luck'.<br><br>The animation is ok (for a television flick) and is of the same standard as the rest of the sequels.<br><br>Dina and daina (who is apparently a boy) are very cute, if irritating to an adult audience .<br><br>I however think they are adorable.<br><br>\nCera gets a bigger role in this movie (in babysitting the twins) and that is nice to see as she is a great female character. We don't see many strong female roles in movies and this is one where it is much appreciated.<br><br>Kids will like it and older fans will smile at it.<br><br>It also teaches children the importance of resposablity.","user":"cyberbat","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Tied with 7 for 2nd best LBT","rating":10,"date":"19 June 2005","review":"The first one I watched with dad and my younger relatives. Secret of Saurus Rock is great! As I said, the 2nd best LBT(of course,the first is the best)! The young 'uns loved reenacting the fights with their little toys. (SPOILER) It's the time of the changing treestars (autumn). Littlefoot and co. are told an old dinosaur myth about the lone dinosaur and the Saurus Rock made in his honor by grandpa. All's well and dandy, but we see two baby threehorns Dina and Dana, Cera's \"neices\"(I don't think she's old enough to be an aunt, probably younger cousins). Then, when playing \"lone dinosaur\", Lil'foot falls of a small cliff but is rescued by a diploDOCus named Doc. It turns out that, after a talk with Lil'foot, Doc could be the lone dinosaur. The twins sneak off to Saurus Rock and followed by the gang. A tooth of the teeth circle around S.R.'s neck falls off. Legend claims that if SR is damaged, bad luck will come(it did). An encounter with an Allosaurus follows. Grownups accuse Doc for the luck. Lil'foot goes off to \"fix\" the luck. Find out the rest by your self(SPOILERS END) Overall, a great sequel for the continuing series.","user":"jcmariano","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"A decent sequel and one of the better ones in the franchise","rating":6,"date":"12 February 2010","review":"I don't think it is the best LBT sequel, but it is nice to watch, and I do recommend it for kids. It is too short though so you don't feel the emotional attachment you get from watching the first film, the dialogue is mostly uninspiring(this is from a more adult perspective, but I am sure kids will overlook this) and the story is quite simplistic. However the animation is good, with nice colours and decent editing. The music is lovely, and the songs while not memorable are pleasant. The twin baby dinosaurs Dana and Dina are adorable, and the voice acting is solid. All in all, this is a decent sequel, definitely one of the more watchable sequels of the franchise. 6/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[2,2]}]
