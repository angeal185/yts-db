[{"title":"love it","rating":10,"date":"28 October 2018","review":"It is one of the best movies I've ever watched. It is a very realistic love story, it touched my heart. I teared up a couple of times while watching this. The characters for this movie are incredible; I loved the girl she was so cute and her personality was amazing. Really portrays an average high school/college girl and I like that. The guy was also perfect; they both went through hardships that people face in real life. Many cute and funny scenes, the ending made me very sad and I didn't want it to be sad but I understand why it ended that way. I will watch this 10,00 more times.","user":"lalyg-63289","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"a must watch Korean Movie ( one of the best korean movie )","rating":10,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"I Iiterally just Watched OnYourWeddingDay and I can't describe how much I Ioved it.
