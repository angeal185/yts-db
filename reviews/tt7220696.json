[{"title":"A masterpiece of it's own","rating":10,"date":"2 December 2018","review":"An absolute masterpiece if you get used to the language, I personally love the unusual language. The movie is historically accurate and depicts the absurdity of life the right way. It as everything, it's tragic, funny, thrilling,dramatic and pulls you right in, touches your soul. So many complex characters and the acting is top notch . This is one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen. For me It goes into my top 10 right next to Shawshank Redemption,Twelve Angry Men.. It has what makes movies important, it teaches or reminds you about morals and ethics, about understanding and shows you what we all have in common . Again I love it , namaste!","user":"villehenrikroo","rank":[12,22]},{"title":"Delighted us.","rating":9,"date":"1 July 2019","review":"We saw it in Delhi today, at the EU film festival.
