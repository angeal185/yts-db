[{"title":"Unearthed & Untold: The Path to Pet Sematary: Underwhelming behind the scenes","rating":6,"date":"21 March 2019","review":"I love Pet Sematary, though not the best Stephen King adaptation it's certainly up there, therefore I was excited to see a documentary about it and get a peak behind the scenes.<br><br>With interviews from every surviving cast member, behind the scenes footage and plenty of interesting stories I'd say it's decent viewing for fans of the movie but overall a very weak effort.<br><br>Though it features interviews with the cast it has absolutely no footage from the film and though King is seen several times there are no interviews with him which seems a tad odd.<br><br>Although it covers important aspects such as casting, special effects and issues during production it also delves into some really lifeless areas such as extras and their contributions.<br><br>There is plenty of stuff that fans will really enjoy but I was left feeling it should have been better. Maybe it was rushed, maybe the absence of movie footage damaged it, or maybe it was the fact that too much of it felt like filler.<br><br>There have been some great documentaries about horror classics such as Friday 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, this is sadly not one of them.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Some interesting production footage/photos<br><br>Cast/Crew interviews are decent<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Extras section<br><br>Frustratingly boring","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10)","rating":5,"date":"8 October 2018","review":"The stage curtains open ...<br><br>The film starts out with Stephen King talking about his book, Pet Sematary, at a UMass event and his expression was that he didn't think anyone would want to read anything like it, so he put it in a drawer. That was the most interesting part of the documentary, at least to me, and it was gone far too quickly.<br><br>Unearthed &amp; Untold: The Path to Pet Sematary isn't anything significant or noteworthy. This documentary could just as well have been in the Bonus Materials section of the DVD or BluRay to this movie. It was more of a sentimental journey as we remembered one of our favorite horror films brought to the screen. There were some interesting little factoids here and there, but certainly nothing that was \"unearthed\" or \"untold\". These are some common stories that we've already heard before surrounding the production of the movie.<br><br>It does have interviews will all the actors involved with the film, and it was fun to see what they look like today and some of the stories they had to share. But, in the long run, this was a bit of a yawner. If you are passionate about this film, then you would enjoy this. For the average movie goer, however, there is nothing special here.","user":"Front-Row-Reviews","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Doesn't have a reason to exist.","rating":4,"date":"28 August 2018","review":"Contains a handful of amusing stories and footage from the set but suffers from being somewhat disjointed, overly self congratulatory and just not that interesting. Also lacks context so if you haven't seen Pet Sematary in a while or don't remember it well, you'll be lost as to what scene people are talking about exactly and when it happens in the movie.<br><br>If you're a Pet Sematary mega fan and need to know how they chose the house to film in, this'll do OK(not great), otherwise - skip it.","user":"Monolight","rank":[5,8]}]
