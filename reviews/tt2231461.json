[{"title":"What do you expect?","rating":7,"date":"14 April 2018","review":"Ok, let's see. A movie based on an incredibly simple video game about monsters climbing buildings and eating people. <br><br>Do people go in thinking it's going to be Oscar material?<br><br>I love Godzilla. I love Kong Skull Island, Pacific Rim, you get the picture.<br><br>It's a giant monster movie with The Rock and Negan in it. And it is a barrel of fun.<br><br>The humor is good, the effects are great, the story is interesting, the pace is fast, the characters are fun.<br><br>If you can turn off your brain and just have a good time, you'll love this.<br><br>For people saying they hated it, I have to question their reasoning for spending money on a movie that is clearly laid out by the trailer and premise alone. <br><br>If you didn't enjoy it, what on earth did you expect?????","user":"rupert-ian","rank":[285,336]},{"title":"Accept the film for what it is","rating":7,"date":"16 June 2018","review":"A movie about an old arcade game starring the Rock? Count me in. I went in with my brain shut off, and got a couple chuckles and, for the most part, everything I expected.","user":"jackgdemoss","rank":[153,191]},{"title":"Gloriously Terrible","rating":6,"date":"14 May 2018","review":"Every single cliche of an action/horror/adventure flick rolled up into one. The charisma of the two big guys (Dwayne and George) carry the entire movie. This movie is not going to change your life, but it will keep you mildly amused.","user":"facebook-923-997082","rank":[215,279]}]
