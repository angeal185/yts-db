[{"title":"13 Sins asks How far would you go?","rating":7,"date":"16 July 2014","review":"OK so I admit I was a bit under educated going into this one and found out in my usual prepping that 13 Sins is actually an American remake of a Thai Horror/comedy, 13 Beloved that came out in 2006. I was drawn to it immediately being the huge Ron Perlman fan that I am, I was pleasantly surprised when I started watching and saw another familiar face in Rutina Wesley (True Blood) playing the pregnant fianc√©e.' there is another familiar face from True Blood as well in the unnamed father in law to Rutina, Tom Bower, who played in several episodes of the series. the film is full of notable character actors, all leading you to expect a great film.<br><br>Elliot (Mark Webber) is expecting a promotion to go along with his upcoming nuptials pregnant bride to be Shelby (Rutina). It looks like life is going to be roses for the couple, but looks are often deceiving and upon closer inspection we find the couple is in dire financial straights. The couple is struggling with a wedding pending, baby on the way and Elliots special needs brother, and it looks as though Elliot needs to rescue his destitute father as well. <br><br>Upon arriving at work he finds instead of a promotion, his problems are compiled with a pink slip. How can things get worse you ask? Just as it seems all hope is gone for poor Elliot, he gets a mysterious call offering a solution, 13 tasks each more strange and difficult than the last but for every task completed his bank account will grow, but once you start this game there is no turning back! How far would you be willing to go to make ends meet and find your financial freedom? <br><br>So to start with there's nothing all that new about this one, but it does offer up some nice little twists as you go. The characters are each interesting in their own right. The cast is fantastic, but not particularly challenged by the story, so although they do well they don't necessarily shine the way I had hoped for.The film has its moments of dark humor, some good action sequences, and interesting kills. The tasks put in front of Elliot will definitely lead to a discussion and some internal battles of conscious for the viewer. <br><br>All in all this film is a fun watch, a bit predictable but it it will also more than likely throw you a few curve balls. Its not a film that is going to change cinema history, but its worth a watch for sure. I will eventually add this one to the collection, as I could watch it again, and I do love some of the cast, but its not as fresh as I had hoped for, yet somehow its still interesting enough to be enjoyable and keep you watching.<br><br>HeatherOmen TheHorrorNation.net","user":"ms-omen73","rank":[24,27]},{"title":"Good one.","rating":7,"date":"30 March 2014","review":"I've always liked psychological thrillers, and though I wasn't particularly blown away, \"13 Sins\" is a good pick. <br><br>The cinematography was rather mediocre and especially monotonous in the beginning, but Mark Webber indeed did a great job - you can see his posture and facial expressions change drastically throughout the movie, which I find pretty haunting. The plot is simple yet intriguing and smart. Somehow, all the twists seem predictable for me, but that doesn't mean they aren't good ones. There is some decent, mild gore along the way as well, as expected from Dimension Films. To be honest, I think it wouldn't hurt to show some more blood; but considering the fact that this is low-budget, it's not that important.<br><br>Though I did have fun sitting through 90 minutes of this movie, I wouldn't highly recommend this to everyone. Maybe just some who need a new breeze regarding horror / thriller genre (the exact reason why I watched \"13 Sins\" in the first place).","user":"zevcookie","rank":[38,46]},{"title":"not bad","rating":7,"date":"8 April 2014","review":"was pleasantly surprised by this film, it's not great, and nothing about it is great, but pretty much all of it is pretty good, the story, the acting, the twists. <br><br>you'll be talking with whoever you watch this with or know has seen it what stage you would stop playing the game. Which is tricky because if you go so far it's difficult to turn back, which is the whole point. <br><br>was a little disappointed with the end, can't help but think 'YOU IDIOT!!!' <br><br>Well worth a watch if your into similar films, not much to hate about this in my opinion.","user":"MikesIDhasbeentaken","rank":[47,58]}]
