[{"title":"Awesome Thrill Ride!","rating":19,"date":"19 May 2017","review":"First off, let me just say that I can rarely be bothered to write reviews on here. The only reason I decided to was due to: 1) lack of reviews, and most importantly 2) the very few reviews that have been posted here are so incomprehensively negative that the only explanation I can come up with was that they had to be shills (which is surprising to me, as most 'shills' on IMDb are only here to artificially increase a film's positive reviews).<br><br>That being said, I found these these first two negative reviews utterly baffling. Now I'm no expert film critic, but movies are my number one passion in life. As such, I've seen so many that I've literally arrived to the point where I'm thoroughly jaded...so much so that most everything that I've seen usually leaves me both bored and uninterested, or at best, mildly amused. Now that I've had my mini-rant, I'll continue on with my review.<br><br>As the title of the film implies, the story is as basic as it gets: a mother's son gets kidnapped, and said mother stops at nothing to get him back. From that simple premise (which has been rehashed millions of times), I began watching this with the expectation that I'll be seeing one cliché after another, with gratuitous violence and over-blown CGI and/or cheesy effects mixed in for good measure. I can honestly say that not only were those expectations overturned, but for the first time that I can remember, I was literally sat on the edge of my seat and kept in suspense throughout. That statement may sound generic and trite, but coming from a jaded cinephile, it becomes a huge compliment.<br><br>I never lost interest for a second, and the sheer intensity and suspense that I felt throughout 'Kidnap' got to the level where I was actively looking to see how many more minutes was left before it endednot because I was bored and wanted to know how much more tedium I had to suffer, but so that I could tell how much more hell the protagonist (and by extension, I) had to go through before all the nail-biting suspense could finally come to an end.<br><br>It was a taught cat-and-mouse thriller expertly choreographed, and Halle Berry's acting was sublime! In fact, I was initially so put-off by the film's synopsis, I would have passed this over in an instant had it not been for the fact that Ms Berry was in it! The acting, cinematography and stunt-work were masterfully crafted in such a way so as to get you emotionally invested throughout. I think that is why this film engendered such a visceral reaction whilst watching it. If you cannot relate to nor care about the characters, the film you're watching falls flat, and you consequently lose interest very quickly. Not so with 'Kidnap'. The relatability of Berry's character, plus the superb job she did with this role, puts you right in the car seat next to her.<br><br>If you are like me, and suffer from the ennui that inevitably comes from having seen almost every movie ever made, and are looking for the proverbial 'white knuckle ride' and adrenaline rush, then I cannot recommend 'Kidnap' strongly enough. In fact, I wouldn't be exaggerating to say that this is on my top 4 list of films I've seen this year thus far!<br><br>So in a way, I give thanks to the two negative reviewers. Had it not been for them, I wouldn't have even bothered writing this review!","user":"david6995","rank":[252,406]},{"title":"A Good Performance From Miss. Berry","rating":5,"date":"27 August 2017","review":"This is perhaps one of the few good films that Miss,Berry delivered to the big screen after her Oscar back at the 2001 along side ( the Call 2014 &amp; Perfect Stranger 2007).<br><br>The movie isn't that great, but it had a lot of tension that make your eyes open the whole film, because the whole film is about chasing the kidnappers by Mom who want to bring her own son back no matter what.<br><br>Halle Berry's performance here is very powerful and to me one of few reason that saved this film, her emotion, reaction of regular mother who turns to be a fighter just to save her kid even if she was going to die is so believable and convincing ( the only actress in recent years that gave me same feeling of a real mother was Angelina Jolie in Changeling 2008), Halle Berry really deserve nominations for this unforgettable performance.<br><br>Now to the bad Side of this film:<br><br><ul><li>The major issue of this film that it had almost the same story line of The Call 2013 which had the same subject which is (kidnapping), even the story line is so identical ( both films start with cars and both end by watching Berry going to the kidnapper house and save the victim) the only different thing was in the call Berry rescue a teenager girl, while here she saves her own child.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>The second thing is the chasing i mean all this accidents while she was chasing the kidnapper and no one saw that, no single police car or police announcements even a police man was killed, a girl hit by a car and a lots of damaged cars. ( it made me wonder if she was chasing them in another planet, Pluto perhaps ! )</li></ul><br><br>_ Another terrible mistake was the Diesel , at the half of the film they show us that there is a little of Diesel left, nevertheless she continues to drive for almost 20 minutes later !!!<br><br>At the end It's a good film if you are looking to entertain yourself at the weekend in the cinema, and if you're a Halle Berry Fan who wants to see your star at her best.","user":"yawael","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"Man did the writers take the easy way out on this one...","rating":5,"date":"1 September 2017","review":"I love action movies without aliens and superheroes so I was exited to see this movie where Halle Berry goes all out in her attempts to safe her kid. <br><br>The base of the story isn't that bad but oh how I hate it when writers can't come up with logical behavior even in high pressure situations.<br><br>With a little bit more creativity this actually could have been a very decent movie, but they took the easy way and at times it just was annoying how the story developed.<br><br>So a big disappointment.","user":"jgeurtsen","rank":[49,73]}]
