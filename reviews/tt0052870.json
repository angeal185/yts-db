[{"title":"The 1950s!","rating":10,"date":"9 February 2013","review":"There is a scene in this movie that totally sums up the 1950s. Mamie Van Doren, bleached hair flowing in the wind, glamorous sunglasses glinting in the sun, drives a 1958 Edsel Citation Convertible, no doubt pink, that is pulling a horse trailer. It doesn't get any more 1950s than that!!!!<br><br>Enjoy this movie for its 1950s clichés. All the good girls are brunettes, and the bad girls are blondes. Men in tight suits and skinny ties. Crappy Rock-n-Roll. Cops save the day. Bad people get punished. People talk tired Film-Noir-speak. Mamie Van Doren's Bullet Bra and wide hips encased in an iron girdle.<br><br>Show this movie at your next 1950s party.","user":"richard-graham-604-587740","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"guns, girls, gangsters and much excitement","rating":3,"date":"3 February 2008","review":"I watch this movie every two years. It's a great classic grade B thriller, perhaps the greatest of the 50's; and the best picture shot by Edward L Cahn. The director usually gives us sleepy flicks, always built on the same frame, except his first ones, the 30's ones, as \"Law and order\". He lost his soul during the 50's and early 60's, till his death.<br><br>A little masterpiece. Mamie Van Doren, Lee Van Cleef contribute much for it.<br><br>A fast paced and pretty shot little thriller. If you are a caper movie lover as I am, DON'T MISS IT.<br><br>I would put it on the same scale as \"Plunder Road\".","user":"searchanddestroy-1","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Fast moving B-movie heist flick","rating":7,"date":"2 March 2012","review":"Chuck Wheeler (Gerald Mohr) gets out of prison and heads to Las Vegas to enact an elaborate heist where he plans to steal an armored car carrying over $2 million in post-New Year's gambling money. He enlists the aide of local gangster Joe Darren (Grant Richards) and his lounge singer fiancé Vi (Mamie Van Doren), who just happens to be the wife of Wheeler's old cell mate. They plan everything out and it looks like it will go smoothly until Vi's ex-husband, Mike (Lee Van Cleef), breaks out of jail. This is a quick moving B-picture and director Edward L. Cahn never lets it lag through its 70 minutes. Van Doren isn't as much of a bad girl as in the previous feature I saw, VICE RAID. Here she is more of a good girl caught in a bad situation. To show how good she is, Van Doren gets two musical numbers in this one. Surprisingly, they don't play up her curves as much as VICE, but the swelling horn section is still abused plenty on the soundtrack. The supporting cast is all good and it is funny to know that even when he was young, Van Cleef still looked old.","user":"udar55","rank":[9,10]}]
