[{"title":"Good for small kids (2-4), thoughful for those in between (5-8)","rating":9,"date":"27 January 2019","review":"Most of the reviews seem very off to me - I really cannot believe we saw the same film? Or maybe they reviewed it for much older kids, which is wrong.<br><br>The movie has great themes and a great simple animation style. Even my kid at 1,5 just left his toys to watch along.<br><br>Enjoy it for what it is: a great story with slow pace (like old time Barbar) and simple animations and voices.<br><br>Recommended!","user":"larindom","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Elephants and cats oh my! And giant pears too?","rating":9,"date":"7 June 2019","review":"Straight out of Denmark, and enchanting tale if intrigue and adventure, all starting with a message in a bottle. How fun is this Alfred, (my dear nephew) Natascha Mortensen and Elizabeth Mary Mortensen. This tale starts off a bit juvenile and immature, but I think that is due to translation dubs. If you'll give it five minutes, you'll be as enthralled as I and love this tale too. A young boy, anthropomorphically portrayed as a yellow cat with his anthropomorphically shown grey elephant portrayed as his buddy. As the story progresses the adventure begins! Enjoy and as always, put on your life preserver when riding a boat with the guys!

Bonus that it was just over an hr long so they actually watched to the end.","user":"twgg","rank":[2,2]}]
