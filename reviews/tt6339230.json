[{"title":"Wait, this is a modern movie?","rating":4,"date":"6 November 2018","review":"How is it possible to make a movie in 2018, that feels like it's a straight for TV afternoon pot boiler. The story is decent, but the production values are calamitous, it feels so cheap and low cost. The acting is decent, but it's too polished, too glitzy, the women are all smart, with immaculate hair, the men are all handsome and groomed. It has such an artificial feel. The scenes of the killer taunting the Police are embarrassing, the cheap mask, dodgy voice....<br><br>This instantly takes me back to a video store in 1997, I've bought a huge bag of Starburst, and this little gem sits unloved on the 2.99 reduced videos stand.<br><br>It's a pot boiler to watch if you're bored, just don't expect anything rewarding. 4/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"The high school kids want their movie back","rating":3,"date":"5 November 2019","review":"Watching portions of this felt like I was reading a drugstore paperback published in the 90s.\nIt felt odd, jarring, weirdly flat and a lot like one of those midweek movies you see when you're sick at home and have nothing better to watch!\nStrange. That's all I can say.","user":"pink_floydilia","rank":[5,6]}]
