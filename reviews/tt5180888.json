[{"title":"A mess of nothingness","rating":1,"date":"20 May 2018","review":"This movie is one of the worst pieces of cinema, I have had to sit through. The direction is uneven, cinematography is choppy and the sound is so horrible that the 10 people in the theater all stated that they missed 3/4 of the dialogue. \nThe lead has an endearing blue color, hustler charm, but the characters are one dimensional characters. Can't tell if any of these actors are talented given the dialogue they had to work with. Jim Belushi looks embarrassed he took the part.\nThe sound man needs to not work again. You can't hear dialogue, as the sound is so dismally inadequate!!!","user":"cockezville","rank":[22,40]},{"title":"Makes Baltimore look pretty bad","rating":3,"date":"19 July 2018","review":"Maybe it is not a coincidence that McCaul Lombardi, the star of this as Keith, had a supporting role in \"American Honey\" , another dreadful film with no real plot. I don't know how films get made without any real story , or plot and little dialogue, but this film is not much more then the lead actor moving from scene to scene and appearing sullen. He does interact with people but in the end I felt nothing at all for his character. There is no tension, no wondering what is going to happen next, because there is no story here. If there are any positives, it comes from the actors in very small roles who are extremely realistic in their portrayal of a very poor and ugly side of Baltimore, but they can't do much in their few minutes of screen time. The only thing I took away from this was the desire to never visit Baltimore.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"What's the point","rating":17,"date":"17 September 2018","review":"This film is about a young man who is just released from prison.<br><br>The story is basically non existent, as it only shows the mundane life of a young man who has not got much to live for. It shows him driving from one place to another very frequently, which is rather unexciting. Most of the camera work is from afar, which adds to the detached feeling between the viewers and the characters. I'm afraid I found this film very boring, and I don't quite get the point behind the story, or indeed the point of the story","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[6,10]}]
