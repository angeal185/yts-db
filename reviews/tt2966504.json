[{"title":"Beautiful Stupid","rating":10,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"This movie feels poorly acted until you are 25 minutes deep. At that point I start to care about the characters. By the end of the movie, I wanted to be in the back seat with those goons as they died for no reason whatsoever. Kate wants to date Sean, so she devises this crazy elaborate plan just to spend time with him. She is genuinely unhinged because not only does she lie to him to meet him, she lies about her mother, ex boyfriend, and even pays the neighbor to convince Sean he is insane. Then at the end she pulls a double suicide just because she can. I hate that I watched this movie but I don't regret doing so.","user":"kendonx-41842","rank":[0,1]}]
