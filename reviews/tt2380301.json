[{"title":"The twist is nice but not enough.","rating":5,"date":"7 December 2013","review":"I have said that you can judge a movie by it's title, and this movie proves my point. Simple, and to the point this movie is about a treacherous bunch of people, and the simple people who want to believe the best, and never see the truth. I did not Enjoy this movie all that much, the acting was alright, and the direction was just fine, not a bad movie, just nothing special at all. The rain is actually a character in this film it never lets up, you hear it all the time. I enjoyed how this worked as a sound track because the rain, and thunder was louder than the radio playing in the back of the room. You are teased through the whole movie with one of those \"16 hours earlier\" sort of flashback feelings, but then it is something else which I guess makes it unique enough to even be mentioned. I would only say that you should watch this if it is free, and you have nothing but time. You will not come away from this feeling like you have been rewarded for your time, but you may get a kick out of the twist as they are careful not to hint at it too often.","user":"face-819-933726","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"This movie is treacherous","rating":2,"date":"6 December 2013","review":"Having seen there isn't any user reviews I thought Id go right ahead to save some people time.The one review I did read under the critic reviews was so far off the mark it was unreal.Surely he wasn't watching the same movie.Sarah Butler the standout?No one stood out if anything absolutely mediocre acting.The whole storyline is the dad has slept with all the women in this cabin and knocks up his sons daughter (which I don't understand as he is clearly a drunk)and the son finds out.Even tho he finds out he forgives her only for her to walk out \"never to be seen again\".This movie for me rushed along as its run-time is only 1 hour and 7 mins and jumps from event to event.It was really like watching bold and the beautiful but the scripting was even more horrendous.Save yourself the time movie goers.","user":"tommmo2010","rank":[10,20]},{"title":"So much Treachery...","rating":6,"date":"4 June 2016","review":"Having grown up watching Michael Biehn in so many great James Cameron blockbusters, it was cool to see a different side of him. Plot was decent. I did like the setting with the rain forcing everyone to confront their own demons. Plus is was cool to see the movie as a flashback and know something big had happened due to all the treachery. It was obvious the actors were definitely giving it their all especially Biehn as the slimy drunk father and Matthew Ziff as the troubled son. Great dysfunctional father and son relationship there! I definitely want to give this movie another try, since I did enjoy the dialogue between the various actors. Besides it is important to support those indie films!","user":"loonurgoose","rank":[2,3]}]
