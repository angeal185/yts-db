[{"title":"How do u comeback from continuous bad Adam Sandler movies? By making The Fundamentals Of Caring.","rating":10,"date":"25 June 2016","review":"First let me say that I don't write reviews on IMDb often but after watching this movie and seeing how little reviews it has I had to write one. Just so that if there is any other soul looking here all confused if he/she should watch this movie or not. WATCH IT. JUST GO WATCH IT.<br><br>Alright, so plot wise it doesn't have lot of characters who just pop in and out. It has a very simple story with simple cast doing simple things and that's the beauty of it. There is no over the top emotional scenes where the cast try hard to make you feel sad but there are simple doses of heartwarming scenes sprinkled throughout the movie which made my eyes wet. <br><br>The cast was amazing. I have always liked Paul Rudd and have seen his range when it comes to acting but still he managed to surprise me in this movie. I did not expect anything from Selena Gomez but she tries and pulls of the role she is given. Craig Roberts does an excellent job like in the movie submarine (which I obviously came to know after I watched the movie with the thought \"this guy looks very familiar. Where have I seen him before\" running in my head the entire time.). There are two more main cast members whom I don't want to mention and give away story details does real justice to their characters too.<br><br>I didn't know the director either but he has done a really good job with this one.<br><br>All in all a really good movie. A must watch I would say. <br><br>And ya, THUMBS UP to NETFLIX for making this movie.","user":"marash2315","rank":[84,96]},{"title":"Best watch in some time","rating":8,"date":"24 June 2016","review":"I love a good movie especially when I have no expectations. I sat down with my kids and was just so surprised by how good this movie really was.<br><br>I don't write reviews, but felt I simply had to for this one.<br><br>It was pure entertainment from start to finish wonderfully funny and just restored a little bit of faith in the guild of acting and humanity.<br><br>If you are in the mood for an up beat feel good movie with a lot of laughs this is a pleasantly easy watch, that the whole family can enjoy.<br><br>Well done and thank you.","user":"ashmanbrian","rank":[103,120]},{"title":"Surprisingly pleasant and overly warming.","rating":8,"date":"27 June 2016","review":"I never review movies, but this is an exception. I have never been so pleasantly surprised by a movie in such a long time and I really have to commend the cast for doing such a great job. The movie was heartfelt from start to finish and included just the right balance of laughs and tragedy to keep the overall mood upbeat.<br><br>The story, which I will refrain from spoiling, is one that can be related to everyone, regardless of our circumstances. It presents a clear choice that we make everyday; live life to its fullest or use excuses to keep everyday the exact same until we die. I believe that there is no greater message worth spreading.<br><br>As I said, I have no intent on spoiling this movie whatsoever, but if you happen to run out of movie ideas, this is a solid choice even for family viewing, despite the 15 certificate.","user":"dmchardy98","rank":[41,48]}]
