[{"title":"Dreck by any other name is still dreck.","rating":21,"date":"21 June 2018","review":"The filmmakers were obviously attempting to piggyback on the current political environment but unfortunately this film fails in nearly all areas. The lead actor, David Corenswet, does an abysmal job and is not one bit believable in the role. The other characters come off like caricatures and the dialogue is endlessly littered with cliches. Most annoying was the cinematography which makes it appear like it was shot with an inexpensive camcorder. The film's budget was likely in the $100-150k range and it shows throughout. This is C-level straight to Netflix dreck that should be missed.","user":"AgentAsst","rank":[40,46]},{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"7 July 2018","review":"Cliched and wooden. Sad to see Mimi Rogers stoop this low. Always liked her. /J","user":"jg-34531","rank":[32,37]},{"title":"COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. Boring, slow, and poorly written.","rating":24,"date":"24 June 2018","review":"Let me save you 97 minutes of your life that you can't get back. The writing is derivative, trite, and predictable. The performances lacked any sort of cohesiveness. The directing felt uneven and the pacing absurdly sluggish. The music didn't help the story at all, in fact it was downright annoying at times. The shots were clumsy and to be honest it wouldn't surprise me if this was made on some sort of smart phone or similar. Unfortunately I can't say anything redemptive about this or I'd be lying.","user":"Downndirty333","rank":[38,46]}]
