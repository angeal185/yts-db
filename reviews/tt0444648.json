[{"title":"One of the worst films I've ever seen.","rating":1,"date":"20 December 2008","review":"I was at my local independent video store and was browsing through their computer. For some reason, I remembered a little indie film on myspace that caught my attention and typed it in. Sure enough, it was on hand. I rented it, walked home and popped it into my DVD player.<br><br>The story of this film concerns a pair of heroin addicted lovers named Spike and Sarah. Spike is a struggling musician who speaks in a slurred manner throughout the movie, and makes me think that he is handicapped rather than an addict. Sarah is a fifteen year old with a traumatic past that involves molestation by her stepfather. Naturally, Spike is pursued by the police, one of the officers being Sarah's uncle, for statutory rape, but the audience is supposed to sympathize for him, being that he is separated from his true love. Yeah, don't see how that is going to work.<br><br>Watching \"Punk Love\" feels like watching a bad film school student film. Nick Lyon intended to make a modern day Romeo and Juliet, but fails in every aspect. It meanders from one indie film clich√© to the next (shot in blue, rape scene, lots of rain, weak symbolism etc.) that you can create a drinking game based on this movie. The first ten minutes of this movie have the couple laying in bed, doing heroin, snow falling over them and Spike mumbling something about Angels and Dragons.<br><br>The one star for this movie is for Emma Bing, who is not a bad actress, the only real likable character in the film, and dare I say, kind of cute. I hope she finds some better work.","user":"bladewarrior12","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Somewhere between crap and genius...","rating":5,"date":"28 May 2012","review":"I wouldn't say that this film is \"Troma\" bad, but it wasn't brilliant either. It was a dark, moody film that offers a bleak look at life for two punk teens in the Pacific Northwest of the US. The script combines elements of Midnight Cowboy, Sid and Nancy, Badlands and Requium for a Dream into the mix. I might even throw in Dumb and Dumber in there as well, since Spike and Sarah constantly do things that make you want to scream, \"Don't do that\" or \"Don't go in there\" often. The plot is a bit disjointed at times, which makes it a tough movie to sit through, and its grim theme makes it even harder. The music is (surpisingly) mostly non-punk, which added a slowness to the film that just didn't work for me. Emma Bing is solid in her role as Sarah; hopefully someone notice her and give her another shot. With that being said, this film is interesting , but not enough to be a \"must see\".","user":"writenact","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"beyond bad, like, Troma Team bad","rating":2,"date":"28 July 2010","review":"The acting and plot are so terrible, the film becomes a self parody. There is little of value here. The story meanders along with no destination or underlying messages; it seems as though it wants to be a film in the genre of True Romance or Trainspotting; ug, even mentioning those two films in conjunction with Punk Love seems insulting.<br><br>My girlfriend and i watched it as one watches a terrible C- monster movie. By the time the film was near the end, we were literally rooting for terrible things to happen to the main characters because we came to dislike them so much. <br><br>Keep in mind, we live in punk-friendly Philadelphia, so we might have otherwise been a prime audience for this little number.","user":"claywork59","rank":[7,11]}]
