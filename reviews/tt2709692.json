[{"title":"OK, but feels unnecessary","rating":4,"date":"10 November 2018","review":"Took the grandkids to this movie...they didn't think it was very good. It seems like something that was produced for the dollars it could make rather than a story that needed to be told.<br><br>The good: it was not very long. The colors are brilliant and visually stimulating. Max was remade with a little more of a fun personality.<br><br>The bad: Grinch somehow seemed wrong. I'm not sure if it was the voice, the artistic effects, or just a general un-Grinchiness. The story was a retelling that didn't need to be. The biggest negative is the feeling that this movie is forgettable.<br><br>I'm sure I'll never watch it again. I've watched the original about a billion times, and the Jim Carrey version nearly the same.<br><br>Bottom line...save your money and rent it later.","user":"brynnharms-70885","rank":[274,402]},{"title":"Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more. Lost it's message!","rating":2,"date":"18 November 2018","review":"I just didn't like it. I love the book I read it from November onwards every year to my kids. I love both the older versions but this just got diluted down until it was a poor version of a Christmas movie. The odd funny moments but nothing else. There was nothing mean or awful about the grinch at all he was quite nice to begin with just a lonely sad man who needed friends","user":"donna-marie-wilson","rank":[86,123]},{"title":"Did they even sing the song?","rating":2,"date":"11 November 2018","review":"When the movie ended, I looked over at my family and asked \"did they even sing the grinch song?\" which I was highly anticipating with a fun, new modern edge. my nephew responded with \"it was a remix and not the whole song\" what?! Jim Carey made an entire scene out of it! This movie was a let down. Can they stop remaking movies if they're going to be lazy and unoriginal about it? The Jim Carey one and the original Grinch are way better than this","user":"JosiReviews","rank":[89,131]}]
