[{"title":"New \"National Lampoon\" movie that is actually funny, if not watched all at once. Movie about nothing but dirty jokes. I say B-","rating":6,"date":"18 February 2011","review":"A man with a dream of making a movie with only dirty jokes (Meloni) goes to the head of National Lampoon (Klein) to get it made. It seems like forever ago when National Lampoon was in it's glory days (Animal House, Vacation). The last 10 or so have been pretty bad, this is the best one they have made since the original \"Van Wilder\". There is nothing to this movie but dirty joke after dirty joke acted out, for example there is a kid playing \"little Johnny\", etc.... A lot of the jokes are very offensive but I could not stop laughing. The best way to watch is in parts...after 20 min it loses its appeal becoming to repetitive, but I actually found it funny and if you are looking for a movie you don't have to thing about and just watch, then this is a good choice. I give it a B-.<br><br>Would I watch again? - Yes - With some of my friends who haven't seen it.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[32,50]},{"title":"A cheaply made movie with lots of laughs.","rating":10,"date":"18 February 2011","review":"This movie has one purpose, to make you laugh at dirty jokes. That is the soul purpose of this movie and that is all it does, but it does it well. Sure you could listen to a stand-up comic tell the same jokes, but watching jokes be acted out as a movie is a fresh idea. So if you like stand-up comedy, you'll love this movie. <br><br>Basically this movie is about a guy who wants to make a movie about jokes that we as people all tell each other, you know the kind of jokes that could get you fired from your job because the joke is so offencive (yaa you know the kind). So the guy starts making the movie and we get to watch all the dirty jokes being acted out... Simple for sure, but it will affectively keep a grin on your face for the more part of the movie, and yes you will have a ton of new jokes to tell and stun all your friends with.","user":"minus_zero","rank":[38,74]},{"title":"\"You're just going to do jokes?\"","rating":4,"date":"8 May 2015","review":"Gilbert Gottfried used to do a stand-up tour where he just did dirty public domain jokes for an hour, occasionally interrupted with an unfunny impression. I always thought he was kind of a hack for it, because what's the merit there? It's not like you have to go to bars and collect dirty jokes like gems, there are plenty of books and websites on the subject. As embarrassing as that tour/DVD was, at least a guy standing on a stage is the correct medium for that sort of thing. These jokes are meant to be told, not acted out in \"sketches\". In one of the few tie-in scenes that are put in this movie to give the illusion of a plot, one character actually mentions how a movie that's nothing but old public domain jokes would suck. Yes, it will and it does, why make it then? Pointing out your errors as an in-joke doesn't get you off the hook, it usually makes everything worse. There are two credited writers/people who know how Google works, and the parts where they are forced to come up with new jokes are among the most embarrassing movie scenes I've ever witnessed. The pre-credit sequence is a girl that sings the national anthem, but the joke is that her singing is off-key. There's no punchline and the scene goes on forever, is this just put in to make you long for the parts with old jokes everyone already knows? <br><br>The worst part of the movie has got to be the child actors though. The entire point of casting children was just for shock value (children swearing was apparently still edgy in 2011), but they're clearly reading their sex jokes from cue cards and still mess up the punchlines. They often sound like they don't even get the joke, putting the emphasis on the wrong words and things like that. Chances are they'll be pretty embarrassed by this movie once they've grown up, and perhaps they should be.","user":"Sandcooler","rank":[7,10]}]
