[{"title":"Inoffensive movie for youngsters","rating":2,"date":"2 May 2015","review":"My six-year-old liked it, but I suspect children over eight will find it rather slow and tame compared with stuff like \"Home Alone\" (which I find rather offensive). <br><br>Nothing to offend prudish parents here, no violence, bad language or supernatural events. Competent direction and camera-work so it did not look desperately low budget, though there were several sequences of kids walking or bicycling, or of moving cars or trains, which padded out the length to 90 mins without adding content. <br><br>The young female lead was fresh and uncloying, but her cohorts were the usual stereotypes (fat boy, boffin, racial minority, etc).<br><br>Lame plot, and maybe I dozed off and missed something, but the solution of the \"mystery\" seemed rather fortuitous.<br><br>I give it 5 for children from 6 to 8, or for \"old-fashioned\" children a little older.","user":"london777","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Not as good as the first, but alright","rating":6,"date":"16 December 2018","review":"This is a sequel to K-9 Adventures: A Christmas Tale (2013). I saw this movie a long time before I saw the original. It's not nearly as good as the original, but it's good enough - particularly for kids. Kassie and crew return to track down a long-lost town treasure - and beat the crims to it. Some adults might find it boring, although I personally don't. Kids will definitely love it. I'd say it's fairly (maybe moderately) good.","user":"jmmustchin","rank":[1,1]}]
