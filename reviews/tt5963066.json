[{"title":"Mediocre Storyline, Non-Charismatic Characters, Awful Killer","rating":2,"date":"10 December 2018","review":"\"The Cabin\" is a slash horror movie with mediocre storyline, non-charismatic characters and awful killer. The lead couple is unlikable and it is impossible to the viewer to feel any empathy for them. There is no explanation or development of the killer and the viewer never knows his motivation to kill or who he is. The storyline and the screenplay are boring, full of clich√©s and never build tension. Last but not the least, there are fake reviews to promote this flick and lure the user of this site, most of them with one line or two. My vote is two.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[28,28]},{"title":"unlikable cast, boring storyline, jittery directing","rating":1,"date":"7 December 2018","review":"From the beginning I hated both protagonists and couldn't wait to see them die.\nthe killer/slasher is uninteresting and shallow.\nThe plot holds little weight as the main characters never make any good decisions.\nalso notice that all the positive reviews of this movie on IMDB have the same grammatical errors. This movie looks like what you might get when you give expensive cameras to an untalented (or maybe inexperienced?) crew.","user":"calebm-1","rank":[22,22]},{"title":"Absolute muck","rating":2,"date":"6 December 2018","review":"Had to turn this diabolical mess off. Terrible acting, brutal overdubbing, terrible camera work. Pretty sure my dog could make a better movie.","user":"xxxno_complyxxx","rank":[22,24]}]
