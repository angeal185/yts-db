[{"title":"Daughters fondly remembers mother's cooking","rating":9,"date":"16 May 2017","review":"Saw this movie when I visited my parents in Taiwan. It's a wonderful story about a daughter's discovery of her Japanese mother's cooking notebook which led to understanding her mother's determination to adapt thru various challenges in her life as she raised her daughters. The movie is slow but it has some great lessons. I would definitely recommend it.","user":"graken","rank":[7,8]}]
