[{"title":"Life story?","rating":3,"date":"5 July 2017","review":"A very thin slice of Lenny McLean's life washed clean to within an inch of none existence. <br><br>The real Lenny Mclean was a criminal, thug, enforcer, street fighter and unlicensed boxer, who was far from invincible and who also ducked out of many challenges from more skilled opponents.<br><br>Later in life McLean ended up as an actor too, before being struck down at just 49.<br><br>An interesting life that is pretty much ignored in this film.<br><br>Instead we are presented 'lovable rogue' stereotype keeping his neighbours safe, a cartoon character, and his three fights with Roy Shaw.<br><br>And if that wasn't enough, McLean's facial ticks are exaggerated to a crazy level, rendering him a gurning fool.<br><br>Not good. Avoid.","user":"alec-macarthur","rank":[29,38]},{"title":"Watching a guy do face twitches the whole time","rating":1,"date":"16 June 2017","review":"I could not get through this film.<br><br>The guy who plays Lenny is continuously twitching his face in a very annoying manner that is so obviously fake that it pulls away your attention from the film continuously.<br><br>The whole underlip stretching is beyond absurd and annoying as hell.<br><br>Do not watch this, it's absolutely ridiculous.","user":"kimobettazzoni","rank":[26,42]},{"title":"Time I'll never get back!","rating":16,"date":"16 December 2017","review":"Do not waste your life watching this film, what a load of bollocks.\nEven worse than the other film 'The Guvnor'\nIf you want the story of his life, read the book, and use your imagination.
