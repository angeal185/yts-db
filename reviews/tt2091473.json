[{"title":"Not Just Too Close, Dead On.","rating":9,"date":"8 January 2013","review":"I would honestly give this film a 9 out of ten. It was directed beautifully, and I feel the screenplay is great. The dialogue is more than believable, and both Matt Damon and John Kransinski both do a wonderful job in conveying their character's qualities and aspirations. There seldom seemed to be a slow moment(if at all).<br><br>As far as how close to reality this movie comes.... I live in northeastern Pennsylvania, only 5 minutes away from Harford, and only 25 minutes away from Dimock(where the documentary Gasland was based). I have seen the effects of hydrofracking, both the negative and what little positive comes of it(but those facts and feelings are for another discussion). As sad as it may seem, natural gas and well drilling companies(to go un-named ONLY in this review) bought their way into the community with false hope, money, and lies, but not necessarily as it happened in the film. In reality.... it was even worse. Barbecues, parties, etc. were even thrown in order to gain fans and friends... The community's spirit and resilience was conveyed correctly, though in reality, it gained support too late.<br><br>All in all, even if political/social/ecological issues regarding hydrofracking aren't your forte, this film is a quality film that is captivating and deserves to have personal opinions set aside and enjoyed for its quality.","user":"akprice44","rank":[92,123]},{"title":"Much better then I expected. Really makes you feel and understand both sides of the argument. I highly recommend. I say A.","rating":9,"date":"21 April 2013","review":"\"I'm not selling them natural gas. I'm selling them the only way they have to get back.\" Steve Butler (Damon) is a salesman working for Global, a natural gas company. Him and his partner travel to a small farming community to buy up property rights in order to drill. When an objection by a local teacher causes an enviormentalist activist to show up things get harder for Steve. This is a movie where the trailer doesn't do it justice. I wanted to see it based off the cast but it looked a little boring. While the movie is a little slow moving it is in no way boring. The writing and acting is very good and the \"bad guy\" that Damon plays really makes you feel for him and kind of root for him instead of the \"good guy\". While the movie does get a little political towards the end this is not a typical \"enviromental/save the Earth\" type movie. This movie makes you able to feel both sides of the argument and almost forces you to pick a side. I expected this to be boring with good acting going in. I got sucked in pretty fast and ended up really liking this much more then I thought I would. Overall, much better then expected and I highly recommend this. I give it an A.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[40,53]},{"title":"Accurate portrayal of predatory practices used by industry","rating":8,"date":"29 December 2012","review":"When the movie ended, credits rolled but no one moved or said a word. That doesn't often happen in a fairly crowded movie theater. Processing was required. Promised Land is a movie that makes people think and thinking does not mix well with fracking. <br><br>Promised Land was much better than I expected. We knew there was a plot twist coming but we were unprepared for the creepinessâ€“picture George Clooney on a hill petting some horses when his car blows up creepy, and that's not creepy enough. As I sat there watching the credits roll, I thought, \"Yeah, they would totally do that.\" <br><br>Big money and huge effort has been invested to discredit this movie just like they did with the documentary Gasland. They rolled out a new website called The Real Promised Land and a new Facebook page by the same name. <br><br>Now I understand why the huge investment in discrediting Promised Land. Movies that make people think are dangerous. <br><br>This movie is not about the environmental devastation caused by fracking. It's about the predatory practices used by industry to gain access to our backyards and how communities loose their way in gasland and are torn apart.","user":"sharson-854-628605","rank":[71,99]}]
