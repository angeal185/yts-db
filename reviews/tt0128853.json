[{"title":"You've got something most of us like","rating":21,"date":"21 February 2004","review":"Romantic comedies are not everyone's cup of tea; after all, who would want to watch unrealistic stories about ordinary people 'coupling' when we are offered such wonderful everyday experiences as ten car pileups, hordes of people being slaughtered in a hail of bullets while shopping, goblins, explosions, vampires and intergalactic spaceships?<br><br>But the majority of women, and many of those men who do not see themselves as the Governor of California will surely find much to like in this charming eye-moistener.<br><br>Tales of this ilk can easily be mawkish, but this one largely avoids the trap, thanks to an intelligent script, the believability of the lead pair (as well as the supporting cast) and good pacing that leaves the denouement until the closing shot.","user":"mosmanic","rank":[74,96]},{"title":"Unbelievable film! Such a warmth and happiness!","rating":10,"date":"30 December 2005","review":"I'm from Germany and I love this film! It makes me happy to just watch it! When watching this film one comes to think why in real life such beauty in words and moments can't be achieved! The film does'nt get boring, even if watched for the 23rd time! It's pure magic - you could endlessly listen to the conversations, the beautiful music and enjoy the excellent acting! Other films try to come in too trendy with freaky music and sexual content(not that there's anything wrong with that) - but it's not a feelgood movie! Besides the puns and the lovely warm hearted atmosphere does the rest! To everyone who hasn't yet seen this movie - rent it, buy it - enjoy it!","user":"SRVforever","rank":[88,118]},{"title":"One of the most romantic movies I've ever seen!!!","rating":10,"date":"18 December 1998","review":"I've been starved for a great romantic film and YOU'VE GOT MAIL more than sated my appetite! I'd rank it right up there with CASABLANCA as one of the most romantic movies of all time.  Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have more chemistry than a High School Science Department!   This movie was warm, funny, smart, and sexy.  Tom and Meg light up the screen and Tom Hanks is the perfect hero!  The movie was 2 hours long, felt like 10 minutes, and I didn't want it to be over!  This is a definite keeper, and I can't wait for it to come out on video so I can watch it again and again!","user":"NPilbeam","rank":[124,173]}]
