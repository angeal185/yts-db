[{"title":"Characters don't always have to be likable!!!","rating":8,"date":"15 September 2018","review":"This is not a movie for everyone. The characters are flawed and that's what makes them real. We do certain things in life without any reason. And that's what happens in this movie and that's what people are criticising but it is also that thing that made me like this movie. Not all characters are free of fault and the ones who look like the victims are equally to be blamed for everything that happened in the movie. I haven't read the novel but the movie is making me want to pick it up. \nAnders(played by the brilliant Ben Mendelsohn) has taken an early retirement but decorating his house and sleeping with strangers is not bringing him the happiness he expected to find after cutting ties with his old life. Even if you can't relate to his story, you'll be able to relate to him. \nI know Netflix has been failing in the action and romantic movie genres but in my opinion, they're not doing so bad in drama movies.","user":"proudpakistanii16","rank":[51,63]},{"title":"Sometimes, you need depressing too","rating":9,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"By watching this film, you won't get a story, or some profound way to \"live the best life\" it's about reality, it's about knowing the things that you do or plan will always not result in happiness. Savour it's slowness in solitude, hopefully you will connect with Anders.","user":"asifkabeer","rank":[44,55]},{"title":"Liked it despite...","rating":8,"date":"30 September 2018","review":"I liked it despite it being somewhat less than uplifting and some shortcomings with the characterisations of some of the cast. No, maybe not too many of the characters were likeable but then that's very like life - well, mine after more than fifty years - and I did care what happened to them. Worth seeing.","user":"timgrn","rank":[14,16]}]
