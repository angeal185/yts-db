[{"title":"Fun horror/anthology movie","rating":7,"date":"19 September 2000","review":"\"Cat's Eye\" is another horror anthology movie that I found to be a nice companion piece with \"Twilight Zone: The Movie\". The thing that surprised me about this film is that it's a suspense comedy loaded with thrills galore and dark humor. Instead of four separate tales, \"Cat's Eye\" has just three, with a plucky tabby cat intervening through all three stories. And all three segments are directed by the same man (Lewis Teague). Stephen King wrote all three segments, with the first two segments based on short stories written by King. The first segment is a black comedy starring James Woods in some of the funniest acting that he's ever done as a man who wants to quit smoking. He goes to a place called Quitters, Inc. This clinic is run by a most unusual doctor played by comedian Alan King. Woods finds out quickly that their methods of trying to make smokers quit are odd. Very, very odd. This story isn't really scary but it's downright hilarious with Woods trying desperately to kick the habit. King is also very funny as the doc. This is a very good segment. But my favorite segment of \"Cat's Eye\" is the second one. The late Kenneth McMillan stars as a ruthless gambler who kidnaps a tennis player (Robert Hays from \"Airplane!\") who's been doing a little you-know-what on his wife. McMillan makes a strange bet with the tennis pro: walk on top of a short ledge around the gambler's high rise building 50-60 stories up. This segment is a scary one, with a few touches of black humor (even though this segment isn't as funny as the first one). King wrote the third segment directly for the screen. He wrote it for a then very young pre-teen Drew Barrymore (who a year earlier starred in King's \"Firestarter\"). Barrymore plays a little girl who takes that tabby cat in to live with her after the cat runs into her house. The reason why the cat ran into her house: kitty spotted a little tiny gremlin strolling into the place. The cat comes in and tries to save the day. This segment is silly but fun. All in all, \"Cat's Eye\" is an underrated gem. Funny, scary, and entertaining.<br><br>*** (out of four)","user":"jhaggardjr","rank":[31,32]},{"title":"An underrated Stephen King film that's in homage to \"The Twilight Zone\"","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2000","review":"Stephen King adapted two of his short stories and wrote the third into this screenplay of suspense.   The first story concerns a man (James Woods) trying to quit smoking by signing up for a clinic. That clinic just happens to be run by the mafia and they literally mean quit smoking with a seriously tough employee (Alan King) behind it. Even if it means tampering with your family's lives. The second concerns an again tennis pro (Robert Hays) who takes on the game of his life after having an affair with a mobster who is a gambling addict. The third follows a cat trying to protect a little girl whose being terrorised by a little demon jester. The suspense is good. Alan King is very good as the seriously tough employee and Woods is always good.<br><br>The second is very good with a surprising twist at the end and the third is a take on of old fairy tales where good triumphs over evil.","user":"mystic80","rank":[23,24]},{"title":"Stephen King's Cat's Eye!","rating":10,"date":"15 November 2004","review":"One of Stephen King's greatest stories in My opinion turned into a live feature film is Cat's Eye! The film has three very interesting stories with some good actors including James Woods, Alan King, Kenneth McMillan, Robert Hays, Candy Clark, James Naughton, Drew Barrymore, Mike Starr, and Charles Dutton! The acting by all of these actors are very good. The stories as I mention are very good and funny in a way though the film is serious. Quitter's Inc is a unique story, The Ledge is arguably the best of the lot but My favorite one is The General. I love the little demon. He is so cute and mean looking at the same time and I am amazed how real looks! Carlo Rambaldi did an excellent job! The music by Alan Silvestri is great! If you like the cast mentioned above and love Stephen King then I strongly recommend Cat's Eye!","user":"Movie Nuttball","rank":[31,34]}]
