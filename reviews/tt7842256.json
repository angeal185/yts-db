[{"title":"Surprisingly good.","rating":7,"date":"24 March 2020","review":"47 Hours to Live is engaging and creative, without being of a high quality.<br><br>The game would randomly stop on someone, so they shouldn't be able to keep swapping first try and I mean Cadence deserved to die from the outset, with the texting and nearly crashing, then texting some more, but i liked it. Passable lead performances, some of the secondary characters weak.","user":"bombersflyup","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Please ignore reviewers that say they didn't watch the complete movie","rating":4,"date":"25 March 2020","review":"I never trust the word of someone who gives up half way through.\nWhy would I consider your review legitimate if you don't even have the patience to watch the whole thing before reviewing it?<br><br>That being said.. this is just your basic run of the mill horror story,'\n4.1","user":"natcalgary","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Standard but good","rating":8,"date":"1 April 2020","review":"I gave this an 8 because I feel this movie deserves a better average, I have seen so many bad horror movies with higher ratings. By reading some of the other reviews it is obvious they didn't watch or pay attention, for Cadence says why they don't use the candle. Believe me if this was even remotely a \"me too\" movie it would have gotten a 1. Is it the best, no but it isn't a waste of time either. A sold 5 should be the average.","user":"armadilla17","rank":[2,2]}]
