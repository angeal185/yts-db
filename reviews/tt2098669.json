I will say the fact that the movie can an actual story line and really neat breakdown of how to take money from a casino was cool. A lot of time and research was put into how casinos work, the gaming aspect and the relationships between dealer, gambler, pit boss and casino management. Its obviously not 100% accurate but not too far off to make the premise unrealistic. The acting is not great and its not a softcore movie but its also not bad.","user":"kpiedra-83249","rank":[2,4]},{"title":"Sub Par Made For Cable Movie","rating":3,"date":"28 March 2020","review":"Beautiful babes help out a friend by embezzling funds from their high rolling workplace. It's a worn out plot with a flimsy script and the girls would suffocate in the paper bag they can't act their way out of. Michael Madesn's blue/black dye job is not to be missed. Good to watch if you can't find anything better.","user":"drivemenutzlong","rank":[0,0]}]
