[{"title":"Don't waste your time.","rating":1,"date":"17 August 2019","review":"Great cast. Terribly written and so slow it actually made 2 people fall asleep. I get what they were going for but they really missed the mark. It was a pretty annoying movie. A lot of hype for this film so I was happy to see it. When you see people leave mid way its a terrible sign","user":"psxexperten","rank":[0,1]}]
