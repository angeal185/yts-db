[{"title":"This is a very funny parody of pop sex-psychology literature","rating":7,"date":"29 September 2008","review":"The film is entirely about sexual perversions, even though it is not technically erotic Allen has taken some of the most popular clinical treatments of sexual fetishes and has placed them into very unusual situations <br><br>Gene Wilder, for example, falls in love with a sheep; Woody Allen plays a medieval court jester who gets his lance stuck in his lady's chastity belt while the king is off fighting in the Crusades; a giant breast is released upon the countryside; an Italian couple can only find happiness in public sex; and we are taken into the inner labors of a male human body as it tries to seduce a woman in a car<br><br>Each individual scene is quite well done The tales are rapid filled with irony about the overly exaggerated importance of sex in our culture","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[31,35]},{"title":"Hit & Miss, But What Hits Is Hysterical","rating":7,"date":"28 February 2002","review":"An uneven early work of Allen's, really just a series of sketches tied around the unbelievable popularity of the \"sex\" book \"Everything You Wantedto Know About Sex, But Was Afraid To Ask\" which in the early 1970's was THE book in popular culture. Many of the sketches are too long and \"peter\" out, but ALL of them have very funny jokes and insight, but two of the sketches are classics and are as funny as anything Allen ever wrote: Gene Wilder's bit where he plays a man who is destroyed after a certain \"fetish\" is introduced into his life and the last sketch, where they show the inside controls of a man's body as he gets ready to have sex with a date: Burt Reynolds and Tony Randall help run the master control room. This is brilliant and clever. Some times it's refreshing to just go back to Allen's early, silly films like Sleeper and Take The Money And Run, even though the man has gone onto important funny films with deep dramatic throughlines: Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors, Deconstructing Harry and Husbands &amp; Wives.","user":"shark-43","rank":[30,38]},{"title":"Rabbits, sperm, giant breasts and a woody!","rating":28,"date":"28 January 2003","review":"Representing something of an early high point in Woody Allen's career, this scattershot spoof of David Rueben's highly popular sex-manual has become somewhat sadly overlooked in favour of the more mature and whimsical charms of 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan', but 'Everything you always wanted to know about sex' is just as enjoyable as his later works, if not more so.<br><br>Although the overt intellectualism that many of Allen's detractors criticize in his subsequent work is already beginning to take form here, not only in the concept (seriously, who'd adapt a sex-manual?) but also in execution, which owes more to the high-brow Fellini and Godard than the low-brow Mel Brooks or John Waters, includes a great deal of metaphysical surrealism, bizarre camera angles and deliberately self-indulgent dialog.  Here Allen's filmmaking approach is more self-serving than ever before, casting himself as a medieval stand-up comedian, a heroic leading man and a sperm, yet still finding time to feature in a lengthy satire on early-seventies European cinema.  The reason it all comes together without succumbing to self-importance is down to the simplicity and stupidity of most of the set pieces.<br><br>The more interesting segments come at the beginning of the film, and if seeing Woody trying hopelessly to unlock Lynn Redgrave's chastity belt and miss-quoting Shakespeare to form a condemnation of T.B. doesn't bring a smile to your face, then the sight of Gene Wilder in the throws of foreplay with a sheep will probably do little to convert you.  Humour for the most is juvenile, puerile and immature, but carried off with such hilarious comedic style, that the Farrelly brothers should really reassess their careers. Allen is as likable as ever in his many surreal incarnations -- appearing in fifty percent of the sketches -- his ultimate triumph being the oily, Italian play-boy causing a stir when he and his frigid girlfriend par-take of a little outdoor nookie.  And even if he is less confident when trying to be socio-satirical, as in the molestation game show, Woody still manages to inject a wit and ingenuity to the proceedings, always carrying off the gags to his trademark self-deprecating style.<br><br>However, despite technical assuredness, the finished product borders on the same hit and miss territory that befalls most anthology films, however, it has to be handed to Allen for making a genuinely intelligent movie that basically celebrates boob-gags and outbursts of rampant misogyny.   The best policy with 'Everything you always wanted to know...' is to ignore the false starts of the later segments, and howl at the sight of Woody fighting a giant breast (\"Don't worry, I know how to handle tits\").  Nevertheless, if your idea of sophisticated humour doesn't include bestiality, orgasms, transvestism, homosexuality, ejaculation, perversion or Burt Reynolds, then feel free to give it a miss.","user":"Nriks","rank":[20,26]}]
