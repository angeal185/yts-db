[{"title":"Slow and dull","rating":2,"date":"14 February 2019","review":"I've had more suspense opening a can of beans to reveal the contents.... and more fun too.<br><br>It was a 5* rating on Sky, that somehow made it worse. I guess I watched the whole thing to try and find out how it had that rating.<br><br>What I discovered was that Sky seem to have given this the wrong title and confused it and it's rating with the 2018 movie by the name of \"Fever\" and not its actual title that is \"Fever Mountain\".<br><br>Definitely one to miss","user":"davidph252","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"So bad I had to make an account","rating":3,"date":"17 February 2019","review":"Now tv (sky) rate this 5 stars hell no. It's bloody awful, terrible story and full of absolutely stupid things that they do. I got frustrated and annoyed watching it. Don't watch this avoid like the plague","user":"jlongmoor","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"The cat stole the show","rating":1,"date":"17 February 2019","review":"Seriously, this must be one of the worst films I've ever sat through. Terrible acting (except for the cat), and no discernible plot line.<br><br>Somehow it got padded out to +90 minutes but it's slower than a two legged horse. Avoid like the plague.","user":"spamade","rank":[5,5]}]
