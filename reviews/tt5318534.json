[{"title":"Great movie!!","rating":9,"date":"1 March 2018","review":"I had high expectations on this movie based on the plot and the trailer I previewed. All the actors in the movie played their characters really really well., the movie really highlighted the power of social media and how it can make or break a person's popularity. A small part by USHER in the film added some nice flavor into the story.<br><br>Overall, I would recommend it to those who want to see a really good movie!","user":"lifelinespublishing","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"Waste of my time","rating":3,"date":"19 March 2018","review":"What an absolute waste of my time. I should have known better from the synopsis. i couldn't work out what the message was. Being a Social media film, surely i was supposed to face a moral dilemma. Whoever funds these films please stop. Absolute nonsense.","user":"garydouglass","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"Worth the watch","rating":7,"date":"3 March 2018","review":"Good film, with an interesting plot. However, felt incomplete with a rather abrupt ending. Halston sage showed great diversity, as an actress, in this role and I look forward to more of her work.","user":"hayleykirui","rank":[10,16]}]
