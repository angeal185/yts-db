[{"title":"if you have absolutely nothing else to do...","rating":2,"date":"21 September 2014","review":"if the dishes are washed, laundry is done, girlfriend is gone, and you have watched absolutely anything else watchable, you can watch this (but will be disappointed) this is a movie with no budget, just a bunch of guys with no acting, directing or any comprehensible camera-work (its mostly point and press record)...<br><br>all of the \"action shots\" are terrible (if you call the final 10 minutes of guys moving around, balls being thrown, but not actually seeing what happens, action shots), and the rest is a bunch of mentally challenged individuals playing stereotypical cast types, and throwing red balls at each other for fun.<br><br>its very hard to review this movie, because it was so terrible, but since most reviews on IMDb have the generic \"worst movie ever made\" posts, you cant really rely on that.<br><br>i will say, congrats to the editor of the movie. for managing to create order in the mess that was made of the filming of this movie.<br><br>i gave it a 2, because its amazing that they managed to actually finish this production, and create a full length \"movie\"","user":"amirrunoron","rank":[3,3]}]
