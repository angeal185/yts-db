[{"title":"Possibly one of the best movies I've seen thus far this year","rating":10,"date":"26 February 2015","review":"It's not as brutal as I thought it would be, but it's fairly exciting. My wife and I both enjoyed this movie. Directed well. Excellent acting. Great story (I was speculating and anticipating for much of the film). A pinch of shock value. What more could you ask for? <br><br>If I had a \"must watch\" list this could be in the top 10. I've read some poor reviews of this film, and I simply can't wrap my head around that. I'm assuming these were bias reviews by viewers who dislike horror/thriller films. Even if you don't enjoy them, this movie is still refreshingly well put together. I was never bored at any time. The casting was also very good.","user":"bclorain","rank":[11,19]},{"title":"Surprisingly good!","rating":8,"date":"9 February 2015","review":"**********SOME SPOILERS*************<br><br>I wasn't expecting much from this when I looked on IMDb before watching it. Turns out that the movie is lingering, dark, and realistic. A couple of made-for-TV style moments, but nothing that really detracted. In terms of the acting, I was engaged by it and felt there was subtlety and nuance.<br><br>It did a good job of defining the line between softer and empathetic approaches to extreme mental health issues and the medical model which aims to kill and destroy deviant and unacceptable thoughts and behaviours. I liked the interplay of these opposing views. <br><br>Raised interesting questions like how far would a compassionate person (in this case, a well devised figure of a social worker) go to protect human life. And when do we apply judgement/control and when should we have mercy/empathy on people that don't share common human values with the \"rest of us\". Seems that we are no closer to knowing how to regard the extraordinary functioning of the human psyche.","user":"weezebumble","rank":[8,13]},{"title":"A great concept wasted due to a lacking screenplay and incompetent directing choices","rating":1,"date":"12 February 2015","review":"Enter the Dangerous Mind had a great concept that was refreshing and extremely cerebral, honestly, it sounded great. Unfortunately for anyone looking forward to this film, this was quite possibly not only one of the worst films I've seen in a while but it also features some of the worst acting I've seen since Troll 2. The only way to describe this film in a nutshell is that it is like watching Uwe Boll emulate Nicolas Winding Refn. It is horrendous. The story follows a young dubstep DJ by the name of Jim who falls for a beautiful social worker only to have voices in his head drive him insane. While this sounds like a nice blend of cerebral psychological romantic drama mixed with a bit of horror, it is anything but. It is essentially a terribly acted film about the outcast getting the pretty girl only to have his nerves get the best of him in the form of inner demon voices that tell him to do terrible things by the end of it all. The acting in this film is abysmal, starring a slew of B-movie actors such as Jake Hoffman, Thomas Dekker, and Nikki Reed, it sinks in a matter of seconds as the acting gets to be so bad that you start to question whether this is supposed to be a hard hitting psycho-drama or a really bad comedy. My biggest problem with this film is Hoffman as Jim. He is unbelievable in every frame and approaches his character's musical tendencies as if he doesn't have a clue. Now, I'm not sure how Hoffman prepared for this role but judging from what we see on screen, I doubt he even knew what dubstep was let alone how to make it. Nikki Reed wasn't as bad as the rest of the pack, but it still would have been nice to see her try just a little bit. The true artistic criminals here are the directors, Youssef Delara and Victor Teran, the latter being the screenwriter as well. Delara and Teran have absolutely no idea how to keep up the pace. Just because your film is a brisk 88 minutes, doesn't mean that it is automatically going to be paced well. Quite the contrary, this film is paced terribly and has no balance to it whatsoever. One minute we're in a love story, the next minute we are plagued by Delara and Teran's half assed attempts at cerebral cinema, it makes for a brutally and painfully boring film that never clicks. Overall, if you have the chance to see this film, don't...run as far and as fast as you can and if you think you're far enough, you're not, keep running until you forget the name of this terrible, ridiculous attempt at a really cool concept.","user":"trublu215","rank":[16,33]}]
