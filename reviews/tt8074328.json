[{"title":"Kinda week.","rating":1,"date":"24 October 2018","review":"Need brad Sykes back these horrible camp blood films being released are a joke.\nAlthough Mark is not at fault , producer needs to spend more cash. Cant make a movie on no budget, it shows but this one was just lost no feel at all. Sad compared to 1 , 2 ,3 only watchable ones.","user":"darkoneskip","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"They won't stop making them!","rating":2,"date":"15 March 2018","review":"As I write, we're only in the third month of 2018 but already there's another CAMP BLOOD sequel on release. This one has a new kind of killer, a hulking, Michael Myers-style murderer wearing the usual clown mask. This time around he's stalking a small number of people through a school rather than the usual woodland setting. There are the usual lame kill scenes and interminable dialogue in between, but at least it's a bit better shot than the last few in the series. It's no surprise that this series shows little sign of flagging because these films must cost next to nothing to make.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Horrible.","rating":1,"date":"1 November 2018","review":"Just a joke.
