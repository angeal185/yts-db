[{"title":"Nice movie, like a slow song in a shady café","rating":8,"date":"28 March 2008","review":"The film is all about mood. If you are not in it, you will not like the movie. My recommendation is to watch it at night, in bed, with no worries on your mind or things to do. It is not something really great, but it soothes the soul like one of those old road books.<br><br>The story itself is more of a three parter, each section detailing a mindset and the situations that define it. You see the hopeless romantic, the one person who let the other inside instead of just sticking to the outside, and for whom losing the other is worst than death; then there is the rebellious daughter that loves and hates her father until it's to late to do anything either way; and of course, the story of Nora Joneses and Jude Law's characters.<br><br>Bottom line: lay comfy in your bed and listen to the slow rhythms of the music while digesting the human nature presented in the film. In the end it is worth watching.","user":"siderite","rank":[104,121]},{"title":"The Style Of Hope","rating":8,"date":"7 April 2008","review":"An inebriating realistic fantasy by Wong Kar Wai one of the greatest aesthetic visionaries modern films have to offer. This time is in English and without reaching the pinnacle that his \"In The Mood For Love\" reached, it's still a mesmerizing romantic road in search of love, hope and an identity that can be recognized. Norah Jones leads the way as someone startled by her own existence. Her kiss with Jude Law must be considered one of the most romantic, erotic and pure kisses I've ever seen. It seals the journey in an unforgettable way. Rachel Weitz makes a star entrance that reminded me of Kathleen Turner's in \"Body Heat\" a walking, full body entrance. Natalie Portman confirms that she's a spectacular actress and a riveting presence on the screen. Their Blueberry Nights became mine and with its wonderful look and score this a film I crave to see again.","user":"littlemartinarocena","rank":[74,95]},{"title":"A mixed bag","rating":7,"date":"20 November 2007","review":"This is a film of contrasts. A good story let down by poor dialogue; some great acting as well as some mediocre and good direction marred by irritating and indiscriminate \"motion blur\" filming.<br><br>The film has the elements and sometimes the feel of a charming love story, a modern-day fairy tale. The gentleness and innocence of the two main characters is in sharp contrast to the world inhabited by the secondary characters, where addiction to alcohol, gambling, desperation and suicide are the order of the day.<br><br>Jude Law as Jeremy seems to have lost the plot. His half-hearted attempts at a Manchester accent are woeful. Why bother with the accent anyway? He is a coffee shop owner in NY, and his origins have no bearing whatsoever on the storyline. However, his natural charisma and his gentle demeanour do suit the role, and he pairs well with Norah Jones as Elizabeth.<br><br>As for the flaws; is there ever total silence outside in the street in NY at night? And would customers really give their house keys to the person behind the counter in a coffee shop, to be kept in a glass jar? And would customers ever be known not by name, but by what they eat? And is there anyone in Manchester actually called Jeremy? As for Norah Jones, although she is on screen for most of the film, she does not have a lot to do or say  which is just as well really. She spends most of her time watching in silent, doe-eyed admiration, as she is given a master class in acting by the \"real\" actors.<br><br>The *real\" actors here are David Strathairn and Rachel Weisz. Strathairn gives a memorable, finely crafted performance as Arnie, who is a cop by day and an alcoholic barfly by night. Rachel Weisz as Sue Lynne his beautiful, wild, estranged wife makes full use of her short time on screen to create a wayward, tumultuous character at once sensuous, and sensitive. Between them they steal the show.<br><br>But gripes aside, the director does manage to create an appealing, if flawed, film. It's a mixed bag. It's good in parts.","user":"mjsinclair","rank":[132,198]}]
