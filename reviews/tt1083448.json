[{"title":"A Modern Day Fairy Tale","rating":7,"date":"20 November 2011","review":"A romantic, modern day fairy tale that is perfect for all the family, but especially for young girls and their Mothers, Grandmothers and their Granddaughters, Aunts &amp; nieces, etc.<br><br>Boys, be warned, this may all be a tad emotionally mushy for your taste, but who knows, you may learn some wonderful manners during the process of watching it. Every little girl (and we are all little girls at heart), dreams of being treated like a princess, whether they like to admit it or not.<br><br>The beautiful Katie McGrath plays the lead female role and I felt at times, she gave a rather wooden performance that actually enhanced her displays of awkwardness in an unfamiliar situation and so rather than distance the viewer, it actually made her character more endearing to them.<br><br>It was wonderful to see Sir Roger Moore acting again, in his typical, suave male role.<br><br>A wonderful Christmas Fairy Story.","user":"nroadsbrooks0","rank":[39,49]},{"title":"A Christmas Fairy Tale - no less..","rating":10,"date":"22 December 2011","review":"When you imagined the castle of cinderlla - it may have looked like this one. When you imagined how nice Prince Charming may be - it might have been just like this one. <br><br>Its a fairy tale - are fairy tales ever meant to be realistic? Of course not! <br><br>My family did not like the movie because they believed it to be poor acting but good looking performers and a unimaginative plot.<br><br>I loved it because it was heart warming. It is not a thought provoking movie. Its lovely. That's all it is. <br><br>Merry Christmas!","user":"lucyinthestars","rank":[26,32]},{"title":"Great family fun","rating":10,"date":"4 December 2011","review":"Usually I watch romantic Christmas movies with trepidation, as there have only been a few that have been good, but this movie was definitely one of those that I have kept in my collection. It was a wonderful Christmas movie. I have only seen Katie McGrath on Merlin as the evil Morgana, but she acted very well in this movie, and you empathize and can't help rooting for her. And of course Sam Heughan was dashing as the prince. The only person who I thought they should have replaced was the actor who played Milo, he's acting was a little wooden. But other, than that, the actors were great, and the plot was smooth. Of course you knew how the movie was going to end, but that's with any romantic movie. And there were times, when I was hoping the movie would not end, it was just that good. Great family movie!!!","user":"cyberpretender","rank":[28,37]}]
