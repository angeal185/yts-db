[{"title":"The Plot Point Makes the Movie Pointless and Senseless","rating":4,"date":"1 November 2013","review":"In Colton, Deputy Seth Delray (C. Thomas Howell) is hired by Sheriff Hooper (Phillip Troy Linger) and he temporarily moves with his wife Grace (Siri Baruc) and their two children to an old jailhouse while the constructor Calvin (David Schifter) repairs their house. When the local prison has a problem, six inmates are transferred to the soundproof jailhouse that is considered cursed and is located on the second floor of the house. Seth finds the badge of the former sheriff that was murdered in the jailhouse and soon he is possessed by an evil spirit and starts killing the inmates.<br><br>\"The Jailhouse\" is a movie where the lead character performed by C. Thomas Howell is a rip-off Jack Nicholson in \"The Shining\". The plot begins like many other possession movies, with a family man being possessed by the former jailer. However, the plot point makes the movie pointless and senseless. My vote is four.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Detenção do Mal\" (\"Detention of the Evil\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Not all that spectacular and pretty unremarkable","rating":6,"date":"20 August 2012","review":"While his new house is repaired after a storm, a cop is forced to live below a haunted jail with inmates of the overcrowded nearby prison but slowly becomes possessed by the former guards and begins to torment and brutalize the inmates, forcing them to rise up against him.<br><br>Not really as great as the plot sounds since the possession is really only hinted at and then figured out through the actions taken, despite the fact that it's never directly stated but rather implied, meaning that this one has just a long amount of time with nothing all that interesting going on. The attacks are brutal and bloody, but because we spend a lot of time with the inmates rather than the cop, lowering the film even more so and making it harder to get into. That, as well as a last-act twist that just makes the entire film a pointless endeavor and is utterly infuriating all the more-so lower it even more and makes it almost worthless.<br><br>Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language","user":"kannibalcorpsegrinder","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"9 November 2018","review":"Was this supposed to be a comedy?
