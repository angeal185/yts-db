[{"title":"Funny, heartbreaking and true","rating":10,"date":"6 July 2004","review":"Who needs expensive movie stars when a group of unknowns can light up the screen like this lot?<br><br>On paper, it sounds like a failure - a cast comprising almost entirely of untrained and untested performers, set in working class Dublin, based on the novella by Roddy Doyle.  By God, does it defy expectations.<br><br>Jimmy Rabbitte is a working class Dublin lad who's been collecting unemployment benefits for two years.  But he dreams of bigger things, namely making it big in the music industry.  He sets out to form a soul band, and assembles a motley crew of musicians and singers, most of whom don't know each other and many of whom can't stand each other.<br><br>The look of the film is gritty and realistic - nothing is glossed over. North Dublin is presented in all it's glory.  The home lives of the band members are depicted warts and all - their private lives set the scene for the inevitable personality clashes that are almost as explosive as the music.  In the mix is the unique character of the Irish people - at one point Jimmy enters a tenement block and, as he waits for the lift, looks over to see a boy with a horse.  \"You aren't taking that in the lift, are you?\" he asks.  \"I have to,\" the boy replies.  \"The stairs would kill him.\"<br><br>The real star of the show is the music - this film spawned two hugely successful soundtrack albums.  The band members were cast partly due to their musical ability, and the results are superlative.  The stand out is Andrew Strong as Deco - would you believe this kid was only 16 when the film was made?  His amazing voice belies his tender years, and suggests that he's been smoking a packet a day since the age of about four.  At the end of the day with is a fine ensemble piece, much like the band.  The acting may be a little wonky at times, but the hysterical dialogue makes up for that.<br><br>Most remarkably, this is a feel good film that does not rely on any of the conventional feel good plot devices.  There are no group hugs, no plot conveniences, no trite happy endings.  Just a shrewdly observed and wittily captured human story about people who dream of making it out of their dreary world.  And isn't that something we can all relate to?","user":"madam_Q","rank":[77,83]},{"title":"How hope can elevate the hopeless","rating":27,"date":"27 March 1999","review":"I must confess that this is my favorite movie of all time, and the  music plays a large part of why I enjoy it so much. Don't expect  stellar acting in this movie unless you want to be let down--though  make no mistake, the acting is certainly adequate. The key players in  this movie were not chosen for their acting abilities, but rather for  their musical talent. The people you see on stage in the movie are the  same people who play the music you hear. (If you appreciate soul music,  do not pass up the chance to purchase The Commitments Vol. I and Vol.  II.) And what a talented assembly of musicians they brought together  for this movie. Most astonishing is the lead vocals of prodigy Andrew  Strong (playing lead singer Deco Cuffe) whom, at 16 years old at the  time of filming, possesses \"a voice that Bob Geldof would starve for.\"  More than anything, this film is about hope. It is about the hopes and  dreams of a handful of poor north side Dubliners striving to beat the  odds and make something of themselves. The film follows the near-rise  and eventual fall of a band that, on the verge of a record deal, could  not bear to watch success interfere with their destiny to remain  destitute.  But was destitution their destiny after all? \"Success of the band was  irrelevant,\" the main protagonist and band manager is told moments  after the band breaks up. \"You raised their expectations of life--you  lifted their horizons!\" And indeed, the epilogue reveals that, even  though the band itself was a failure, virtually every band member had  achieved a greater level of personal achievement than they had hoped  for before they had joined the band.  This is a movie about the raw appeal of soul music; it is a movie about  Dubliners; it is a movie about the economic conditions in general that  grip Ireland; it is a movie about poor folks who endlessly toil in the  vain hope that they can make ends meet. But more than anything, it is a  movie about how hope alone can be the ultimate salvation of of those  who have nothing else to look forward to.","user":"Enemy-2","rank":[49,54]},{"title":"Funny how the Irish dig Motown...","rating":20,"date":"20 May 1999","review":"I've lived in Detroit all my life, and the great soul music of the 1960's and 70's which was created here (and is still enjoyed here) is featured throughout \"The Commitments.\"  The Irish lads and lasses really do up the soul staples, from \"Try a Little Tenderness\" to \"Mustang Sally.\"  The actual musical talent is reinforced by the strong character development, industrial setting (North Dublin), and masterful plot, adapted from the novel of the same name by Roddy Doyle. \"Say it once, say it loud...I'm black and I'm proud,\" is never more irreverently humorous than when questionably repeated by Jimmy Rabbite's soul disciples. I own this film, and I could watch it over and over.  The soundtrack is excellent, and the pop culture references throughout the movie are hilarious (especially during the audition scene.) This film delighted both the hard-core Detroiter in me, as well as the Irish lass.  The working class Irish youth depicted in the movie are sincere, and so is their project, The Commitments. (All the great bands were a \"The ...\")","user":"Adrianne","rank":[47,52]}]
