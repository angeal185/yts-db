[{"title":"Not bad, but not great either","rating":5,"date":"5 June 2018","review":"This is an okay movie about the high schooler who would have become an adult after 6 or 8 months when he reached 18 years old, but just before that, he lost his parents who died in traffic accident in France. Before he reached the adult age, it's the French government obligation to take care of him. But when he later found out that his parents were not his real parents, his mother was actually his aunt who could not have children, so her sister gave her one of her children, a boy, to her, so this kid was growing up in France instead of his real country, Morocco. <br><br>The major part of this film was about when he found out that truth, he decided to go back to his real parents in Morocco. But he could only speak French and his real parents were uneducated low class in Morocco, so when he went back, there's huge gap and cultural difference that needed him to adapt by himself. A lonely young man to deal with lot of loss and sadness.<br><br>Basically, this is a quite boring film but even so, you'd like to keep watching, because the cinematography shot in Morocco was so good, the seashore, the bay, the ringlet, the desert, the simplicity, the boredom of the country were so good. The soundtrack is also quite good. All the actors, young or old, male or female, all performed so natural and so real. A quite boring film but not bored enough to stop you from watching.","user":"LogicIsEverything","rank":[2,4]}]
