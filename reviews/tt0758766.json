[{"title":"Charming, witty, and lighthearted comedy","rating":10,"date":"3 September 2007","review":"There are already 222 reviews of this movie, so the chances of anyone ever reading this are slim. However, I'm a sucker for a longshot. (so if you read this review, please give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down...I'm curious to know if anyone will ever read this, buried under more than 200 other reviews)<br><br>When a friend suggested we rent this movie, my initial reaction was, \"NO!! It's a chick flick. And besides, it's got Hugh Grant in it. Those are two really big strikes against it.\" However, and remember my fondness for longshots, the movie also casts Drew Barrymore in the other lead role. I couldn't resist.<br><br>To my complete surprise, both actors were excellent, and Hugh Grant doesn't have a bad singing voice. To be honest, if he and Drew Barrymore wanted to record an album of pop songs, I think it could do quite well. Her strength is that she is perky and funny, and that compensates for lack of trained vocal talent. Sometimes you DON'T want to hear Barbra Streisand.<br><br>Here's the quickie plot summary: Hugh Grant was in a popular band of the 1980s, and now he's reduced to playing for embarrassing venues like shopping malls, amusement parks, and High School reunions. When a Britney Spears-type singer wants him to write her new single, his life changes completely, but only due to Drew Barrymore's help.<br><br>I now judge movies in part by how my European friends would react to them. I have to admit that some American movies are a little corny, but this movie passed the test with flying colors. A friend from Slovakia not only loved the movie, he insisted on watching the trailers and special scenes.... twice! It was a welcome relief to actually be proud of a Hollywood movie.<br><br>I now have new-found respect for Hugh Grant, and my admiration for Drew Barrymore is higher than ever. She sure has a lot of talent for playing someone with pluck and a little bit of endearing wackiness.","user":"pachl","rank":[314,345]},{"title":"Cheesy and proud of it","rating":8,"date":"12 February 2007","review":"Let's face it, often we go to the cinema for a bit of inconsequential fun. In case you were in any doubt, Music and Lyrics kicks off with an 80s-style Wham-like video of a band called as 'PoP'. Firmly tongue in retro-chic, Hugh Grant is Alex Fletcher, the washed-up has-been now playing the nostalgia circuit for middle-aged housewives. He meets bubbly Sophie Fisher (Drew Barrymore) who waters the plants in his apartment but has a knack for writing lyrics. This saves his day when current pop-diva princess Cora asks him to write and record a duet with her.<br><br>Chances are you are now reaching for the vomit bag or saying that maybe sounds like quite a giggle. If you can stomach the idea of Hugh Grant singing his own songs and staging a come back then rest assured, this is a very polished and unsubstantial rom-com. He and Drew Barrymore propel the movie with energy, wit and a warm, lovable enthusiasm. While perhaps doing little more than playing new aspects of themselves, it is a delightful performance, and one backed up with catchy songs, a fabulous debut by Haley Bennett (Cora) and a heartfelt, realistic script.<br><br>Cora is a sort of teenage megastar, somewhere between Shakira, Britney Spears and a youthful Madonna. Her elaborate stage-shows have a 'Buddhism &amp; thong'(mysticism and sex) philosophy. Here, as with Alex and Sophie, the echelons of the music world seem realistically portrayed. While the matches seem unbelievable at first, by the end of the film we want Hugh and Drew to continue their romance offstage, just as with classic romance films of the 30s, so by any mainstream yardstick, Music and Lyrics is a success. The film is as unpretentious as its two lead actors, makes no great claims, and satisfies Valentine's Day release requirements with a sincerity that takes it a notch above the average cheese. Casting is spot-on, even down to Sophie's older (and much larger) sister, who has similar characteristics and mannerisms. It's easy viewing, and even contains nothing unsuitable for older children. If you want more sophisticated and substantial fare, you probably don't need film reviews to find your way to the nearest art-house cinema or Oscar blockbuster. But for straight enjoyment, Music and Lyrics slides down like a very reasonable glass of rich chardonnay. Silly, formulaic, but rather well done.","user":"Chris_Docker","rank":[223,250]},{"title":"Interesting and funny movie","rating":8,"date":"8 February 2007","review":"I must warn you -- Being a guy, I had pretty low expectations to begin with. However, there were a couple of things I enjoyed:<br><br>1) The movie was funny. <br><br>-- Hugh Grant's one-sentence witty remarks came out natural and funny. <br><br>-- Their ability to poke fun of two distinct musical decades could be better, but still turned out pretty funny. <br><br>2) The plot was novel (at least to me). <br><br>-- \"Meshing\" the two music periods (the 80's and today) in the same movie provided a good way to contrast the two styles. <br><br>-- Since I'm not so familiar with the music industry, I enjoyed the \"behind the scenes\" with the trial and error of coming up with lyrics (at least in the way the movie portrays it.) <br><br>Other than that, it was the typical \"chic-flick.\" Guy has problem with girl, he says some bad things, stir up some emotional scene and the usual -- will they get back together? <br><br>Other than that, if you're just looking for a good laugh, I'd give it a go!","user":"cegeon","rank":[186,221]}]
