[{"title":"Val Lewton would be proud","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2003","review":"I just watched this remarkable 1988 film which somehow managed to escape my attention previously. It may have been the Vestron distribution that worked against it - the company went under, and the film was not released on a mass scale. <br><br>I have not seen a \"horror\" film which involved children that impressed me as much as this since \"Curse of the Cat People.\" \"The Innocents\" has just been knocked out of second spot by my viewing of this stylish film that puts \"The Other\" and \"The Others\" to shame. <br><br>The film concerns young British teen Anna, who suffers fainting spells, and in her dreams visits the house which she had drawn on paper. As the dreams go on, she meets a young male teen named Mark, whom she had drawn in the window on paper. At first she couldn't get to visit his room - he tells her she has to go back and draw the stairs. <br><br>I won't reveal more of the plot, it would be doing the film a great disservice, even though most viewers will probably be one step ahead. That's not a negative in this case, as it enables one to be more attentive to the production design of Gemma Jackson and the direction of Bernard Rose, which combine to depict incredibly stark visuals - there's no cheating with splashes of color and hazy or overlit photography that are often erroneously used to indicate a dreamlike state. <br><br>Charlotte Burke will tear at your emotions as Anna, a shame she made this her solo acting experience. Elliott Spiers is equally impressive as Mark, but he only made one more film. Glenne Headly - a New London, Connecticut native, does remarkably well in her role as Anna's mother, her accent is impeccable. This one is not to be missed.","user":"clore_2","rank":[40,44]},{"title":"Fantastic","rating":12,"date":"12 November 2003","review":"I was absolutely stunned while watching this fantasy/horror film.  The original plot has Anna (an eleven year old girl with glandular fever) sketching the crude drawing of a house during the opening scene.  As her fever worsens, she repetedly dreams of the same house on an open field. In her dreams, the house is brilliantly lit up and really looks like a child's drawing, which I found a rather frightening image.  Anna dreams of adventures in the house with a boy named Marc, and these adventures turn more sinister as her illness becomes more serious.  There seems to be a link between her illness and the evil she must face in the house, but like many things in the movie, this is only hinted at.<br><br>In many ways I found this movie better than the book, Marianne Dreams by Catherine Storr.  Although the book does contain some subtle horror, it is basically for children.  However, the movie offers some real scares as well as an underlying atmosphere of suppressed horror.  There is something unnerving in the scenes when Anna is exploring the empty house that is difficult to put your finger on.<br><br>Perhaps the reason this amazing film wasn't a huge commercial success was because it's difficult to determine it's intended audience. While the character of Anna might appeal to pre-teens, some scenes (in particular the one when the father tries to break into the house with a hammer) are far to intense for young children.  Most adults may be put off by the plot, but if they're at all interested in child or dream psycology, or just want to see something different, I'd throughly reccomend it.","user":"jasonay","rank":[53,60]},{"title":"Pretty darn cool","rating":9,"date":"21 July 2004","review":"My friend and I picked \"Paperhouse\" out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the Horror section-- neither of us had heard of it, but the blurb on the box was really promising. And the movie didn't disappoint, though I still probably wouldn't call it a horror movie exclusively.<br><br>11-year old Anna Madden draws a house, and visits it in her dreams. She is definitely asleep when she's seeing the house, but it's so real in a sense that it's almost like a completely separate reality. Which, in view of later events, doesn't seem like a far cry from the truth. Anyhow, she finds she can add to the house, its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture. <br><br>While this is going on, Anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever, and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing. On top of that, she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father; he has a job that takes him away for long stretches, though one gets the impression there's actually more to the story than that.<br><br>OK, so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough-- but frankly there's something really menacing about it. The dreamworld is eerily surreal -- the house, for instance, is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field. The folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate world/ongoing dream...<br><br>One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy, Mark, who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about (I'm not giving that away, you know from the moment he appears that it's the same kid). In reality, Mark can't walk due to an illness; in Anna's drawing-world, he can't walk because she didn't draw him any legs. She blames herself for his real-life illness, and tries to rectify the situation, but... everything starts getting really weird. She even brings her absent father into the drawing, with disastrous results. The bits with the father are really terrifying.<br><br>I don't want to give anything away, so I'll stop there... There seems to be a lot going on in this film. I'm sure you'll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it-- Is it a simple a story as it seems, or are there actually layers of meaning? I don't know, but either way it's quite fascinating. There was a \"Nightmare On Elm Street\"-ish quality about it, in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect. I love things like that.<br><br>My only complaint is that it feels like it COULD have ended many times, but didn't. I'm satisfied with the ending it had (some of you sensitive types might want to have Kleenex handy!), though it really could have a variety of conclusions. Anyway, it doesn't exactly feel drawn out once it's actually over, but while you're watching and it keeps fading back in, it's a little nerve wracking.<br><br>Still, \"Paperhouse\" is a really GOOD film. It's well done, and acting-- especially Charlotte Burke as Anna-- is top notch. Burke, who has never before or since appeared in a film, is a real gem. I don't know why she never went onto do anything else, but either way she's really convincing and enjoyable to watch.<br><br>\"Paperhouse\" isn't exactly a horror movie, it's sort of a fantasy/suspense/something else type of movie, with some definite horroresque moments-- but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or something.<br><br>Give it a chance, you won't regret it! And maybe you should read the book, too...","user":"suomi_metal","rank":[30,34]}]
