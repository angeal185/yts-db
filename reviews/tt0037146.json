[{"title":"Tex wrangles some horse wranglers ..........","rating":4,"date":"14 July 2006","review":"In this WWII era cheapie western, Tex Ritter investigates and tries to stop the wrangling of horses meant for the US Army . Fuzzy Knight is along for the ride. This film was a standard entry from Tex, with a well-used plot and standard writing. The action scenes were okay, but too few for my taste.<br><br>Tex Ritter was a pleasant singing cowboy, but not the most convincing in action scenes. This film demonstrates that and is basically just an average western programmer. The cast did an okay job with a so-so script.<br><br>Fans of this type of film will find it a good diversion and any film with the lovely Jennifer Holt is a must see !","user":"revdrcac","rank":[4,5]}]
