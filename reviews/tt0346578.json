[{"title":"The Batman and the Penguin As They Were Meant to Be Portrayed","rating":10,"date":"13 July 2005","review":"\"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman\" is about as entertaining as animated Batman movies get.<br><br>While still true to the feeling of the comic books, the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks much like he has before, but now he appears somewhat less imposing. The Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by the less edgy, more youthful Tim Drake Robin.<br><br>Kevin Conroy, as usual, invokes the voice of Batman better than most live action actors.<br><br>Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice-acting job than I was expecting.<br><br>As in the live action Batman films, the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains. My all-time favorite, the Penguin, is here. His design is sleeker than it has appeared before, hearkening more to the Burgess Meredith portrayal of the '60's than the Danny DeVito portrayal of \"Batman Returns.\" David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the Penguin's voice. The Penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate, just as he most commonly appears in the comics. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a Bane who's much more memorable than the forgettable version in \"Batman &amp; Robin.\" And finally, Batman has a descent mystery to solve, putting the \"Detective\" back in \"Detective Comics\" (that is what \"DC\" stands for, after all.) The revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist.<br><br>The score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie. It sounds like a mix between the score from \"Poirot\" and the score from \"Mission: Impossible.\" All in all, it's more entertaining than your average cartoon.","user":"SylvesterFox007","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"Good Batman Cartoon.","rating":7,"date":"4 January 2008","review":"This Batman movie isn't quite as good as Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero But it is still a good installment to the Batman cartoons I say it is equally good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons The storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it The Cartoon effects are good The voice of actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as Batman/ Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I am sure you will not be disappointed with batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So make sure that you rent or buy batman Mystery of The Batwoman the movie because it is really good.<br><br>Overall score: ******* out of ********** <br><br>*** out of *****","user":"kyle-mcdonald","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"HEHEHE, undoubtedly still one of the best Batman Films out there.","rating":8,"date":"8 November 2003","review":"The movie is a great movie, it uses the more recent character designs so if you are used to the original show, you'll have to adjust, but otherwise, visually it is a fantastic treat. The music is good, as always, it includes the original Batman theme in there as well as a new song by an up and comer Cherie called Betch Neva which is a great song and played a couple times throughout the film. there is also a love interest for batman as well as an antagonist. Voice acting is superb and the story keeps you entertained. If you are a fan of all the batman material that has come before, you owe it to yourself to watch, especially if you recognize the characters such as rupert thorne and bane. Take a look, it is more than worth it.","user":"gohmifune","rank":[12,16]}]
