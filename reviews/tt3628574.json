[{"title":"more like \"Put You to sleep\"","rating":1,"date":"2 January 2019","review":"Unbearably slow and pointless, this was a boring mess with an unappealing lead actress and a waste of time for 3 talented actors, Michael Shannon, Luke Evans, and Michael Huisman. 1 hour and 44 minutes of Katherine Waterston moping her way through a film about.................well, I don't know what it was about. Maybe it was about grief ? Being loved ? People who cheat on their spouses ? Domineering mothers ? It is hard to watch a film when the lead character is completely unlikable and seems brain-dead. One of those movies with lots of shots that linger on for an eternity and characters do and say things that seem completely unrealistic. There is suppose to be some air of mystery to it and believe me there really isn't, when it ended I just thought \"That's it ?\". Not even worth a look if you're a fan of any of the 3 actors. I kind of felt like i was being tortured and left the theater in a bad mood !","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[25,31]},{"title":"Solid if unmemorable","rating":6,"date":"4 January 2019","review":"Katherine Waterston is as lovely as ever, Michael Shannon is very nice in a role that's considerably softer than his usual parts, and the direction is slick and competent. However the whole thing is mostly forgettable and the movie just sort of ends without a satisfying resolution.","user":"egbrockstar","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"ya but no","rating":3,"date":"3 January 2019","review":"I see what they were trying to do... but they failed.
