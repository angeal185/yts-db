I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE THE RUMORS THAT ROTTEN TOMATOES ISN'T LEGIT ANYMORE THAT'S WHY MY FIRST CHOICE IS IMDB FOR HONEST REVIEWS... FROM START TO FINISH, THIS IS ONE GOOD MOVIE... SEE FOR YOURSELVES.","user":"Warren_Scott-55087","rank":[59,80]},{"title":"A Serious Crime/Drama Flick","rating":6,"date":"6 October 2019","review":"This was a decent hour and a half watch. A very well-rounded balanced group of actors who did an extremely good job. This movie pulled no punches and was serious from start to finish. Very little action 100% drama. A little slow starting hence the character development but as the story progressed you became engaged with the characters. A story of family and friends and how far one is willing to go and sacrifices they'll make for their own.","user":"Birkyirky","rank":[19,24]},{"title":"Likeable cast playing unsympathetic characters","rating":4,"date":"11 January 2020","review":"The problem with this movie is I had not much sympathy for the main characters played by Jai Courtney and Alex Wolff. The supporting cast played by Finn Wittrock as an amputee and the girl he likes played by Leighton Meester. The initial part is hard to follow. Poor direction then a bit of Iraq. The break part is fairly exciting. Of course you want to see if they get away. But then what's going to happen to Jai Courtney in prison? Dumb ending.\nA feel bad story.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[4,4]}]
