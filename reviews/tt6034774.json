[{"title":"Painful","rating":8,"date":"8 January 2019","review":"I didn't last very long. I watched maybe 8 minutes of this; it seemed like I had been watching for 30 minutes or more. I don't know if high school drama clubs do videos, but if they do. I'm sure they would do a better job.<br><br>Run away.","user":"jimcancook","rank":[21,28]},{"title":"Is there a C movie category?","rating":1,"date":"8 January 2019","review":"Been a member for about 9 years I think, never seen a movie previous to this that was so bad I felt the need to write a review.\nThe idea/concept was actually pretty good, the execution however was severely lacking.\nFor me is was mainly the flat acting that made it so bad, made me cringe at points. Never managed to finish it due to this.\nI guess asking if there is a C movie category is a little harsh as there is at least some production value in it, camera work for instance and some of the art work in the history lesson part are not all that bad at all, but man the acting. Did I mention the acting?","user":"Quigonjay","rank":[20,28]},{"title":"Low production value","rating":3,"date":"8 January 2019","review":"So I was going into this knowing it wouldn't be the best movie ever, but still, the start of the movie was pretty okay. The acting was doable and I got interested in how the world got to the state it was in.<br><br>However then about 8 minutes in we get a scene with a teacher giving a lecture. I kept thinking \"what is that I'm hearing?\". Turns out that every time the teacher speaks you hear noise in the background. It starts and stops exactly when he talks. It seems like whoever made this movie thought it would be a good idea to just cut out the noise in between the words and not even try to actually remove the noise from the audio or just record the scene again.","user":"nickbetting","rank":[13,17]}]
