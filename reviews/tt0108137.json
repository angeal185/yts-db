[{"title":"A beautiful horse film","rating":14,"date":"14 June 2000","review":"Well, in my continuing quest to see every movie Russell Crowe was ever in, I stumbled across this little film.  (As long as I'm disclosing biases, I might as well mention that I have not read Elyne Mitchell's novel.)<br><br>It is a film for children--specifically, girls ages 8-12 or so who love horses.  And they will love it.  Younger children may be disturbed by some of the content; these are wild horses trying to survive in the wild, in all weather and situations.<br><br>It's framed as a fable, with Elyne Mitchell (Caroline Goodall) writing a story for her daughter Indi (Amiel Daemion) about Thowra, the great silver brumby, and the Man (Russell Crowe) who  wants to tame him.<br><br>It's meant to be a fable, which explains how all these wild horses are so beautifully groomed.  The horses also occasionally  seem to be deaf, since they fail to react at all to sounds that any horse would prick its ears at.<br><br>As a horse film, it's highly successful.  We see lots of lovely horses, doing fascinating horse things.  The horse part of the movie is perfectly developed.<br><br>The humans are more troublesome.  I suspect that Mrs. Mitchell and her daughter were not characters in the book; adding them causes a fundamental shift in the relationships between the characters.  Instead of relationships between Thowra and other horses (especially the Brolga, his archrival) and between Thowra and the Man, the most important relationships are those between humans (between the two Mitchells, between Indi and the various men who catch and tame brumbies) and between humans and nature, with the relationships among the horses and of the humans to the horses receding into the background.<br><br>Instead of a simple pair of conflicts--between Thowra and the Brolga (the natural challenge); between Thowra and the Man (the unnatural challenge)--we get instead a large number of relationships, which changes the entire dynamic.<br><br>Despite these problems, the new concept could have worked, if simplified a bit.  The basic point is that both Indi and the Man love Thowra, and for the same reasons:  he is beautiful, strong, proud, and free.  However, because Indi loves Thowra, she wants him to remain free; because the Man loves Thowra, he wants to own and tame the horse.<br><br>Such a conflict could have provided ample opportunity for lessons on \"listening to the bush\" and on the difference and inherent contradiction between love and possession (etc., etc.).<br><br>In the film, however, the Mitchells dominate.  Elyne gives her daughter lessons on nature and life, with the help of an injured kangaroo they find, which serves to teach that wild things belong in the wild, that if you truly care about something you give it its freedom--all lessons that could have been communicated via the story of Thowra.  (I loved the kangaroo, but it wasn't necessary.)  Meanwhile, the Man is underdeveloped, and sometimes demonized--which runs entirely counter to the purpose of the film.  The Man is not evil, just obsessed.<br><br>The filmmakers undoubtedly decided to focus on the girl and her mother because that's their audience.  A reasonable decision, and yet one which weakens the film.<br><br>Overall, a nice, solid horse film which should be very popular with its target audience.","user":"sign_of_the_angel","rank":[23,24]},{"title":"Stunning Visuals","rating":9,"date":"9 April 2002","review":"I truly wish that this movie would have been shown in theatres in the US instead of going directly to video.  The visuals were absolutely stunning, especially the scenes of the brumbies galloping freely.<br><br>The basic premise of the story about the Man's obsession for the Silver Brumby was excellent.  The medium of the mother relating the story to her daughter was also handled well, but some of the other scenes with the mother and daughter distracted from the flow of the film. Especially the scenes with the kangaroo.  To me they seemed disjointed as if they were just thrown in hodgepodge.<br><br>Overall I loved the movie and will watch it again for the Australian scenery and horse scenes.","user":"Mia4","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"A Wonderful Surprise","rating":9,"date":"8 April 2002","review":"I usually have pretty low expectations for \"children's movies\" not to mention animal adventures.  This film turned out to be a fabulous surprise in every way.  Sure, I came to it solely to finish out my search for Russell Crowe films; but I came away extremely moved by both the story, the breathtaking visuals of Australia and the lack of heavyhandedness so usually present in these films.  This film provided a mesmerizing, compelling film experience.  Oh yeah...Russell looks absolutely gorgeous.....  Try it...you'll be glad you did.","user":"Lola-32","rank":[11,13]}]
