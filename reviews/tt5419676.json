[{"title":"A must watch!","rating":10,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"This was an excellent documentary that provided an insider's look and a rare opportunity to hear from female Artists, Activists and leaders of the feminist movement of the 70s.<br><br>Don't let the bad reviews deter you from watching - they were probably written by angry dudes!<br><br>I feel empowered and motivated after watching this film and it's a must watch for any girl and woman today!!","user":"kristinajanelawson","rank":[39,66]},{"title":"Women's stories told from the source","rating":8,"date":"16 October 2018","review":"This film requires no direction and no script. Women tell the stories that happened to them as they were growing up and what is happening currently. This is a documentary about women by women and it is what is it. There is no contradicting what happened to these people and the stories speak for themselves. Women are not yet equal in society and it used to be even worse. Despite the progress the fight needs to continue because of the attitudes towards women expressed in the film and the very reviews from this website. <br><br>This happened! This is happening! Women have not been able to vote for 100 years!","user":"Natron00","rank":[39,68]},{"title":"Loved it!","rating":10,"date":"19 October 2018","review":"Great movie, that shows how far we have come on some points, and how much work there still is to do.","user":"caventina","rank":[34,62]}]
