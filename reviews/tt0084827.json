[{"title":"TRON: 'All that is visible'","rating":9,"date":"12 November 2004","review":"TRON. Now here's a film that seems to generate a wide spectrum of reviews.<br><br>As for my take on this landmark motion picture, I have to admit that I will always be able to reflect on it in its original context.<br><br>In 1982, TRON (along with Blade Runner) was nothing short of breathtaking. And, although it was originally panned by critics, those who have taken the time to look closer, have noticed that there is more to this film than there first seems to be.<br><br>One of TRON's greatest strengths lies in its extensive use of parallelism. There is the world of the user (almost a god or demigod motif), contrasted with the world of the programs (very much a metaphor for our world). And, just to enhance this metaphor, Dillinger's helicopter is shown with neon-red lines, and the final fade to black is preceded with a time-lapse of the city  suggesting data running along traces.<br><br>The obvious parallels are with the use of the same actor for each character's counterparts in the digital world. Flynn and Clu, Alan and Tron, Laura and Yori, Gibbs and Dumont, Dillinger and Sark.<br><br>However, we see a number of other characters show up here and there, in more subtle form: For example, there's Sark's second in command on the bridge of the carrier. He shows up earlier in the film as Peter  the suit who was watching Dillinger's office. Then there's RAM's human counterpart asking Alan if he can have some of his popcorn. <br><br>I find it surprising that many are critical of the 'unbelievable' aspect of this film. However, never is the audience expected to believe that this is the way the computer world really works or that a person could ever be zapped into a computer. In fact, to allude to the type of story that the audience is being presented with, TRON does a near-quote of Alice In Wonderland, with 'Stranger and stranger.' Perhaps Kevin Flynn fell down the rabbit hole. And  for those who think TRON is a Disney film  watch the production notes and you'll discover that this is not a Disney film (although they did fund it).<br><br>Of most obvious interest is the fact that TRON pushed the computer graphics technology of the time to its limits and beyond. And  despite many who have said that its graphics are primitive, they're confusing resolution with texture-mapping. The truth is, the number of colours displayed and the resolution shown in the computer-generated components in TRON is higher than most desktop displays  even today. To output to film with the level of sharpness and smooth gradients seen in TRON, you'd need at least 24 or 32-bit colour, with a horizontal resolution of approximately 3000 to 4000 pixels. On top of that, it was the first film to use transparency in 3D CGI (the solar-sailor simulation). To my knowledge, texture-mapping didn't exist in 1982. Fortunately, the lack of texture mapping works well with the stylized look of the film's 'world inside the machine.'<br><br>As a film, TRON is definitely both unique and entertaining. And, for those who are visual in nature, it's full of splendid eye-candy. The design work is top-rate, and is best appreciated when viewed on film. I recall watching this movie when it first came out in 1982, and have to say that it was nothing short of total immersion. Unfortunately, most of the modern transfers of this film have been pretty rough (with the exception of the out-of-print Laserdisc box-set).<br><br>The plot for TRON is actually quite simple. Despite this simplicity, it is cleverly used for the purpose of -- hopefully  making the audience think about our world, and how it may relate to some 'higher world.' If we are programs, then who are our users? Is there a level up from us, and do they know all the answers? There is certainly a metaphysical angle to TRON, which the audience can ether pay attention to, or disregard in favour of the simple thrill of watching Light Cycles square off against each other on the Game Grid.<br><br>Many elements are combined in this film: the gladiatorial film, the exodus, the revolution, the sentient AI, the battle of good vs. evil, and  of course  the almost prophetic depiction of the computer industry. Encom and Ed Dillinger are very much parallels to real themes that took place in the computer industry in the years that followed the release of TRON. These themes are very much repeated in more recent trilogy of films. I think the actual name for the Light Cycle game that Flynn mentions will give you a clue as to which trilogy I'm referring to.<br><br>Finally, there's Kevin Flynn. Some may be surprised that I left this one to the end. However, I thought I'd leave the best for last. Fact is, Jeff Bridges did a brilliant job with this character. Over the years, I have actually known computer-industry hot-shots who are remarkably similar to Flynn. He made the character believable. And, this carries over to the film itself. No matter how much of a leap you're expected to make when approached with a script or screenplay, be compelling. Jeff Bridges and David Warner do exactly this. <br><br>TRON is a movie that really entertains. I like to think of it as a big small movie. One that was definitely ambitious and is presented in 'glossy' and vivid wide-screen, yet has a sort of nice-light-snack kind of feel to it. It's a movie with a great deal of replay value, and one with compelling characters. <br><br>In short, TRON  like its video game counterpart  is fun.<br><br>And for that, and a host of other reasons, it will remain on my list of favourite films.<br><br>End of line.","user":"J-bot6","rank":[272,319]},{"title":"Put \"Tron\" Back In Theaters!!!","rating":9,"date":"30 September 2004","review":"I hope some smart person from Disney is reading this: if ever there was a movie crying out to be re-released into movie-theaters, it's \"Tron,\" the dazzling sci-fi film from Walt Disney Productions. If it were released into theaters today, \"Tron\" would be a smash hit, 'cause the movie-audiences of today would understand it a heckuva lot better than the movie-audiences of 1982.<br><br>\"Tron\" tells the story of a young computer programmer named Flynn (Jeff Bridges) who gets sucked INTO a computer, and must fight for his life playing life-or-death video games, run by the evil Master Control Program. With the aid of a good warrior program named Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), and Tron's significant-other Yori (Cindy Morgan), Flynn must put a stop to the MCP and set things right in the computer world once again before returning to his own world.<br><br>With breathtakingly beautiful computer-animation (and the very first film to use computer-animation extensively), and presenting an original, dazzling world where energy lives and breathes inside a computer, \"Tron\" was way ahead of it's time. This may explain why the film was greeted with incomprehension from critics and audience members alike back in 1982.<br><br>The problem was, back in 1982, there was no such thing as the Internet, and, apart from business types, most people didn't really know diddlysquat about computers yet. As a result, the computer jargon heard throughout \"Tron\" went sailing over most audience members' heads, and for many, the story was difficult to follow. Critics complained that \"Tron\" was all special effects and no story. And, for the final insult, \"Tron\" wasn't even NOMINATED for Best Visual Effects at Oscar time, presumably because the Academy in 1982 didn't recognize computer-animation as \"genuine\" visual effects, i.e. \"it's animation, not visual effects,\" they thought to themselves. \"The Abyss\" changed all that in 1989, but that was a big seven years after \"Tron.\" Obviously, everyone in 1982 had missed the film's point.<br><br>But the passing of time has been very kind to \"Tron.\" Today, the film has a major cult following, and is recognized by many as the landmark sci-fi film that it truly is. Looking at \"Tron\" today, the movie has aged very well indeed, like a fine wine. Now that time--and people's knowledge of computers--has finally caught up with \"Tron,\" now would be the PERFECT time for the world in general to take another look at this amazing film.<br><br>Message to Disney: put \"Tron\" back in theaters! Clean it up with a new remastered print &amp; remastered sound, and let the world rediscover this sci-fi classic. It WILL be a smash hit! In 1982, people just didn't understand \"Tron.\" Today, they will. Trust me. :-)","user":"Gazzer-2","rank":[209,263]},{"title":"Poetical cyberadventure","rating":6,"date":"6 June 2004","review":"Excuse me, but : wow ! I feel sorry for those who are disillusioned, but Tron (1982) is nothing to me but pure magic ! A poetical \"cyberadventure\" where the cyber world is a methaphorical representation of the \"real\" one. And to think that those images were produced, and more unbelievable, imagined, in the early eighties ! OK, by today's standards, it might not look so impressive to some viewers, but still... And the imagination behind that movie, those graphics : wonderful ! I wish to be yet surprised by unexpected ideas such as Tron. And I am not necessarily thinking about a sequel : just surprise me ! Tron (1982) : a classic of the 7th art !<br><br>Eric Quebec, Canada<br><br>P.S.: Excuse my English, I am French-Canadian.","user":"regiedunlop2003","rank":[136,177]}]
