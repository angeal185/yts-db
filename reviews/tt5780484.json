[{"title":"Poor Acting","rating":4,"date":"3 December 2018","review":"Expected a lot from the movie. The story held on but the acting totally amateurish. The protagonist considering he was a boxer in his earlier life showed little courage in the face of diversity. The movie could have been a big hit had the producers had more money to produce this low low budget film.","user":"sudipmaitra","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"The absolute worst UK mob movie I've ever seen.","rating":2,"date":"11 January 2019","review":"Thats the only reason I watched this thing, If you can endure the first hour and a half of this tripe, I promise you'll be treated to an even more ridiculous ending to this mess. Good luck.","user":"Ghenghy","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"Made of wood inc.","rating":2,"date":"9 April 2020","review":"Inconsistent accents , miserable .
