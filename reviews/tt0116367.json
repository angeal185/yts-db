[{"title":"Enjoyable, but leaves you puzzled.","rating":8,"date":"10 January 2005","review":"I enjoyed this film, but I was left a little puzzled at the end by what I'd just watched in terms of what type of movie this is.<br><br>It starts off as a very Tarantino-esquire film, it's clear that he wrote it as his famous dialogue is present. It's an enjoyable crime thriller much along the lines of Tarantino's other works (such as Pulp Fiction &amp; Reservoir Dogs) but with a bit of Robert Rodriguez flare shown during the action sequences.<br><br>Then with about 50-ish minutes left, the style film changes entirely. It becomes another film, it goes from stylish crime thriller to random vampire action movie. It's almost as if Tarantino left the room while writing the script and somebody wrote the rest of the film for him, it loses it's Tarantino charm and becomes a predictable, gore fest, vampire flick.<br><br>I'm a fan of Vampire films, so I still enjoyed the movie, but I can see why others don't like it. The acting is of high quality, especially from Geroge Clooney who outdoes himself, and in parts saves the film.<br><br>8/10 - Watch with an open mind.","user":"ShadowKnuxx","rank":[174,208]},{"title":"Half an interesting film","rating":6,"date":"12 February 2006","review":"The first half of this film is like anything you'd expect from Quentin Tarintino and Robert Rodriguez: cool 70's soundtrack, snappy dialogue, really good editing, lots of violence, and a slightly unconvincing role by QT himself. I thought it was disturbing, stylish and pretty good for the first half, and was enjoying it.<br><br>And then they get to the Titty Twister, where there are lots and lots of vampires and lots of blood and nudity, and lots of fighting, and, for me, it just went completely downhill. It felt silly and just inappropriate from what we'd seen at the beginning, and I actually got a little bored.<br><br>That being said, I really liked Harvey Kietel's performance and George Clooney was much better than I'd thought he'd be. Plus, Salma Hayek is one sexy kitten.<br><br>So yeah, half a good film. If you love over the top vampire films though complete with dated effects, then go for it, because you might just like it","user":"ThePedofinderGeneral","rank":[102,120]},{"title":"Concept: 9, execution: 6","rating":7,"date":"13 April 2013","review":"I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) <br><br>Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more \"meta\" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film.<br><br>This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.","user":"rubenvanbergen","rank":[18,19]}]
