[{"title":"The brilliance of early Kurosawa","rating":8,"date":"3 August 2002","review":"Impressive as some of the later films of Kurosawa are - \"Kagemusha\" and \"Ran\" for example, I have to confess that it is his early work, particularly those set in modern Japan as opposed to its feudal past, that I find myself returning to with greater pleasure.  He was not one of those artists who necessarily got better and better, rather was he one who continued to take on different challenges, not always with the same degree of success, as \"Dodesukaden\" and \"Dreams\" were to prove.  I have long regarded the 1952 \"Ikiru\" as his greatest achievement, with the three modern day day films starring Toshiro Mifune that precede it, \"Drunken Angel\", \"The Quiet Duel\" and \"Stray Dog\", fascinating consolidations of his skill as a director. \"Stray Dog\" revels in technical accomplishment.  It tells the story of a policeman who, after experiencing the theft of his gun while travelling on a bus, embarks on an odyssey to retrieve it.  Questions of morality and honour loom large as they do in any Kurosawa film, with the quest becoming ever more urgent as evidence is gathered of the weapon being used in criminal activities.  What might be regarded as plain bad luck in another culture is here seen as a matter of shame and dishonour by the unfortunate policeman, that has to be addressed forsaking all else.  The search is pursued in a dazzling series of chases, encounters and interrogations that leaves the audience, like the hero, exhausted at times.  The weather is hot throughout, characters sweat profusely and sometimes everything erupts in a tropical downpour - no other director uses rain so physically.  Perhaps, at over two hours, \"Stray Dog\" is a little too long to sustain its material.  It sags a little in the middle, but the chases at the outer ends of the film are wonderfully done, particularly the penultimate sequence where the cop pursues his prey through vegetation where city and countryside meet.  You can almost smell the steamy atmosphere of a morning after rain where everything is about to heat up again.  Possibly the other two Mifune films of the same period have the edge on this.  They are more meditative works, their lengths more sustainable.  But, for sheer cinematic bravado, this is the one.","user":"jandesimpson","rank":[57,60]},{"title":"Brilliant early noir from Kurosawa. To be recommended.","rating":8,"date":"19 February 2004","review":"Captivating American-esque noir, one of Kurosawa's first great films. What seems like a weak premise for a thriller at the start actually ends up providing a great central situation for this movie which drives it forward much better than, say, Donzoko. Music, also is great.<br><br>Toshiro Mifune, looking young and handsome, is quite marvellous as the central character, a detective whose gun is stolen on a bus. What starts out as a detective nervous about finding his gun and fixing a silly mistake, develops into a frantic and desparate man who feels somehow responsible for whatever crimes are committed with his gun. The suspense and detective-story plot are well developed in Stray Dog, but what really makes the story captivating is the revelation of the central character's feeling of guilt throughout, and his learning about crime, criminals, and that what is important is to make good come of your mistakes.","user":"Ben_Cheshire","rank":[38,41]},{"title":"Kurosawa's first major masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"18 September 2003","review":"STRAY DOG stands as the legendary Akira Kurosawa's first real masterpiece, noteworthy for at least two big reasons: the style - classic American film noir (rich, velvety b&amp;w atmospheres), enhanced with a touch of Italian neo-realism (great use of diverse locations, which provide a great view of day-to-day postwar Japan), and the star, a young Toshiro Mifune, whose truly collaborative association with Kurosawa was cemented here, and would grow in spectacular fashion during the subsequent 16 years. <br><br>Mifune became as much of an international icon as Kurosawa, and this is the first film where it's easily evident why. As an example of film noir, STRAY DOG offers plenty of gripping suspense and moral complexity, and holds up well alongside classics like THE BIG HEAT, THE KILLING or THE MALTESE FALCON. Kurosawa touched upon international influences to an unprecedented degree in Japanese film (the internationalist impulses of Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi or Mikio Naruse are just as deep and varied, but far more discreetly deployed), Kurosawa also skillfully highlights Japanese specifics (the rookie cop expecting to be fired, even accepting the possibility in an apologetic fashion, only to be assured that he will not be fired - this would not occur in a similar American setting), while always linking the same details to universals: honor, nobility, responsibility. This would become the thread linking Kurosawa's celebrated period/samurai films to his contemporary dramas. STRAY DOG was perhaps the first of his films where it truly resonates in a global fashion - a timeless, classic film.","user":"davidals","rank":[38,42]}]
