Is it predictable? Yes. Generic? Yeah. But what do you expect? It's a nuts and bolts action film, entertaining enough and worth your time.","user":"louis-ohalloran30","rank":[165,200]},{"title":"Good popcorn action flick","rating":7,"date":"13 November 2019","review":"If you enjoyed the previous 2 movies, this movie follows the same simple formula but it's a very nice 3rd movie.\nDon't go in expecting a deep story, some actors just scream bad guy straight away and make everything predictable, go in just to enjoy the nice combat scenes and fast paced action.\nOverall it's a nice film to just enjoy without thinking too much about it.","user":"ssjsolidsnake","rank":[92,112]}]
