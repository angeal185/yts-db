[{"title":"Good action flick","rating":7,"date":"20 July 2001","review":"If I were to make a quick summary of this movie, it would be \"a good, but not great, action flick.\"  I don't think this movie was intended to be innovative, to be great, to be memorable.  What it was intended to be was entertaining, and it lived up to this expectation.<br><br>Harrison Ford is the master of remaining as low-key as possible.  He has had so many films where he can over-emphasize, over-dramatize, and simply over-act.  Ford has the maturity to keep this from happening, and he does so again in this film.  Ford is supported quite well with such actors/actresses as James Earl Jones (reprising his role as Greer from The Hunt for Red October), Samuel L. Jackson, and Anne Archer.  For an action flick, acting is much above average.<br><br>It was also suspenseful...thrilling.  I thought the ending had a nice build-up and climax.  I realize this is different from the book's ending...but remember, these are two different visions...not the same one. This brings up a big point in movie-watching:  Comparing a movie to a book is the worst thing you can do.  They are two completely different genres. More importantly, as I said before, they are two different visions.<br><br>I'm not a big action fan.  I used to be, but anymore most stories are the same.  To this end I would say Patriot Games is fairly mainstream. However, it was always fun to watch and sometimes thrilling to watch.  I'm also not a big Tom Clancy fan, but I've given the movies based off his books a shot because again they are different visions.  The result is (at least with Patriot Games) a good film to watch on a Saturday night with a bowl of popcorn.  Don't expect great things, but don't expect to be disappointed, either.<br><br>Rating:  7/10","user":"chadly86","rank":[37,38]},{"title":"Have to admit, I like this","rating":24,"date":"24 November 2002","review":"OK, so it has some plot holes, and I generally spend a good amount of time detailing for my husband the deviations from the novel (which are many, since Hollywood doesn't make many five-hour movies).  And it's predictable and artless and has plenty of clich√©s.  I make it a point not to read IMDB reviews for a movie until after I've written my own, but even so I can guess that this one has been torn apart on these points probably at least a dozen times.  Now that that's over with, I'm going to admit that I like this movie.  It feels like a tight thriller, good for those nights when I want entertainment with some minor complexity.  I like to \"go along for the ride\", so to speak, even though I know how it ends.  And going back to the first time I saw this, before I'd read the book, I remember being on the edge of my seat quite a bit.<br><br>Thora Birch does this film a lot of good.  Her expressions and lines are quite well-acted, and she's cute without being syrupy.  Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford; you either like him or you don't, and this movie isn't going to change your  mind (I happen to like him).<br><br>Don't go renting this one if you want an artsy movie, or a beautiful movie, or a movie with a perfectly tight script.  But if you can enjoy a film for simple entertainment value, and you like Harrison Ford ;), this is a good one for after the kids are in bed.","user":"Rachel-20","rank":[44,51]},{"title":"Good guys are real good, and the bad guys are real bad.","rating":7,"date":"4 March 2008","review":"Patriot Games is a more than serviceable thriller, perhaps a bit out of date when viewing it now, but still a very effective good against evil piece. The source material is so dense and intricate it was always going to be hard to condense that into a 2 hour movie but I feel the makers manage to keep it fleshy whilst making the respective characters interesting and watchable. The acting on show is more than adequate, Harrison Ford is great in the role of Jack Ryan, he manages to portray him as a sensitive family man who can step up to the plate when things get ugly, and Anne Archer is solid enough as the wife and mother caught up in the web of nastiness unfolding.<br><br>The baddies are led by the brooding Sean Bean who is a little under written, whilst Richard Harris is sadly underused, but the action set pieces make their mark and thankfully we get a riveting final reel that cements the steady ride we have under taken. It is formulaic to a degree, but that is OK if the combined efforts of all involved are spot on, and here they are, 7/10.","user":"hitchcockthelegend","rank":[21,24]}]
