[{"title":"If you're gonna steal the Jim Jones story, at least call it what it is","rating":5,"date":"24 August 2014","review":"My opinion of Ti West continues to dissolve as I sample more of his work. I love HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and thought that this was a bright new director who had a grasp on the \"slow burn\" style of film making. I felt that THE INNKEEPERS was a great movie ruined by a rushed, poor ending, but was still good enough to maintain my opinion of his future. Then, I saw his phoned-in entries in VHS and THE ABC's OF DEATH, but willing to chalk those up to being short stories. With this movie, he's now officially making me question whether he is a one-hit wonder.<br><br>I'm actually struggling a little bit with exactly what my opinion of this movie is and what my rating should be. I'll start with some of my issues with the movie. I had heard a lot of talk going into this movie that it was influenced by the Jonestown Tragedy and I was ready for a movie that explored the nature of fanaticism and religion in the framework of West's slow burn style. What I was not prepared for was an EXACT simile of the Jonestown events. Except for one of two creative liberties, West never strays from the story, at all. By the midpoint of the movie it is clear that he's not going to offer anything new and, as a result, all tension is lost because the viewer now knows exactly what is going to happen later. If he wanted to do a Jonestown movie, why not just do one? Why not use the character's names and just call it what it is? This feels like a blatant attempt to disguise his thievery for a younger generation that may not know any better. As someone who's interested in the more macabre side of life, I've seen a half dozen documentaries on this subject already, including prior dramatizations of the events, including a recent one on cable television that was pretty much just as good.<br><br>My other major issue is the \"found footage\" attempt. I have no inherent issue with found footage, at all. In fact some of my favorite horror of the past few decades would fall into that category and you'll never hear me complain about shaky camera-work or motion sickness. The problem, is that it just doesn't work at all and comes across as a crutch used by West to try to hide some of the cracks in the foundation. The quality of the film itself, the camera angles, the cinematography...all of them are too well done to be believable in the context of found footage. You know he wants you to believe that's what it is, but it's just not believable. There are even moments in the movie that are just plain impossible within this framing device. For instance, the climax with the two reporters and \"Father\". Anybody who could possible be filming is in the frame, so who exactly is taking the shot?<br><br>So, I started the review by stating that I wasn't sure of my opinion and how to rate it, but until now I've pretty much bashed it, so where's the confusion, you may ask. Well, let's assume for one second that I'm 20 years younger than I am and don't really have a base of knowledge on the Jonestown events, or am not aware of the prior versions of this story, that maybe this is new material. Let's also assume that I'm not very critical of film style and don't care about the found footage attempt. If you can put those two things aside, the movie is entertaining. Yes, I knew exactly what was going to happen, so tension was shot for me, but West's directorial style still saves this somewhat. Gene Jones is very good as Father, though definitely needed more screen time. AJ Bowen is decent as our main character and elicits a sympathetic reaction from the audience. There are brief shock moments, mostly in a few of the deaths. Those things keep this from being rated lower, for me.<br><br>As many have suggested in prior reviews, it's probably time for West to give up complete control. No matter who you are, in what business you work in, most suffer when given complete reins. It helps to have other opinions and thoughts. Maybe it's time for West to direct someone else's story and let someone else edit. And, for the love of God, stop casting your friends in movies. Joe Swanberg cannot act and should not be given roles.","user":"TheRedDeath30","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"A Great Representation of Nowadays Christianity.","rating":7,"date":"10 April 2020","review":"In this modern representation of the blind following concept of brainwashed sheep, A news team travels with their friend to Eden Parish, a community of a pretended fake pacifism to find his missing sister but things in Paradise may not be as it seems.<br><br>No one can deny but a blind follower that the current versions of Christianity - regardless of the denomination - is a cult! Mainly produce, hatred, prejudice and brain washed sheep. Sad as it is, nowadays christian has nothing to do with the authentic message of Jesus. I fell this is quite a decent representation of such, many Christians now are semi brainwashed slaves to their churches an its ideas with all their hypocrisy and think only inside the box attitude.<br><br>On the technical point of view, the movie seems to start and reach its peak in a great manner of documentary represented film, yet by the middle of the film, the authenticity of the documentary starts to fade as we see most of the events from the perspectives of unknown camera men but over all a good experience with some acceptable acting and directing.","user":"Impartial-Critic","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"\"This is the last sacrament.\"","rating":7,"date":"29 April 2014","review":"Most people seem to dislike the \"found-footage\" genre, though I personal like to see what stories filmmakers can create and develop it as a found-footage (mostly horror). I did like the first 3 installments of \"Paranormal Activity,\" I absolutely loved \"Cloverfield,\" and \"The Blair Witch Project\" did scare me. Thus, if you found more than one of these repulsive, ignore my review. I will also warn that this is obviously not a movie for everyone. After watching this movie, I can say that I came out very disturbed and mortified, which was Ti West's intentions (I presume). The whole film feels very real, and I did enjoy Gene Jones and Amy Seimitz's terrifyingly surreal acting. Most people will see this movie knowing how it'll end since it's based on the Jonestown massacre (don't look this up if you don't know it!!!), but that doesn't mean there weren't other aspects of the movie that weren't entertaining. For what the movie is about, I was surprised to still be jumping in my seat and breathing heavily at moments of great suspense. My only complaints about the film were some of the choices Ti West chose to move the story (those moments where the audience knows they are doing something very stupid and it feels unrealistic that they would do that to begin with). Some criticism I've heard is that it takes forever to get to the \"good\" parts. I'm going to argue that that is false criticism unless you are only looking to watch a 95 minute movie filled with terror and suspense. Yes, the first half of the movie doesn't have very much suspense, but there is still a chilling mood creeping up every minute. Plus, the chemistry between the actors is great and entertaining!","user":"bigmystery23","rank":[44,61]}]
