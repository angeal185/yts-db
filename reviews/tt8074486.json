[{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"I thought Randy Couture this oughta be funny. God this was awful. That Lala is the worst actress I've ever seen. I was like who the hell would hire her to act. Then I saw that her boyfriend is a producer on this film. Too funny. God what a wreck.","user":"solidabs","rank":[25,25]},{"title":"When I die they will be showing this in hell","rating":1,"date":"15 March 2019","review":"An ex UFC fighter and a bunch of wannabe famous instagram models team up to create this dumpster fire of a movie.<br><br>Absolute trash.","user":"Kanocoolbananas","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"Don't waste your time.","rating":2,"date":"27 July 2018","review":"'The Row' (2018) had a lot of potential to be a fun B-grade slasher film, but instead chose to be two very different films: a laughably bad direct-to-video cop thriller with Randy Couture, and a sloppy slasher film with Instagram bimbos getting whacked by a knife-wielding killer.<br><br>Acting is somewhat OK from the cast and the killer looked pretty creepy on-screen, but the rest of the film is pretty much woeful due to the terrible script. I know it's a slasher movie, but some of the stuff here was just so, so bad. And what's with having no chase scenes? Come on, people.<br><br>Funniest part of the film had to be the female police chief who looked like a she'd just finished working it on a pole. I'd laugh if wasn't so stupid.<br><br>I'd suggest you watch Sorority Row (2009) or just browse Netflix for something decent. This movie is trash.","user":"Slasher_Guy","rank":[28,30]}]
