[{"title":"This film gave my wife nightmares for weeks","rating":10,"date":"26 July 2016","review":"This film scared the heck out of my wife when we saw it at the premiere at a local independent theater. It gave her nightmares for weeks after viewing. So right off I am recommending this film.<br><br>I have seen many horror films in my time. I actually don't even really consider this a horror film (in the traditional sense). This film is marketed as a horror film and definitely has horror elements, but there is a deeper story inside of it. <br><br>The most terrifying things in the film are not the \"jump scares\" but the haunting images that linger with you afterwards. <br><br>The film successfully gives you the sense of dread and unease that don't happen a lot in modern horror films. You can tell there are a lot of throwbacks to early 70's-era horror because the story builds before battering you with scary images. <br><br>The entire cast is great and every person has a reason to be there; there is no fodder or filler even in the extras. Go check it out!","user":"dominicsedillo","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"Worst movie ever.","rating":1,"date":"14 July 2016","review":"Is this some sort of joke where people are rating bad movies well?? Seriously this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Never in my life have I regretted watching a movie so badly that I've decided to comment on IMDb about it. Everything about this movie was terrible. The acting was forced and sub-par, the plot could've been cool but they took the absolute worst path possible, and the \"effects\" were absolute garbage. I feel like Simon Cowell right now criticizing someone's poor performance. Spare yourself, do not watch this movie. If you actually like this movie, I feel bad for you because there are thousands of better choices out there.","user":"bobbytorick","rank":[32,59]},{"title":"Genre Bending Done Right!","rating":10,"date":"3 June 2014","review":"It is rare you find a smart movie that keeps you guessing and then delivers at the end. Still picking up peaces of my mind after this one. Style wise there is so much to love here, it feels like Clive Barker meets Fincher. The story is captivating from beginning to end despite the fact that there's more blood in this movie then I'm use to, it never took away from the story but only added to it. Some times your not sure where the director is going with the story but then he gives you a little bit more and keeps you entertained till the final frame where he delivers his final blow that will keep you thinking for days. The score in its self is very interesting as the genre bending story progresses nothing ever feels lost or out of place. Not sure what will become of Beautiful Prison all I know is that I Frickin loved it.","user":"lickerlovermd","rank":[20,41]}]
