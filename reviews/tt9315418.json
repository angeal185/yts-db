[{"title":"Thin plot, cheap production","rating":2,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"The plot and subplots are very thin. The series are not strong on storytelling, but this Christmas special is far worse. The cheapest twist is when the order of the duke moves a ferry across the sea, instantly.<br><br>The production is poor too. The film was obviously shot in summer, with plentiful flowers, leaves on the trees, and actors failing to look cold. The final scene is terrible: The characters apparently have no family, and eat their Christmas lunch together, outside, in the sun, in the middle of the English winter.","user":"rtol-48622","rank":[9,12]}]
