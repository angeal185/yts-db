[{"title":"Surprisingly, very good","rating":9,"date":"6 April 2000","review":"Much to my surprise, it was easy to like this film.  All of the primates did a great job, and although some scenes were a little hard to believe, the overall story had a good message and many terrific moments, especially towards the end.  It was a very funny film at times, but for me, the more dramatic moments worked the best.  A very enjoyable experience.","user":"Tito-8","rank":[26,30]},{"title":"Wonderful movie, an 80's classic.","rating":10,"date":"5 June 2010","review":"The first time I watched this movie was in year 5 at school, and it left a permanent mark on me as one of my all-time favourite flicks. I enjoy it today just as much as I did when I was a child.<br><br>The storyline is very touching, and delivers a powerful message about how humans have continued to exploit animals in the name of 'scientific research'. Viewers are taken on a moving journey from start to end, as the film visits scenes which are heartfelt, humorous and horrific. You can't help but get that fuzzy feeling inside as you are introduced to the chimps on a more personal basis (and each one has its own unique little personality - from the aggressive attitude of Goliath, to the raw cheekiness of Goofy) and then shed a tear or two when both you, and Jimmy Garrett - Matthew Broderick's leading character - realise what the true intent of all the flying training actually is.<br><br>All the actors do a great job in this movie, including Matthew Broderick who is just as entertaining to watch in a serious role as he is in a comedic one. A young Helen Hunt also does a fantastic job as Virgil's loving trainer. Even William Sadler, who plays the sturdy-faced Dr. Carroll, undoubtedly depicts himself as the \"bad guy\" of the story, and does it well - even if in the movie's reality, he is a man who simply holds a difficult job... one which he intends to do well at all costs.<br><br>Of course the chimpanzees steal the spotlight of this movie, they are just amazing to watch, and their acting skills and behaviours are very believable all the way through. You almost forget that they are only acting in the same sense as their human co-stars.<br><br>The orchestral soundtrack by James Horner, to sum up in a single word, is beautiful. Viewers are taken on an emotional roller-coaster which effectively tugs at the heartstrings. I challenge anybody who cares about animals to sit through this entire movie without shedding a single tear! In fact it's one of the best movie soundtracks I have ever sat through, everything from harmonica to African wind pipes are utilised to put the finishing touches on all the scenes. <br><br>Some of these scenes in this movie can be disturbing, especially for a younger audience. Initially seeing this for the first time a a child, I found the two flight chamber 'radiation' scenes so powerful, I dare admit that they actually have haunted me in nightmares occasionally over the years. Today, I STILL find it difficult to sit through them, and prefer to reach for the fast forward button whenever they are fast approaching. The method in which these scenes are filmed - slow motion effect, eery sound effects over background silence, in-depth depictions of sadness/shock on the chimps faces, the look of horror on Broderick's face as he witnesses the fate of the chimps first hand - can come as a pure disturbance for any animal lover to watch... especially knowing that the movie is/was based on real life experiments. <br><br>Alas, that is the true nature of animal experimentation, and the movie does such a good job depicting it from an in-depth point of view - how the subjects of the fatal tests come to grasp with their impending doom, their 'fight to survive', and how that in turn effects their human trainers, who can't help but bond with them. And of course it has a climax happy ending that we're left hanging for.... the irony of the humans unknowingly training the chimps toward their freedom, as well as for the fateful project.<br><br>I love this movie and think its an absolute 80's classic, one of the best. Definitely a gem that has, in my opinion, been horribly underrated. They certainly don't make movies like these anymore, which is a shame.","user":"RedTrinity","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Wonderful film--GREAT MUSIC!!! But where is the soundtrack???","rating":13,"date":"13 November 1999","review":"Ever get that feeling to just watch a movie and bawl your eyes out? I'm one of those people who feels that it's healthy to really cry once in a while. This movie will do it to you. Many sad moments during the film--but I must say the ending is one of those happy tear-jerker endings. Truly, the personification of the chimps increased the emotional awareness of the film--you react to the chimps' feelings at least as much as the humans'. What I think really made the emotions fly out of me was the music. James Horner's score takes you through the clouds on wondrous flights of melody and also puts you through torturous periods of mourning and sorrow. His use of a gorgeous flute instrument combines innocence with a bit of an African tone. Being a great James Horner fan, collecting scores such as Legends of the Fall and Titanic, I was very disappointed to find that the score for Project X is only available on the black market! To this day I can't figure out why. If you've seen this film and know anything about the soundtrack, feel free to e-mail me. If you've not seen it, pop it in the VCR and you'll see what I'm talking about. Just make sure you grab a box of Kleenex!","user":"knohl","rank":[15,18]}]
