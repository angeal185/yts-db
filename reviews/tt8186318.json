I wish there were more movies like this available.","user":"dshields-25698","rank":[85,124]},{"title":"Bring your neighbors! Great take-a-ways","rating":10,"date":"23 August 2019","review":"I almost never would give a 10 on a film since I believe that every film could do better, but in this case it is just a really good family film with some great take-a-ways. The acting keeps getting better in their films and the professionalism of the script level is very comparable to any family film produced by Hollywood. The messages and impact was felt deeply by myself. The next day I am still singing the songs in my head and trying to make some differences in my daily life to take advantage of the advise offered in the movie. I can't understand why many people would vote a '1' and then not even do a review, unless they never even saw the film and are just against anything with references to Jesus in a film. I guess that part hasn't changed in over 2000 years!? Go see the film and take someone with you...","user":"kkjmm-39293","rank":[66,104]},{"title":"Best Kendricks Brothers Movie Yet","rating":10,"date":"23 August 2019","review":"Best Kendricks Brothers Movie Yet and they're getting more and more bold about the Gospel\nLOVE that !!!!","user":"rightgirl","rank":[54,85]}]
