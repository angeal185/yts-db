[{"title":"Enjoyable","rating":8,"date":"26 August 2019","review":"This movie is great. A lot of the reviews so far don't agree with Lionel's views so they give a low rating. If you watch a movie with killing in it do you give it a low rating because you don't agree with killing? No it is a feelgood movie about a radio host who hasn't moved with the times but is strongly influenced by his 16 year old niece he had never met. Recommended.","user":"ilyall","rank":[23,29]},{"title":"Don't believe the rating!!","rating":10,"date":"24 August 2019","review":"This is a great movie about people feelings, it is not about only politics, it is a movie with a heart and the script is great. Really good movie to watch with your family. You never get bored and even Steve Coogan's character makes you think and feel for him. The movie is more about the scars and disappointments we go through life and how we deal with these traumas. Very human, really good. Very unfair rating.","user":"Rogerforpresident","rank":[23,32]},{"title":"Love Steve Coogan he makes this movie stand out","rating":10,"date":"23 August 2019","review":"Cant believe this movie is rated only 4.5 only.
