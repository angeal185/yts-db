For me, I have barely heard about this movie so I decided giving it a go (not knowing what I ventured into). <br><br>The movie is all kind of weird, the neon signs, the whole dark atmosphere..but I really enjoyed it overall. It has a good soundtrack as well, which is something you should not disregard! <br><br>Overall acting/casting was good.<br><br>For some reason it reminded me a bit of The Grand Budapest Hotel (do not ask me why)...<br><br>And stay with it to the end!!!! I think you will get yourself a nice suprise by watching this seemingly \"simple and quiet\" movie:)","user":"meliz","rank":[62,80]},{"title":"I REALLY Liked This Movie","rating":7,"date":"14 May 2018","review":"My movie needs are simple. I want to be entertained. that is it. I don't need any fancy references or nods to previous movies or directors etc. I don't need to be informed or moved or left speechless. <br><br>The best part of this movie is it makes it very easy to suspend belief. So you don't have to watch it and suddenly think oh man that wouldn't happen or gee that was wrong. It is highly stylized, the dialogue is great and there is a definite rhythm to it. The acting is great some of the back and forth between actors is actually very witty and very solid. It has twists and turns- none of them earth shattering but great nonetheless. <br><br>I think every actor in it was great- I cannot for the life of me figure out why everyone hates it so much. My best guess is that pretentious people either thought it was going to be one thing and it wasn't so they are upset or pretentious people expected it to be more artsy like some of those noir type films can be. <br><br>Reading the reviews before I watch it I sort of knew it would be good. I think at a certain point people who I disagree with made it clear they didn't like it so in a sort of the enemy of my enemy thing- The bad reviews seemed like folks who expect too much of a simple small movie or tried to take this movie way too seriously and those who liked it seemed to simply take it as a piece of entertainment. <br><br>My wife and I watched it on a Sunday night after dinner curled up on the couch and felt like it sounded good, so we'll ignore the bad reviews and buy it on Xbox 1. I am really glad we did. The movie isn't going to change your life, it isn't going to be one of those life altering movies This movie was great and it did the one thing we wanted on a lazy Sunday night... It entertained us. <br><br>My God the people who hated this movie are the same type of people who loved La La Land and Mother- I will almost always enjoy a movie they hate- I watched two movies this past week- Black Panther and Terminal. Black Panther was applauded as being incredible- I thought it was just ok and I just can't get anymore involved with it than saying it was just ok. <br><br>So if you are looking for something a bit different than what has come out the last few years and can enjoy something for what it is- simple entertainment the give it a shot you'll probably also really like it. <br><br>In short, only people that hate fluffy puppies- don't like this movie.","user":"TriggerPullerUSMC","rank":[153,225]}]
