[{"title":"For the heads","rating":8,"date":"13 October 2018","review":"Generally speaking, when pop culture tries to portray metal culture, or metalheads, or even just extreme music, it ends up being, at best, something vague that gestures in our direction. But this full length professional film did metal right. I was surprised too.","user":"visionarybloc","rank":[34,35]},{"title":"A surprisingly good Finnish comedy","rating":8,"date":"14 March 2018","review":"I am a (Finnish) metal head so I had some expectations when I bought the ticket. At least the subject was close to my heart. Finnish comedies in general are broadly cringe-worthy and I have not paid for a movie ticket to see a Finnish flick maybe ever before.<br><br>It has many funny moments for a regular Joe, but definitely you are going to be able to pick up much more from this if you are familiar with the metal scene. Subtle references to Finnish artists here and there put constantly a smile on my face.<br><br>There are a few interesting characters, and one absolutely hilarious one.<br><br>Some scenes were completely not funny and unnecessary for the story to be interesting. Still the good scenes and lovable characters were capable of making me laugh numerous times, so the overall feeling afterwards was very good.","user":"jere1988","rank":[56,63]},{"title":"Great movie","rating":10,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"So I watched the movie without any expectations and gotta be fair the movie was damn good and funny as well. Highly recommeneded for metalheads and people who just want to have a good laugh.<br><br>P.S. that was my 1st movie from Finland and I loved it. Keep up the good work metal bros and sisters.<br><br>Cheers","user":"Spooder","rank":[28,30]}]
