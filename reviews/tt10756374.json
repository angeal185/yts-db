[{"title":"Upvoted by hundreds of fake accounts","rating":3,"date":"24 March 2020","review":"This movie wasn't horrible but it wasn't good either. The radio host character was absolutely abysmal. He tried so hard to be scary and suspenseful but came across as a piece of cardboard.<br><br>I only lasted 30 minutes and 2 stories into the movie. The 1st was completely nonsensical, boring. and not even remotely scary. The 2nd tried to have a punch but fell completely flat. It was a complete and utter snooze fest waiting for the completely anticlimactic ending.<br><br>I've seen up voting before but I'm surprised to see 800 possible fake accounts just to up vote this movie. Both of the written reviews are completely fake and you can always tell because they're so ridiculously over the top about how much they love the movie and then you watch it and realize there's no way that any real person could have thought that about THIS movie. In pretty sure they just cut and paste them from real movie review websites, made for different movies.<br><br>Imdb seriously needs to solve this problem.","user":"enigma-947-339467","rank":[36,44]},{"title":"Movie made of YouTube horror story stories","rating":6,"date":"31 March 2020","review":"This film does not deserve a 1/10 rating. Its original in some shorts and meh in others. But enjoyable over all.<br><br>A collection of YouTube short horror films remade. Good selection.<br><br>The core of the story, the DJ is perhaps the chink in the armour.<br><br>I recommend to horror fans.","user":"rochfordsimon","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Family and Friend ratings?","rating":3,"date":"24 March 2020","review":"7.1 avg rating upon viewing.
