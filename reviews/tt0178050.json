[{"title":"The Real Stuff","rating":9,"date":"9 November 2004","review":"What do you want in a movie? If it's verisimilitude, you must have subjective overview for the context, or else it's just another period piece as distant and impersonal as The Napoleonic Wars. If it's a character study, you must accept this as the basis of the filmed entertainment.<br><br>\"Sunset Strip\" should be viewed as a character study companion piece to \"Almost Famous\" with far more accurate verisimilitude. \"Famous\" is a wondrous pastiche, lotsa entertaining bang for your buck. But \"Sunset Strip\" represents the real s**t. I know. I was there. And here's why you should take my anonymous word for it.<br><br>When I first saw this movie I was astonished that I didn't recognize the name of its writer, for I recognized every one of his characters, literally as well as figuratively. The writer obviously was exactly the same age I was, worked in the exact aspects of the entertainment industry that I did, at the exact same time in the early 70's at the exact same spots in Hollywood and knew the exact same people I did (or knew of.) Anna Friel was Genie the Tailor, who did in fact die in an auto accident with several members of British band Fairport Convention. The geeky manager was seemingly an early Geffen clone. The disolute songwriter was a Warren Zevon-alike, while Jared Leto was, dare I say, a completely interchangeable popstar type of the era. My own future husband, popstar of that era, lived in the exact same Laurel Canyon mountain aerie depicted in the film (replete with benevolent landlord), while I worked as a music photographer amongst the main protagonist's doppelganger. And I did know who he was. He was one of the names you'll recognize on photo credits of the era, who owns a major restaurant here. But he didn't want his name on the writing credits, so I'll respect that.<br><br>\"Sunset Strip\" is a highly entertaining character study that is unbelievably accurate in its depiction of an assortment of characters on the perimeter, or the earliest stages of ascent, of the music scene in Los Angeles in the early 1970's. It's all true. And we did go out there every night. . .","user":"fastfilmhh","rank":[28,29]},{"title":"Great Story","rating":8,"date":"13 January 2001","review":"The movie starts off with this prologue:<br><br>\"In Hollywood in 1972 upon Sunset, man The Strip was packed every night. Not with tourists, but Us, the people in the backrooms trying to make it. We were all out there looking for something because we knew that LA was a goldmine and that your life could change in 24hrs and thats why we came here.\"<br><br>The movie takes place within a 24hr period, giving insight into the lives of those trying to \"make it\". For such a short period, the viewer gets an awful lot of character development. One of the many things that makes this movie good is how one can relate to the characters, the realism. The soundtrack is also really well done, it totally sets the mood for each moment and has a tendancy to carry the viewer to where they are supposed to be.<br><br>I found the acting to be believable, and was glad to see some faces I recognized for other movies.  I would suggest anyone who is looking for a good movie check this out.","user":"Handcake","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"it really wasn't THAT bad...","rating":4,"date":"4 September 2003","review":"Well last night I watched Sunset Strip on Canal +, the movie channel, pretty much just to see Tommy Flanagan (Duncan Reed in this movie, Cicero in Gladiator, and Morrison in Braveheart...very different roles).  Before that, though, I read some reviews about the movie, and none were very flattering. After seeing it, though, I can't really understand why, for I quite liked it.  I mean it certainly wasn't as bad as the critics were making it out to be.  There are several different plot lines going on at once, all during a single day on Sunset Strip, and they're all connected to each other by at least one person.  It would be too confusing to explain it all, but I recommend it.","user":"winderhath","rank":[15,16]}]
