[{"title":"Decent, if not the most memorable Eastwood Western","rating":7,"date":"21 September 2006","review":"This is a pretty good though very simple Western and I am sure that the somewhat low ratings are due, in part, to the movie not being exactly what Clint Eastwood fans expected. In this film, he plays Joe Kidd--a decent sort of guy but not exactly as super-human as \"the man with no name\" in his Spaghetti Westerns. He's a lot like Eastwood in UNFORGIVEN because he seems not so super-human, except that he is a fundamentally decent person in JOE KIDD, whereas in UNFORGIVEN he's almost like a multiple personality (one nice and the other evil). The character Joe Kidd shows off his abilities here and there, but he isn't the amazing man with a 6-shooter as you'd expect from Eastwood either--though he sure does pretty well with a rifle or train (you'll have to see what I mean by seeing the picture). So overall, this film is very good but a bit subdued and more realistic than most of Eastwood's Westerns--plus at under 90 minutes, it's pretty short as well. One way I knew this was a pretty good flick was that my wife sat and watched the film with me--and she hates Westerns.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[37,43]},{"title":"Another Great Performance of Clint Eastwood, In an Above Average Western Movie","rating":7,"date":"14 January 2004","review":"Joe Kidd (Clint Eastwood) is a former gunman and bounty hunter, hired by the landlord Frank Harlan (Robert Duvall) to chase Luis Chama (John Saxon), a Mexican-American fighting for land reform. Along the hunting, Joe realizes that Frank's men are cold blood killers, and decides to help Luis Chama. He convinces him to fight for his rights in the court of justice. In the way back to the city, Frank's men try to kill Luis Chama. Clint Eastwood has another great performance, having a great duel with Robert Duvall. The story has some flaws, but anyway, maybe the greatest problem is the expectation generated by the name of John Sturges: we always expect another masterpiece from him, and maybe this is the reason why there are some underrated comments about this above average Western movie. My vote is seven.<br><br>\nTitle (Brazil): Joe Kidd","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[36,49]},{"title":"Classic Clint....","rating":8,"date":"31 August 1999","review":"Clint was already a veteran of many westerns by the time he made \"Joe Kidd\" and, though many don't find it among his best, it shows Clint as the Joe of the title doing what he does best.<br><br>As a ne'er-do-well who ends up siding with Luis Chama (Saxon), a wanted Mexican bandito, Kidd does battle with a group of bounty hunters (led by a suitably villainous Duvall) out for Chama's blood.<br><br>\"Joe Kidd\" is leisurely but not uninteresting; after all, any film written by Elmore Leonard has interesting points (just look at his later work).
