[{"title":"It's Hard to Know how to Rate This Film","rating":6,"date":"28 May 2019","review":"The production quality and acting are 100% excellent. The story itself is so implausible and just didn't make enough sense for me. On the other hand, the film maintains interest (certainly not boring). So...ten stars for top-notch production and acting. Minus five stars for a somewhat ridiculous plot. Then I added a star because it kept my interest until the end. I hope that helps!","user":"torijoyous","rank":[77,90]},{"title":"The trailer makes u believe that it is another film on infectious disease....","rating":7,"date":"28 May 2019","review":"But this is a solid thriller with enuff twists n turns. The acting is top notch.\nDo not read more about this film or the climax might get spoiled.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[92,120]},{"title":"Would have preferred a pandemic set in China tbh","rating":2,"date":"6 October 2019","review":"When I thought this was going to be a pandemic movie set in China, I got interested. But then it went down a completely different path. Very confusing plot. Far better ways for one woman to save another woman from abuse .........ie not by maiming them. How about reaching out and talking to her?!\nAlso, like another reviewer says, those buses in China look way too old.","user":"Coburgkiwi","rank":[23,27]}]
