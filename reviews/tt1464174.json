It is tough doing comedy and it is tough explaining why something is not to ones taste. Martin Lawrence made quite a lot of money with this series and not only a few would wonder how this could happen in the first place.<br><br>While this isn't complete waste (you might be able to laugh or chuckle at some of the silly jokes), this really is by the numbers and has no surprising element whatsoever to elevate it over other movies with similar themes. Not only that, it isn't really that well executed either. But what would you expect from a movie when it reaches its second sequel (part 3 that is)?! So while the (general) census suggests that you won't like the movie, you might see it otherwise (especially if you liked both prior movies)!","user":"kosmasp","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Borderline Unwatchable","rating":1,"date":"22 February 2011","review":"We get this every January/February, one movie comes around that reminds us all how good Oscar season was, 2 months prior. In 2009 we had Bride Wars. In 2010 we had When in Rome. This year it's Big Momma 3.<br><br>Absolutely nothing in this film was funny, nor I or the audience of about 40 people laughed once at this cataclysmic attempt at a comedy. Martin Lawrence sets the art of humour back an entire decade with this go-nowhere performance, he's practically sleep-walking through the entire movie, are things really that bad Martin? how badly do you need a check? the last thing i remember seeing him in was Wild Hogs 4 years ago and that was a masterpiece compared to this slop.<br><br>The plot circles around Lawrence's stepson (Brandon T. Jackson) being targeted by some Russian mafia for witnessing a murder. Lawrence's character is a respected FBI agent, is the only thing he can think of to hide his stepson; dressing him in drag and enrolling he and himself as members of an all girls school? <br><br>This obviously paves the way for a ton of teen-sex jokes, alas there are barely any attempts at this (got to keep that precious PG-13 rating guys).<br><br>A comedy that fails to get a single laugh out of some 40 people is a huge failure in my eyes. Let's not let this film be forgotten because it came out so early on in the year, critics at the end of 2011 need to be prepared to put this on their list of worst films of the year. If not - then any of the films that beat it will have to be spectacularly awful.","user":"limoncella-641-42235","rank":[24,33]}]
