[{"title":"A TRUE THRILLER!","rating":9,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"You would never know this movie was from a first time director. Filled with a cast of talented and familiar actors, this movie keeps you interested for the full length of the film. You really have to pay attention to keep up with all the deep psychological intricacies. I highly recommend this movie for everyone (above 10 years old, there is some language.)","user":"justingoins","rank":[20,33]},{"title":"Nice old tale","rating":5,"date":"11 October 2019","review":"Costumes and movie sets works well,\nshame the story is a bit too obvious","user":"camilleparpaleix","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"True","rating":2,"date":"8 October 2019","review":"This movie is very, very SLOW, there's nothing but talk and more talk, with more nothing. It goes nowhere from start to \"thank god it's over\" finish.","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[8,16]}]
