[{"title":"Men dont like female heroes. Hmmm","rating":1,"date":"8 December 2019","review":"Aliens, tomb raider, black widow, wonder woman, kill bill, underworld, to name a few. Men don't have an issue with these strong women because the story was actually good and had likeable characters.","user":"wilkinsonncl","rank":[742,912]},{"title":"\"Men don't wanna watch female hero's on the screen\"","rating":3,"date":"18 November 2019","review":"Elizabeth Banks said that men don't wanna watch female hero's on the big screen.\nIt has nothing to do with that, and if you think so you are just blind.\nIt's about quality, and good writing, acting....\nIf the movie is good it doesn't matter who is in it!\nBut when you do something as cheap as this and think it will make the big bucks you can't be that smart! And to wast money on this franchise...anyone who thought this would be a good idea must be fired! Movies like this is exactly what's wrong with Hollywood! No love!\nMake a good movie, but love into it! And it should work out fine! But just to complain about that men don't wanna watch it because there are females in the lead role is just embarrassing....","user":"dannehh","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Female perspective","rating":17,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"Hated it. Felt like I was being spoon fed woke tropes. I love Elizabeth Banks, but felt talked down to and \"at.\" That aside, I was surprised there wasn't more action. My husband fell asleep next to me in the theatre and a few people walked out. Really ruined a night out.","user":"meusvita","rank":[1,1]}]
