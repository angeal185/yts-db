[{"title":"The Original British Horror Omnibus/Anthology","rating":27,"date":"27 May 2001","review":"Dead of Night is responsible for so many films made in the horror genre, because it was the first that took a huge gamble and pieced several unconnected stories together within a narrative that loosely keeps them together.  Tales From The Crypt, Vault of Horror, Tales That Witness Madness, The House That Dripped Blood, Torture Garden, The Monster Club, Creepshow, Tales From the Darkside:  the Movie are just a few of the films that owe part of their existence to this little British film.  The frame story details how a man goes to the country for a weekend only to say he has been there before and met the people there before in his recurring dream. He is thrust into a discussion between those that believe in his dream and one lone doctor(psychiatrist) who seems able to explain all phenomena in a scientific way.  Each of the guests then in turn tells a story about their brush with the supernatural.  Most of the stories are very inventive(although by modern standards cliched as they have been copied many times)and entertaining.  Two of the stories really stand-out. The first is about a mirror that shows you a different room as you look into it, and the other about a ventriloquist with a split personality.  The other stories are good, and one is humorous(perhaps out of place but fun nonetheless).  Acting is solid throughout with Mervyn Johns as the man subjected to the same dream over and over again.  Richard Valk excels as the doctor, and Michael Redgrave is outstanding as the man able to give the gift of speech to a \"dummy.\"  Also of interest is the pairing of Basil Radford and Naughton Wayne form Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes.  They DO compliment each other so very nicely.  A wonderful, eerie film.","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[90,93]},{"title":"A prime example of a well-made horror-anthology","rating":27,"date":"27 July 2006","review":"Anthology n.: a collection of selected literary pieces or passages of works of art or music.<br><br>This classic horror-anthology from Britain's Ealing Studios is composed of four separate stories, composed around a group of strangers that is mysteriously gathered at a country estate where each reveals their chilling tale of the supernatural. But even after these frightening tales are told, does one final nightmare await them all?<br><br>The horror-anthology has proved a difficult sub-genre, usually made with only limited success, because it's notoriously difficult to get it right. If only one of the stories fails to deliver, the whole piece is dragged down. But this multi-part horror effort from Britain's Ealing Studios still proves to be very effective and justifiably still is one of the most revered and successful horror anthologies ever made. It features appearances by many of the best British actors of it's day, including Mervyn Johns, Ralph Michael, Basil Radford and Michael Redgrave. With four different directors at the helm, not all four segments are equally effective and are quite different in tone, but they are all good in their own right. The standout for me, not judged in terms of the best, but certainly the most frightening story of the four, is \"The Ventriloquist Dummy\" by Brazilian born Alberto Cavalcanti (he's simply billed as Cavalcanti), the only non-British director involved in DEAD OF NIGHT. Michael Redgrave plays a renowned ventriloquist who descends into an abyss of madness and murder, when his dummy takes on a life of his own. One of the most unsettling stories I've ever seen. <br><br>The somewhat less effective (if only slightly) mirror sequence by Robert Hamer shows something very scary can be achieved with very basic means. When Ralph Michael looks in the mirror, to his horror he keeps seeing the reflection of a dark Gothic room lit with candles, completely different from the room he's standing in and slowly, he begins to loose his mind. Ultimately, it is the extremely unsettling music score that makes it work. Basic but very effective.<br><br>As with most anthologies, it's difficult to keep track of the main interwoven storyline, because between the different stories we're told, your mind is still very much trying to grasp what you've just seen. This is probably why the genre became increasingly unpopular over the years. With the exception of \"The Ventriloquist Dummy\", don't expect anything particularly scary, but it did leave me quietly disturbed. The peerless British cast and the witty, slightly old-fashioned tongue-in-cheek dialog makes this very pleasant and appropriately unsettling viewing.<br><br>Camera Obscura --- 8/10 --- 10/10 for \"The Ventriloquist Dummy\"","user":"Camera-Obscura","rank":[43,45]},{"title":"Trapped in a Nightmare","rating":8,"date":"1 October 2014","review":"The architect Walter Craig (Mervyn Johns) drives to a farmhouse in the countryside of London and he is welcomed by the owner, Eliot Foley (Roland Culver), who introduces him the psychiatrist Dr. Van Straaten (Frederick Valk), his friend Joan Cortland (Googie Withers), his young neighbor Sally O'Hara (Sally Ann Howes) and the race car driver Hugh Grainger (Antony Baird). Craig tells that he has the sensation of Déjà vu since he had had a nightmare with them in that house but one lady is missing. However Mrs. Foley (Mary Merrall) arrives completing the characters of his dream.<br><br>The skeptical Dr. Van Straaten does not believe in supernatural but the guests tell supernatural events that they have lived. Grainger had a car accident and then a premonition that saved his life; Sally had met a ghost during the Christmas; Eliot and his wife had lived an evil experience with a haunted mirror; two golfers that loved the same woman and decide to dispute her in a game, but one of them dies and haunt the other; and Dr. Van Straaten tells the story of a ventriloquist with double personality that is dominated by his dummy. But when Dr. Van Straaten accidentally breaks his classes and the power goes out, the nightmare begins.<br><br>\"Dead of Night\" is an original horror tale that is certainly the source of inspiration to \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Tales From The Crypt\", \"Vault of Horror\", \"Creepshow\", \"Tales From the Darkside: the Movie\" where the screenplay discloses a main story and many segments. The final twist is totally unexpected and a plus in this little great movie. My vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Na Solidão da Noite\" (\"In the Solitude of the Night\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[16,16]}]
