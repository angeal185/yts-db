[{"title":"Great Film, Good plot and fast moving script, give it a chance.","rating":10,"date":"31 October 2012","review":"I just stumbled across this movie while sitting down for an afternoon on my day off. It was on TV. I thought here we go another boring typical American film, but after about half an hour I became hooked This is a seriously underrated film and one of the better films I have seen in a while.<br><br>It is very well acted, it has a good plot that keeps you hooked and it has a very good suspense level all the way through.<br><br>I was very pleasantly surprised that I felt compelled to find it online and make a review. Great film!<br><br>I have to add 3 more lines to make it a review lol. OK, basically it is a perfect sitting at home chilling out film that keeps you interested all the way through. I found it original and fast moving, I was not bored at any second. I would not be writing a review if I did not think it was really good, watch it yourself and give it a go, you will not be disappointed, one of the best made for TV movies I have seen, and a lot better than most of the brain numbing tripe that comes out of Hollywood these days. Jeri Ryan is a seriously good actress, much better than those young wannabes.","user":"pjones491","rank":[6,15]},{"title":"Worth a watch","rating":8,"date":"2 March 2018","review":"1st time I have seen Jeri Ryan without a Star Trek uniform and I have to suggest she was convincing. The plot is reasonably easy to work out but it does keep you watching throughout. Given it 8 based upon the enjoyment factor in watching this movie, there are a lot worse than this so it is really worth watching. I hope I haven't given anything away, good film, good plot, worthy of watching","user":"davyd-02237","rank":[0,2]}]
