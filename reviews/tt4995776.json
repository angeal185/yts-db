[{"title":"Outstanding Film","rating":8,"date":"15 December 2019","review":"Much better than I thought. It is very well done: True stories are always the best. This is very well cast and directed. Chris Evans and Michael Williams are superb in their respective roles. Greg Kinnear and the rest of the cast are very good as well. A must see.","user":"Easygoer10","rank":[18,19]},{"title":"I watched it twice!","rating":10,"date":"16 December 2019","review":"Once on my own, then with my husband, and I actually enjoyed it more the second time around. I saw many of the artistic touches that I had missed the first time, because I was distracted by the fascinating story. And performances that I thought might be over the top, actually seemed right the second time around. My husband really enjoyed it too!<br><br>Based on real events (reading about the real story was amazing after watching the film), which always makes for a more amazing story, IMHO. The real story was much more complex and went on over a longer period of time, so the filmmakers really had to fictionalize some things to fit it into one movie. (It could easily have been make into a mini-series.) I notice political trolls posting repetitive low-score reviews here. Ignore them.","user":"cmartinelli-12-663160","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Positive beautiful film, just when we all need it.","rating":9,"date":"31 July 2019","review":"This a moving film with exceptional performances by all actors involved. The direction and writing also hits good tones and avoids becoming a blow them up action movie. I really enjoyed this film from beginning to end. Chris Evans can act and there's a nice character arch with a few of the main players. Overall I really enjoyed this and will watch it again.<br><br>The fact that it's based on saving lives and happened during a really hard time in the Middle East and Africa (late 70's early 80's) makes it more poignant given the state of the world today.<br><br>Overall it's an A for me. I will recommend this to my friends and family. Enjoy :)","user":"gideonzack","rank":[297,431]}]
