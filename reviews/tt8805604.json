However Paula Abduls acting is horrific and almost ruined the movie. As soon as she comes on the scene, the reality that this is a movie sets in. Before she came into the movie, you were immersed in the story as it unfolded. Once her part came up, the horrible acting detracted from the plot, it was so obvious she was \"Acting\" it was almost unwatchable. Part of her problem is that the only thing that moves on her face is her teeth, her lips barely even move, so its really hard for her to use facial expression, like most actors and actresses, to convy meaning. In any event its a FREE movie that is worth watching, with LOTS of twist and turns.","user":"Jawillis93","rank":[5,9]}]
