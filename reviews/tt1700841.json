[{"title":"If this movie was a physical object, I'd kick it in the shin.","rating":1,"date":"9 September 2016","review":"This film is the equivalent to a sixteen year old, fairly privileged middle class boy, who has a baseball cap, curtains and t-shirt with the marijuana leaf on it yet has only ever smoked one spliff and made a huge deal about it. He thinks that smoking weed makes him relevant. So he needs to let everyone know he does it because there's nothing else that will appeal about him. Because he doesn't want to come off as a nerd, he lowers his intelligence and because he is too 'dumb' to actually be funny, he swears every 10 seconds to constitute humour. Possibly still faps over that one single poster of a tanned girl in a bikini that his Uncle bought him on his birthday because he was 'becoming a man, bro.'<br><br>It was described to my boyfriend as 'offensive'. It wasn't. It's vulgar. It's not even the funny kind.<br><br>I watched it last night with my boyfriend. Only us and a group of three 'lads' were in the cinema. Understand, we all laughed more during the adverts and trailers than we did the actual movie.<br><br>Within the first five minutes, I was embarrassed that I subjected my boyfriend and I to this and knew it was going to disappoint me.<br><br>Immediately, you're met with profanity. Now, once or twice to give the impression that hot dogs swear is fine. Swearing so much to substitute for lack of humour is just pathetic. Amidst the language, nothing funny was said. That's bad writing.<br><br>There's the joke that hot dogs are having sex with buns when they're put into the buns. That makes sense as a joke. It's a safe bet. This would have been modestly funny had it not been repeated throughout the whole film.<br><br>Yes, we get it. The sausage is a phallic shape and goes into a bun.<br><br>It really puts it to you within the first few minutes. A pack of sausages shaming each other about their size and shape. (BECAUSE THEY ARE METAPHORICAL PENISES DON'T YOU KNOW! HAR HAR!) Again though, not funny or clever. Then courting the lady-buns by being vulgar. Sausage calls bun a b***h.<br><br>It was clear that I'd sat us down for an uninspired and lazy flop.<br><br>I laughed modestly twice. I laughed out of obligation and embarrassment about 5 times.<br><br>There were a few clever bits. I am a fan of wordplay, so to see someone riding a bottle of 'Horseradish Sauce' was satisfying. The Frankfurters were played as Nazis who hated 'Juice' and their symbol was 'ff', made to look the Nazi alternative. Offensive, yes, but a little clever. I like offensive humour.<br><br>There were so many opportunities for actual humour it hurts. Nothing that could have been funny was displayed for more than a second.<br><br>There was a graphic rape scene.<br><br>I get that it sounds ridiculous when you hear that it's a douche forcefully sucking the juice out of a carton.<br><br>You might think I am being silly, but I swear to you, if it had been humans, it would have been pretty horrific.<br><br>Because it was a cartoon, you were expected to laugh at rape.<br><br>Ha ha. No. I don't think any of the viewers found that funny, even the 'laddish' blokes at the back didn't crack a humoured grin.<br><br>There's also this really awkward sex scene at the end where all the food engage. This is to really bring home the hot-dog/penis metaphor.<br><br>A taco has lesbian sex with a bread roll.<br><br>My fingers hurt from typing.<br><br>If you're 12 years old and completely new to sex, drugs and swearwords, you and your dude-bros will love this.<br><br>If you require a little more maturity and intelligence in your humour, AVOID. Otherwise you'll leave needing to take a shower and needing to withdraw from cinema.","user":"TanyaToad","rank":[285,479]},{"title":"Lousy, Loud, Unfunny Garbage","rating":1,"date":"19 August 2016","review":"If your idea of funny is excessive unnecessary profanity (it seems almost every line in the film contains it) inserted instead of actual humor, uninspired sex jokes, gross images with no pay off, and lame satire, then you may enjoy Sausage Party.<br><br>Allegedly, the inspiration for making this movie was the creators' desire to make the first \"adult\" 3D animated film. The interpretation of \"adult\" here seems to be the same as when it's used to describe porn--in other words, \"adult\" in the sense that you wouldn't want children to watch it but not in the sense that it shows much sophistication.<br><br>I have nothing against gross or low humor. But that's just it. There aren't really any jokes in this movie. Punchlines here are usually someone dropping an f-bomb. If you are not 11 years old, you may want something more. Visual gags are sometimes interesting, but do not induce laughter. The animation is well done and there are many celebrity voices involved, all of whom act well, but to what end?<br><br>Anyone familiar with the sort of movies Seth Rogen ends up in (toilet, sex, and drug humor) then you will have a fair idea of how this pans out. There are characters taking drugs and talking about \"getting baked.\" HA! HA! Items from the grocery store make crude remarks and simulate sex acts. HA! HA! Many of the characterizations simply involve people yelling a lot. HA! HA! There's brutal violence. HA! HA!<br><br>News emerging since the opening suggests that the artists working on this project were treated cruelly and unfairly. That's how I felt as an audience member.","user":"gogm-43400","rank":[419,725]},{"title":"My brain. It bleeds.","rating":1,"date":"28 February 2017","review":"Have you ever seen a movie so terrible you create an IMDb account *just* so you can warn the rest of the human race? How, god. HOWWWWWWWWW does this movie have even one good review.<br><br>Sausage Party is that scrawny, rape-stach'ed white dude who struts into the bar with an exaggerated swag, dirty wife-beater, backwards snapback and sunglasses on who takes the mortified look on your face and repulsed \"no\" as invitation to continue grandiose-performing, flexing his lack of muscles in your face, and repeating the F-word ceaselessly (ground me now, mom!! lulz!!). Eminem did it once, so...<br><br>When you signal to the bartender and try to escape, he follows you around... For an hour and a half. And just when you finally sigh in relief that your friends have come to save you, he hops directly in front of you and pulls down his pants.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate some good crude humor. Family Guy. American Dad. Archer. All fabulous examples of dangerously crass, raunchy humor being pulled off remarkably brilliantly.<br><br>But the word \"humor\" is more than a stretch here. (Wait, the douche is a douche? Is that what you said? No no, could you blatantly tell me that the douche is a douche? Because I didn't get that the douche is a douche.) Every racist stereotype under the sun is personified and paraded around as characters to make up for personalities that don't exist. The dialogue is flat and nauseatingly postured. The plot is predictable within the first five minutes and reeks of nuance-less anti-religious propaganda. <br><br>There is an actual, entirely unnecessary rape scene. <br><br>(Is rape funny to confederate-flag-sporting, sister-banging twats? Must have missed some memo.) I only made it up until the scene where a few of the characters come to a dirty Mexican bar (because, get it? Mexicans are dirty drunks??), but apparently the film continues its downward spiral right up to the point where they actually have an orgy. Take that, God.<br><br>I genuinely cannot imagine this movie being funny to anyone with an IQ over 20. Maybe to bro-tastic idiots with seven rape allegations and a hate-crime assault charge who only get by cause daddy runs a big corporation and knows how to throw a tantrum.<br><br>Please don't watch this bulls**t.","user":"gracerenaed","rank":[92,150]}]
