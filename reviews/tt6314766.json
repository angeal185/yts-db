[{"title":"boring","rating":4,"date":"28 January 2020","review":"A cricket named Apollo is a traveling entertainer who arrives at a luscious garden hoping to perform in the Queen's jubilee. Wendy the Wasp tricks him into a scheme to kidnap the queen. Wendy takes over as the new queen threatening the health of the garden.<br><br>The animation looks blocky and more like Legos. The dialogue is flat. It needs an injection of humor. The general premise is fine but the execution is lackluster. The worst of all is that it's rather boring. This is equivalent to a children's TV cartoon movie. It's probably fine for the smallest kids.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Sweet and perfect for young ones","rating":5,"date":"22 February 2019","review":"Very sweet and family-friendly. It's not as good as \"A Bug's Life\", but perfectly safe for your little ones.

The enchanting universe of the book and the delicacy of texts written for children is lost. Not to mention the pictorial touch very banal (unlike the TV series that reproduced the gouache style and was shimmering).\nPity. Maybe another director will take over the torch.","user":"franbelle10","rank":[1,2]}]
