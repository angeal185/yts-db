[{"title":"Terrible!","rating":2,"date":"30 November 2019","review":"A variation of the invisible friend/ghost advising the protagonist, Me and My Left Brain is just terrible. Unfunny banal dialogue combined with a thoroughly annoyingly unlikeable \"gentleman hero\" and a woefully inappropriate jazz band soundtrack (why for goodness sake?) make this intended Aussie comedy an ordeal to sit through. I generously awarded a 2 purely on the basis of a couple of attractive female leads and some nice urban locations, that intermittently pop up. Best avoided however and easy to see why it avoided any critics' screenings.","user":"spookyrat1","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"It's very Orstralian ... code for terrible","rating":1,"date":"24 February 2020","review":"I could only watch it for 18 minutes before I cut out and that's because I live in Orstralia ... so it was my patriotism that lasted that long. This is typical inner city Sydney bogan dreamtime stuff ... it is a better quality type of bogan than we experience in the minor capital cities in this country. I can imagine that the cafe set, who produced this epic and uninteresting work, were so proud there wasn't one outback or skippy scene in the first 18 minutes ... who knows what happened after that? Occasionally a good work comes out of Australia but for me, this isn't one of them.","user":"stevojaxon","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Spot on comedy and wit","rating":8,"date":"22 May 2019","review":"Fantastic cast and direction as well as superb writing by Alex Lykos, this film will have you laughing the whole way through.","user":"aqwang","rank":[5,16]}]
