[{"title":"Simply put - Honest and well made.","rating":8,"date":"24 January 2019","review":"From a technical viewpoint, very well executed - lighting and Cinematography were excellent. As for writing - every character in this is so well conveyed that the actors are able to do the story justice. Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job as expected - both him and Jonah Hill really showed some emotional range in their roles. Rooney Mara's performance was great and her chemistry with Mr. Callahan was palpable; although not nearly as much so as Mr. Callahan's screen chemistry with Donny. Even the time Jack Black and Joaquin have on screen together is magical - and weirdly enough I don't think they could've cast anyone better for Jack Black's character.<br><br>The movie ended up being more of an exploration of 12 step program than I expected, but by the end it actually gave me deeper insight and understanding of those struggling with alcoholism who seek help. Knowing tons of people who've gone through the program (recurring ones and success stories) it's given me a slightly deeper appreciation for anyone's struggle/experience.","user":"rickbobchristie","rank":[22,24]},{"title":"Exceptional","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2019","review":"Joaquin Pheonix and Jonah Hill give stand out performances in this amazing movie. Struggling to find anything these days to watch that even rates as value, this movie ticks all the boxes. The ending took me by surprise as the story is based on a true story and that made it even more worthwhile.\nAlthough there have been countless films made about alcoholics, their recovery and AA, this was different. This felt as if the viewer was there, not watching a movie with actors. Standout performance was Joaquin Pheonix. I have always thought he was a great actor but in this his is nothing short of brilliant.","user":"eyeintrees","rank":[24,28]},{"title":"This film will leave you emotionally satisfied.","rating":8,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"I just wrote a review for the first time, for 30 minutes, and my web page shifted.
