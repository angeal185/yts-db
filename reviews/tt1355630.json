[{"title":"A Moving Film That Makes Me Think About My Own Family and What's Important","rating":8,"date":"20 August 2014","review":"If I stay is a beautiful, moving film about a teenage girl and the life or death decision she must make. Mia is a teenage girl that has a wonderful, quirky family, a boyfriend who loves her to pieces, and a bright, ambitious future. But, all of that changes when she and her family are in a fatal car accident. While Mia's body is in a coma, her mind journeys back to all of her memories, triumphs, heart breaks and future. She has to make the decision on whether or not to fight and stay alive, or let go and leave this world. Will Mia stay? <br><br>I love this movie. It made me laugh, cry and it helped me to see all of the good in my own life that I should cherish, because you never know when it could all change. The cinematography is beautiful. Most of the film is filled with memories that Mia has and the way they are portrayed is very neat. The music is also beautiful. Mia is a cellist and a lot of the film focuses on her dreams of becoming a successful musician, so the film is filled with beautiful classical music. <br><br>My Favorite character is Mia played by Chloe Moretz. This film shows so many aspects of Mia's life, so it's easy to find something to relate to. She has a great passion for playing the cello and dedicates most of her life to it. She has difficulties relating to her parents and even her boyfriend since their musicals tastes are far more edgy than hers. She has to face her insane loss and she has to choose between many different things in life. There's something about her life that I think anyone can relate to, so she's a wonderful character. Chloe does a wonderful job portraying everything she's going through and she moved me to tears many times.<br><br>This film makes me think about my own family and everything I would do for them. It makes me think of my life and all the joys and sorrows I've faced. There was not a dry eye in the audience because this film provokes unique memories for every individual. I felt especially connected to Mia's family because I too have a younger brother and am very close with my parents, so I was very touched by Mia's situation. <br><br>I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18 because of the intense emotions and mature content.

And the fact that it seemed so genuine is exactly why I have not cried in a film so much since....\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\" Chloe Grace Moretz has already proved she is a force to be reckoned with, but by an accomplishment like playing the key character in a film that was made to be a tearjerker without coming across as completely laughable shows what a strong actress this young woman truly is.<br><br>Excellent, relatable script, wonderful direction and perfectly edited, the fact the a bunch of tween girls went \"Huh? What? That's the end?\" when the credits began to roll proved that R.J. Cutler knew exactly when to end this film at the precise moment. There was no need to overstay the welcome.<br><br>Make sure you have some Kleenex.","user":"DJRMewzique","rank":[133,187]},{"title":"The Cello & Guitar","rating":7,"date":"12 November 2014","review":"What sleight of hand! A moving love story between a high school cellist prodigy &amp; a rising rock star (slightly older). If I stay implies a choice is to be made. Perhaps there is. Who am I to say? If there is no one knows for sure, &amp; if they proclaim otherwise, they are a clear &amp; obvious fraud. This story revolves around this existential question &amp; successfully gives deep &amp; equal background for both. Many will flat out cry, &amp; I remember two instances of prolonged hard blinks, fighting off tears. <br><br>The maturation of Chloe Grace, as I call her, has been sublime to watch. I rarely watch Carson Daly, but remember the genuineness &amp; wit from his interview with her before an early hit movie. This was ingrained into my memory as someone to keep track of. She displays masterful acting, as the female lead. If I could buy stock in an actress, she would be my blue chip 1st choice. Everything about her is amazing, including her \"Joliesque\" lips. They are similar, yet all her own. <br><br>It gives me great pleasure to recommend this movie. It was enjoyable to see the clear chemistry between boy &amp; girl. They were successful in portraying the emotions of true love, the give and take, and sacrifices that make it endure. Chloe Grace Moretz outshines everyone else in the story. The supporting cast was good, but never had the chance the moment she was cast. The ending seems predictable but it was far from it. The director makes two equally compelling cases for her choice. Enjoy this movie about young adult love, and don't be surprised if you compare it to your own love stories. I rate this a very solid 7/10 stars on the back of Chloe Grace's performance. Others who enjoy this genre more than I may well rate it 1-2 stars higher. Chloe Grace continues to rise in her mastery of the art. <br><br>Knox D. Alford, III","user":"knoxiii","rank":[28,35]}]
