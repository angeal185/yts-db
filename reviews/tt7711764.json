[{"title":"The Pentagram of Boredom and Nothingness","rating":1,"date":"9 August 2019","review":"The movie is fine for about 15 minutes until the protagonists get caught inside the titular pentagram and you realize there won't be much more to the movie than that.<br><br>There's not much mystery about the evil entity as we see it a few minutes later. There's just some shaking and a badly designed CGI demon Asmodeus appears and drags the English guy to hell. Lucky for him. You're still stuck with an hour of the movie left to go and four people left alive. I wish the whole thing had just ended right then and there.<br><br>According to the synopsis these people are teenagers. Yeah, right. Well, at least they behave like they're 12 although they look like they're on the wrong side of 30.<br><br>Candles play a big part in the movie. The gut wrenching sequence of fetch the candle was so tense it had me on the edge of my seat. I thought they were dead for sure when they lost that last candle. But, hey, the junkie girl saved the day with her tiny tealight. Well done, girl. Who knew that small tealight was gonna burn as long as the foot tall and three inches wide massive candles.<br><br>I kinda thought that the bad guy was making the most sense the whole time. At least he was trying to resolve the situation. He should have just shot them all and left. But what the hell do I know. He was clearly the bad guy here.<br><br>What do you do when you get trapped inside a cursed pentagram? You go to sleep. What else would you do? Luckily no one had to use the toilet for the entire night.<br><br>On the whole this movie has much too little to offer. It looks cheap. It is shot in almost exclusively one location and that is just an ordinary room. The characters are weak and shallow. I found myself not really caring about what happens to them. The dialogue is monotonous and boring. Some of this is on the script, some on the wooden acting. There's almost zero tension. The horror element is not present. The CGI demon is not scary and is only a distant threat.<br><br>It probably seemed like an interesting idea for a low budget movie. Unfortunately that is all that remains. An interesting idea. The movie turned out to be an uninteresting dull affair. I would avoid this if I were you.","user":"bastian-kreuzer","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Don't even bother...","rating":2,"date":"5 November 2019","review":"Granted, the title of the movie and the fact that it is a horror movie was more than sufficient to make me sit down and watch the 2019 movie \"Pentagram\" from writer and director Steve Lawson.<br><br>When it was blatantly proclaimed that the movie was based on real events, that is where I first started to doubt this movie. And I managed to endure 31 minutes of \"Pentagram\" before I called it quits.<br><br>Why? Solely because the storyline bored me senseless. It was an abysmal and downright stupid storyline, and it didn't help much with having to suffer through a movie of four people trapped within the confines of a pentagram, unless they wanted to be mauled by a shroud of bad CGI.<br><br>This movie was just doomed from the very beginning. The storyline was so weak and pointless that it utterly failed to captivate me. And it didn't really help much that the movie was bearing a sense of overwhelming low-budget sensation.<br><br>As for the acting, well, let's just say that people were struggling with the script, plot and storyline, and they were given so very little to work with.<br><br>I am rating \"Pentagram\" a mere two out of ten stars, and I can honestly say that this is not a movie that I will be returning to finish watching. It was just downright ridiculous and boring. If you enjoy horror movies, there is an abundance of far more interesting choices readily available out there.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"One of the worst out there...","rating":3,"date":"9 August 2019","review":"One of the worst out there...\n3 stars just cause the idea was pretty neat,execution sucked...\nActing atrocious,effects terrible...In the hands of better crew with bigger budget,\ncould have been pretty decent...","user":"tchitouniaram","rank":[3,6]}]
