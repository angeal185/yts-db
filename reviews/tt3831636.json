[{"title":"Not the Worst","rating":3,"date":"19 January 2018","review":"I agree with other reviewers that the music is atrocious, just awful and ruins the movie. Also, I wish low budget films would STOP using a flashing screen. If you have to use a flashing screen to get a mood across, you've already failed. It's almost as if this director has more equipment to make a film than he needs and tries to use it to mask lack of creativity. <br><br>For an Independent film, it isn't the worst I've seen. I thought the film looked good and the acting wasn't horrible. The plot isn't that original and the movie is slow. But all in all not a bad effort.","user":"Fancytower","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Another boring 'cabin in the woods' type film","rating":2,"date":"1 July 2017","review":"SLASHER.COM is yet another indie horror going for the routine 'cabin in the woods' premise. It sees a young couple heading off for some remote rural fun, only to discover that the landlords of their holiday home are more than a little creepy. This one has some REALLY bad acting, and it's cheap and nasty looking to boot. The only (mildly) interesting thing about it is that the landlord couple is played by Jewel Shepard (RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD) and R.A. Mihailoff (who played Leatherface in, er, LEATHERFACE).","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"So bad it's good","rating":4,"date":"26 February 2019","review":"This is a really cheesy, poorly made movie with bad acting, but it's so bad that it's entertaining. Horror fans will probably understand what I mean by that.","user":"adeleysim","rank":[2,2]}]
