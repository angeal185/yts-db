[{"title":"Great movie wonderful story!!","rating":9,"date":"18 March 2020","review":"Was so hard to watch the police chief and the DA assume that just because you r black u r guilty. Was so impressed by the young black attorney--his drive even though he was subjected to brutality himself. Makes u look at death row in a very different light to be sure that those whom r there r truly guilty. Highly recommend this movie.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[56,67]},{"title":"Take some of the very negative scores with a grain of salt....the film is amazing.","rating":10,"date":"22 October 2019","review":"I saw \"Just Mercy\" a few days ago at the Philadelphia Film Festival and was blown away by the film....and I consider it to be one of the best movies I've seen in recent years. I could easily see the picture receiving several Oscar nominations---especially for acting. Imagine my suprise when I looked on IMDB and saw a score of 5.6 and some negative reviews! I am not exactly sure what this is all about and perhaps it's because there are some angry pro-capital punishment folks or some who simply hate a film with a mostly black cast. All I know is that the film is a quality production and kept my interest throughout.<br><br>The story is based on the work of Bryan Stevenson, a Harvard graduate who chose to move to Alabama and work for a small salary to help examine the convictions of men on death row...men who in some cases were not guilty at all. How could anyone NOT applaud this sort of thing?!<br><br>Overall, a brilliantly written film that made me sad and angry....and I love when a film effects me that way. The acting was top-notch, the story magnificent and the writing amazing. Just ignore all the negativity and see this one....you'll be happy you did. As for me, I'd consider this perhaps the best American film of the decade...it's THAT good.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[268,365]},{"title":"Totally shocking !","rating":8,"date":"1 January 2020","review":"I went into this film with no expectations at all, didn't even really know what the film was about, just saw the really exciting cast and I was in. Nothing would have prepared me for the totally shocking.....True Story......that was told in this film, it has stayed with me ever since I watched it.<br><br>I'm not sure I know enough words in the English dictionary to describe the total disbelief in the whole story and journey of Walter McMillian and Bryan Stevenson played by Jamie Foxx and Michael B Jordan respectively. Needless to say that I had never heard of the central case of this film involving Mr McMillian nor the incredible work of Mr Stevenson and his organisation. I think it definitely benefited my viewing experience because I really had no idea what was going to happen.<br><br>Wow what an emotional roller coaster in many respects. I have complete and utter disgust with the pathetic case that was brought against Walter McMillian in the first place...........basically the police needed to desperately catch someone so they intimidated another death row inmate to testify against an innocent man, so he could get a reduced sentence. Then there is the small fact of not using the witness accounts of black people who would prove Mr McMillian's innocence.........nor have any black people on the jury??!?!?!?<br><br>Then there is the other side of the emotion.............from disgust and almost anger, to just outright sadness...........this film is deeply horrifying and sad due to the nature of the subject matter...........the scene when Herbert Richardson gets executed, is a huge emotional punch to the gut..........it must also be said that the end credits are also just as educationally horrifying.............thankfully there are some silver linings!!<br><br>All of this going through my head is obviously due to the film being good........oh yeah did I not mention that..............why is the Imdb score so low???? The directing is solid but nothing mind blowing........it didn't need to be!!! The acting in this film is what just adds that extra special touch to elevate the film from good to great, for me!! Michael B Jordan, Jamie Foxx, Brie Larson all of whom are just great in the film..............no more to say!!!!!<br><br>Overall I am just shocked by the story, it took my breath away!! Being from the UK where the death penalty has not been accepted for quite some time..........it is completely dumfounding why its still used and accepted in the US?!?! Yeah those statistics at the end is almost vomit inducing. 80% out of 100 its a very good film highly recommend.............people need to hear this story, peoples eyes need to be opened.","user":"Lewis_Heather787","rank":[61,103]}]
