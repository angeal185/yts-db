[{"title":"a hidden pearl in the cheap movie bin","rating":9,"date":"14 October 2005","review":"My friend bought this movie out of the $5 bin at Walmart for a laugh. I was just expecting a stupid, mindless romantic comedy. What I found was a brilliant piece of work. The script is quite impressive. The story actually focuses on the \"Best Men\" like it says, not on the bride and groom. The whole film is chock full of lovable (and not so lovable) vibrant characters from nerdy little Teddy to Billy, the classical romantic hero, to Buzz the top-notch soldier with a heart of gold to Sol the lawyer you don't want to trust. Why had I never heard of this movie before?!? This definitely deserves a place on the shelf for anyone who loves comedy and good writing.","user":"GoddessArtemis85","rank":[21,27]},{"title":"A love story with enough action to keep the guys happy.","rating":10,"date":"20 May 2005","review":"Great movie..it has comedy, drama, unexpected events, love and real interaction among friends..people you know slightly and total strangers who interact and mesh well in the storyline. Good cast; and for all of you Dean Cain fans, he shows a buff chest. Drew adds an interesting twist to the bride-to-be. Luke Wilson is again great in his role, he gives real depth to his role. The male stars interact like they actually know their roles and the little quirks in their relationships just seems to draw you more into the story and Drew is believable as the bride to be and has a friendship with each of the 5 male stars. I seldom recommend movies, but this is definitely one I plan on seeing a few times just because it was written so well I know I probably missed a few things the first time.","user":"edtay","rank":[17,24]},{"title":"Uneven homage to 'Dog Day Afternoon'","rating":5,"date":"6 April 2014","review":"There is a bank robber known as Hamlet working the area who quotes Shakespeare during his robberies. Four friends Buzz (Dean Cain), Teddy (Andy Dick), Billy (Sean Patrick Flanery), and Sol (Mitchell Whitfield) have come to pick up Jesse (Luke Wilson) from prison released after around 3 years. They are all dressed in tuxedos going to Jesse's wedding with Hope (Drew Barrymore). Billy is dropped off at the bank who turns out to be the masked bandit Hamlet. Then the rest of the guys go into the bank. They are surprised by Billy's bank robbery, and join in. Sheriff Phillips (Fred Ward) surrounds the group, and turns out to be Billy's dad.<br><br>This is a poor copy of 'Dog Day Afternoon'. Billy is way too pathetic. The FBI is way too ridiculous. The other people in the group makes no sense. It's trying to be a quirky action comedy. Except that it's more stupid than funny. And it's a horrible idea to have Andy Dick who is hamming it up for the camera. I think the filmmakers are attempting at a Tarantino-like DDA movie but they don't have the skills to pull it off. It comes off as a weak homage to the great movie.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[3,3]}]
