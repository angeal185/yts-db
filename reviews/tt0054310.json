[{"title":"Well done . . . with a major flaw","rating":2,"date":"2 August 2002","review":"The British have made war and historical movies with an unrivaled consistency of quality, and Sink the Bismarck is no exception.  The details are meticulous, the casting first-rate (except for a hokey voice-impersonation of Churchill), and the battle sequences marked by accuracy and fine special effects.<br><br>This otherwise fine film is marred, however, by the false depiction of one of the major characters, Admiral Lutjens, commander of the Bismarck.  In the film, he is stereotyped as the typical Nazi - a Hitler sycophant, careerist and wild-eyed fanatic.  This was most certainly not the historical Lutjens, who was by no means a Nazi fanatic.  Lutjens was a naval hero from World War I, who served out of duty and dedication, not Nazi conviction. (Lutjens protected Jews under his command, and members of his family were in trouble for their anti-Nazi views.)  This is at complete odds with his depiction in Sink the Bismarck, which I find inexcusable, given that the above information was certainly available to the production.  In fact, an accurate depiction of Lutjens would have, in my opinion, added interest to the plot.<br><br>Nevertheless, Sink the Bismarck is eminently watchable and a fine addition to any war movie collection, if you bear in mind the above caveat.","user":"jacksflicks","rank":[84,104]},{"title":"Excellent movie","rating":19,"date":"19 December 2000","review":"For starters, this picture was thankfully filmed in black and white.  This is only appropriate for gray colored ships shooting it out in the North Atlantic.  The performers were, for the most part, convincing.  The movie got a little risky by using a fictional character (played by Kenneth More) for the lead role, and delving a bit into his personal life.  But it didn't get out of hand.  The movie takes just the right amount of time in developing and depicting the important events in the eight day life of the Bismarck.  I got the feeling that I was actually there and watching these events take place.  The movie is essentially accurate, based on accounts I have read in books; including one by the highest ranking German survivor. The depiction of the destruction of the British battle cruiser Hood was not exactly accurate, but I would rank that a minor point.  Getting the ship used in the movie to blow up the same way the Hood would probably have been more trouble than it was worth.  The bottom line is the ship was destroyed and only three crew members survived.<br><br>This movie is an excellent, no-nonsense portrayal of the short and dramatic life of the legendary German battleship Bismarck.","user":"thull1","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Gripping wartime British naval drama","rating":8,"date":"28 May 2006","review":"This movie is a well crafted and gripping depiction of British attempts to locate and destroy the German battleship Bismarck during World War II. It is told from the viewpoint of sailors aboard vessels from both sides and also the British naval command headquarters. I have little knowledge of naval history so am in no position to comment regarding historical accuracy.<br><br>Personally, I found most compelling the strategy and tension within the Admiralty War Headquarters in London, especially the personal depiction of the coordinator of this operation. Kenneth More convincingly plays Captain Jonathan Shepard, who lost his own wife earlier in an air raid and has a son who is himself a naval pilot involved in the battle to sink the Bismarck. Shepard's relationship with the lovely but very professional female naval officer Davis is well captured. There is also a moving portrait of Shepard's restrained response to unfolding news regarding his son. Though there is engaging battle drama at sea, it's the character portrayal of this stiff upper lip British officer that made the movie for me.","user":"roghache","rank":[16,18]}]
