You start to understand that, in spite of the hype, movies are not as good as they used to be -- more like production-line white-bread, all mapped out and pre-sold into the appropriate distribution channels before the first viewer ever even gets a look -- and that in the same time period, TV has come to surpass film in terms of quality and entertainment value.<br><br>And then every now and then you get a film like Midnight Special and for a brief moment you start to think this medium might someday recapture its glory days.<br><br>I am not going to tell the story or do anything which will diminish your experience, should you choose to see this film.<br><br>I will simply say that, if you believe the primary goal of a movie is to hold your interest and entertain, this one does the job from the first frame to the closing credits.<br><br>Boy is that refreshing! <br><br>The actors -- not name actors -- were excellent.<br><br>The special effects were mind-boggling, especially for an indie.<br><br>The script breaks (or bends) some rules of conventional narrative but otherwise is so tight you could use it for a drum solo.<br><br>Highly recommended.","user":"A_Different_Drummer","rank":[258,364]},{"title":"Something different","rating":10,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"Different, smart, well written film with superb acting. This kept me engaged and interested throughout and was different to all other movies I've seen recently. Deserves a much higher rating than what it has on here.","user":"rebecca_shaw7","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"How a great indie scifi should be done.","rating":9,"date":"7 June 2018","review":"Up there with films like The Signal this was a indie scifi fans dream.Far too many big budget scifi rubbish on our screens over the years , not going to name anything in particular but its the same old same old tag line and Im sure anyone reading this will now exactly what Im talking about .","user":"pdwhitten","rank":[10,11]}]
