[{"title":"The Con Is On","rating":7,"date":"16 April 2001","review":"A movie that proves that what you see is not necessarily what you get, as a mother/daughter team con one well-heeled member of the opposite sex after another, in `Heartbreakers,' directed by David Mirkin and starring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Yes, the con is on, as mom takes em to the altar, daughter seduces em (getting caught in the act by mom, of course), and mom settles for a divorce and some big bucks.  For the women, it's like having the goose that laid the golden egg, and all is going well; the bucks are rolling in and Cupid's path is being littered in their wake with the carnage of the men they've despoiled.  Then Page (Hewitt), much to the chagrin of her mother, Angela (Weaver), decides it's time to strike out on her own and take down a score for herself.  But as fate, luck, chance or what-have-you would have it, at that moment the IRA steps in and not only wipes out their bank account, but hands them a bill for back taxes that far and away exceeds the amount already confiscated.  At that point, what's a girl to do, but find another mark.  Only this time, it has to be one rich beyond their wildest dreams.  And with that, the hunt is on.<br><br>\tAn amusing, and at times hilarious comedy, the fact that it works as well as it does can be attributed to two things, by category:  Weaver and Hewitt; and Ray Liotta and Jason Lee.  For what the movie lacks in originality is made up for with the performances of the aforementioned four.  As far as the women, such a pair of femmes fatales you've never seen; Hewitt has it and flaunts it, but she's still overshadowed by the gorgeous Weaver.  Looks aside, however, what really makes it cook is their shared if-you-see-me-comin'-better-step-aside, take-no-prisoners attitude, a Mae West meets Kate Hepburn persona that gives their con its zing.  Weaver plays it to the hilts, saucy, seductive and sharp as a tack.  And not to be outdone by her co-star, Hewitt stays right there with her, by giving a performance that makes you believe that this is a young woman who could actually pull this stuff off.  Together, their antics on screen are reminiscent of Lemmon and Curtis in `Some Like It Hot,' or Caine and Martin in `Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.'  There's a refreshing lack of pretentiousness about them that really makes them fun to watch.<br><br>\tAs for the guys, Liotta gives a sharp performance as Dean, a guy with a hard edge and a soft spot for Angela, and Lee does a notable turn as Jack, a regular guy who finds himself in the eye of Angela and Page's storm.  Lee has an especially engaging screen presence, and some of the most memorable moments of the film are in the scenes he shares with Hewitt. <br><br>\n\tLast, but far from least, Gene Hackman scores some guffaws as billionaire tobacco magnate William Tensy.  He gets a bit tongue-in-cheek with his character, who with his tobacco stained teeth and smoker's cough is at the same time hilarious and repulsive.  When Angela demurs his attempted kiss, you'd swear you can smell his breath and the reek of smoke from his clothes. And you have to give Hackman credit for this one, because to play this role all vanity had to be stuffed in the closet for the duration. <br><br>\n\tThe supporting cast includes Anne Bancroft (Barbara), Jeffrey Jones (Mr. Appel), Nora Dunn (Miss Madress), Julio Oscar Mechoso (Leo), Carrie Fisher (Mrs. Surpin), Ricky Jay (Dawson's Auctioneer) and Elya Baskin (Vladimir). Director Mirkin must be given credit for his imaginative approach to some fairly unoriginal material, and for making up for it's lack of substance by extracting some top performances from his actors.  The real strength of `Heartbreakers,' however, is the fact that it never takes itself too seriously.  If you look deep enough, you may find some insight into human nature, but for the most part this is a movie that was made with nothing but fun in mind.  It's entertaining, there's some laughs and some nice moments, and it's easy on the eyes.  If you let it, it's a movie that will let you off the hook for awhile and show you a good time.  And for my money, that's not such a bad deal.  I rate this one 7/10.","user":"jhclues","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"Good old-fashioned dirty-minded fun, even when Jennifer Love Hewitt isn't on screen.","rating":7,"date":"20 July 2002","review":"Director David Mirkin used to write for \"The Simpsons,\" which explains why Danny Elfman did the main theme for \"Heartbreakers\" - a movie that, success-wise, has more in common with The Greatest TV Show Ever than with Mirkin's earlier \"Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion,\" and not just because Shawn Colvin makes a guest appearance here as well. Don't get me wrong, it's not nearly as clever - but it IS often as funny. Plus you get to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot.<br><br>Mother/daughter grifter duo Sigourney Weaver and JLH are on the verge of splitting up, but agree to do One Last Big Score (isn't it always the way) in order to get out of trouble with the IRS and part sufficiently loaded; Gene Hackman, as a chain-smoking pensionable zillionaire (\"His liver spots are positively luminous\") is their mark in Palm Beach and also the source of a lot of the fun. In fact, he and an under-used Ray Liotta come close to swiping the film from the leads, but Sig and Love make a good team, each complementing the other - Weaver's the better actress, but Hewitt holds her own; and though the former's attractive, the latter - even in her blonde disguise - is smokin' (something the film never forgets - you get to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot).<br><br>The Robert Dunn/Paul Guay/Stephen Mazur script won't win plaudits from the PC brigade; \"Heartbreakers\" is often a farce in a good sense, but the female characters come off for the most part not as morally upright as their male counterparts (though Hackman's moneybags is by far the most repellent person here). Pacy for sure, and often funny if not always in what the late British DJ Kenny Everett's Cupid Stunt character called \"the best possible taste\" (witness the oral sex gags early on), there's a distinct slowing down as the tale unfolds and Jen's growing feelings for a potential mark (Jason Lee) makes it more sentimental than cynics would like; the first half of the movie is funnier and edgier than the second. But you get to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot.<br><br>In the end, \"Heartbreakers\" has a tone a bit too much like the likes of \"Are You Being Served?\" to be a must-view for all; the movie sometimes comes across like a \"Carry On\" film. Only with a budget. And good performances. And decent writing. And funny. And with a fine soundtrack. Okay, so it's not much like a \"Carry On\" film, but it does make for a good two hours' watching; Weaver fans will get a particular kick out of her rendition of \"Back In The U.S.S.R.\", and Hackman fans will enjoy seeing him upstage everyone except for Hewitt's anatomy; I gave this 7 out of 10, but I should have given this an 8 purely on that count. This is one movie that lives up to its title.<br><br>And did I mention you get to look at Jennifer Love Hewitt a lot?","user":"Victor Field","rank":[48,57]},{"title":"So cool to watch again and again!!!!!!","rating":10,"date":"29 April 2006","review":"What a fabulously funny film!!!! Jennifer love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver work so well together, and the emotional scenes in the film are so believable. Plus looking at Jennifer love Hewitt in a series of brightly coloured micro dresses is fabulous. You can really tell she is turning from a little bitch to a sensual beauty who cares. Sigourney Weaver is so funny, I was in stitches listening to her as \"olga\". What I did find confusing though was her constant hair colour and length change. One minute its long and red, the next like a bob and blonde, was it a wig, if so where was the indication!!!! Her rendition of \"back in the U.S.S.R\" was hilarious yet catchy. Ray Liotta, Gene Hackman and Jason Lee as the love-struck victims are perfectly cast.In the scene where Jennifer Love Hewitt is on the bed \"sleeping\", and opens her eyes crying, I was and still am choked when I see it. Fab film folks 10/10","user":"inga_cutebaby_ella","rank":[47,57]}]
