[{"title":"Nope","rating":1,"date":"24 January 2019","review":"I saw no merit in this 'film' whatsoever. Amateurs with a camera and kids in cheap hallowe'en masks.\nWouldn't have bothered commenting but for , once again, an obvious planted 10/10 review.\nI hate dishonesty worse than bad cinema.","user":"kfckidkfckid","rank":[24,36]},{"title":"Nope.","rating":2,"date":"2 March 2019","review":"Nothing happens. Ever. The old \"someone with a Halloween mask is looking in our window\" scare. Never figured out why anyone with a house in the woods with every light on never has curtains.\nConsidering that was the \"scariest\" thing to happen in the whole movie, I was disappointed.","user":"auntiebuddha","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"Promising then throws it all away.","rating":3,"date":"24 January 2019","review":"This started off slow and only really picked up in the second act when it started to show some promise. Sadly it never goes anywhere.\nAfter it ends you feel like there should be another half an hour to actually tell the story of what happened.\nInstead there is too much \"b roll\" and no actual film going on.\nShame as from a technical stand point it was ok (as far as found footage films go) but it was let down by the writing.","user":"Lost_Highway","rank":[18,27]}]
