[{"title":"simple fare","rating":9,"date":"3 February 2008","review":"This is both typical and untypical Ozu - typical in that its a simple story with a typical simple point (but of course told with deceptive skill and complexity), but its unusual in that its set among the upper middle classes, not the 'average' Japanese family of most of his movies.<br><br>The story is straightforward - an unhappy marriage between a rich girl and her successful but relatively low born husband. She can't hide her contempt for his dullness and rustic ways. He is unhappy but never argues back, just finds his own little ways of getting pleasure out of life. A series of incidents finds them having an unexpected late night simple meal (green tea over rice is essentially 'leftovers' when nothing else is available) and suddenly she realizes she loves him after all.<br><br>As always with Ozu, the richness is in the characters. Taeko, played by Michiyo Kogure is spoiled and insensitive, but a compelling, capricious character. Mokicho (the husband) under his dull salary-man skin is really a sensitive, caring man. The other characters are all vivid and memorable, especially Setsuko, the headstrong niece. There are also wonderful set pieces, usually involving Taekos friends, having little girls nights together, gossiping about their husbands and plotting marriages.<br><br>With Ozu a brief overview of his movies always makes him sound dull. But in reality this is funny, moving and compelling. Its not first rate Ozu - the theme of the movie is too straightforward and obvious, the ending a little too neat and tidy. But second rate Ozu is still head and shoulders above almost any other drama. The humanity of the characters shines through, creating a little world we can sink into. The wonder of Ozu is that we are not observing characters, we are sitting with them, in the middle of their lives.<br><br>I can't help but compare this to Naruse's 'Repast', another movie about a marriage in trouble, where the wife cannot hide her contempt for her husband, but in the end they both realize why they love each other. Naruse was more of a pessimist, so the reconciliation at the end of Repast is both happy and sad, as the characters realize that that living together, even without a great love, is better than being lonely. In Ozu's more traditional world, the couple (product of an arranged marriage) eventually find love, even after many years of marriage by the acceptance of each others little foibles. Taeko learns that simple things can be as pleasurable as luxury. It seems a little trite, and it would be in another film makers hands, but somehow Ozu finds depths of wisdom even in such clichés.<br><br>The irony is that Ozu was a lifelong bachelor, yet he made perhaps the best movies ever made at examining families in detail. If I had my way I'd put this movie and 'Repast' as compulsive viewing for all engaged couples. It would be more effective than any pre-marriage course!","user":"GyatsoLa","rank":[33,36]},{"title":"A Good Ozu Film","rating":8,"date":"26 September 2009","review":"This film mines much of the territory of Ozu films, including the complex relationships of the major characters, the resistance of a young lady to agree to an arranged marriage and the aesthetics of everyday living amongst the working classes. The film has two main stories, parallel to each other, running through it: Takeo, who is bored with her husband who is very simple in his needs, lies to him so she can go to a spa with her friends. Their niece, the pretty Setsuko, is the one who is resisting the arranged marriage meeting. How the two stories bisect is typical Ozu, creating conflict and anger. This film is not as good as much of Ozu's output at the time, but that includes \"Tokyo Story\", \"Early Summer\" and \"Late Spring\", which are standout classics. The great Setsuko Hara is not in this film and the equally great Chishu Ryu is a bit player, but I think you'll still find this film worthy of your time. If you haven't seen an Ozu film, start with \"Tokyo Story\" or \"Late Spring\" (others too, including \"Good Morning\" and \"Autumn Afternoon\") but give this a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.","user":"crossbow0106","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Husband and wife are like the taste of rice with tea","rating":8,"date":"10 April 2005","review":"Its about a rich family and arranged marriages. Taeko is in an arranged marriage which is not so successful, they communicate very badly and she lies to get out and do fun things with her friends. For her it is easy to lie to the husband as she thinks he is very stupid. Her niece don't want to go on a arranged marriage meet, but decide for herself who she wants to marry probably a sign of the times, the transition from traditional to modern Japan. In other ways also the modern is juxtaposed with the traditional, they wear kimonos as naturally as western style clothes. And her sister is working in a top position as a designer.<br><br>As another IMDb reviewer said this is most interesting because of the charming characters. The elegant, but a bit arrogant and selfish Satake Taeko (Kogure Michiyô) had me spellbound from beginning to end. All characters are interesting and the interaction and communication between them make up the movie.<br><br>The city itself takes up a small role in the movie as well, something I like a lot. Editing also is very clever at times. Its never ordinary or dull.","user":"Atavisten","rank":[20,26]}]
