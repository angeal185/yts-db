[{"title":"Ridiculously fun and entertaining.","rating":3,"date":"3 April 2016","review":"Literally the film is about a spaceship that arrives in Arizona, 1873, to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region. A posse of cowboys and natives are all that stand in their way. Daniel Craig teams up with Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde to save the day. Problem? Nope. \"Cowboys &amp; Aliens\" is a blast of summer blockbuster fun, delivering fun visual effects, consistently entertaining action, and fun dialogue to spice up the fun. This is the kind of film you would expect to be god- awful, but turns out to be super fun and enjoyable from start to finish. None of the actors try too hard to be serious, knowing what kind of film they're in. And producers Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard also understands what audiences are going to want out of this film. They nailed it. This film delivers exactly what it needed, crafting a fun and stupid movie that everyone will find somewhat enjoyable.","user":"dom-lerose-8","rank":[49,55]},{"title":"Unexpected Brilliance","rating":9,"date":"15 January 2016","review":"I had heard the negative reviews despite my high hopes for a new different perspective. So with such a negative feel about it I was so enthralled with it. Blown away with this mix of genre that worked beautifully and the cast was amazing. From start to finish I loved it. It started as a genuine Wild Western movie with a very slight hint of something just not quite right. If I had seen this movie without knowing the title and synopsis like I did with From Dusk Till Dawn which had me incredulous with its amazing twist. I had no clue as to what was to follow. Daniel Craig was unbelievably perfect as the confused clueless gun slinger struggling to remember his identity. Ford was exactly the hardened war veteran you wanted that had to think on his instincts despite what he was seeing. The originality was insane. The past meets the unimaginable and the necessary meeting of 4 different groups of humans in the 1800s just to defeat the darkness is something to revel in. If you love westerns and sci fi I defy you to not enjoy this.","user":"markzipperboy2","rank":[33,39]},{"title":"How can anyone not like this movie?","rating":10,"date":"11 December 2014","review":"It is well acted. It is well produced. It has a star-studded cast and a fun twist on sci-fi action thrillers. <br><br>Here's what you do for a \"summer fun\" movie: Combine a bunch of cowpokes with a hostile alien race, set it in a time period where the human race has no concept of time or space travel. Then let Spielberg do his thing.<br><br>I've had fun watching this film several times. As with all good flicks, there's always something you missed the first, second and third times. This isn't really meant to be serious science fiction. It's meant to be an entertaining romp that mashes up the western and sci-fi genre, and it throws in just enough action and special effects to make up for a so-so script.<br><br>If you watch this and don't like it, then you don't like watching fun movies. <br><br>This. Was. Fun.","user":"Mischief810","rank":[65,82]}]
