It resembles the Lynch series, (\"Eraserhead\" actually), though Lynch uses more colour... I recommend it to all the freaks (lest they should go nuts like Max...) and to the movie freaks, that like to admire pure art. the number i've written is PI, with the precision of 216 decimals... and don't fool yourselves, it doesn't have any pattern, it just runs infinitely...","user":"andyxpert","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Indie film at its best","rating":10,"date":"15 May 2000","review":"'Pi' is independent filmmaking at its best.  Without the constraints of the studio/corporate system, Aronofsky and Gullette created a film that is bizarre, intelligent, and unlike anything that came out of Hollywood in the 1990's.  Who would have thought to blend Wall Street, the Kabbalah, computer science, Go, number theory, and the most fascinating number in the universe in a solute of obsessive-compulsive, paranoid genius and then strain through gritty B&amp;W cinematography and hyperkinetic editing?  The mixture is definitely not for everybody, but I certainly loved it.<br><br>Plus the soundtrack (featuring Orbital, Clint Mansell, Aphex Twin. Gus Gus, Spacetime Continuum, and other techno talents) just flat-out rocks.","user":"stharward","rank":[289,363]},{"title":"Finding God through the ancient language of Mathematics","rating":9,"date":"9 November 1999","review":"Pi is the oddest, hippest, most chilling account of the descent into the abyss.<br><br>Following mathematical clues derived from an analysis of the stock market, Maximillian Cohen begins his descent into madness as he attempts to discover the nature of everything through the peculiar numerical entity known as Pi.<br><br>Thrilling enough, but then combine with generous amounts of Kaballistic mysticism, black and white footage and a soundtrack like an audible fractal, and you have a sensory snare which drags you along for the ride into Max's impending breakdown.<br><br>Obsession has never been so exciting.<br><br>Pi is an utterly gut-wrenching, mind expanding phenomema. If you have ever wondered about the universe, God or the nature of insanity, Pi will take you where you don't want to go.","user":"cultovone","rank":[225,299]}]
