Not only is it a festival favorite, but it deals with a lot of very powerful subjects all in a nice, tidy but rough around the edges piece.<br><br>While it is a 'Fight Film,' there is a lot more going on than one would think. I don't want to reveal any of the great plot points but I will say this, 'Watch this movie!' Nora, played by Shannon Murray is a master study in dealing with the harsh realities of life. How she does it is told in a brilliant and loving fashion by Director Bailey Kobe.<br><br>If you're in the mood for a great film, take a look...","user":"asaprods","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Visually stunning and well written","rating":10,"date":"28 February 2020","review":"Powerful story and outstanding performance.
