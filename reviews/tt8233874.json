[{"title":"Very funny and charming.","rating":9,"date":"31 May 2019","review":"I was surprised by how well Extra Ordinary worked. It's full of little surprises and great performances. Apart from one bad choice (the entire character played by Claudia O'Doherty: an extremely unfunny stock character who seems to have wandered in from an Adam Sandler movie), Extra Ordinary is consistently smart and fun.","user":"mymangodfrey","rank":[47,62]},{"title":"Funny and heartfelt","rating":8,"date":"19 October 2019","review":"I cannot believe that the first review I see says this was boring... not at all...\nA black comedy Irish in its soul! Very entertaining!","user":"vmalarcon","rank":[26,33]},{"title":"Terrific Fun","rating":9,"date":"24 July 2019","review":"Rose (Maeve Higgins) has given up her calling as a psychic after a terrible accident and is making her living as a driving instructor in rural Ireland. Martin (Barry Ward) is a widower with a troublesome ghost of a wife and an increasingly sassy daughter, Sarah (Emma Coleman). When he asks Rose for her help exorcising the ghost, she at first refuses, but then a well past his prime rock star (Will Forte) decides he needs the blood of a virgin to renew his vows to Satan in order to revitalize his long-dormant career, and Sarah is just who he's looking for; or is she?....\nThis is a very funny movie about ghosts, lost hopes, redemption and everything in-between; Forte is hilarious as the over-the-top Christian Winter, but it's Ms. Higgins who carries the film with humour, grace and rather an alarming amount of moxie. Throw in some sight gags referencing other horror movies along with just out-there craziness (deer head crying tears of 7-Up - \"it's Mummy, she always loved 7Up!\"), and this is a film that should get a wide audience everywhere. Extraordinary, indeed.","user":"alisonc-1","rank":[33,45]}]
