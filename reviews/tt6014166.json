It made us cry.","user":"marcimdb10","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"An ENJOYABLE HOLIDAY FILM","rating":9,"date":"11 November 2018","review":"So for me the story was fine. Parents and a guardian angel who is trying to encourage a teen daughter to understand the real meaning of the holidays. I have to say that the men in this movie were really attractive. The guys were not afraid to show emotion and I was moved by the performances. Look it is not the most in depth movie but if you are wanting to veggie out with family during the holidays this is perfect. No big story line. Easy to follow. ENJOYED IT-- I am from the Tampa bay area and I loved seeing snow scenes.","user":"allisonjanegarity","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"This is cheerful and worth watching.","rating":9,"date":"11 November 2018","review":"What I like about this Christmas movie is that they story was very grounded in reality. A young LA teenager is struggling with the loss of her Mom during the holidays. She is dealing with an empty feeling and is resentful. At the end of the movie she has a real transformation and she seems to come around. My family liked it. I enjoyed seeing Jerry &amp; Ravin having fun in the snow filled mountains. Sorry for the other folks who watched it and did not see what we saw or got from this cute little film. I thought that the movie was pretty well acted considering what I see on Hallmark and Up Tv. The look and tone of the film was solid.","user":"ruthjennifer","rank":[9,13]}]
