[{"title":"There's not stoppin' them","rating":10,"date":"25 August 2006","review":"You have just finished watching Breakin' - and feel like you want to go out onto the streets and find a group of people to dance with, then you realise that your about 20 years too late and the only gangs hanging around your neighbourhood are not interested in dancing.<br><br>Your spirits drop, realising that you can never get back your youth...<br><br>But then you remember, you also own Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo and you get back on your sofa and spend another couple of hours with a friendly group of Break Dancers who only want to support their local amenities... They don't use violence (apart from perhaps some suggestive popping' and lockin' moves), they don't use guns or drugs and they even get their rival street gang to kiss and make up with them in order to protect their hood from the City Suits.<br><br>Where else could you get a story line like that? Take it for what it is - great music, great dancing, great fun!","user":"hfennemore","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Off The Heazy!!","rating":9,"date":"9 September 2002","review":"Let's get one thing straight......If you haven't lived the Hip-Hop lifestyle, you cannot properly judge this movie in ANY negative manner. I was a teenager in the mid 80's and danced (electric boogie) in the streets and roller rinks of NY for 4+ years. I went to LA when I was 16 and battled other dancers on Venice Beach, which was the MECCA of electric boogie street dancers.<br><br>This movie was the best of it's kind!! Michael \"Boogaloo Shrimp\" Chambers was arguably the best in the craft and shined in both this movie and it's predecessor. Don't view this movie looking for a wealth of incredible acting, but do watch it for some amazing street dancing and a very likeable cast with a good storyline. I LOVED this movie and still do. Every time I see it, I'm transported from my office back to my carefree teenage years, where my biggest problems were what to wear when dancing and what music I was going to boogie to!<br><br>I'm popping and throwing waves as I write............","user":"LARRYLOVE711","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"Unbelievably Ridiculous","rating":4,"date":"22 February 2002","review":"Nothing in the world can prepare you for Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo.  No description does it justice, no warning truly gives you an idea of what you are in store for.  Few movies are as bizarre, yet oddly compelling at the same time.<br><br>Because one movie wasn't enough to contain these people; Breakin 2 picks up where the first movie picks off.  Or so I assume, I haven't seen Breakin, but the three main characters Kelly (Lucinda Dickey), Ozone (Adolfo Quinones) and Turbo (Michael Chambers) are the same.  In this installment the trio try to save a youth center named Miracles from the clutches of evil (read: white and unhip) government bigwigs who want to bulldoze the unsafe building and make way for a new shopping center.<br><br>It's fortunate that the trio live in an alternate universe in which breakdancing can solve all of society's ills.  No exaggeration here; over the course of ninety-four boogie filled minutes, dancing stops bulldozers, pays bills, ends gang wars, and even cures the ill and the infirm (One person bounds out of the wheelchair in jubilation; apparently they simply forgot they could walk).  There is so much dancing in this movie that it frequently appears that the plot is intruding on it, and not the other way around.  These are people who work a hard day's living dancing then go home and blow off some steam by, what else, dancing.<br><br>This isn't a poorly made movie in the traditional sense; it isn't full of continuity holes or bad special effects.  For all its silliness, it probably succeeds in exactly the way it wanted to; as a movie about people who love breakdancing so much they'd rather do that than say, eat, sleep, converse, or share meaningful human contact.  More than fifteen years later, it's terribly quaint, and hilariously dated.  But it has a city-wide dance party, a hospital-wide dance party, a dance-filled climax (a shock, I know) and two performances by Ice-T.  What more do you want?  Do yourself a favor and rent this movie.  By the end, you'll be dancing too.","user":"Mr. Pulse","rank":[30,36]}]
