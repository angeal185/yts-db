[{"title":"You will cringe, laugh, cry and hold your breath in shocked disbelief and utter horror: one of the most intense and most touching war films I have ever seen","rating":9,"date":"14 November 2015","review":"There's only a handful of so called \"war films\" I consider to be films about the actual reality of war. HBO's mini-series 'Generation Kill' is probably the most realistic when it comes to the depiction of modern warfare - but 'Kajaki' (also known as 'Kilo Two Bravo') gives it a run for its money: this criminally under-seen masterpiece should be considered a modern classic. The production values are fantastic; the cinematography, the script and the direction are absolutely flawless - but you won't notice them. What you will notice is the outstanding ensemble of actors, portraying characters in a way you forget you're watching a movie. They will make you cringe, laugh, cry and hold your breath in shocked disbelief and utter horror.<br><br>This film had me literally on the edge of my seat the entire time, but what really grabs you by the gut is not just the suspense and the horror; it's the relationships between these soldiers and how they look out for each other. How close men become when their lives depend on each other has probably rarely been depicted on screen with the intensity and no-bullsh√Æt, keep-it-real attitude as is the case here. And knowing that what you're seeing actually happened only adds to the experience (for this film IS an experience). Definitely not the kind of war film that you come across very often. Superb. 9 stars out of 10.<br><br>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br><br>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br><br>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/","user":"gogoschka-1","rank":[68,80]},{"title":"Epic, Real, Impeccable Masterpiece!","rating":10,"date":"7 March 2016","review":"I like war films. Not because I like war, but since it happens I'd like to know more about it. This film isn't like \"Platoon\", \"Hamburger Hill\", \"Saving Private Ryan\" or any other such \"Movies\". This film isn't like a movie at all. It is so real that it sucks you into every moment as though you were actually there. After the character development, I was literally on the edge of my seat, with my elbows on my knees with my hands holding my cheeks. I saw it at home, so thankfully I was able to pause it to make a cocktail; I needed one because it was that serious. <br><br>Other war films I have seen and liked; they seem like popcorn fodder compared to this one. I was so engrossed in the progression and actually became angry at war itself like I have never felt before. I wasn't aware it was a true story until the end credits and I cried then. I was emotional throughout the film, not even knowing this. It was so real that I talked not only to myself, but to the characters I was watching.<br><br>Thankfully, there were no \"shaky cameras\" like \"Inglorious Bastards\", making it easy to concentrate on what was really going on. What was going on was disturbing and humbling at the same time. Every scene and every incidence was relevant. I don't even call this film a \"movie\", because it is better than that. I have never given 10/10 to any film and rarely write reviews, but this one is deserving of a 15/10 if that were possible. If you have any reservations about watching this film, cast them aside and view it. Every aspect of what a perfect film would be about is included in this one. It's not a family film or for those who faint easily. It is gripping, extremely graphic, truthful and simply a masterpiece of cinema. <br><br>It is deserving of the Academy Award for \"Best Picture\", \"Best Director\", \"Best Screenplay\", \"Best Actor\", Best Supporting Actor\", \"Best Cinematography\", \"Best Editing\", \"Best Makeup\", and of all the films I have ever seen, I put this one on the top of my list, and that isn't an easy feat. With my child love of the \"Wizard Of Oz\" and my insatiable lust for \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\", this film has dethroned all of them. This is the best film I have ever seen in my life.","user":"jonlioncourt","rank":[40,52]},{"title":"Do not let your wives see it !","rating":10,"date":"16 February 2020","review":"Cos' mine cried for two nights , and i ... i think i've got PTSD just for seeing that movie . And i was in the military . Perhaps cos' i can block what's happened to me , but not to others .\nReally folks, this so lately movie seen by me and then me missus , it's so realistic and to top it off inspired from a real story , that is no wonder Harry ( former prince now ) quit the \" Firm \" who is sending young guys to loose limb and life in the defense of England outside its borders . I bet he had seen some really bad stuff .\nA very well done movie , describing the horrors or war and the suffering of those trying to make a living out of it .\nTen stars for a shockingly realistic movie , ten stars for a very good job done by everyone .","user":"gherota","rank":[6,6]}]
