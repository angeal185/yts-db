[{"title":"Better Than Expected","rating":8,"date":"13 May 2019","review":"I took my mom to this for Mother's Day as per her request, and fully expected a very hokey chick flick with zero plot, etc. To my delight it ended up being very funny, a bit of a tear-jerker at one point, and overall a cute movie that I'd probably watch again with my mom or girlfriends. I'd call it lightly empowering for females, especially senior women, and overall just really fun.","user":"akenyeres","rank":[52,56]},{"title":"Something special.","rating":8,"date":"14 May 2019","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. Sure it's not bringing anything new to the genre, but I wasn't expecting it too be anything more than it was. All of the actresses have lived wonderful lives and have accomplished so much in their careers it's great to see such strong women in a movie. I could be a little biased, as I just recently lost my grandmother to cancer, and this movie reminded me why I loved her so much. This is like the perfect movie to watch when you're having a lazy day at the house and want something feel good while you stay cozy. Like a big warm blanket. In my opinion, those are some of the best movie out there.","user":"derrickharp","rank":[37,41]},{"title":"Touching , funny, good movie","rating":9,"date":"12 May 2019","review":"Yes it is formulaic. It's the whole rocky underdog female version.. But it has so many wonderful moments. Diane Keaton is her usual wonderful self.We laughed . We cried. Will it win an Oscar, no . But if you want a touching sweet movie that reaffirms what is important ion life go see this movie.","user":"hipps001","rank":[37,44]}]
