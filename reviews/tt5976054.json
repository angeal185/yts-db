[{"title":"No budget top entertainment","rating":10,"date":"27 February 2020","review":"Th8s film was made for no money with a cast of kids who were all making their debuts. The film makers should be enormously proud of this little film.makes you wonder what they could achieve with a bit of money behind them. Fantastic.. it wasn't the most polished and the story had a couple of holes, but overall a fabulous fun filled caper with some delightfully warm moments from the adult cast too","user":"moonpop","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Good fun","rating":10,"date":"12 March 2020","review":"Kids loved this film - not a film for adults but anyone over the age of 6 will love it plus adults who haven't grown up. Some good comedy from 2 of the adult cast. Can recommend as a family film for everyone to watch","user":"birdjames","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"The kids loved it","rating":10,"date":"26 February 2020","review":"Not sure why this has got a bad score. It is a film with kids for kids. There are some good adult parts but the plot and pacing is aimed at kids. Bearing this in mind it is good little film. Loved the creepy house where they moved to.","user":"terri-79002","rank":[7,14]}]
