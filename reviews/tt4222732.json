[{"title":"This was so terribly boring that even the ghosts got up and left...","rating":3,"date":"4 August 2019","review":"Usually Thai horror movies have a tendency of being good. So I needed little encouragement to sit down and watch the 2014 movie \"Game pluk phi\" (aka \"Ghost Coins\") when I was given the chance.<br><br>Sure, I had never even heard about this movie prior to finding it by sheer random chance in mid-2019. But it being a Thai horror movie was sufficient enough to make me want to watch it.<br><br>And I managed to watch 50 minutes of the movie, then I simply quit. Up to that point director Tiwa Moeithaisong had utterly failed to entice and captivate me with anything that was going on in the movie. And the fact that it all seemed rather incoherent and the characters were rubbish didn't really help much on convincing me to watch more of \"Ghost Coins\".<br><br>I didn't really enjoy the storyline that there was in the movie, as it seemed more like they had been filming random things as they went along and tried to tie it together as a movie.<br><br>And for a horror movie, then \"Ghost Coins\" was frightfully devoid of anything even remotely scary. Well, unless you are a Thai teen girl perhaps. But for a seasoned horror veteran, then this was just a heap of rubbish.<br><br>I have no intention of returning to watch the rest of this movie, since it failed to entertain me on so many levels. If you enjoy Asian horror movies, like I do, do yourself a favor and give \"Ghost Coins\" a wide berth and find something else to watch.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[2,2]}]
