[{"title":"A bizarrely interesting experience.","rating":6,"date":"4 April 2020","review":"After they paid for the prosthetic fish tail, there clearly was nothing left in the budget. The main part of the movie (supposedly set in a small psychiatric home for women) was most definitely filmed in someone's Topanga Canyon bungalow - likely unbeknownst to the homeowner who was away in Cabo for a week. The crew also probably borrowed his boat and traded a down-on-his-luck sea captain a bottle of Old Smuggler for the use of his trawler.<br><br>That being said. The film is made in earnest with some serious gusto and heart. The acting is pretty good. There is some lore to the story. Tense moments. Silly ones. It's a strange blend of genres. But I couldn't stop watching.<br><br>I can only imagine what it could have been with a little bigger financing.","user":"Otkon","rank":[36,36]},{"title":"Not perfect but pretty darn good","rating":6,"date":"16 April 2020","review":"Some if it is a little hard to follow but overall it was compelling.","user":"snhughes43","rank":[22,22]},{"title":"Not a reality show","rating":7,"date":"12 April 2020","review":"If you choose to watch FANTASY, HORROR, MYSTERY then don't analyze and review it as a reality show. It will mislead those genre fans.","user":"huang-62173","rank":[21,21]}]
