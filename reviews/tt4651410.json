[{"title":"Save yourself the aggravation and don't watch this movie.","rating":2,"date":"27 April 2016","review":"This is a movie that suffers from a bad script, acting, directing ... just a bad movie overall.A movie so bad it makes bad look movies look good.<br><br>There is absolutely no acting from anyone of the actors. The Story line is lame and the acting even lamer. Each actor looked like they had to have their teeth pulled to utter their lines. Claire Forlaine looks old enough to be the lead actors Mother. I have no idea what Bruce Wills was doing in the movie and Jenna B Kelly cant act to save herself. The rest of the cast was there in the movie to make sure a bad movie stayed bad.<br><br>The boat chase scene is the only scene that is barely watchable. Jenna B Kelly except for looking good cant do anything else. I have seen novices act better.<br><br>Seriously save your self the trouble and skip this movie.","user":"Ripvanvinkel","rank":[61,72]},{"title":"Had to sit it out just to see if it could get any worse.","rating":1,"date":"22 April 2016","review":"Boy, did wisecracks degenerate pretty severely since Die Hard and the good ol '90s. This faceplant reeks of cheap thrills, direct-to-DVD actors and, of course, a 150 year old Bruce Willis. I'm about 2/3 into the movie and I've already forgotten half of the plot. Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the Michelangelo of Thieves apparently, acts with the kind of confidence only a guy who thinks Wakeboarding is an extreme sport would. And did I mention every girlfriend is a sniper? Granted, no adults were involved in the making of 'Precious Cargo', or it wouldn't have been made at all. This train wreck is what happens when subpar directors try to make movies for millennials â€“ the most unlikely-to-happen plot in the universe right now.","user":"nyrn","rank":[67,88]},{"title":"Just.... no.... just don't!","rating":1,"date":"1 May 2016","review":"This movie is god awful. Id rather let my children talk to strangers than let them watch this. Who ever wrote this movie should be shot. Not just because the dialog, story-line, and everything in the movie sucked, but because I was wondering if the writer even knew what a writing was.<br><br>Action movie with horrible gun acting. Hardly any recoil, and at one point some of the slides of the guns were cocked back or not even closed fully. I could go on for about an hour about the crappy gun stuff, but you would want to shoot me too.<br><br>The actors, may be great. but the writing was so bad its hard for any actor to act with the lines. Did not fit situation and was really uncomfortable. I feel bad for some of these actors as this movie will seriously hurt them. Even for Willis, this was one of his worse films, and it all comes back to the writer. How could you act well when you have these kind of crappy lines. <br><br>Filming was just as bad as everything else in the movie, I felt like they enjoyed green screen a little too much, forgot what good lighting consists of, and some of the camera angles were a big sign that boasts of a low budget film. <br><br>Save yourself, save your friends, save random strangers, save the cute old lady across this street. be a public servant and don't bother with this movie, just don't.","user":"saburaukami-645-566777","rank":[51,67]}]
