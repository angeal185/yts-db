[{"title":"Pretty dull and lifeless","rating":4,"date":"20 March 2013","review":"A film crew shooting a horror flick in an old abandoned hospital, realise that all is not what it seems as one by one, they all seem to fall under the influence of an evil presence...<br><br>The problem I had with this film is that it's nothing that any self respecting horror fan hasn't seen before. It takes a while to get going and utilizes done before clichés such as ominous music combined with slow tracking shots, in an attempt at atmosphere. As a result it emerges as a pretty lacklustre by the numbers effort that despite having one or two nice ideas, is simply a ho-hum affair that has no real suspense or tension and the characters are pretty uninteresting. The performances aren't great either and overall the film simply comes across as boring. It was also far too restrained for my liking, considering its premise could have allowed for at least some potentially entertaining set piece kills, but it's all to tame and cutaway.<br><br>4/10, just a dreary, dull horror for me.","user":"Corpus_Vile","rank":[22,26]},{"title":"Bad acting, overused plot, no budget. If you are a hardcore horror fan you may like this, others should avoid. I say D+","rating":17,"date":"17 March 2013","review":"\"Did you see that!?\" A film crew shooting a low budget horror movie moves into a abandoned psychiatric hospital. The hospital seems to take on a life of it's own the longer the crew stays. Little be little the cast and crew begin to notice strange things happening. I will admit that I had pretty low expectations for this even though I did like The Ward. I also realize the movie is about a low budget film crew but just because that's the plot doesn't mean they only have to hire bad actors. Not only is the fake movie low budget and bad acting, the actual movie is low budget and bad acting. It's hard to knock the movie based on budget but there comes a point where you have to realize that acting does matter, even in really low budget throw away movies like this. The rest of the movie was pretty much cookie cutter and not that scary to me. If you are a hardcore horror fan you may like this, I did not. Overall, the bad acting was too distracting for me to fully get into the movie. I say D+.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[39,50]},{"title":"Had so much potential!","rating":4,"date":"30 March 2013","review":"Dark Feed is one of those films that looks cool, so you keep watching because something amazing is going to happen, you can feel it So you keep watching and waiting and waiting Until the movie is over and you're like, \"Damn, where did the past hour and a half go?\" Dark feed had all the cool lighting, sweet sounds, awesome camera angles and shots of a horror movie, but with no movie. I really wanted to like it, but it really had no story and really weak dialog. It almost felt like a reality show a times, where you're just watching people on a film set work and talk about everyday life. The last 20 minutes of the film started to get interesting but I also felt like it didn't really matter because 70 minutes before that made my brain shutdown. A very bleak horror film overall, but it had major potential to be something amazing Unfortunately it fell flat instead. I gave it a 4 instead of a 3 because the last 20 was pretty decent.<br><br>Please like me on Facebook!
