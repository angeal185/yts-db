[{"title":"An Endless Orgy Of Twists & Turns That's Definitely Worth A Shot.","rating":25,"date":"25 November 2014","review":"An endless orgy of twists &amp; turns that begins &amp; ends with a bullet being fired, Cold in July isn't an easy film to pin into any genre because it starts as one thing, then changes its course around the middle, seems to be heading in the direction you predicted but once again takes an unexpected turn to become something else entirely.<br><br>Set in 1989 Texas, the film tells the story of a local civilian who's all over the news after killing an intruder in self-defence, only to find his family being stalked by the ex-con father of the deceased. However, the two soon find themselves being misled by the police &amp; with the help of a private investigator try to uncover the real truth.<br><br>Co-written &amp; directed by Jim Mickle, this indie keeps shifting its gear which stacks up pretty well in the end as the aura of tension that's present in the film throughout its runtime is nerve-wracking. Camera-work is expertly handled, editing is really good, background score nicely compliments the whole narrative &amp; the tone shifts are carried out in a manner that pulls the viewers in than out.<br><br>Coming to the performances, the film boasts a badass cast in Michael C. Hall, Sam Shepard &amp; Don Johnson and the trio are fabulous in their given roles. Hall plays an everyman &amp; it is through him that we enter into the story, Shepard chips in with a strong performance as well but it's Don Johnson who impresses the most &amp; steals every scene he's in with effortless finesse.<br><br>On an overall scale, Cold in July is a tense, gripping &amp; expertly narrated indie that offers an immersive drama which eventually culminates on a highly satisfying &amp; emotionally rewarding note. Worthy of a wider audience &amp; definitely one of the finest films of the year, not to mention one of the coolest as well, Cold in July is certainly worth a shot &amp; comes highly recommended.","user":"CinemaClown","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Plot Lines Dropped","rating":5,"date":"31 May 2014","review":"While the acting in this movie is very good and Sam Shepard's character evolves, there are major plot lines that just get dropped. It reminds me of Charlie's Angels episodes that don't make sense and we're supposed to not worry about that and just think they are cool. Same here.<br><br>The statements I'm about to write could be called \"spoilers\" but they are not really because they don't matter. The whole middle of movie is about bad cops that tell Michael Hall that he killed Sam Shepard's son even though he really didn't in order to draw Sam Shepard to town so that they can kill him. Do we find out why the cops did that? No. Do the cops get pay back? No. Later, there is a big deal made about the Dixie mafia and what bad asses they are. Do the characters confront or even see the Dixie mafia? No. And the big stated reason why Michael Hall needs to leave his wife and kid to help Sam Shepard is to find out who he really killed. Does he ever find out? No. <br><br>There is a main plot that I have not revealed, so there is something to this movie. But all this other stuff really seemed pointless.","user":"t-bone53","rank":[108,136]},{"title":"Good run through with a bit emotional detachment","rating":7,"date":"4 April 2015","review":"The story line is simple and clear but not completely convincing in all aspects. But the screenplay is the one that makes to hold on to the movie till the end without letting you think about the logics. The music and some of the performances like Sam Shepard's have been partners to the screenplay.<br><br>But towards the end of the movie, You think about Richard's involvement to the plan is so lightly touched making the characterization contradictory to itself. A citizen with clear records, a responsible family man who tries to safe guard the family under any circumstances turns out to be warrior keeping aside the family for a while. That itches a bit ! Doesn't it.<br><br>Other than that, it is a movie that you can watch for once without much regrets.","user":"SatiagoManez","rank":[9,9]}]
