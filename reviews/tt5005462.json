This film is must viewing, it brings out the truth about today's world - Nothing but stupid people becoming famous.<br><br>We live empty lives attached to phones, controlled by social media and slaves to likes.<br><br>quality acting! The cinematography is stylish, and music was hypnotic.<br><br>Overall, see it, it's satire, black comedy, social commentary and more!","user":"noirvisualsclub","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"A film that teeters between MEDIA and MANIA","rating":10,"date":"13 November 2018","review":"'The Actor is NOT a \"HORROR\" movie, it is a depiction, a scary reality if you will, of the life of an Actor and his place on our social media totem pole.<br><br>LIKES, FAME, FOLLOWERS, there is always someone else who has more and everyone else expect from you to try harder to gain relevance.<br><br>This movie retains the balance between this psychotic state and a very hilarious approach to telling of one's journey to becoming the \"greatest\".","user":"METROFACTS","rank":[5,9]}]
