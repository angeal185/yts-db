[{"title":"Not very good.","rating":3,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"I can't say this movie is amateurish. The cinematography and editing is good. However, the first thing I noticed is that the main character is supposed to be 20, but the actor portraying him looks much closer to 30 (or older). That is very distracting. He seems to be a decent actor, and is a nice-looking guy, but he simply doesn't look the part. The rest of the actors are a mixed bag as far as ability goes.<br><br>Thirty minutes in there is no character development. I'm left uninterested in all of the characters. The central question in the movie, which is made known almost from the very start, could be resolved almost instantly with a bit of modern technology, rendering any suspense regarding it absurd. From early on, there is an undercurrent of something else going on, but, again, no suspense.","user":"sdiegotw","rank":[18,28]},{"title":"HAHAHAHA! Seriously?","rating":1,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"Just awful. The glowing reviews are bogus, obviously because they state the acting is good. The dad's horrible acting is comical. Just...no.","user":"jbrooks-87405","rank":[13,21]},{"title":"Garbage","rating":1,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"This film is a total ripoff of the 2012 documentary about the French scammer Frédéric Bourdin. The script lacks any originality, resulting not only in a played-out plot but also tedious unnuanced dialogue recycled from every made-for-tv movie from the 1990s. The acting was atrocious to the point of being nearly unwatchable. Also, the way the writers wrote all the female characters seemed incredibly misogynistic. Skip this terrible movie and watch the 2012 documentary instead.","user":"mrnerdymcgee","rank":[8,12]}]
