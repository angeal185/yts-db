[{"title":"It's supposed to be a LIVE action Road Runner Cartoon!","rating":8,"date":"1 November 2004","review":"You people have completely missed the point of the movie! When Kirk Douglas falls off the cliff, or off his horse, he is not intended to be hurt! Didn't you get it when he painted a tunnel on the big rock, and Arnold and Ann PASS right through it? Then when Douglas tries it, he runs splat into the rock! It is a very funny comedy! COMEDY being the key word here. Arnold has some great lines in this movie as does Ann Margaret. This is your classic Saturday Morning Wile E. Coyote/Roadrunner cartoon done in a live version. Don't worry so much about the acting, and just enjoy the movie.<br><br>Also, Ann Margaret is NOT 63 in this movie, and she is VERY hot looking in it. And even at 63, she is still somewhat hot!<br><br>If you have this movie and Brain Donors, you have yourself a fun day ahead of you!!","user":"drew1751","rank":[53,60]},{"title":"hilarious film, just like Roadrunner","rating":10,"date":"10 July 2004","review":"Almost like a Roadrunner cartoon, but live action. Pretty much all the clich√©s you can think of, including names such as \"Handsome Stranger\" for the handsome stranger played by Ah-nold, and \"Charming\" for the beautiful heroine. <br><br>Frankly, IMHO, Kirk Douglas's horse was the star of the movie. While watching it with friends I said, \"I love that horse.\" I think that animal should have won an Academy Award. (I think there is a \"Patsy\" award for animals, actually)<br><br>Probably best to see this one with friends. Probably pretty boring to see it alone, but where friends can feed upon each other it is wonderful.<br><br>None of Kirk Douglas's implements did come from the ACME company, though :-)","user":"barryaus","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"Dudley DooRight versus Wile E. Coyote for Jessica Rabbit","rating":6,"date":"25 May 2008","review":"I'm not quite sure why Kirk Douglas took the part of a live Wile E. Coyote in the film villain other than to say that he had now tried the slapstick comedy genre. But in this case the frustrated coyote is not matched up with the beeping road runner. His adversary is Dudley DooRight in the person of Arnold Schwarzneggar, the Handsome Stranger. Yes folks, that's his character name.<br><br>We've got a third cartoon character in the mix, Ann-Margret doing a prototype of Jessica Rabbit. Annie's really showing off the stuff today with bosoms akimbo, she's got every member of the cast panting after her with the exceptions of Strother Martin who is her father and still sees Daddy's little girl and Arnie whom she pants after, but who doesn't show the slightest interest.<br><br>The bulk of the film is taken up with Kirk as villainous Cactus Jack and his horse Whiskey, doing their best to stop Arnie and Ann and rob them of a large sum of money from banker Jack Elam to Strother Martin. It's here where all the comparisons to the road runner cartoons take place.<br><br>I'm sure Kirk Douglas liked the change of pace, burlesquing his own western image. And he had a tough assignment because the majority of his scenes are alone and the dialog was spoken to his horse. Maybe Mr. Ed should have been cast in the role. <br><br>If anybody noticed the name of the horse Whiskey is the same name that Kirk Douglas used for his horse in his acclaimed Lonely Are The Brave.<br><br>Lest you think that because this is a road runner film the ending is a road runner ending. Let's just say that Jessica Rabbit has her needs and priorities as well.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[17,19]}]
