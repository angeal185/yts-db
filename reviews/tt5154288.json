[{"title":"mediocre silliness","rating":4,"date":"26 March 2017","review":"It may have got some good reviews from some film festivals but this dark comedy slasher is both slow and boring in 95% of it's duration... While giving credit for being novel, the running gag of the baby supposedly directing mommy's homicidal tendencies got old very early. The movie wants to be a comedy thriller but in no way is it actually funny.and as for being a thriller, when virtually every person she encounters is just an incompetent imbecile for her to toy with, there is zero tension ( a date not seeing she was even pregnant or someone putting on boxing gloves to fight someone with a butcher knife ?) oh please...<br><br>Alice's dead pan, emotional free approach to Ruth was handled professionally but actually did nothing to elevate either the film's subject matter or actually caring about her character<br><br>While the movie is not a total bust, it's just a exercise in silliness that may entertain some but for me was totally a forgettable viewing...","user":"RMS1949","rank":[42,58]},{"title":"Prevenge: The best pregnant, slasher, comedy, horror movie...ever.","rating":8,"date":"1 February 2017","review":"The three Greek Furies that feature prominently in the 1934 Noirish movie, Crime Without Passion, are the central metaphor in Alice Lowe's extraordinarily dark Prevenge, billed as the world's first pregnant, slasher, comedy, horror movie.<br><br>In it, Alice Lowe's character, Ruth, embarks on a revenge murder spree goaded on by her helium-voiced, gestating baby.<br><br>It takes her to Wales and, in one breathtaking scene, the streets of Cardiff on Halloween night where she claims she almost needed protection from the boozed-up locals in a sequence reminiscent of Scarlett Johnassonn's Under The Skin street walk in Glasgow.<br><br>The reason for her bloody revenge spree is only revealed in drips (so I won't spoil it - like a preview I read before the screening did for me) which adds greatly to the narrative tension.<br><br>The making of this low budget Film Four offering is remarkable. Lowe was offered development money and finding herself pregnant used her condition to inspire this blackest of black script. She then wrote, produced, cast and filmed (in 11 days) the whole affair before her baby arrived.<br><br>Seeing an actor perform whilst heavily pregnant, and genuinely playing a pregnant character, is a rarity (my only recollection is Frances McDormand in Fargo) and Lowe certainly makes the most of the opportunity. Shooting took place in her late third Trimester.<br><br>The Furies are the ultimate avenging angels and she uses the extraordinary scenes from Crime Without Passion to symbolise her quest for justice, viewing the movie from the comfort of her hotel room where she takes respite, despite noisily bonking near neighbours, from her exhausting killings.<br><br>The killings themselves are simple but bloody affairs and each has hilarious set ups. Can she complete her task before the long arm of the law catches up on her careful forensic clean ups? You'll have to see it to find out.<br><br>This is classic British black comedy at its best. Using its low budget as a virtue but still making some moments of genuinely great cinematography, most notably in an exotic pet shop and a beautiful full facial dream sequence in a yoga class.<br><br>It has echoes of Mike Leigh's early work and Ben Wheatley's Sightseers is an obvious reference point. Obvious because Lowe is its co-star and it too shares a murderous plot line.<br><br>But, comparisons aside, this is an entirely original take on several genres that does its damnedest to create a genre of its own. <br><br>Whether there's room for thousands of pregnant, slasher, comedy, horror movies is debatable. <br><br>So we'll just have to agree on one thing. The original and best.","user":"markgorman","rank":[33,58]},{"title":"Pretty decent","rating":6,"date":"4 July 2017","review":"There's some fun to be had here with this dark comedy. A pregnant woman goes on a murdering spree on the people involved in her unborn child's father's climbing death. A movie like this could have been completely unwatchable so I appreciate that they got the tone just right. The child speaks to her from the womb but it never gets completely goofy. The violence she commits is brutal and bloody and it doesn't attempt to trivialize or justify their deaths.<br><br>Despite that, there is entertainment to be had as the more she kills the more unhinged she becomes. At times it's an almost playful performance from Alice Lowe who also wrote and directed it. Overall a respectable movie. Nicely shot considering it was done in under 2 weeks.","user":"dissident320","rank":[8,11]}]
