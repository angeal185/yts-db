[{"title":"See it for the ladies.","rating":6,"date":"29 August 2014","review":"Andy Sidaris follows his usual formula with this mix of action, gorgeous scenery, and even more gorgeous women. The story deals with the title character, an international criminal played by handsome John Aprea. He's gunned down outside an art gallery by the goons of a crazed associate, Miguel Ortiz (Rodrigo Obregon). Then a team of government operatives, including Travis Abilene (amiable hunk Steve Bond), Donna (the delectable Dona Speir), and Taryn (lovely Hope Marie Carlton) spend their time trying to eliminate Ortiz and his henchmen.<br><br>\"Picasso Trigger\" is fun, at least to a degree. It's never inspired, but it's reasonably rousing at times and even if the viewer is otherwise bored, they'll hopefully be preoccupied with ogling the female cast members. Naturally, they show off the goods when they get a chance. The acting is basically good enough for this sort of thing. The standout is veteran Aprea, who's a real smooth type. The gadgets designed by \"Q\" type character The Professor (Richard LePore) are cute, especially that killer crutch.<br><br>The material is played with a degree of humour, with some choice bits of dialogue here and there. Things get a little annoying in the final minutes, with one \"ending\" after another, but the movie is overall a good little diversion.<br><br>Six out of 10.","user":"Hey_Sweden","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Terrific girls - movie should have been better","rating":5,"date":"12 September 2006","review":"Once again, this Sidaris film seems to have everything: a fit and quite believable as an agent Dona Speir, an incredibly adorable Hope Marie Carlton (on a scale of 1 to 10, her smile is a 12), a gorgeous Roberta Vasquez, international locations (Paris, Las Vegas, Texas, Hawaii, etc.), LOTS of explosions, outrageous gadgets, etc. The mix should have been explosively hot, but sadly it's only lukewarm. The execution of the formula is mechanical, as if Sidaris was simply ticking off action scenes from a list. There are very few funny lines (the best belongs to Speir: when she's accused of being jealous, she says \"there is not a jealous bone in my body - check it out for yourself\", and she disrobes!) and the one fight scene, involving Harold Diamond, is terrible. But to end this comment on a positive note, John Aprea gives a slick performance as the arch-villain of the story.

A steady stream of bad acting, massive explosions and even more massive mammeries (but less nudity than most of the other films in the series). When it comes down to it Andy Sidaris's near-trademark mixture of boobs, bullets, and bad acting is not for everyone. You either enjoy the concoction or you don't. I'm more in the former than the latter as I see them as fairly innocent time-wasting eye candy. Just go with it and you'll enjoy to an extant. And while this one might not be his best film (that would be \"Do or Die\" in case you're wondering), it's still enjoyable if you just remember to turn your brain off at the door.<br><br>My Grade: C+ <br><br>Eye Candy: Cynthia Brimhall, Hope Carlton, Patty Duffek, Kym Malin, and Don Spier all show various amounts of gratuitous skin.<br><br>DVD Extras: Introduction with Andy and Julie Strain; Director's Commantary; 36 minute Behind the scenes featurette (featuring abundant nudity); Production Stills; Sndy Sidaris filmography; web-links; Theatrical Trailer; and Trailers for 11 other Sidaris films (all with abundant nudity) <br><br>Easter Egg: There's one hidden in the main menu featuring a nearly fully nude Julie Strain goofing off.","user":"movieman_kev","rank":[6,8]}]
