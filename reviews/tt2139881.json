[{"title":"This movie isn't for everyone, but it was for me. It honestly made me laugh","rating":8,"date":"4 August 2019","review":"I actually don't understand all the highly negative reviews. There isn't enough things in the world to laugh about and this comedy is one of them. It wasn't perfect, but it had a reasonable message and definitely had some funny scenes","user":"flinx-52179","rank":[147,191]},{"title":"Haters Gona Hate","rating":9,"date":"2 August 2019","review":"Legitimately one of the best rom coms I have ever seen. This is coming from a person who sways with republicans. The performances are exceptional. Both Seth and Charlize are playing their strong suits. And hooyah was it awesome to see such very different actors get a chance to be on screen together. The witty and even sometimes scary realistic nature of the writing in this film gave me chills. Yes, the stoner guy who was incredibly intelligent, honest, and wasn't afraid to stand for what he believes in...Guess what? Makes the SECRETARY OF STATE who possesses the same qualities fall for him. It isn't about oh look at the nerdy guy get the pretty girl. NO?!!! This is simply a man and woman who find one another and fill in the gaps in their own lives. I thought it executed the political climate in our country beautifully and fairly. One of the most ground breaking scenes I have ever seen in a hollywood film. All in all if you're super liberal or super conservative, you'll hate it and won't be able to take it for the true love story that it is. But if you are the person that is truly able to talk and break down barriers, this is a story for the ages and one that I hope will play on and on. Can't believe they were able to pull off this in a rom com. Funny as hell, pure of heart, Brilliant.","user":"spenserpollard","rank":[93,130]},{"title":"Cool!","rating":8,"date":"3 September 2019","review":"Seth Rogen as Julia Roberts and Charlize Theron as Richard Gere. \"Pretty Woman\" with switched roles. Modern times. Easy and fun movie.","user":"fschettini","rank":[56,78]}]
