[{"title":"Bad, but could be worse","rating":3,"date":"19 June 2014","review":"Let's get this out of the way first thing: Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan is a bad movie. Badly acted, badly directed, bad CGI effects (but, of course, you knew that as soon as you saw this listed on the SyFy Channel). And yet, it's entertaining in ways that its creators probably never intended. A group of teenage hoodlum wannabes are punished for their crimes...by being sent to camp. Their punishment comes in the form of drill-sergeant survivalist cop who clearly should not allowed within 100 feet of minors and a psychiatrist who wants them to get in touch with their feelings. For a teenager, I can't imagine which of them would be worse company for a weekend. As befits a horror movie that needs a body count, you will hate nearly all of these people and want them to die within 15 minutes. Don't worry, you'll get your wish. Pretty soon, the campers are getting pruned by a 15-foot-tall freak who appears to be developmentally disabled, until you realize that, somehow, he was smart enough to make or buy an double-headed ax with a 10-foot handle (C'mon, those things can't be easy to come by!) that's just big enough for a guy his size to use without looking like he's playing with a toy. He's given a back story familiar to anyone who's a fan of \"maniac-in-the-back-woods\" horror films. The movie plays out exactly as you expect it to. It \"stars\" (and I'm using the word in its loosest possible interpretation) Dan Haggerty and Joe Estevez. It's a hallmark of how low this movie sinks that its best-known performers are a TV actor whose last significant role was in 1978 and Martin Sheen's cheaper, less talented brother. Haggerty's role is little more than a cameo (and the scariest thing about this movie is, that apart from his hair and magnificently-sculpted beard going from blond to gray, he doesn't appear to have aged a day in the last 40 years). And Estevez spends the entire movie acting as if Gary Busey and Nicholas Cage are inside him, battling for possession of his immortal soul. There's nothing even remotely original about this movie: from turning a folkloric character into a generic psycho killer to the contrived excuses for why nobody's cell phone and car seem to work when they really need them, to the cookie-cutter characters whose odds of survival are inversely proportional to how annoying they are. Even Estevez's third-act freak-out seems oddly derivative. But if you approach this movie with appropriately low expectations, the cheese factor is good for a few laughs.","user":"theshadow1963","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"This was... well, something in its own league... let's just call it that!","rating":3,"date":"26 July 2013","review":"While \"Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan\" isn't among the worst of movies that I have seen, it is far up on the scale.<br><br>This slasher movie tries to incorporate the Paul Bunyan tale with some good old fashioned teenage slash-fest. But ultimately the end result was rather tame and less than interesting, to say the least.<br><br>A group of young delinquents are sent away to a reform boot-camp in the middle of a forested mountainside, under the supervision of gung-ho police officer Sgt. Hoke and a psychiatrist. However, the group run afoul a giant that is stalking the mountainside. The giant is wielding a massive axe and is ferocious and hellbent on killing anything in his path.<br><br>Storywise, then \"Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan\" was a very generic and genre stereotypic slasher movie, although trying to put in some legend and folk lore - which failed miserably.<br><br>The effects in the movie were adequate at times, while at other times they were so low-budget that you can't help but shake your head in disbelief and laugh out loud at them.<br><br>I don't recall a single face seen throughout the movie, and as such I suppose that is a good enough thing, as it is nice to see unfamiliar faces in movies, as to not draw associations to previous roles the actors or actresses have portrayed.<br><br>\"Axe Giant: The Wrath of Paul Bunyan\" wasn't entertaining and it was very tempting to let one's attention drift towards something else as the movie trotted on mundanely on the screen. Sometimes you just wonder why certain films gets produced, funded and even makes it off the drawing board.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Not good at all","rating":2,"date":"15 June 2013","review":"I watched this because Dan Haggerty is in it,I remember very well growing up and watching Grizzly Adams on TV He doesn't have much of a role in this (lucky for him)but the acting is pretty bad and the cgi is also very bad I wont say anything stupid like I want that 90 minutes of my life back (that expression is so annoying) The blue ox was just terribly done Acting was bad cgi even worse Just not a good movie I also thought it might be one of those horror movies that was so bad it was funny no such luck At the end of the credits it says Paul Bunyan will return I certainly hope not.I searched and searched for something positive about the movie,it took a while but finally it hit me.The scenery is very nice,I don't know where it was made but the mountains and deep woods were very nice","user":"bledrules","rank":[16,22]}]
