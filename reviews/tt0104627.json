[{"title":"Could this mean the renaissance of the intellectual","rating":8,"date":"26 June 1999","review":"Knight Moves is a film of/for fruitcakes....a little too complicated to be called a Madeira, but heavy enough to take away the hunger pangs.  It manages to convey the horror of death without any real murder sequences being shown and is rather  Hitchcockesque in places.<br><br>The story centres around chess player Peter Sanderson (Christophe Lambert) and his (possible) involvement in a string of serial killings.  Due to his complete absorption  in the game, he has already lost his wife and is now in danger of losing his daughter.  Although he is the prime suspect, he becomes involved with a psychologist called in by the Police.  This role was picked up by Christophe's (then) wife, Diane Lane, who not only coped well with the character, but also with a well-rehearsed bedroom scene.  A case of 'truth being stranger than fiction'?<br><br>Like many of Christophe's films, this one relies heavily on explaining the psychology of the killer, even if it is only in laymen's terms; but it does deal with complex issues of responsibility and duress.  The photography is a juxtaposition of European noir sur blanc and British thriller, with a little American 'home-grown' logic thrown in for good effect. Tom Skerritt is disappointing as the chief of police, a role that he plays woodenly.  He is upstaged by his sidekick (Daniel Baldwin).  Jeremy is portrayed by Ferdinand Mayne, an actor well known to film-going audiences, with over 120 roles to his credit before his death in 1998.<br><br>Although this film was not initially well received, its continued presence on the 'Pick of the week' shelf at the video store proves that it may well become a 'cult' film.  It is often in the top-100-rentals slot in many countries and it seems to appeal to a diverse range of people.  While some of the supporting cast need acting lessons, its camera work and well co-ordinated plot make this an original and enjoyable 'who-dunnit'...and you really will be guessing to the end.","user":"Spike-65","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"Who-Dun-It?","rating":9,"date":"19 August 2003","review":"I really liked this movie a lot. Very well written murder mystery with clues that are fair and sort of a scary movie to boot! It really keeps you guessing right to the last scene who is the disturbed murderer. Set on an island off Canada at a world chess tournament, where the killer is murdering his or her (I won't spill the beans!) victims by chess moves taken by the players. Every one and I mean everyone, is a suspect as the cast gets whittled down by the killer leading to a heart pounding climax. Nice photography with a creepy opening scene. If you like to play Sherlock Holmes or just like an edge of your seat mystery thriller you will enjoy this movie a lot. I guarentee you will keep changing your guess to who the killer is many times while watching this.....but use your little gray cells and follow the clues! Neat flick!","user":"irishcoffee630","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"CheckMate!","rating":10,"date":"30 August 2003","review":"On the advice of some the comments I read here on the IMDB site, I picked up a $4.99 on sale wide screen DVD of this film. This film is an outstanding and extremely well written dark, disturbing murder thriller. I was amazed not expecting it to be this good! It does remind me a lot of the early 1970's Dario Argento films with it's black gloved razor blade clutching killer, oddball characters and film style. Set on an isolated island off the coast of British Columbia during a world chess championship, the killer is murdering the locals leaving scrawled blood drenched clues above their beds as he murders by chess moves. Christopher Lambert is one of the eccentric chess players drawn into the mystery who may(or may not)himself be the culprit. The clues in this movie stand up for any mystery lover and it was fun to try to solve the riddles presented and figure out who-dun-it. This is definately Lambert's best film role as he delivers a feverish performance. Last 20 minutes you will be on the edge of your seat as the film rushes to it's chilling and VERY exciting finale. The final camera \"flash\" shot (see the film then you will know what I am referring too) and last line spoken was a brilliant way to end this really great mystery thriller. This film was only fairly received upon it's initial release and most people have never even heard of it. I recommend this movie very highly for those who like an intelligent mystery that relies on mood, stylish directing and a well written script. 10/10 this movie blew me away!","user":"coachspk","rank":[15,23]}]
