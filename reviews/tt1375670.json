[{"title":"Just another Adam Sandler film...","rating":10,"date":"11 July 2010","review":"There is nothing wrong about this film... there is nothing right about it either. It's just another Adam Sandler feel-good movie, and if you like these (I certainly do), you will like this movie too. If you hate them for a lack of plot or the shallowness of the jokes, you won't. I just know I laughed a numerous amount of times, and I felt good after having watched it.<br><br>And no, I'm not a stupid guy; I like a good plot, good acting, directing and well-thought-of puns as does the next guy. But there are times when you feel like watching a complicated drama, and there are times when you feel like watching a no-brainer.<br><br>This is definitely a no-brainer, which will make you feel good from time to time. That's why Adam Sandler makes these movies, and that's why they keep doing so well.<br><br>They will make you feel good :)","user":"frankveer-1","rank":[330,509]},{"title":"10/10, a cinematic masterpiece.","rating":10,"date":"13 August 2019","review":"This is one of, if not the best piece of any category of media/entertainment I have ever seen. This movie made me laugh almost every minute of the film but some how made me think harder than I ever had to with its hard hitting takes on racism, sexism, and classism. With hilarious scenes like the pool scene, to beautiful cinematography at the water skiing scene. Is strongly recommended to all people, whether your a kid, an adult you can enjoy this movie at its fullest.","user":"liamjonestran","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"I'VE SEEN A LOT WORSE","rating":7,"date":"5 October 2019","review":"Hollywood has lost the art of being funny. Mainly because everything has been done beyond the subtle. Short attention spans, filth masquerading as entertainment and too much freedom without consequences has reduced what's seen as funny to banal dick jokes.<br><br>You know what's worse? Reading the sanctimonious crap written here in this forum.\nI hate that some contributors want to coerce our agreement to their opinions by suggesting we have no taste if we disagree.<br><br>Well, there's plenty of rubbish being peddled as comedy but like I said, I've seen worse.<br><br>The overriding feeling I got was that the cast was having fun. Seemed natural with lots of ad lib. So what? I had fun too. So what!","user":"steve-667-10190","rank":[5,5]}]
