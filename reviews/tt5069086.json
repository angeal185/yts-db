[{"title":"Amazing take on time travel!","rating":7,"date":"5 April 2018","review":"I have -no- idea why this movie is ranked so poorly!<br><br>For low-budget Sci-Fi films, this is top tier and has an engaging storyline, likable characters I can relate with, and doesn't dumb things down too much.<br><br>It has great rewatchability. I wonder how all the nay-voters would rank Primer?? Especially the only other reviewer who said \"the storyline is confusing.\" Um, this movie is **definitely** geared towards the genius spectrum.","user":"hopeseekr","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"A mixed bag, but...","rating":6,"date":"1 June 2018","review":"For any story about time-travel there are going to be confusing and unclear parts. How these are handled somewhat defines the experience. Altered Hours uses the premise of drug-induced time-travel/viewing to avoid paradoxes such as those encountered in time-machine stories.\nWhile the concept is good, the actual film making is pretty woeful, indeed terrible in parts. The main protagonists' acting is bearable, but some of the supporting characters are appalling, really dire in places. \nHowever, the outcome of the story, the raison d'Ãªtre for the behaviour of the characters is finally well explained. I was quite moved by the ending, indeed it was what saved the film for me.\nIt's a clever story, poorly delivered. I look forward to the next story from these writers in the future - hopefully with a better budget and cast!","user":"Amadio","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Not too bad","rating":4,"date":"16 April 2018","review":"The writers are new to making a full feature film and this is their first attempt, reading their biographies. The story is interesting but the putting it together in a good movie is much more difficult to achieve for this theme.<br><br>Nevertheless I was able to follow what was happening and yes the future was changed and lives were saved. I somewhat liked it, but a lot of visual dreaming never came to fruition, which may confuse viewers. But if you understand the real timeline it never happened that way. Viewers will have to figure that out for themselves after having seen the movie, when it will make sense.<br><br>A nice attempt for which I give it a rating of 4.","user":"pietclausen","rank":[5,6]}]
