[{"title":"Load of rubbish, but I enjoyed it.","rating":7,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"So here's the deal, this is definitely not a good movie, it isn't exactly well written, the jokes are old hat.... but, it is a Christmas movie, and if you're wrapping your presents, eaching a box of chocolates, and on your third glass of prosecco you'll probably enjoy it.<br><br>It's the usual format, the no good parent goes on a journey, they have bad times, a moment of anger, and a reconciliation where everything turns out wonderful, and they all set off on the yellow brick road. It is genuinely no deeper then that.<br><br>It does have a certain charm, and nice message, that Christmas is about family, not decorations.<br><br>I watch too much Family Guy, so when I blink or look away, I swear Meg's in the movie. Christine Baranski was the star of the show for me, great timing. 7/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[36,44]},{"title":"Funny!","rating":7,"date":"16 December 2018","review":"I don't get the 1 star reviews. What exactly did you think you were going see? This was funny - lol at several points. If you don't like this kind of humor then why did you bother to even watch? I mean, damn, Kenny G!!","user":"jgrovesward2","rank":[31,43]},{"title":"I don't care what anyone else says!","rating":9,"date":"19 May 2019","review":"I don't care what anyone else says, this movie is super funny!! It cracked me up! It was silly, over the top, and still honest. Plus it made me laugh so much and so loud. My husband loved it too!!","user":"asamiblue1","rank":[21,28]}]
