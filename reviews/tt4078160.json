[{"title":"This Lesson Could Have Been Better And Conveyed A Stronger Message...","rating":5,"date":"3 April 2018","review":"I was really looking forward to this tale of revenge and learning as the premise sounded entertaining. A teacher, Mr Gale (Hands), who is ridiculed daily by his students, decides to take matters into his own hands and to elevate their learning curves by some extreme teaching methods.<br><br>You do get what you expect; there are some nasty scenes of violence and abuse. The scene where Mr Gale nails the hand of his student, Fin (Bendall), to the desk looks realistic. It's the realism which could have made this movie something special.<br><br>I've known families like Fin's and his brother's, Jake (Cox), where the brothers don't get on... to the point of arguing, fighting, and forsaking. I've also known the senseless bullies of Fin and Joel's (Coltart) order. Though I do hope that the scene in the schoolroom isn't that realistic - if it is, I pity the teachers and can understand the twenty-six-grand to study to teach the government are offering.<br><br>The trouble starts when you get to the tortuous indoctrination. Through all of the bleakness, we are then subjected to a gayfull and lunatic lesson. This departs from reality and enters the demented. Which, in itself wouldn't be a bad thing had Mr Gale been suffering from a mental break. However, this doesn't appear to be the case. Then when you throw in Fin's delusion it was enough to wrench me away from the film, thinking, what the hell(?). From here the story and character of Mr Gale become preposterous and unbelievable. I felt that both the writer and the director, Ruth Platt, were trying too hard to get their point across, making the story appear pompous and pretentious.<br><br>It's from here on in that the film falls apart.<br><br>The really ludicrous thing is the scene where Jake's Girlfriend, Tanja (Gavanski), is accosted and forced to join in the lesson. She's worried that Fin's not come home, though his brother doesn't give a damn, so she sets out to find him. She wanders the town aimlessly and just by coincidence comes across Mr Gale. This is absurd because the abduction takes place outside. How did Mr Gale know she was there, let alone that she had an interest in one of his captives.<br><br>Then there's the timeline which is totally cockeyed by the end of the film. So what started out as an okay film drops into a quagmire of below average revenge torture fodder.<br><br>If you like your revenge stories and can empathise with teachers then this may be worth a watch, though it could have been much better and even could have made a statement. Though I would say you'd be better off with the Hostel or Saw franchises.","user":"stephenabell","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Stale And Boring","rating":3,"date":"17 March 2016","review":"The premise for this really caught my interest, a teacher getting revenge on some disrespectful little brats? Sign me up. Unfortunately while watching this it became very clear that this was not going to be an ultra gory torture/revenge flick, instead it played out more like an indie drama that just happened to have a horror premise.<br><br>It starts off alright enough, the two boys are unlikable but I figured that was OK since the premise of the movie is about them being kidnapped/tortured. The big problem here though is that once the boys do get captured almost the entire rest of the movie is one big monologue delivered by the teacher character. This wouldn't be so bad if it was interesting dialogue, but it really isn't, he basically just goes through a bunch of things that the boys were supposed to learn in his class. This all leads up to a very underwhelming finale.<br><br>Once everything was all said and done I didn't really feel anything, the movie never had me attached or interested in any of the characters. There are a few scenes that I could tell were suppose to be artsy/deep but they just felt forced. Overall I just wasn't into this, there isn't enough drama to make this a good indie drama and there definitely isn't enough horror to make this a good horror movie. There really isn't much to see here and you would probably be better off skipping it.<br><br>3/10","user":"HorrorOverEverything","rank":[16,26]},{"title":"Difficult but interesting","rating":9,"date":"29 March 2016","review":"The Lesson isn't sure what it wants to be - an indie love story mixed with horror, a micro budget revenge movie. This is its main problem - it is a bit schizophrenic in terms of is genre - hardcore horror fans might not like it, as not gory enough, indie film fans might find it not art-house enough, and then there's the fact that the bulk of the rant of the main character is hard to stomach in places. But the wit and intelligence of the script shines through, and the film keeps you teetering between two moral standpoints quite effectively.<br><br>There are some really nicely observed moments placed throughout the film, like the flashbacks where the relationship between boy and mother is drawn out, and the subtle emotional abuse that the main female character is subjected to which leads to quite a gratifying and blackly funny twist at the end, for those with the patience to see it through.","user":"nezumi-790-832577","rank":[16,30]}]
