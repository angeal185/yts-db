[{"title":"A collection of 20 short-films with extraordinary stories.","rating":8,"date":"20 April 2015","review":"10 veteran masters + 10 new talents. 10+10 is a project initiated by the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival to demonstrate the solidarity between Taiwanese film-makers. 20 directors are invited to make a 5-minute short film each on the theme of the \"Uniqueness of Taiwan,\" but allowed total freedom in all other aspects. The Festival believes that this collaboration would be a great inspiration for film-makers and audiences. 10+10 doesn't quite add up to 20 in this varied collection of Taiwanese shorts by some of the island's leading filmmakers. Commissioned by the Tapei Golden Horse Film Festival, each movie was given a five-minute running time to speak about \"the uniqueness of Taiwan\" on its 100-year anniversary, with the results ranging from more accessible genre fare to minimalist mood pieces to commentaries on local politics and pop stars that only aficionados will grasp. A Berlin Panorama slot, plus the participation of Hou Hsiao-Hsien, should ensure further fest bids and a small-scale DVD release.","user":"kadalpura","rank":[3,3]}]
