[{"title":"Great idea, disappointing execution","rating":4,"date":"24 November 2016","review":"I agree with and try to live in accordance with the central idea that this documentary is trying to get across - focus on the important things rather than on consumer objects. But this documentary was a disappointment - I didn't even get all the way through. It's light on content, repeating the same basic ideas over and over. And using the book tour as a central narrative was dull and made the documentary look like an advert for the book.<br><br>Instead, I would have loved to have seen other issues explored. How do different minimalists do it differently? Is minimalism just a way of having a nice low-stress life or do people use it as a basis for helping others? What are some practical ways of reducing costs? How do people blend it with other alternative ways of living? How have people lived minimally in history? Does it work better in a city or the countryside? etc.","user":"rjlbatty","rank":[145,159]},{"title":"An easy introduction to minimalism","rating":8,"date":"12 April 2017","review":"I think most reviews here don't get the point. It's not supposed to give you a plan for how to live like a minimalist. This is a documentary made for people who don't already live minimalist and haven't done any reading on the subject. This could serve as a great wake up call for many and all Western materialists should watch it. It's like an easy introduction to the topic.<br><br>It doesn't do much for someone who already lives like that but so what? \"I rather read blogs on the subject and bla bla bla\", yeah okay sorry guess what? You are the egotistic hipster you so much like to mock. You don't need guidelines or blogs to live a minimalist life. To be able to choose minimalism is always a huge privilege as you can see in this documentary and I think this fact makes it easier for Western people to relate and absorb something from Minimalism.","user":"falcksandra","rank":[51,58]},{"title":"Misses The Boat","rating":4,"date":"16 June 2016","review":"I have been getting into Minimalism and reading the blogs/listening to the podcasts of not only The Minimalist but many others featured in this film. So when notices came up about this movie I thought, heck ya, I'll go see it. And ,I'm sure like some others in the theater, I dragged along a loved one to see what they thought.<br><br>The unfortunate thing is that this movie gives out nothing of practical value to one who has not been researching, reading books, and watching YouTube videos on the subject. It's a nice promo and there is a smattering of interesting information...but not much.<br><br>The problem is on both ends of the spectrum. At the beginning of the spectrum is \"what do I DO to be minimalist?\" and the other end of the spectrum is \"what is my actual end PURPOSE in becoming a minimalist?\" This movie does not really address either end.<br><br>If you wanna talk PURPOSE go read James Wallman's Stuffocation. Brilliant book. Why do I and others get into Minimalism? Minimalism is the stepping stone towards clearing the way to going after what you REALLY want. Wallman's book discusses it in detail. This movie should have had a lot more of that. Especially in the case of Colin Wright. They had Colin Wright in the movie for, like, a minute. But his story is a lot more interesting. For him, Minimalism was not the end game...travel was the end game. Minimalism is how he achieved it. There should have been a lot more stories in the movie along this vein.<br><br>So how about the beginning of the spectrum? Here they failed too. Before the movie started a loud couple behind me were chatting away and one couldn't help but hear the conversation. The woman asked \"does this have anything to do with that woman who wrote the Tidying Up book?\" I couldn't help but inwardly smirk slightly...except in the end this woman had a point.<br><br>Some practical advice on HOW to go minimalist would have been as handy as some \"other spectrum end\" stuff on the why of it. There was a little bit about the 333 Project, but hell, The Minimalists didn't even discuss the famous \"packing party.\" Numerous 5-minute videos on YouTube are going to give you more practical advice than you get here. There wasn't even any talk about psychology or your relationship to your things. This is an important aspect of the topic.<br><br>A few good things: that woman who discussed marketing and advertising...she was good. Interesting story about that newscaster that lost it on air. And Sam Harris. You can always give me more Sam Harris.","user":"mowasteph","rank":[78,92]}]
