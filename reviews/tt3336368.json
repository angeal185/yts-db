[{"title":"Great movie for preschoolers","rating":10,"date":"31 October 2014","review":"No violence whatsoever, an uplifting message (hatred comes from fear and fear comes from lack of understanding), an intelligent story, beautiful pictures and animation, humor adjusted to the level of small kids. I found not a single flaw in this movie. My 3 and a half year old daughter was delighted.<br><br>Of course, and this results from the above, adults should prepare themselves for an hour and a half nap. This is not \"Shrek\", people. But this is no reason to lower the rating of a movie that is clearly directed at preschoolers.<br><br>Some people complain that they did not find it as amusing as the original Maya series 30 years ago. Of course they didn't! They were 4 years old back then and now they are 30+. So how could they feel the same emotions?<br><br>My rating: 10/10","user":"marac","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"Bee yourself!","rating":9,"date":"20 October 2014","review":"Maya is one of the most delightful and sparkling characters to come out of a kids film in a long time. In a way reminiscent of Miyazaki's youngest heroine's this little bee stands up to authority and keeps just asking questions.<br><br>The movie is spectacularly beautiful. There is a rich meadow world that comes alive. My two girls were spellbound for the whole film. The 4 year old can get scared easily in films (the poster of The Boxtrolls was enough to scare her) but she was happily cheering Maya on. The whole bug world comes alive in song and dance that is so charming - the girls were singing all afternoon.<br><br>There was enough humour for grownups too. There are a couple of ants (voiced by the Umbilical Bros) that really steal the show. Jackie Weaver as evil Buzzlina had just the right amount of scare and fun in her portrayal. The other voices, Richard Roxburgh and Noah Taylor, etc. did such a great job.<br><br>Take your kids, it's a great time at the movies.","user":"xoxojimmy","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"FANTASTIC animated movie for big and little kids alike!","rating":10,"date":"20 October 2014","review":"I was lucky enough to attend the Australian premiere of Maya the Bee Movie and cannot express how much my kids (aged 7 and 4 years old) and I ADORED this movie.<br><br>It's a beautiful story about a feisty little bee called Maya who doesn't fit in with the other bees in the hive. Maya goes on a journey of self- discovery, meeting lots of insect friends along the way. The main message of the movie is the importance of BEE-ing yourself: something which is important for kids to see from a strong female character who is neither a princess or a wizard (thank goodness!).<br><br>My little ones were fully captivated for 80 minutes straight (shock horror) and talked about their favourite scenes and characters in the car on the way home. The filmmakers did a superb job making the film colourful and appealing with gorgeous CG animation, and the story is really something special that everyone can relate to.<br><br>I strongly urge all parents who have little ones to go see Maya the Bee Movie - the 'buzz' surrounding the film is well deserved!","user":"stephmountzouris","rank":[10,11]}]
