[{"title":"Rare gay theme thriller is a modest effort","rating":7,"date":"3 November 2019","review":"Gay themed thrillers are a rarity in the film world. This modest effort starts out well enough. Joseph, a loner/lonely Gay man goes to Fire Island looking for escape from his unhappy job as a lawyer, fun and connection only to discover he's come off season, and doesn't have a clue of what he's going to do or where he'll stay. Warned about the meatrack by an older Gay man (played almost as a predator to the enormous discredit of the script/director), Joseph allows a stranger (but a young handsome stranger) to lure him into the meatrack. Joseph is drugged and mugged, stumbles with a cloudy head and senses of perception towards the beach and sees someone dragging a body to the edge of the water, he runs off and passes out.<br><br>When he comes to he is in the living room of a classic Fire Island modernist home where Cameron, apparently the man who found him passed out has brought him to recover. Is Cameron actually a savior, or is he part of the looming dangers of Fire Island?<br><br>The film introduces a cast of house guests and it's pretty obvious that Rafael, the hottest, sexiest and most fuckable of all the film's characters is trouble.<br><br>The film builds small tensions, but ends with an abrupt stop that left me completely unsatisfied.","user":"cjenson123123","rank":[52,58]},{"title":"Achieved it's intention - in my opinion","rating":7,"date":"3 November 2019","review":"A story of coming out to oneself but choosing the wrong path.<br><br>There is no denying there is suspense fully developed in this plot. The situations Joseph finds himself in are questionable and the intentions of the cottage group is left wide open for the viewer to interpret. Yes, there are holes in the plot, that's my reason for just 7 stars. But the overall effect of the story succeeded in building a level of suspense and mystery.","user":"cekadah","rank":[61,69]},{"title":"Enjoyed it","rating":8,"date":"2 November 2019","review":"I wish more gay movies were like this - it's certainly not perfect, but also not just like most gay movies. The diverse cast, bomb soundtrack, and beautiful scenery really pull it all together.","user":"sludlow-48535","rank":[66,76]}]
