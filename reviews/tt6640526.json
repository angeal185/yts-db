[{"title":"I don't get it...","rating":2,"date":"12 December 2018","review":"I watched this film because I thought it would be informative as to police brutality, and a documentary on their approach to document said. They did show a few examples of police wrong doing, yet I got more of a let's piss cops off so we can make a documentary.<br><br>I gave it a 2 for the valid shot's of cop's doing wrong. Very hard to watch as far as quality of shooting.","user":"bairjohn","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"1/10","rating":1,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"Probably would've been better had a man directed this","user":"bigjewnig","rank":[6,14]},{"title":"Well told and emotional!","rating":10,"date":"19 November 2017","review":"I highly recommend this film made by a dedicated crew. Very important topic!!! Police misconduct effects us all. I loved watching this well told story - the men and women who walk the streets keeping our officers on the straight and narrow are modern day heroes. I highly recommend this watchable import and documentary.","user":"sarah-522","rank":[7,29]}]
