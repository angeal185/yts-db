[{"title":"Pretty Difficult to Sit Through","rating":2,"date":"23 March 2017","review":"I can't really fault the sets or effects as the entire set is pretty limited. Cinematography is OK, Audio is OK, Sound Track is serviceable and thankfully not annoying.<br><br>Kuhnke (as \"Mats\") does a pretty solid job given a pretty weak script. Salt (as \"Edwards\" aka Stick-Girl) and McArdle (as \"Parks\" aka Dough-Boy) are both unsuitable to be cast as \"military personnel\" and unforgivable as \"SEALs\". Why IN THE WORLD did they cast a woman as a SEAL Team Commander? Seriously?... and a pallid, anorexic one at that? If you're as tired of the SJW/Feminist pandering that goes on in film as I am, you might want to pass this one up .... otherwise be prepared to see yet another 85lb supposed \"super woman\" with arms about the size of my 2-year old's throwing around a guy three times her size - eventually killing him with her bare hands. <br><br>Right. <br><br>SO believable. <br><br>Additionally, the lack of discipline in both conduct and language coming from these supposedly \"elite\" soldiers is laughably bad - watching the two \"SEALS\" argue is like watching an old married couple fight.... and they fight a LOT. Since the writer apparently didn't seem to know any military personnel, he at least could have watched \"The Abyss\" a few times before writing his highly pressurized SEALs ;)<br><br>I can't help but think that if the movie had been cast with believable characters, it would have added a star or two to the rating - even with the hideous dialog.<br><br>There isn't a lot more to the movie, so I'll close with the suggestion that if you want to see a movie similar in many ways to this one, yet superior in every way, check out \"Pressure\"(2015) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3029476/","user":"joe6629","rank":[24,37]},{"title":"Sub sea level/par feminist movement","rating":4,"date":"29 March 2017","review":"A steely looking Tom Hanks lookalike lends his expertise and sea craft to a small special ops team on a recovery mission.<br><br>We soon realise he is just a proto-main character and he quickly makes way for the female team leader to take charge of the storyline and screen. The mission quickly becomes a fight for survival as she makes one cretinous decision after another.<br><br>Eventually she is challenged by her right hand man who is three times her size and has already knocked out a similarly sized character with a single punch. This is no problem for her though as she rips his shoulder out of it's socket then strangles him with her bare hands, but not before delivering some edgy put downs.<br><br>In a final twist, her henchman rises from the dead and attacks Tom Hanks who by this time has been reduced to a useless damsel in distress. Not to worry. Our tiny heroine is on hand to save the day and kill him a second time! By this point I got the impression the audience was supposed to be rooting for her, which wasn't easy after her moronic actions had effectively killed everyone on board.<br><br>Inevitably, the female is the only survivor and ends up stranded in the middle of the ocean. Couldn't have happened to a better person.<br><br>Great if you're still not tired of the slowly dwindling feminist/sjw agenda.","user":"imatosser182","rank":[19,32]},{"title":"Chamber of blandness","rating":3,"date":"19 November 2019","review":"There was no intent on hating on 'The Chamber' before seeing it, and actually do wish that it was a halfway decent film. Would never watch any film, television series etc. with that attitude, do find that an immature way of judging a film, and actually did like the concept. And despite how some of my reviews may sound, this is somebody who tries to be encouraging when rating and reviewing a film, while offering any necessary criticism, and hates hating on them.<br><br>Even when trying to see it with an open mind, 'The Chamber' just didn't work for me. It is not a completely awful film, irredeemable films are not an awful lot, though not exactly rare, compared to the billions of films that exist as of now. From personal view (again), 'The Chamber' is also not a particularly good film at all, mind you this is agsin a very subjective opinion that is, and there is a lot that works against it that outweighs the little that works in its favour.<br><br>Starting with the least bad things, the acting was serviceable, with an engaging lead performance from Johannes Kuhnke in particular. The visuals also to me weren't too bad, have seen far cheaper-looking films, the sets are limited but the photography shows some skill and atmosphere and the editing has coherence.<br><br>Audio wasn't too unappealing either, it didn't sound too loud or like it was placed too predictably.<br><br>On the other hand, 'The Chamber' badly suffers from a complete lack of tension and suspense, and some of it does get rather on the ridiculous side. The pace never really comes to life, so too much of the film is bland and dull. Despite the best efforts of the actors, the characters' illogical character behaviours and sketchy character developments did work against them, a shame because the actual performances were as said not bad at all.<br><br>Furthermore, the story is completely flat and has no tension or suspense whatsoever, it's little more than a dreary muddle with absolutely nothing felt throughout. Pancakes have more life than the script and more natural dialogue has been found in an episode of the worst of Cartoon Network or something, not that that is much of an endorsement.<br><br>In summary, weak but have seen far worse. 3/10","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[2,2]}]
