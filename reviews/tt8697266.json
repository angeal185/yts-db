[{"title":"Comeback Baby","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2019","review":"I am a man and have always liked Iliza. I loved her first special, yet found the follow-ups to be a bit disappointing. Here, with Elder Millennial, it seems that Iliza is on the comeback trail. She is an energetic comic, and has voices and schticks that make her unique; here she uses them judiciously. Also, she is a pretty lady, quite easy on the eyes, but always willing to blast that pretty image to smithereens. This show is not constant hilarity. But it is always entertaining.","user":"j-lacerra","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"I can't help but wonder if the low reviews are men","rating":9,"date":"10 August 2018","review":"I mean, I'm an elder millennial white female so I'm sure that's why I can relate so much. I love that she gets real and turns it funny. She's also so animated an not afraid to make fun of herself. If you are against lipstick feminism, this wouldn't be your thing but it's totally mine.","user":"missryd","rank":[30,55]},{"title":"Funny stuff","rating":9,"date":"26 August 2018","review":"I laughed out loud several times and what more could you want? And to everybody talking about 'not being able to relate'; I am female but that doesn't mean I didn't laugh at Bernie Mac talking about giving his girl the D... comedy is funny or not and Iliza is funny.","user":"lynnopla","rank":[14,23]}]
