If you want an honest indicator of how good this film is: look at the trailer. The \"Space Babes\" spaceship is made of cardboard and the control console is literally covered in tin foil. Look, this film came out in 2017, not 1966. There is no reason whatsoever to make a film as poor as this. To even call it a \"film\" besmirches the more respectable, talented artists who work tirelessly to create cinematic masterpieces. Space Babes is so bad that it doesn't even deserve a Razzie. Last year's Razzie winner compared to this would be an Oscar contender. Truly one of the worst things I have ever seen in my life. It has no redeeming value whatsoever.<br><br>I implore you: don't waste your time. Watching paint dry is far more entertaining than this garbage.","user":"MinistryofDoom","rank":[4,5]}]
