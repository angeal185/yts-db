[{"title":"A Delightful Family Film","rating":7,"date":"25 August 1999","review":"There is only one movie in history that I can name that my wife, my mother and my six-year-old daughter enjoyed equally. This is it.<br><br>This is an astonishly effective and pleasant remake of a very good film. It's light, romantic, touching and downright funny. You cannot pour enough accolades on young Lindsay Lohan, who effortlessly plays both twins, and, if you listen closely, juggles four accents. (She changes her Brit accent when she plays her own American alter-ego pretending to be herself in England - if you saw the film, you know what I mean).<br><br>Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid with that big, goofy, infectious smile, give the film its romance and maturity, without stepping on the fun-filled kid's plot. This is simple, easy-to-watch family entertainment.<br><br>There is also a great editing and effects element. You never once notice a split screen or cheap over-the-shoulder shot when both of Lohan's characters are on-screen - its really quite astounding how seamless it is.<br><br>My daughter, after seeing this in the theater, quickly proclaimed this her favourite movie ever. We own the video, and I have watched it with her at least a dozen times without growing tired.<br><br>A perfect rental after a bad day, or when you want to have a family movie night. *** out of ****.","user":"DanB-4","rank":[110,117]},{"title":"A delight","rating":6,"date":"6 October 2001","review":"I think that this is the best Walt Disney film that I have seen since  The Last Flight Of Noah's Ark. It is a delight from start to finish and  every bit as wonderful, perhaps even better then the originial. This ia  a welcome return to the good old fashioned clean family films Disney  used to make. The soundtrack is wonderful and Lindsey Lohan is a great  little actress who plays the two parts very well (I love her British  accent). Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson were terrific at playing  Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara's old parts. A young actress named  Elaine Hendrix is a great comic villianess. I detested her character  and laughed my head off when those girls gave her just what she  deserved. Some people might say that this plot is old and clich√©d by  the standards of today, but it still works. They should release this on  a double bill with the original. I hope Disney keeps on making films  like this, goes back to \"the good old days\" so to speak.","user":"dtucker86","rank":[79,87]},{"title":"Good natured fun","rating":8,"date":"19 July 2006","review":"This is one of those rare cases where a terrific movie is equaled by its remake. Hayley Mills carried the dual roles of twins learning of each other's existence and concocting a plot to reunite their divorced parents splendidly in the '60's version, and Lindsay Lohan showed wonderful comedic talent at an early age in this delightful remake.<br><br>It's a Disney flick, so the comedy is family slapstick variety as you would expect. The evil stepmother-to-be is over-the-top evil (even called Cruella De Ville by one of the girls), and she's a character you love to hate. The obvious chemistry of the parents (Randy Quaid and Natasha Richardson) is great, and begs a question which is never answered to satisfaction, \"Why did they split up in the first place?\" Everything in the film symbolically shows that they were made for each other: even their respective maid and butler take a shine to each other.<br><br>The fx and editing to stand Lohan's two characters together is magnificently done; it really looks like two actresses. No split screens, backs of heads of fake-looking \"doubles\" etc. to distract you from the movie. Lohan skillfully contrasts the American/British accents and mannerisms of the two girls; you know and believe which twin she is at any given moment.<br><br>Well directed, well acted and fun. I'll even forgive the film makers for ripping off the stranded-in-the-lake scene from \"Meatballs.\" The closing credit snapshots provide a sweet epilogue to tie up loose ends.<br><br>Good family oriented comedy worth a rental.","user":"MartianOctocretr5","rank":[42,46]}]
