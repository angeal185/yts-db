[{"title":"Charming with a bit too much Cheese","rating":6,"date":"28 August 2015","review":"I won't be the first in saying this movie was a bit slanted toward the cheesy, campy side of Disney. But then again, what Disney Channel movie isn't? I would like to point out, however, that the leads (Mal and Ben) were relatively believable (and likable) characters. I'm not spoiling the movie when I say that Dove Cameron did well at portraying an independent young woman with conflictions about living up to her mother's expectations. On the good side, Mitchell Hope made me believe he was the son of a Disney prince and princess (now king and queen).<br><br>Granted, there were several times I wanted to stop watching this film due to the gross amount of cheese and horrible scripts, but I stayed each time for those moments of sincerity and sometimes cleverness. I will probably watch this movie again, and maybe again after that. (Guilty pleasures...) Oh, and P.S. Kristin Chenoweth is an amazing actress who was clearly having fun with her role. She might have come off as mostly cartoonish, but there were some moments where she brought the dread-factor in some subtle ways.","user":"jonbee-39559","rank":[31,34]},{"title":"looved it!","rating":8,"date":"26 February 2017","review":"Wow, what a great movie!! So, High School Musical is my favorite Disney original musicals. But this is in 3rd place. The concept and story is so cool and I love the chemistry between all the actors. Dove Cameron is so great in this and you really believe in her character as Maleficent's daughter. The songs are great and they are so fun and they are so catchy! I love this movie and I am excited for the second one.","user":"snperera","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Rotten to the core","rating":6,"date":"1 August 2015","review":"Disney's Descendants is a miracle of campy film-making. The cheese levels are off the charts as the teenaged children of the Disney villains sing, dance, and fall in love with their heroic counterparts.<br><br>The highlights have to be the so bad it's awful rap rendition of \"Be Our Guest,\" the depiction of Maleficent as a tap dancing fiend, and the rest of the villains being depicted as washed up home-bodies who vegetate on the couch all day.<br><br>To be fair to the younger actors, they're game with their performances. The script feels like a fan fiction written by middle school age kids with plot holes galore: how did the villains reproduce? I'm guessing they either asexually budded or hooked up with other villains to produce them? Also, if the nerdy Doug is the son of Dopey, then who's his mother? And this is just the icing on the cake: why is Prince Ben okay with Mal slipping him a love potion? How did the wand summon Maleficent when the fairy godmother's kid just wanted to use it to make herself beautiful? Ah, who cares? This is guilty pleasure level fun and I'm sad to say I'll probably watch it again.","user":"MissSimonetta","rank":[30,38]}]
