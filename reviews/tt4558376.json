[{"title":"Not a Comedy","rating":2,"date":"22 February 2020","review":"I thought this was a comedy. It is not. Also, it is not a drama. It's like watching a home movie with two people who don't really love, or like, each other very much. And then nothing happens. Two of my favorite comedic actors are in this bucket of boredom and that makes me sad.","user":"tsdennison-63370","rank":[30,34]},{"title":"Skip this and watch \"Force Majeure\" (2014)","rating":1,"date":"5 February 2020","review":"As the other user review suggested, this film has already been made, it's called \"Force Majeure\" and it's outstanding.<br><br>It's a complete ripoff of \"Force Majeure\" without any apoligies. \"Downhill\" lacks the character and emotional depth of \"Force Majeure\", plus it's sorely miscast in every way.<br><br>If you're at all interested in \"Downhill\", do yourself a favor and watch \"Force Majeure\" instead.","user":"leezureworld","rank":[106,146]},{"title":"Not a single enjoyable minute","rating":1,"date":"4 March 2020","review":"Joyless and boring.
