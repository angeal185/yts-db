After the first 10 minutes of watching, the person starts to loose some braincells. After watching whole movie, the person is just a brainless creature and you could leave them alone, untied, with the doors open and they won't be able to escape because that's what the Emoji movie did to their brain.","user":"kamilaa-14836","rank":[95,111]},{"title":"Terrible Film!","rating":1,"date":"11 May 2019","review":"I hate this movie so much! It wasted such perfectly good voice actors, and it was a waste of product placement! Man, it ripped off Wreck-it Ralph, The Lego Movie, and Inside Out! The jokes are just stupid! Sure, the animation was fine and all, but still!","user":"athaggard","rank":[65,96]},{"title":"Terrible!!!","rating":1,"date":"20 May 2019","review":"Don't watch it, you'll waste your life!!!
