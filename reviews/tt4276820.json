[{"title":"A tale of treachery, greed and a code of ethics toxic enough to spoil a Big Mac.","rating":8,"date":"26 November 2016","review":"Biographical dramas tell stories about significant people in history but they are always much more than that. The person chosen for the bio-pic reflects something about the values of the era and the society from which they came. In this sense, The Founder (2016) goes well beyond the story of a global hamburger empire to the values that made McDonald's possible and it does not paint a pretty picture. The mantra \"persistence is everything\" is heard at the beginning and the end of this film but when decoded it means persistent treachery, greed, and a code of ethics toxic enough to remove some gloss from the world's most recognised golden arches.<br><br>The real founders are brothers Maurice (John Lynch) and Richard McDonald (Nick Offerman) who pioneered the idea of standardised burgers made quickly that led to the modern fast-food industry. Into their lives came Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a struggling milkshake-mixer salesman who is amazed at the queues of people lined up for burgers and fries. The brothers trust Ray, tell him their secrets, and in 1954 Ray becomes the franchise manager responsible for setting up new stores. Driven by insatiable greed, Ray wants to go national but the brothers fear loss of quality control. When Ray realises that owning the property on which stores operate gives him complete control of the business, his takeover plans are rolled into place.<br><br>The storyline follows the facts of history but it is the film's characterisations that are its real achievement. Perhaps best known for his extraordinary performance in Birdman (2014) Michael Keaton is in a class of his own when it comes to portraying deeply flawed people living on the edge of sanity or evil. From the opening scenes his eyes express callous disregard for others, and at one point he boasts that if a competitor was drowning he would not hesitate to put a running hose deep down the victim's throat. His flawed humanity is contrasted by the authenticity and honesty represented by the brothers. Excellent casting, directing and period sets make this a thoroughly engaging story.<br><br>This film also arrives with remarkable timing given the current global spotlight on the home of capitalism. Millions of McDonald's fans are regularly processed by one of the most sophisticated marketing machines on the planet. Seeing The Founder is a bit like finding out that Santa Claus is Satan in disguise. Good cinema not only entertains: it shows the world as it is, not as we believe it should be. The Founder tells a story that should be told, and it does it brilliantly.","user":"CineMuseFilms","rank":[241,279]},{"title":"Keaton shines in this fascinating biopic","rating":8,"date":"24 November 2016","review":"For many the thought nowadays of takeaway food is but a convenience we all enjoy (some more than others) but at one stage during human history the very idea of having your burger, fries and ice-cold Coke ready in mere seconds was a novelty that began sweeping the nation of America before taking over the world as we now know it today. <br><br>A staple for over 60 years, McDonalds restaurants are a mainstay of everyday life, a reliable source of cheeseburger delicacies, crispy French fries and refreshing beverages that continue to supply the goods to those both young and those young at heart. When consuming McDonalds however, its unlikely many of us have ever truly considered where this establishment was born from and thankfully for all us, the story is a real doozy. <br><br>It's often the case these days that high profile, well-marketed biopics are reliable as a Big Mac (you always know what you're going to get) but John Lee Hancock's film is imbedded with both an energy and pace that elevates it above the usual bio-fair and with another awards worthy turn from Michael Keaton as its centrepiece, this enthralling slice of history is a fabulously entertaining ride tinged in nostalgic 1950's vibes and garnished with a quick- smart script from The Wrestler screenwriter Robert D. Siegel. <br><br>Capturing the time, place and allurement of this mankind changing business model, The Founder does a great job of transporting us back in time as we ride alongside struggling salesman Ray Kroc, whose eyes are opened when he comes across the McDonald brothers, whose business model of \"fast food\" finally gives Ray the chance his so longed for all his life, to make a buck and then some. <br><br>Keaton's performance as Kroc is quite the feat. His a genuinely cold and calculated character but as the film begins we are happy to see him put in the hard yards as his franchise model of stores takes off but as the brand grows so does Kroc's ego and Keaton's performance morphs naturally as it does in fascinating and unexpected ways.<br><br>Come the films later stages, the real feat of Keaton's turn comes into the spotlight and what we're left with is a layered character brought to life by the performer, whether it's in comical situations or brutally raw moments shared with lawyers, Keaton is on fire here and while his ably supported by the likes of Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as the unfortunate McDonald brothers Dick and Mac, The Founder is founded off the back of Keaton's turn and whilst unlikely that this film will find itself in to many awards categories, Keaton is looming as a key player in the upcoming awards season.<br><br>The Founder is one of those rare biopics that grabs you from the get-go and doesn't let up. <br><br>A well shot, scored and acted studio film that tells a story worth telling (plus one of the best advertisements McDonald's has never paid for), The Founder offers a fascinating insight into the beginnings of the McDonald's brand that also gives us an equally fascinating real life figure and another chance for the career revival of Michael Keaton to continue on its merry way. <br><br>4 milkshake sachets out of 5","user":"eddie_baggins","rank":[75,84]},{"title":"The Founder is the McDonalds version of There Will Be Blood...and I'm lovin it","rating":9,"date":"13 February 2017","review":"When somebody like myself can describe their childhood as always remembering the golden arches from the McDonalds, I don't know whether to describe this memory as sad, like an imprinted advertisement, or simply American. Regardless of the opinion of their food, McDonalds is the standing example of the American dream, both for the consumer and the businesspeople. For a typical family, they have the option of forgoing the hard work of cooking in favor of having hamburgers in a short time (I never said it's a good thing, just an option). For the entrepreneur, McDonalds is more then just a restaurant; it's a success story of an American company that has gone global. <br><br>McDonalds today represents American capitalism; always expanding, always trying to please the customer, and always ruthless. For a company that has prided itself off of its food, they've been criticized for the health factor and their aggressive marketing tactics. A lot of a companies behavior goes back to the ones the started it. It may be the case for a lot of companies like Apple, Starbucks, Wal Mart, and Playboy, but McDonalds actually had two beginnings. Their stories are shown in The Founder. <br><br>Milkshake maker salesman Ray Kroc (played by Michael Keaton) seems to be doing well at his job, but is striving for something bigger. His usual sales to restaurants and drive-ins give him a glimpse at the flaws of these places including wrong food orders, long waits, and loud atmosphere full of teens. When an order for eight mixers is placed by a restaurant in San Bernardino, Kroc drives out there to see this \"McDonalds\". What he encounters is a revolutionary speed system that allows food to ready fast along with disposable paper and a family friendly environment. Kroc meets the McDonalds brothers, Dick (played by Nick Offerman) and Mac (played by John Carroll Lynch) who convinces them to let him help franchise the restaurant. <br><br>Kroc at first has a hard time convincing investors to join in on this new restaurant idea, and the few wealthy ones that do try to do things their own way (including fried chicken on the menu!). Once he gets the idea that middle class investors are more likely to follow the McDonalds standards, restaurants start to explode across the Midwest and the business takes off like crazy. As Kroc gains power, he starts to become more defiant against the McDonalds brothers, despite being restricted by their original contract.<br><br>My original fear was that The Founder was simply going to be a commercial for McDonalds. What I got instead was a very fascinating character study into the mind of Ray Kroc. A bad screenplay could have easily made Ray Kroc a pioneer or a monster, but this somehow balances out everything in a fair viewpoint. You don't agree with a lot of the tactics Kroc does to make the burger business boom, but the movie shows where he's coming from. They also portray him as vulnerable, as they show later that one of the companies biggest tactics comes from a third party.<br><br>Michael Keaton is perfect as Ray Kroc. He balances the scripts tough job of making him tough and backstabbing, yet likable enough that you still want to follow him.<br><br>I have to give a lot of credit to both Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as the McDonalds brothers who have the caliber to pull off the perfectionist, yet na√Øve attitude that the original siblings had. <br><br>The Founder is neither a pro or anti McDonalds movie. This is more like Patton or Nightcrawler; it's a study on a person in which your supposed to make your own judgment on. <br><br>I'll give this nine McDonalds logos out of ten. Had I seen this last year, it probably would've ended up on the best of 2016. The good news is that even without the accolades it missed out on, The Founder is still a good movie from start to finish. Check it out and see if your lovin it like I am.","user":"RforFilm","rank":[31,34]}]
