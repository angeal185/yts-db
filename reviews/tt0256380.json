[{"title":"The most meaningful of the Brothers movies","rating":10,"date":"24 October 2012","review":"This is my favorite of all the Farrelly Brothers movies. It's laugh out loud funny, and yet has a very well delivered message about internal and external beauty without being preachy. I think this one will be a classic in time to come because all the scenes are well written. <br><br>Gwyneth Paltrow as Rosemary manages to convey emotion through the fat suit and that is not mean feat. Jack Black as Hal is just right for the role that deservedly made him a star. The supporting cast is excellent from Jason Alexander to all those who play all the various characters.<br><br>I've watched it several times and it's still good. If you haven't seen it - it's hilarious and touching.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[14,14]},{"title":"One of the sweetest movies I've ever seen!","rating":8,"date":"9 July 2002","review":"No contest, I will say this marks the best of the Farrelly Brothers.  Not because this film is laugh-out-loud funny--it's funny, but not hilarious--but because it has a great heart and delivers a beautiful message without any corny Hollywood pretentions.  Sure, the premise is funny--a shallow guy gets virtually hypnotized into thinking all the unattractive women he sees are foxes and ends up going out with a 500-pound woman who he also thinks is a fox.  It's a great premise, but the Farrellys don't fixate on that premise alone, preventing it from turning it into a lame, one-joke slapstick comedy.  This is a comedy with heart--a rare finding.  In between laughs, you really get wrapped up in the characters and storyline.  The gags flow quite naturally, without the Farrellys forcing any humor onto the screen.  If a comic opportunity comes along, they take advantage, but there's no random acts of slapstick.<br><br>I am pleasantly surprised with Jack Black, who has proved in this movie that he doesn't only have what it takes as a comic actor, but also as a serious actor and a romantic lead.  I've always enjoyed seeing him on screen, but he usually plays the same wound-up, hyperkinetic characters.  Basically, he's funny, but you still know you're watching Jack Black on screen.  This time he exercises his ability as a method actor, he succeeds well.  Gwyneth Paltrow is adorable and sweet, capturing the audience's sympathy with her winning smile.  Joe Viterelli is amusing as her overweight Irish father, and actually pulls off a fairly convincing Irish accent.  The sizzling hot Brooke Burns makes a few appearances.  And Jason Alexander is always a joy to watch.<br><br>I think \"Shallow Hal\" does the best job at conveying the message that beauty is on the inside.  It has been conveyed before in films like \"The Nutty Professor,\" but I feel this film conveyed it best.  This could've easily been a 105-minute fat joke, but it doesn't travel that route.  There are no crude or mean-spirited gags.  Could it be that the Farrelly Brothers matured?  Even of the films of theirs that I liked (ex.:  \"Dumb and Dumber,\" \"There's Something About Mary\") are a little uneven and contain a few gags that are just plain cruel.  Like in \"Mary,\" Cameron Diaz's brother is mentally ill and the butt of a few jokes.  Here, we have a character that walks on both his arms and legs, but he's portrayed as a normal character, and not as a gimmick for some cheap laughs.  There are moments that really tugged at my heartstrings.  The \"burn victim\" scene brought quite a few tears to my eyes.  The story is solid, with no boring lulls.  And the soundtrack is pretty good--I have criticized the Farrellys in the past for using crappy music in their sountracks.<br><br>If you're looking for a good romantic/date movie with some good laughs and a good message, \"Shallow Hal\" will be an absolute delight.<br><br>\nMy score:  8 (out of 10)","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[110,129]},{"title":"Not even close to being as bad as you are led to believe!","rating":9,"date":"17 February 2015","review":"From the posters and trailers, you'd expect the Farrelly Brothers to be crude and offensive with this kind of material but it really isn't. It has a much deeper message than it appears. It knows when to be funny and knows when to be serious. Why so many people disliked it and why critics panned it is totally beyond me!<br><br>The movie is about a man named Hal, played by Jack Black, who judges women based on their looks. He keeps failing at it and his attractive neighbor, Jill, even turns him down after he begs her to go out with him. The next day at his job, he's bummed that he didn't get that big promotion and happens to bump into Tony Robbins in the elevator while leaving his work. They get stuck in the elevator and Hal explains him his love life. Robbins then puts a spell on him to see the inner beauty in women so that he can judge a woman based on her personality. Suddenly, things starts to change for Hal. His best friend Mauricio (played by Jason Alexander) notices Hal's fresh new standards with his taste in women and doesn't like it one bit. Hal then begins dating a woman who is overweight named Rosemary, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. He sees her as a beautiful, petite woman and they hit it off. Mauricio, who is much more picky with women and more shallow than Hal, can't believe it.<br><br>That's the plot for you and I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that the story is predictable and the characters are memorable. I can't give the cast enough credit for doing such a wonderful job and it's interesting to see Jack Black like you've never seen him before, departing from his usual slacker/stoner role that he's given. Shallow Hal is a movie with a lot of brains and heart to it, as well as a great date movie. There's more to this movie than it appears, so watch it before you say negative things about it and you may be surprised!","user":"sethmlanders","rank":[11,11]}]
