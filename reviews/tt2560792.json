[{"title":"Astonishingly awful.","rating":1,"date":"27 August 2018","review":"Nothing about this farce is worthy of even one star. It was a toxic mix of technical stupidity, ridiculous improbability, uninspired writing and the worst 'acting' I have ever seen. I almost had a coronary infarction when this one moron seemed to climb out on the wing (at 200+ mph) to chop off an engine...with a small hatchet. This abortion was apparently, judging from the credits, made somewhere in the Balkans, even though the HB tail number of the plane belongs to Switzerland. If that other reviewer who claimed to be an airline pilot really is one, I hope to hell nobody I care for ever rides with him.","user":"krs-8","rank":[32,36]},{"title":"Don't bother - this review had more budget and suspense","rating":1,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"Where do I start... ? Bad acting, stupid plot-twists... it just sucked from start to end.\nLow budget is no excuse! This is clearly an attempt to lure actors to a studio so producers could molest them, and then release this piece of crap to hide the fact.. \nDo not waste your money on this.","user":"ron-744-521939","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"I hope this was supposed to be a comedy","rating":1,"date":"22 July 2018","review":"You do not develop an infection from a gunshot wound within 5 minutes of being shot. You do not immediately pass out when you don't have access to insulin when you are a diabetic. WHO WROTE THIS SCRIPT??? You could at least google a medical condition before you insert it into your plot. This movie is hilariously terrible.","user":"emrldgarden-25920","rank":[47,57]}]
