[{"title":"Worst movie I have ever seen","rating":1,"date":"15 May 2019","review":"Please somebody kill the script writer, Aladdin is a good character in cartoons and cartoon series has better script, I don't want to become spoiler but believe me , Don't waste your time to watch this movie or don't waste your money on this movie.","user":"waseemrazajafri","rank":[62,65]},{"title":"Unbelievably bad","rating":1,"date":"15 May 2019","review":"Combine one miserably written script, a bunch of dreadful ham actors, an ultra-low budget, childish special effects, cheesy costumes, and what do you get? One awesomely horrendous movie. No kid could suffer through it, and no adult will be able to tolerate more than two minutes of it. This is is grade-Z garbage plain and simple.","user":"jake_fantom","rank":[73,80]},{"title":"ok, what did I just watch ?","rating":1,"date":"25 May 2019","review":"LOL, where do I even begin, I can't believe people are actually wasting money on making such bad movies, it's worse than B-movies, it's just bad and in ALL honestly, the only reason I kept on watching this joke is because of the main Acrobat/Aladdin, that guy got something... and Genie was Ok-ish too, the rest.... oy, I'm no film maker, but believe me, even with such limited budget I could make something watchable...","user":"olevish","rank":[27,28]}]
