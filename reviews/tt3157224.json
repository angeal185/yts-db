[{"title":"We Still Kill the Old Way: I'm really torn on this one","rating":5,"date":"6 December 2018","review":"This was a recommendation and a movie I'd certainly never had watched otherwise. Not only do I generally dislike British cinema but I hate any \"Gangster\" related nonsense especially such low rent stuff like this.<br><br>It's a revenge tale, a bunch of old school gangsters seeking retribution against young hoodlums who take the life of one their own. On paper this movie stood absolutely no chance with me, but it does have redeeming features.<br><br>It's paced perfectly, it's wonderfully constructed and the 4 veterans do a fantastic job especially Ogilvy and Cosmo. It succeeds in making you absolutely detest the antagonists, to levels I haven't seen since Eden Lake (2008).<br><br>But on the flipside our heroes are also villians, it's difficult rooting for a side when essentially it's bad vs bad. I don't care if the youth are more obnoxious, in the grand scheme of things I'm sure the protagonists have considerably more blood under their nails. Much like the critically acclaimed Attack the Block (2011), you expect me to cheer on these wretches just because the opposition is worse?<br><br>And more? It suffers with the same problem as Eden Lake. Namely, it's too real. What I mean by that is chav scum and youth gangs are rife, you see them to some extent daily regardless of where you are in the country and quite frankly I don't want to see them in movies as well. The first 10 minutes of the film made me deeply uncomfortable for a host of reasons.<br><br>So though the film is wonderfully made it suffers due to its own successes.\nFor me this was better than it should have been, but I just can't get behind a movie with such themes.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Very well made<br><br>Some great performances<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Deeply uncomfortable viewing in places<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>Hospital security isn't what it used to be","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Good Old Firm Gangster British Film","rating":8,"date":"25 January 2015","review":"I was genuinely surprised by how good this was - it's a South London gangland film and it was well made, entertaining and Danny Dyer wasn't in it but his daughter is and she is interestingly enough called Dani Dyer! (Couldn't make it up could you). Well Ian Ogilvy, Richie, of 'The Return of the Saint' fame is retired to the Costa del Crime and is awaiting his big brother to come over for a Birthday bash. Meanwhile back in Blighty his bro Charlie (Steven Berkoff) interrupts a gang who are sexually assaulting a young girl Lauren (Dani Dyer) - instead of acting like men they brutally murder him.<br><br>The Feds (that is police to non gang types) are about as much use as a pork pie at a bar mitzvah and so Richie gets his chopper out - sorry helicopter - and comes home back to his old Manor - where everyone used to be proper crooks and love their mums - that was back in the day. Now they are all 'blud' and 'innit' and have to walk with a pimp stroll and a permanent hood on their heads like a failed monk. There he assembles the old firm - who are a coterie of crime acting regulars- and they go all out for some righteous retribution.<br><br>Now there are some issues with this film, police procedure is a joke, a few plot holes, as many coincidences as Dickens packed into 'Oliver Twist' and an ending that requires a bit of a stretch to actually believe. That said I still ruddy enjoyed it, veteran James Cosmo as the loud mouthed Arthur was brilliant and Ian Ogilvy showed what a bit of old school talent can bring to the screen. This is a guilty pleasure and I wish the makers all the best - it is nice seeing veteran actors getting a fair crack at a fun role. If you want a bit of semi - mindless fun and don't mind a bit of sawn off shotgun justice then this is for you or puckkah as they say.","user":"t-dooley-69-386916","rank":[28,34]},{"title":"Brilliant old school revenge","rating":10,"date":"8 January 2015","review":"I have to say that this was a brilliant film. With the UK the way it is, being overrun by little chavs, this was the ultimate chav-culling film. a group of old school gangsters stand up to them and take them down the old way. <br><br>Some good humour and references to other films such as the Italian Job, it was a refreshing change from half of the rubbish that is released nowadays. <br><br>OK the way that the gang leader talks was a bit over the top, but it shows how people perceive the little gits. <br><br>If you want a good film with a nice little twist, then watch this film.","user":"paulgeite","rank":[31,41]}]
