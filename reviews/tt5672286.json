[{"title":"GREAT MOVIE!","rating":10,"date":"6 May 2018","review":"Every Canadian needs to watch this movie to learn of Canada's actual history towards the Indigenous people or as I would say \"The First People\" of this country. Perhaps if people watched this movie they would get a better understanding of what the government has done to generations of Canada's First People.","user":"sherimunroe","rank":[26,28]},{"title":"deep and intriguing","rating":10,"date":"9 October 2018","review":"This movie shows the brutal, harsh reality of life in a residential schools. not only do we get a look at saul through out his life but we also see the damage to other students along the way. sauls acting stayed consistent through out the movie which was surprising considering it is all different actors. this film gives you a look at something we wouldnt be able to understand in this depth if the film werent made.i was emotional during this movie beacause this movie is real, this isnt a nightmare we can wake up from, this is real.","user":"anneeswain","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"The uncomfortable truth","rating":10,"date":"2 July 2018","review":"It is a tough and painful movie to watch, so you should. For those who know something about Canadian History, the residential schools is one of those topics some prefer to evade. But you can't and very few (if any) movies have shown the reality as it was. Crude, painful, disturbing. There were a few scenes I had to turn away and pretend I did not see just because they are too strong. Midway through the movie you are led to believe there is a reason why this is happening, just to quickly realize there is not and this is just a big tragedy with no winners. Be brave, open your mind and watch this masterpiece.","user":"idrincon","rank":[15,17]}]
