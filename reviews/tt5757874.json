[{"title":"Painful to watch","rating":1,"date":"15 January 2019","review":"The acting was so poor and the \"pegasus\" flying through the sky was so awful I wanted to laugh. However, I was with my kids so I had to suffer through it. Terrible film.","user":"ascb2008","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"cringe","rating":1,"date":"17 April 2020","review":"Now, if you view this movie like some low budget homework project of a group of high school students and set your expectations really, really low, you might be sympathetic enough and not mind the cringe-worthiness of the whole experience.\nMy kids, 11 and 12 laughed hard at the silliness of the story and comical special effects. The acting was not totally bad though, on amateur level of course. If this movie took more than 2 weeks to film and more than a few hundred bucks of budget, then somebody was seriously ripped of for the production.","user":"minucher","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"23 June 2019","review":"This movie was bad. My 6 and 8 year old thought the acting and effects were really poor.","user":"jwezo","rank":[0,0]}]
