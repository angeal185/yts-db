[{"title":"Don't wait to see Joker, Joaquin already brought his \"A\" game!","rating":8,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) is a man you hire to track down missing people. Joe is also a skilled ex veteran who is permanently traumatised by his dark past. When Joe works, he walks around with confidence and has no problems using violence in order to get the job done. After getting the job done and collecting his pay, Joe comes home to his elderly mother who he takes care of.<br><br>After completing a recent job, Joe is soon offered a new mission from a New York senator. The mission is to find and rescue the Senator's 13 year old daughter who may have been captured.<br><br>I enjoyed the fact that Joe as a character is no 007. It's clear that while he is skilled, he's also a man with a horrible past, but in the end... he is very capable for any task. To the audience, we feel Joe does what he does to distracts himself or perhaps occupy to his thoughts from dwelling on his own personal hell.<br><br>The film is loaded with tension, but to my surprise it's also all shot beautifully. When Joe is on a mission, we don't do see the smashing and bashing. The director here gives us enough understanding to know what Joe is doing each step of the way without needing to show us every single detail. Other scenes are filmed creatively, allowing us to see Joe's mind and thoughts. These scenes can come across like a dream sequence and viewers might possibly find this slow and boring. Others may lock into what we see of Joe's world and be thankful for how much we get to see of his personal life. For me personally, I loved how creative this film was. Showing different camera angles and Joe's mind in depth only helped me to gain greater understanding of the situation and the characters. Naturally it's these types of moments that also build the suspense!<br><br>From a performance level I loved Joaquin Phoenix. While I understand the actor has kept himself busy on screen, I personally enjoyed his work here more than anything else I've seen of him recently. The actress of the 13 year old victim (actress Ekaterina Samsonov) also acts incredibly and provides perfect screen chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix's character. I personably enjoyed seeing these two work together as the story built up.<br><br>Overall, I found this film rather surprising in a positive way. The film is dark, gritty and loaded with tension as it progresses, but we also gain a greater understanding to Joe's thoughts and his mind. We are given plenty of creative detail thanks to the awesome work from the director. That being said, I feel many will enjoy the film's creativity while others might start to look at their watch during the film. For me, I loved it, and it was great to see something new and fresh in 2018 with yet another solid performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix. Worth a look!<br><br>8.2/10\nWalkden Entertainment","user":"WalkdenEntertainment","rank":[136,178]},{"title":"Unconventional at it's finest","rating":9,"date":"5 December 2019","review":"Yes I am aware that many thought this film was slow. However, it the slow and thoughtful burn of this film that makes it so unique and well done. It is, overall, a story about trauma and how this trauma has afflicted the protagonist. This is what trauma looks like. I already loved it but could further appreciate it after viewing a video by screened titled \" How to Show Trauma\" Just watch this video and then decide for yourself. Everything about this film was very much intentional and for good reason.","user":"dragoncherie","rank":[23,27]},{"title":"Joaquin Phoenix is at his best","rating":8,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"Please beware there may be spoilers.<br><br>I was moved by this movie. As others have said certain aspects seemed weak, the plot for example. The story however was so strong and so badly needed to be told. Phoenix gave such a passionate, all or nothing performance that honestly this is one of my favorite films of his as far as the artistry and acting.<br><br>He connects so strongly with the young girl that its palpable on the screen. This felt so incredibly real, without the fluff that seems to usually come with these types of movies. Injuries seemed realistic, the pain of the characters, the agony of the story. All in all give it a watch if you can handle the subject matter","user":"hashimoto3214","rank":[64,85]}]
