[{"title":"an entertaining evening with lots of twists and turns","rating":7,"date":"8 November 2005","review":"Airing on The Lifetime Channel as \"Living with the Enemy\" this film features Sarah Lancaster as a harried assistant who is swept off her feet by a techie billionaire. While adjusting to her new life - being the wife of a billionaire can be a tad stifling with the cars and bodyguards - the young bride discovers some nasty history behind her hubby's success. While some of the many twists and turns seemed a bit too convenient, there were enough of them that weren't too obvious so that I was entertained throughout. Overall, the movie makes for a nice evening. It kept me guessing - and staying tuned after each commercial break!","user":"prohibited-name-1082","rank":[24,26]},{"title":"Living With the Enemy- With Husbands Like This ***","rating":7,"date":"1 June 2007","review":"A beautiful Sarah Lancaster stars in this unusual movie.

His firm, Cobalt, is amazing.<br><br>After a day of whirlwind romance, they wed and the fun begins. He brings her home to an estate run by his alcoholic vicious sister who thinks she is an older version of Dorothy Malone's Oscar winning performance in \"Written on the Wind.\" I thought that this sister would be another Mrs. Danvers of \"Rebecca\" fame.

I disagree with those who think it was a waste of time and money. Sarah Lancaster is a very good actress and Mark Humphrey is a very good actor not to mention both are very sexy. I think they both were perfect for the parts they played in this movie. Mark Humphrey is one of the sexiest actors I've seen in a long time. I taped this movie and have watched it several times, that is how much I enjoyed it. It kept me guessing a lot, you don't know if Phillip is involved in any of the criminal activity until the last of the movie and you feel so sorry for Allison for getting into this situation especially because she is so in love with Phillip. I think this is definitely a movie worth watching.","user":"wendyp1","rank":[16,21]}]
