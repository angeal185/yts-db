[{"title":"How would Rooster Cogburn have handled it?","rating":6,"date":"22 June 2005","review":"As portrayed by John Wayne, United States Marshal J.D. Cahill is a man obsessed with his work as a lawman. I guess you needed super dedication in doing that job right. Trouble is, he's neglected his two sons, Gary Grimes and Clay O'Brien who've fallen in with bad company. In fact that bad company has thought of a pretty good scheme in how to rob the town bank with the help from the Cahill boys. One unforeseen consequence of the scheme is the sheriff and deputy from the town are both killed.<br><br>Wayne catches up with some nefarious characters who fit a general description and have a chunk of cash on them. They're not the right guys and he suspects as much. The rest of the story concerns what happens as Grimes and O'Brien are conscience stricken and how that brings about a general righting of wrongs.<br><br>My problem with the story is that marshal's kids or not, they've committed a major league felony. In another film Grimes would have hung for it. Two law enforcement officials were killed in the performance of their duty. You do recall in Hang 'Em High those two kids who did not help Bruce Dern overpower Clint Eastwood still hung in the end. Or in True Grit, John Wayne shoots without hesitation some young criminals there. <br><br>But this is a John Wayne film involving his family so the Duke is trapped by certain parameters that his fans expect. It makes for some weakly resolved issues in the plot.<br><br>But if you're a fan of the Duke, Cahill U.S. Marshal will fill your bill.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"A good film for Wayne","rating":1,"date":"1 August 2004","review":"Unlike the comment that said \"unoriginal\", for a western of the early seventies, when the western was at that time dying out for a period, this is a gallant effort on the part of all involved in the production. I must confess, it would be hard for me to say anything bad about a John Wayne movie, it certainly is not \"The Searchers\", but no where near \"The Geisha and the Barbarian\". Cahill was a milder Wayne as a family man, with a good lesson of being there when your needed as a father. A strong point that stands out in the movie, with the other elements (bank robbers, bad guys, boys in trouble) well incorporated around the basic theme. Andrew V. McLaglen did justice to the script, keeping things simple but well rounded, with a conclusion that will satisfy the western fan. After watching the film on TCM recently, I came to realize that it may be dated, somewhat, but a true measure of what good film making is all about. In a world of high budgets, overpaid actors and grand special effects, \"Cahill, U.S. Marshall\" gives what any viewer would want from such a film: A good story.","user":"rfrankssr","rank":[28,35]},{"title":"Good and enjoyable western with a great casting and a sensational John Wayne against his nemesis magnificently played by George Kennedy","rating":7,"date":"22 March 2014","review":"This exciting film packs action Western , go riding , thrills , emotion , shoot-outs and is quite amusing . It contains a magnificent main cast as John Wayne facing off his contender George Kennedy and a top-notch support cast . it's a sympathetic western , with a beautiful cinematography , glamorous scenery and great soundtrack . It deals with J.D. Cahill (John Wayne) is the toughest U.S. Marshal they've got, just the sound of his name makes bad guys stop in their tracks . Break the law and he's the last man you want to see , and the last you ever will . When his two children (Gary Grimes , Clay O'Brian) want to get his attention they decide to help some cutthroats (George Kennedy) to rob a bank . As five killers robbed a bank , the lucky ones get caught and the events go awry . <br><br>Nice Western packs thrills , family feeling , shoot'em up and results to be pretty entertaining . Besides , it contains good feeling as friendship , faithfulness , companionship , and enjoyable father-sons relationship . Furthermore , an anti-racism subtext was written into the script in response to ongoing criticism of John Wayne . The screenplay is plain and simple, with a conventional plot , but ultimately gets overcome . Gorgeous outdoors with decent production design by Walter Simonds , though the opening and finale scenes were filmed entirely in the studio . Enjoyable acting by always great John Wayne . Most of the scenes showing John Wayne riding from a distance were filmed with Chuck Roberson substituting for Wayne . His son is well played by Gary Grimes (Summer of 42, Class of 44) , he performed in similar role as a naive cowboy other films (The spikes gang , CulpepperCattle) , though he virtually disappeared without much trace and nowadays is retreated . Neville Brand was surprised to be offered the role of half-Commanche scout Lightfoot, a part he felt he was badly unsuited for, but accepted it just because he liked working . There also appears notorious secondary actors from numerous Westerns such as Denver Pyle , Paul Fix , Harry Carey Jr , Hank Worden , Marie Windsor , Dan Vadis , Walter Barnes , Royal Dano , among others.<br><br>Rousing musical score by Elmer Bernstein in his ordinary style , including some marvelous songs with lyrics by Don Black . Colorful and spectacular cinematography in Panavision by Joseph Biroc , being filmed on location in Durango , Mexico . Rightly produced by Batjac Production , a company presided by John Wayne and his son Michael A. Wayne . This well-paced film was compellingly directed by Andrew V. McLagen , son of great actor Victor McLagen . The pic contains McLagen's usual themes as familiar feeling , a little bit of charming humor , friendship and and sense of comradeship among people . Andrew does the human touch and full of insight that accompanied him during most of his films and the story develops pleasantly in a large frame with an interesting plot and fully adjusted to the requirements of the action . Andrew McLagen is a known Ford's disciple introducing similar themes in his films . Andrew holds the distinction of directing the most episodes of \"Gunsmoke\" . Furthermore , he holds the honor of filmmaking the most episodes of ¨Have gun , Will travel\" . And is one of the few directors to have directed both Clint Eastwood and John Wayne . He's a Western expert (McLintock , Shenandoah , Bandolero , Chisum , Cahill , Way West) and warlike specialist , such as proved in several films (Return to Kwai, Wild Geese , Dirty dozen: the next mission, Sea wolves, Breakthrough) . Rating ¨Cahill¨ : Agreeable , and above average Western 6'5 . The picture will appeal to John Wayne fans . Worthwhile watching .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[13,15]}]
