[{"title":"Adam and Eva before being expel from Eden","rating":29,"date":"29 August 2016","review":"\"One &amp; Two\" is a new interpretation of how Eva is tempted to \"see\" and to \"feel\" what is outside Eden. She really craves to know the real world (to taste good and evil). When we are born in this 3D world we are put in a fleshy body in order to know pleasure and pain by our five senses. The Father knows that if Adam and Eva run away they will face the cruelties of the outside world. That's why he is warning them not to cross the barrier. The Mother however is willing to give them a chance. In this film the omnipotent God the Creator is represented in his dualistic form - the Father and his female consort the Divine Mother(Sofia, Prakriti)- something that is omitted in the Bible, but well explained in the Gnostic scriptures and in the Vedic texts. In the beginning Elochim (plural)created the human being as two united parts - so to say in its precelestial state every human being (man or woman)is an ideal creature made of both male and female forces/energies/substances. When we descend in fleshy body from Heaven to our 3D world a dichotomy takes place - from One we became Two. We are no longer the ideal precelestial creature. We are separated and it causes us pain and suffering.<br><br>Please see for reference the Gospel of Thomas (11): \"When you were one, you became two. But when you become two, what will you do?\" In \"One &amp; Two\" the director traces the painful process of postcelestial separation, the rage of the Father and the rejection of the Father's will. In the end of the movie Adam and Eva tried to destroy the heaven they came from. Did they succeed to burn out all the ways to return there or there is still a small possibility for the human being to recreate his/her original state?","user":"vajrayogini","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Kids Go Poof - Movie Goes Nowhere","rating":4,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"Weird little film. Starts off promising and remains promising throughout, it just never does anything with that promise. Smart enough to come up with believable constraints on children who can teleport themselves (and yet are confined; i.e. there has to be line of sight to where they are going to poof to next, so put a bag over their head and their powers are gone), and equally clever enough to figure out ways around that.<br><br>But it moves at a pace that is, at first, leisurely, and later as the \"action\" ramps up (or more accurately as there are changes in the situation) the film slips even further into sleepwalking. It sets up interesting developments but then deliberately doesn't really do anything with them. The filmmakers seem averse to exploring any of the multiple concepts that are sprinkled throughout. Perhaps it's as simple as they were not as clever and smart as their own premise.<br><br>It's frustrating that so much could have been addressed but the filmmakers act just like the film's characters; dour and non-communicative to an extreme. Simple visual effects are believably handled; performances are strong; there is even a whole scene here or there that is everything you might want it to be, but then the film meanders away as if it has no clear idea where it wants to go or why it wants to get there. Or why we should stick around for the ride.","user":"seriouscritic-42569","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Weird, very weird","rating":4,"date":"22 October 2018","review":"Probably One And Two would be consigned to obscurity save for the fact that\none of the four principal cast member Timothee Chalamet has gone on to stardom in the movie big leagues. Chalamet and Kiernan Shipka play a brother\nand sister who live on a remote farm and have some unusual abilities, abilities\ninherited from their mother Elizabeth Reaser who is subject to seizures and not\nlong for the world.<br><br>His own kids scare the pants off their father Grant Bowler who punishes them\nevery time they use their powers to transport themselves. The idea was\nclearly taken from the British science fiction series The Tomorrow People where\nkids could just transport themselves anywhere on a whim.<br><br>An interesting concept but the film moves so slowly it becomes unbearably\ndull. In the end I'm not sure what the point was.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[5,5]}]
