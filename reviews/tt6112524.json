[{"title":"Quite alright for me.","rating":5,"date":"14 October 2019","review":"The Young Cannibals brought a nice premise, a good execution, ok actors/dialogue, overall I was intrigued and had fun with this one. In the woods horrors are quite possibly the easiest ones to make, right there next to zombies, yet this one managed to bring something new to the table. Just a little more that you'd expect, but it made quite the difference.<br><br>So if you're a fan of the genre, don't go in expecting a masterpiece, but be prepared to see more than the usual, a genuine plot that evolves throughout the movie, characters that have more than one layer and...well I wish I could say more about the monster but probably the budget just couldn't cover for a better one.<br><br>Still, it was a pleasant surprise thus I will recommend it.<br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Small budget horror with a decent atmosphere","rating":5,"date":"2 October 2019","review":"You won't be overwhelmingly surprised by what's happening, there's no spectacular plot, but that's normal for the genre anyway.\nThe atmosphere is well created in my opinion, mainly thanks to the soundtrack that fits well, pictoresque terrain and quite good actors (tho some characters were a bit annoying).\nThe directing was alright, yet some editing seemed weird, maybe to save some dosh on special effects regarding the monster having dinner.\nPretty solid for a film that most probably had a rather small budget.","user":"LoremIpsum321","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"It's actually quite good","rating":6,"date":"1 October 2019","review":"This movie is a mixed bag in every way , while some scenes\nare truly awful just like that we get scenes that are really good !\nAlso a fantastic sound track something lower budget movies\nSeem to get wrong . In fact it was the music and sounds that\nmade me stay with this one . Not bad at all .","user":"markhappyboy","rank":[19,23]}]
