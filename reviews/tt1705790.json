[{"title":"Even worse than Hora","rating":2,"date":"10 April 2013","review":"Plot: The team behind the exploitation film \"Hora\" are ready to shoot another movie, but this time the notorious director has finally lost it. Murder and absurdities occur on set, and we are now allowed to witness the chaos first hand.<br><br>Our thoughts: This following review will be bringing up a lot of points about the prequel, \"Hora\", as well. When I received this movie for reviewing I remember that I had \"Hora\" in my collection already, just hadn't watched it yet. So I decided to go through that one first, only to find out that \"Hora\" was nothing more than a mix of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" and \"Thriller: A Cruel Picture\". So much so that they even had a group of guys rape the woman several times, and one of them was mentally handicapped! Homages? I'm sure they can be viewed as such, but I think when you go so far that the movie feel more like a remake than the official remake of \"I Spit on Your Grave\" did, then you've done too much. While \"Hora\" was a disappointing experience, I was pretty interested in the plot of \"Inside the Whore\". I think this kind of meta- story can be really fun, and certainly when done by the right people for the right reasons. My only concern was that maybe \"Hora\" wasn't the right movie to do this for.<br><br>There isn't much to bring up about the plot of \"Inside the Whore\" - it's literally just about a film crew making a sequel to \"Hora\", but things go out of hand behind the scenes. The director, Reinert Kiil, plays himself and he's the main protagonist here. Slowly he starts taking advantage of the cast of pretty girls, and rape and murder are just around the corner. Now, this is fine for me. It could work. But instead this went to nearly supernatural heights, and not being able to pull it off effectively at all. It doesn't help that the movie is just a mess as a whole either, being an overall disjointed experience. For such a simple movie you can only blame the filmmakers when the viewer gets confused.<br><br>Clearly \"Hora\" and \"Inside the Whore\" were both made as attempts to be controversial. \"Inside the Whore\" sure makes that apparent by starting the movie with a naked woman doing a nude dance and it shows most parts of her body in great detail. I don't have anything against graphic nudity, but the next scene in the movie takes place in a theater before a rating board is about to watch \"Inside the Whore\" (the one we are also gonna watch) and the nude woman was only there to entertain them before the film starts. Much like it does with us. I realize this is exploitation, but even the trashiest of the old classics did it with more care than this one and it literally just comes off as stupid.<br><br>The rest of the movie was, to my surprise, more tame than \"Hora\" was - maybe because it felt so random and stupid, but it actually never got very violent or trashy. There was only really one scene in the entire movie that was well made, but to make up for it that scene felt entirely pointless too - I can't for the life of me see a reason for it. It's when a woman in the cast is (or acts?) possessed - the make-up and her screams were pretty solid, to be honest. Other than this, the movie doesn't deliver much of joy for the horror and exploitation fan in me. Not even to my intellect - making a meta-movie is always an attempt to say something, but I really can't find much of depth in the smugness. Maybe if this was 1980 and \"Inside the Whore\" came as a reaction to the many 70's exploitation movies. But in 2012/2013 it doesn't manage to say a damn thing.<br><br>If you really, REALLY want to watch exploitation from Norway, then you really should skip \"Inside the Whore\" and watch \"Hora\" instead. As much as I disliked \"Hora\" and often found myself annoyed by the outright stupid dung that went on, \"Inside the Whore\" was even worse. To underline how pointless this movie felt, I can personally not see a reason for the filmmakers making this movie instead of moving on to an entirely new project. It's a waste of everyone's time. I'm ready to see Reinert Kiil tackle something different. I am sure he can make something way better and original than both of these since they are often more well-made than some of the junk I stumble upon. For now I can only judge him based on these. And my verdict is that I'm not impressed. But at least \"Hora\" entertained me more than \"The Thrill of a Kill\"!<br><br>More reviews at FilmBizarro.com","user":"filmbizarro","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Surely this was a meant as a spoof...","rating":3,"date":"10 August 2013","review":"The first movie \"Hora\" (\"The Whore\") was a mediocre movie, but still enjoyable enough to actually watch. Then this movie comes along and most definitely proves that something stinky sure rolls downhill.<br><br>This is supposed to be some kind of documentary about what happened during the creation of the first film that Reinert Kiil did, but strange things are happening upon the set.<br><br>Yeah, right, this was as bad as it gets, or at least close there by. The movie, and I use the term movie very abstract here, was so strange and bizarre that it was actually possible to sit through it all just to see what happens next. But if you look at this from a bigger scale, then it was all low budget and most definitely not worth the time or effort. And for people who enjoyed the first movie, I suspect they will be sorely disappointed with this one.<br><br>The acting in the movie, well it was as to be expected. So don't get your hopes up. And the same could be said for the special effects.<br><br>For those in the audience (like me) who can understand Norwegian, there is some nice treats throughout the movie, especially during the more brutal scenes, as the subtitles doesn't even match what is actually being said. The subtitles in these cases are toned down as to what is actually being said, and also the subtitles have a whole other meaning as to what is being said on camera.<br><br>The only thing impressive about this movie is how many times Reinert Kiil manages to fit in his own name in the credits. It was just ludicrous, and had to be a spoof.<br><br>If you are looking to be entertained by Norwegian cinema, I strongly suggest that you pick up another title, perhaps \"Thale\"? Because this movie was a waste of time.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Reinert makes a statement but in a boring way","rating":3,"date":"20 February 2013","review":"Reinert Kiil, the director of Hora (2009) decided to make this flick a trilogy and let Inside The Whore be the mockumentary about the making of Hora. Due the unexpected success of Hora especially for a flick from Norway were they don't have any money from the government to make movies this is a bit of a action against the system. That's easy to spot in the beginning and the end. <br><br>But we are left with the flick between the beginning and the end. The beginning was already a big surprise. A girl dancing naked, but when the lights go on we see her naked on stage of a cinema were Inside The Whore will be shown. But the surprise was how the girl was filmed when the lights go on. A close up of her butt and her vagina. And it stays in close up for a few seconds. But then we move over to the mockumentary and that part was really boring. You can see them on set and having parties and teasing each other to have sex. Here and there we see a boob and some blood but overall it annoyed me. <br><br>Once the lights go on again at the theatre we move back to the distributors. And it's here that Reinert makes a statement, again with a girl full frontal with a gun. <br><br>I guess they had a lot of fun with all those tattooed chicks on set but for the viewer it really took too long. I liked the beginning, pussy galore and the ending but the flick itself wasn't really good. Here and there you will have a laugh and the gore added is one of the cheap kind. Hora addicts will surely want this in their collection. Can't think what Hora 2 will bring us.<br><br>Gore 1/5 Nudity 4/5 Effects 2/5 Story 1/5 Comedy 0/5","user":"trashgang","rank":[8,13]}]
