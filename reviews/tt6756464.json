[{"title":"Eye opening...","rating":9,"date":"9 February 2019","review":"This is an eye opening film about an army of radicals who invade foreign countries with the sole intent of overthrowing the established government and killing the population that aren't like them. Hiding behind their religion they're attempting to \"convert\" or kill anyone who doesn't share their beliefs.","user":"davidjdoyle-140-892335","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"a good documentary","rating":8,"date":"7 February 2019","review":"This norwegian documentary about the radical muslim forces, are well made but at times a bit unilaterally presented. they focus far too much on the male part of the muslim radicalists, and forgets completely the women and girls that also are a great part of the ummah-group, who also travels to syria and iraq to take part in the creation of the chaliphat. Ã¥sne seierstad has written a book called ''two sisters'', that elaborates the female position in the muslim society in norway, and their involment with the ummah group, and how they are radicalized,and join forces with the is in syria and iraq.<br><br>i remember very well when the film makers were fighting their rights in court when police seized unpublished material from them, and i recall that i thought the norwegian security police had violated the rights of free speech and protection of sources.<br><br>another impression from this film is that mr hussain has the same techniques and demeanors to recruit new members to the islamic faith, as radical norwegian christian movements does. it is said that there are 200000 muslim believers in norway, so it amazes me that the ''healthy'' and stout christian movements doesnt enter the track and starts mobilizing. its a fact that an increasing part of the norwegian population are off-baptizing themselves, becoming ateists, or simply converts to other religions.nothing wrong with that, its just a symptom that '' my '' norway are being internationalized,multiethnical and multireligous.<br><br>do see this film and take a seat in ubydullah hussains pocket,and judge yourself is he a lure or just a fake......and a great thanks to the film makers even though they forgot to mention ayan,leila and the others......","user":"ops-52535","rank":[3,6]}]
