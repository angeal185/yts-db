[{"title":"the reigning king of dwarfsploitation cinema!","rating":6,"date":"6 April 2004","review":"Heartwarming family entertainment about a mischief-making, wind-up toy loving dwarf and his retired stage-queen mother, working together to make ends meet by renting out rooms in their spacious home. To supplement their modest income, they randomly kidnap young girls and chain them up inside their filthy attic. These captives are used in wild sexcapades by an array of libertine gentlemen who call at all hours, and show their gratitude for services rendered with cash donations(no, not to the girls...to the DWARF). In order to keep the fussy sex-slaves in line, our fun-loving \"little person\" injects them with daily doses of heroin. All is hunky-dory until an unsuspecting young couple rents a room in the house. Before long, complications ensue which pose a serious threat to the family business.<br><br>This insanely licentious softcore roughie, one of the most entertaining of its kind, is a timeless classic loved by bad-apples the world over. When is Disney going to remake this as an animated musical?<br><br>7.5/10","user":"EyeAskance","rank":[43,46]},{"title":"The World Needs More Dwarfsploit Films...","rating":7,"date":"7 May 2006","review":"THE SINFUL DWARF is another 70's era exploit/weirdy that really defies explanation. I will say that it's slow moving and doesn't really pick up til the end, but the whole concept is twisted enough to warrant a look at this one...<br><br>Olaf the dwarf (who another reviewer nailed it when he said that this freak looks like a psychotic version of a squished Jack Black...) and his mother run a boarding house. To supplement the minimal income that taking in boarders offers, they naturally lure young girls to the house with toy dogs, drug them with heroin until they are addicted, and whore them out to the local scumbags. When a couple moves in and the wife starts snooping around, everything goes to hell...<br><br>THE SINFUL DWARF isn't quite what I expected - as I stated before it's kinda slow and dull at points - but overall I'd say it's a must-see for any sleaze/exploit/sexploit lover. There's plenty of full-frontal nekkidness, and the sleaze-factor gets amped up towards the end as Olaf rapes the wife with his cane, and the last sex scene between client and captive is the strongest of the film. The film plays out kinda as a cross between BLOODSUCKING FREAKS (without the gore) and THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE (without smokin' hot Christina Lindberg) - but not as good as either of those films. Worth checkin' out - 7/10","user":"EVOL666","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"Fans of H.G. Lewis and early John Waters must own this sickie!","rating":24,"date":"24 June 1999","review":"\"The Sinful Dwarf\" is a Danish/American production which actually played in theaters in Denmark (I've talked people to who saw the shocking premiere). The lead actor, Torben Bille, is one the most known dwarf actors in Denmark...I guess, he would rather forget this ultra bizarre piece of sexploitation. Torben lures innocent young girls to his mom's house with help of mechanical toy poodles!! They are drugged &amp; tied up and later abused by \"clients\" and/or sold into slavery. In between his drunk mom are doin' several musical numbers! The many sexscenes are pretty close to porn and the soundtrack reminded me of Residents! It's like an insane mix between \"Bloodsucking Freaks\" and \"Pink Flamingos\" with zero comic relief - this movie will blow your mind! Trash film mogul Harry Novak also backed \"Please Don't Eat My Mother\", \"Kiss Me Quick\" etc.","user":"Jens-28","rank":[15,16]}]
