[{"title":"I wish I could give this ZERO stars!!!","rating":1,"date":"17 March 2018","review":"The best part about this \"movie\" was when it went OFF!! Even the credits were bad. Don't waste your time. This \"movie\" is BEYOND HORRIBLE!!! The storyline, acting, graphics, and everything was alll horrible. Ugh!!!","user":"tdspencer","rank":[15,22]},{"title":"I had one of those vision things again.","rating":1,"date":"10 April 2018","review":"Eric Roberts, topped billed has a minute role in the feature. Jeremiah, a foster child of unknown parentage sleep walks and goes to an Atlanta college called UMT, although referred as UMC by Pooch Hall who flubbed his lines. Jeremiah (Grant Harvey) has visions and a bad hair cut, the only thing in the film worse than the acting and script. He must combat Lilith (Alice Rose) a serial killer with tremendous T&amp;A for a serpent. They spend a lot of the film explaining their theology, but never why Jeremiah doesn't know how to work a comb. The film was horribly bad, even for those who might buy into the theology. <br><br>Guide: No swearing of nudity. Alice Rose is very sexual.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"2 March 2018","review":"Really bad, dont watch, cant find words how bad this second rate \"something\" is, it is not a movie, this is camera recording some random people who cant act. and it have 6.8 out of ten, really?.
