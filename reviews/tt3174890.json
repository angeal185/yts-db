[{"title":"Funny Sunny","rating":9,"date":"22 January 2020","review":"Nice movie with heart. Depends on your mood how you feel about the movie but I was glad I watched it. Heart warming. Nice acting, nice story. More than nice actually. It was touching for me.","user":"furmonkey","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Heartfelt, funny, charming & touching","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2020","review":"OK so it's not a 10 (I did that to counter the idiot who only gave it a 1) it's probably an 8. The only drag is the lead actress's acting ability is not great... poor soap opera actress... Australia has MUCH better than here but I guess they had a low budget and she was the best they could get that could also covert mega cuteness factor? Once you ignore that blemish she delivers enough for you to enjoy the rest of the beautiful simple genius of this charming film and it's central character delivered wonderfully by RJ Mitte.","user":"aliensexgod","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Everyone has its value","rating":8,"date":"2 March 2020","review":"It's such a inspiring movie recently seen. Disability, so what!!?? I found my way out. There should be something each of us are good at. No one can change what you are. Be yourself, hell yeah.. the movie is funny with tears, nicely done.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[1,1]}]
