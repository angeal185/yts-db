[{"title":"better than I anticipated.","rating":6,"date":"25 May 2012","review":"It's 6.5 out of 10 stars for me for this dramedy that should have stayed nearer to drama toward the end.<br><br>What's great about it: Williams' performance. I don't think people were ready, at this time of his career, for a nuanced performance, but that's what this is. He breaks into being the crazed Williams of talk shows only twice, and briefly, during this film. Otherwise he is convincing as a middle-aged car salesman with complicated relationships and the absence of a long-term plan. His excellence at sales isn't limited to cars; he can talk many women into bed, and that's his downfall.<br><br>Robbins is also good as a stupid, jealous husband with a gun.<br><br>What's not as good: the supporting characters at the car dealership were under-written. The Chinese restaurant and police captain stuff was awful. I can't stand Fran Drescher, and I can't stand her here. (If you like her, you'll like her here.) The dog she's carrying was used too much, and I realize the yappiness was supposed to heighten the tension, but mostly it made me want to look for my own gun or consider shutting off the DVD. I never did see that his sacrifice during the hostage-taking was fully motivated. (Seems drastic to be willing to die just to avoid a stressful day.) <br><br>I did like the character of the ex-wife and that of the wannabe awful clothes designer girlfriend #2, played well by Lori Petty. Also, I liked the bizarre opening scene which is in the middle of a funeral procession. There's a how-to writing book I once read that said, bring all your characters on stage with their (attributes) flying. This opening scene did just that, so kudos to Ken Friedman.","user":"grnhair2001","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"***1/2 out of 5","rating":8,"date":"8 August 2002","review":"Robbin Williams stars in this wickedly amusing and ocassionally hilarious film about a car salesman having the worst few days of his life. Williams plays Joey, a car salesman who is juggling 2 girlfriends, had to deal with his wife wanting more money, a ganster wanting payment on a gambling debt and a boss who wants him to seel 12 cars in two days or he will loose his job. On top of that We have Tom Robbins as the husband of an employee who breakes into the dealership with an automatic weapon demanding to know who has been sleeping with his wife. The film suffers from a boring first half that seems to be going nowhere fast and only has a few scattered laughs but then begins to succeed due to the great chemestry between Williams and Robbins. It may not be perfection but because of great performances from the two leads, many laughs and a heart felt ending this one is a winner in my books.","user":"casey_choas66","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"interesting movie","rating":8,"date":"15 August 2007","review":"This movie is funny, insightful, and alarming all at the same time. This is a synopsis of mostly Italian American life in working class burroughs of NY (Queens, Long Island, whatever). Joey (Robin Williams) is juggling two neurotic girlfriends and an ex-wife while struggling to keep his job as a smooth talking car salesman. The movie starts off with a shot of a cemetery in Queens, the biggest damn cemetery I have ever seen. It gives you the feeling of crowdedness, that even in death people are crowded and are probably still arguing over elbow room. Joey is desperate and even tries to sell a car to a widow as she is burying her husband. Eventually, a distraught and somewhat deranged husband of the car dealer's secretary takes over the dealership with a machine gun, convinced that somebody there is screwing with his sexy wife (which is true). It isn't Joey, but he takes the rap and tries to talk the guy down, doing a pretty good job. Car salesman becomes psychologist, and he does an amazingly good job, along with help from a phone call from both his wife and his mother to the distraught man. This is the best part of the movie. You see Joey and Larry (Robbins) play out this scene with both humor and fright. Larry is trying to prove his manhood to his wife. You understand his plight and feel his pain, and at the same time you see the mans compassion, especially with the phone calls from Joey's ex-wife and mother. There is something very real about this scene and I would think that someone who has to talk down a hostage situation might gain something from watching how Joey makes connections with Larry on a personal level. Eventually Larry sees what a mess Joey's life is and starts to see that actually his situation isn't that bad. This movie is as much about the alienation and frustration of modern life as anything else. The movie is loud and frantic and might put you off in that respect, but hang with it.","user":"filmfanaticNorCal","rank":[16,22]}]
