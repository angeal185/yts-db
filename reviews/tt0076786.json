[{"title":"''She must die, die, DIE! \"","rating":10,"date":"30 August 2005","review":"\"Suspiria\" has been acclaimed as director Dario Argento's masterpiece. And it certainly is. The plot is fairly simple. American ballet student Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) travels to Germany to attend an exclusive ballet school. Once there, she discovers that there is more going on within than just dance instruction. Although the school's directress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) welcomes her warmly, she is unsettled by her aide, Nazified teacher Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), as well as several mysterious student disappearances. When her new friend Sara (Stefania Casini) is the latest to vanish, Susy begins her own investigation of the academy. Filmed in bright, lurid Technicolor, and accompanied by a thundering soundtrack by Goblin, Suspiria is a nightmare-come-to-life. The performances of Harper, Bennett and especially Valli (like Bennett, a major star of the Golden Age) are solid, as is the unrelentingly creepy atmosphere. Also on display are two especially gruesome murders which happen near the beginning of the film. Argento later said that he modeled the look of the film directly on Walt Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" and, indeed the similarities are apparent. \"Suspiria\" may not always make perfect sense plot wise, but it's a thrilling roller-coaster ride through what may very well be Hell. \"Suspiria\" ranks as one of the best Italian-made horror films of all time.","user":"phillindholm","rank":[173,241]},{"title":"The most horrifying use of color to date.","rating":9,"date":"8 March 1999","review":"What sets Dario Argento apart from many of his contemporaries is his success with visual imagery.  In a style where sudden visual shocks are used to thrill the audience, Argento creates elaborate deaths which cannot be quickly forgotten.  The highly involved double-murder towards the beginning of the film still remains one of the most memorable scenes in horror history, standing next to the Psycho \"shower scene\" in pure sensory input. And in a technique so powefully employed here and here alone, Argento sets scene after scene aglow with color, using it to express the mood in ways only the subconscious can fully appreciate.  All around, this is an excellent addition to the genre of horror cinema, one of the most expressive films to ever plunge a knife into the psyche of its viewers.","user":"Emil_H","rank":[157,226]},{"title":"Artistic Nightmare","rating":6,"date":"30 June 2004","review":"A German ballet school for girls is the setting for mysterious deaths, in this 1977 horror story, written and directed by Dario Argento.  \"Suspiria\" is a visually stunning film.<br><br>The images contain objects we recognize, like people, buildings, and interior decor.  But the objects seem vaguely menacing, and less real than surreal, as though they symbolize ideas, repressed desires, or subconscious fears.  The vivid, rich colors, strange camera angles, deep shadows, and bright light piercing through darkness, all contribute to the impression that the viewer is trapped in someone else's nightmare.<br><br>One haunting segment of the film takes place in a huge, and strangely empty, public square, at night.  A blind man and his German shepherd dog stand in the middle of the square, surrounded by imposing buildings of neo-classical architectural style.  Some professional reviewers of this film have suggested that the public square is a veiled reference to Hitler and Nazism. Indeed, one could argue that the film's subtext is an indictment of fascism.<br><br>\"Suspiria\" is not for everyone.  It is unsettling, and at times grisly.  The plot is weak, and plot elements are not really explained.  The acting is largely irrelevant.  And while the background music is suitably gothic, it is also frantic and monotonous.<br><br>The best approach to this \"art-house\" film is to ignore the superficial plot, and focus instead on the fabulous cinematography, and the gothic images as conceptual metaphors.","user":"Lechuguilla","rank":[153,225]}]
