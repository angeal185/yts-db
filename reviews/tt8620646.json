[{"title":"Seriously? Complete garbage","rating":1,"date":"31 July 2019","review":"The best part is her arrival at the luxury hotel. Forlani looks great and there are some subtle shots at people having affairs and how they act. Unfortunately the first three minutes go by and they start whatever it is they call this. I mean this is terrible. The setting and plot are both ludicrous with some all knowing all powerful off screen voice pulling the strings on these two people acting like idiots. Saying the movie is stupid would be kind.","user":"tkell31","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"Deserves a better rating.","rating":7,"date":"13 February 2019","review":"I am surprised by the low ratings and the bad reviews it got. After watching An Affair To Die For I think this movie clearly deserves a higher rating. To me it was an entertaining movie, a story with alot of twists and turns, some that you see coming and some that you don't, but overal there is a constant suspense hanging throughout the movie. I doubt this could happen in real life but that doesn't matter to me. When I watch a movie like this one I want to be entertained, and that's exactly what I got, entertainment. The acting was okay expect for Claire Forlani. She just doesn't have it to be a good actress so that was the minor point to me. A good little thriller worth watching.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[31,45]},{"title":"Not bad ... some missing pieces","rating":6,"date":"4 February 2019","review":"Stumbled upon this movie wasn't expecting much. Started off eeegh then I heard have fun with my wife ... my ears perked to see what was to come. A lot of twist and turns but some things over the top or left out. Too many NOE WHY IN HELL WOULD YOU DO THAT OR NOT THAT came into play. I watched it thoroughly like I said not bad but not the greatest yet held my attention though.","user":"fdhodges","rank":[14,19]}]
