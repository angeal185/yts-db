In fact, he and his agent Jorge Mendes came off even more out of touch with reality, especially the latter. His agent portrays Ronaldo as if he is the greatest person ever to walk the earth, the gushing admiration was noticeably cringe worthy towards the end of the movie, when he makes a speech after they have finished a family dinner about how Ronaldo is the greatest sportsman and person around. Even Ronaldo's family are quick to shout give him an Oscar. It's no wonder with Ronaldo surrounding himself with Mendes from the age of 16 why he became as arrogant as he is.<br><br>I thought the only true characters we got to see were his mother and son. I felt sorry for his mother as she has clearly not yet come to terms with losing her husband. You can see also the pressure she faces when Ronaldo plays. I think his desire to want to be recognised as better than Messi has really got to her. There is one point where Ronaldo says it's just a game to her on the phone, but this is after he opens the movie with \"winning is everything to me\" He contradicts himself a good few times throughout the movie.<br><br>What can't be questioned is that he clearly loves his son. His son comes across as a very normal and honest kid. There is one point where Ronaldo talks to another father outside the school as he is picking his son up, and as they walk away Ronaldo remarks on the man's stature, to which his son replies \"bigger than you\". Ronaldo then quickly adds \"but Daddy is stronger\", as if he was threatened and needed to prove his dominance over others to his son. Also, there is a part where he asks his son which car is missing, like this was a normal test of intelligence for a child... It showed this is not someone who you can relate to. What I got also from Ronaldo is that he expects his son to become almost a replica of him, hence the name Cristiano Junior and the way you can see he wants him to become a footballer, like he expects he will live up to his standards, which is unfair on the boy.<br><br>As a person you can gage he is not that understanding of others and sees things very much as black and white. This was highlighted by what happened with his dad. He said the biggest regret was that his dad could not see how he turned out, which is fair enough- but he said I wished I had another dad and I don't care why he became an alcoholic, which to me shows he fails to realise that not everyone has the same mindset in life as he does and can go down the wrong paths for whatever reason. <br><br>What was never seen in this movie was a true look at a Ronaldo who suffers through the bad times. They focused on the injury he had at the world cup, but in terms of their exit, it failed to show his reaction to their elimination for an extended period. All that was seen was him getting into a taxi and saying how he needed to go on holiday. He also blamed their elimination purely on Portugal's team and his injury, failing to admit he missed many good chances against the USA and Ghana, which could have put them through. There is never at any point any self criticism. He does not portion any of the blame on himself for things at any point not just footballing wise, but in all aspects. There was also no mention of his break up with his ex girlfriend in the movie and it showed nothing of her, considering they were dating for a some time over which it was filmed. There was a fleeting mention of her but nothing else.<br><br>In terms of his rivalry with Messi, I would say the obsession with manifests itself in the movie more than ever. The film makes no secret of his disappointment at seeing Messi winning four years in a row, which is to be expected; but this was one of the first things you see at the start, all but confirming this is what football for him is all about. Whilst he goes on to say he says he sees Messi as more of a person now, I think that stems from Ronaldo winning the last two Ballon D'ors. Had Messi won both, I think there wouldn't have even been a movie and he certainly would not be talking about Messi in a more positive light. It's good he has not taught his son that Messi is someone he sees as his rival, but you can figure out Messi is never far from his and his agents thoughts.<br><br>Overall, I can't say the movie endeared me to Ronaldo anymore than before. There was not enough of a connection formed with him to make you think this is a person who actually is quite humble and is not afraid to show himself at his worst. He was very wrong to claim the movie is an honest look at how he is, because you can see it's not. He has some good points shown, but the overriding theme is a huge ego and unhealthy obsession to be the best.","user":"charlton-05627","rank":[62,95]},{"title":"A marketing ploy with almost no authenticity","rating":2,"date":"13 November 2015","review":"These types of documentaries, i.e. behind the scenes with someone of note over a defining period of their life, is often hugely entertaining and insightful. Not this one. <br><br>'Ronaldo' is a pure piece of marketing to be sold to Ronaldo fans. There's insight into the issues surrounding and defining his family, specifically his brother, mother and late father, however Ronaldo is portrayed as the demi-God with few, if any, personal issues. Indeed the film intimates that he is the salvation for everyone in his family, specifically his mother who states that she thanks God that she didn't go through with the abortion she planned when pregnant with Ronaldo. Weird.<br><br>I found his devotion to his son admirable however it seems the beginning of a very unhealthy path in that Ronaldo Jr already seems to have his future mapped out - to follow in his father's footprints. Indeed, the whole controversy around Jr's conception/birth mother (a mystery) was not addressed at all. <br><br>In terms of football, this film epitomizes the issues with professional sport. There is no mention of the value of teamwork, selflessness and placing the team above the individual - the tone here is that Ronaldo is the Saviour and no one else matters.<br><br>Overall Ronaldo came across as driven, single-minded, deluded, selfish, arrogant and, most tellingly of all, permanently self-conscious. He might be incredible on the field but off it he comes across as someone living with a massive dissonance between who he presents himself to be and who he really is within. And for that reason I'm left feeling sad for him.","user":"dannyritawedding","rank":[45,69]}]
