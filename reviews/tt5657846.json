[{"title":"I love this movie","rating":9,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"This, in my opinion, is a fantastic movie. The actors and actresses are phenomenal. I do love that they added Mel Gibson, who plays the perfect \"dad\" to Mark Wahlberg. Will Ferrell and John Lithgow are a true match for a \"father/son\" combo. <br><br>To me, this movie is uplifting and all around fun. I, unfortunately, deal with a lot of stress/anxiety but I turn this movie on and it \"soothes\" me.<br><br>I can't wait for number 3.<br><br>Thank you to all the wonderful people who made this movie happen.","user":"golfne1","rank":[46,56]},{"title":"A Christmas classic for me.","rating":8,"date":"29 November 2019","review":"Daddy's Home laid the foundations, Daddy's Home 2 further rose them into a stupendous construction that intelligently added more ingredients carefully thought out. It's almost as if the the casting director, writers and filmmakers knew exactly what Daddy's Home needed in order to make a better sequel, even with the perfect amount of elements needed, nothing more, nothing less. Of course these elements which I'm referring to are the always warming and family-friendly holiday setting and the obviously salient, hugely welcomed inclusions of two tremendous actors like Mel Gibson and John Lithgow, two polar opposites as already shown with Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. It is truly impressive how well the casting turned out with them, they played their parts perfectly, you can truly see \"like father, like son\" written all over their characters.<br><br>So these newcomers throw in their dynamics and bring along an exciting mixture of associations between the four characters. Mel Gibson cleverly\ndelivers his hilarious swagger and macho attitude that contrastingly clashes with the soft, gentle and sensitive John Lithgow whom also portrays fabulously and pretty accurately a character basicly designed to be Will Ferrell's character, but older. Many hilarious situations take place, from Brad (Ferrell) and Dusty (Wahlberg) receiving their dads, Don (Lithgow) and Kurt (Gibson) at the airport to a terrible mishap with Christmas lights.<br><br>The teasing of John Cena's character at the end of the first film was well-put in, because it felt there was room to explore his character as well.\nIt proved to be another astute move on behalf of the casting directors, since his inclusion actually made this movie a lot funnier. A new rivalry emerges with him and Rusty, who wants to be liked by his step-daughter, who hates him and unconditionally loves his daddy, Roger (Cena).\nThe whole family goes to a cabin, where Brad and Dusty find themselves going at it once again. The manger scene is exhilarating, definitely one of the best in the whole film. Overall, I find it to be very consistent, it can hardly disappoint, unless you're biased by dislike or hatred towards either Mel Gibson or Will Ferrell.<br><br>The ending puts everything in perspective, as with most holiday movies, this one also leaves a heart-warming and sentimental message about forgiving and family union, along with the classic Christmas carol, this time tenderly singing all together \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\".<br><br>A Christmas classic in my book, I have seen it many times already. If you enjoyed it as much as I did, it can become a classic in your book too.","user":"patriciogl10","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Adding Gibson to the cast was brilliant in my opinion!","rating":8,"date":"15 November 2017","review":"'DADDY'S HOME 2': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br><br>A sequel to the 2015 hit comedy starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, as two rival fathers competing for the same children's love. In this follow-up they're now friends, and they have to deal with their own fathers visiting for the holidays, who are also complete opposites as well of course. Mel Gibson and John Lithgow join the cast, as the elder dads, while Linda Cardellini and John Cena also reprise their roles from the original movie. The film was once again directed by Sean Anders, and it was written by Anders and John Morris (the same duo also co-wrote the original, as well as 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE', 'SEX DRIVE', 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE', 'WE'RE THE MILLERS', 'HORRIBLE BOSSES 2', and other hit comedies). This film has received nearly unanimous negative reviews from critics, but it's done really well at the Box Office (and with viewers there). I thought it was pretty funny too actually.<br><br>Brad and Dusty (Ferrell and Wahlberg) now get along perfectly, and our doing a really effective job co-parenting their kids together. Then both of their fathers, Kurt (Gibson) and Don (Lithgow), decide to visit them for the holidays. Kurt is extremely egotistical, obsessively masculine, and a bit of a sexist asshole. Don is really sweet, kind and friendly. More family drama occurs because of their visit, which causes conflict between Brad and Dusty again as well. Especially when Brad invites the biological father (Cena) of Dusty's stepdaughter over.<br><br>The movie is frequently very funny. It definitely has some bad jokes in it too, and it's a pretty routine family Christmas comedy, but it's still mostly funny. Adding Gibson to the cast, as the womanizing chauvinistic pig, was brilliant casting in my opinion as well, and he's hilarious in the role. Lithgow is also good in his part too, and Ferrell and Wahlberg are both effective once again too. I actually enjoyed this sequel more than it's predecessor; it seems more packed with quality humor to me, at least in my opinion. It's also more fun that it's set at Christmas (in my opinion as well).","user":"Hellmant","rank":[79,115]}]
