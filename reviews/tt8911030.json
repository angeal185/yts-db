[{"title":"Cure for Insomnia","rating":1,"date":"7 January 2019","review":"If all the knowledge gained in this dreary documentary could be condensed into useful information, this could have been a 3 minute You Tube clip.\nWith stock slides that looked like that they were from a recruiting company to WWII Nazi Germany newsreel, there wasn't enough interesting content to keep an amphetamine junkie awake.\nI could also mention the narrator with his monotone Northern British accent and boring delivery, which would have been better suited in a film about how cricket balls are made.\nOh, I did mention it. I will also mention that you should not waste your time watching this.","user":"anyataylormelville","rank":[14,14]},{"title":"Must wear Aluminum Foil Hat!","rating":1,"date":"7 January 2019","review":"Hey you!\nYes, you!\nDo you believe that the earth is flat? That we are governed by reptilian overlords? Afraid of chem-trails?<br><br>If so, then this should be a real treat for you.\nI have rarely seen such a collection of unfounded and harebrained vomit made into a \"documentary\".<br><br>I guess somebody wanted to show off his collection of \"futuristic background clips\" from stock-sites and just had to fill it up with some pointless copy.\nStill it took them only 10 minutes until those clips were recycled again and again.<br><br>Also don't expect any useful or even new information about robots.","user":"bwdude","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"7 January 2019","review":"Just absolute garbage from start to finish. The narration is pretty bad, but I can't really blame him because nobody would be able to make the writing in this sound interesting.","user":"sundogsfan","rank":[10,10]}]
