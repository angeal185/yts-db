[{"title":"Have you checked the children?","rating":7,"date":"23 October 2000","review":"\"When a Stranger Calls\" is a somewhat entertaining horror-suspense-thriller that starts off great, loses steam in the middle, then comes back for a good finish. The beginning of this movie is outstanding, with babysitter Carol Kane receiving obscene phone calls from an unknown maniac. This is far and away the best part of the film. It's scary, creepy, and downright eerie. But it doesn't sustain that level through the entire film. The mid-portion of the movie is rather dull, featuring a few lazy supporting performances. But \"When a Stranger Calls\" redeems itself with a nail-biting climax, even though the conclusion doesn't top the film's opening in terms of scariness. Carol Kane and Charles Durning are good in the roles of the terrified babysitter and the private detective searching for the killer when he's on the loose. \"When a Stranger Calls\" is not a great horror movie but a good one. And its better than the cable-made sequel that came out fourteen years later, \"When a Stranger Calls Back\". <br><br>*** (out of four)","user":"jhaggardjr","rank":[32,37]},{"title":"Great opening and ending--lousy middle","rating":7,"date":"20 March 2004","review":"A girl (Carol Kane) is babysitting one night. She keeps getting phone calls from a guy saying \"Have you checked the children\". (They're upstairs sleeping). The phone calls continue. She gets nervous (and never checks the children). She calls the police. They trace the calls--they're coming from INSIDE the house...<br><br>This was a big hit in 1979 with teenagers--despite the R rating kids were let into this one. It does have a great opening 20 minutes and a pretty scary ending--but the middle is dull dull dull. It involves the killer (well played by Tony Beckley) stalking an older woman (Colleen Dewhurst slumming) and a police detective (Charles Durning--also slumming) after him.<br><br>Good performances save the middle half from being totally unbearable, and there is good direction from Fred Walton. But all in all this is a mediocre thriller. Still, I'm giving it a 7 for the opening, the closing and the acting.","user":"preppy-3","rank":[25,29]},{"title":"\"Have you checked the children?\"","rating":8,"date":"8 November 2001","review":"When a Stranger Calls boasts the scariest opening in film history. Wes Craven completely ripped this intro off in Scream. It's that good. Too bad the rest of the film isn't. It goes completely downhill after the beginning. It's so scary and has such a tense start that you can hardly watch it without holding your breathe. My girlfriend couldn't watch it period. She had to turn her head and keep asking me when it was over. It's very subtle, slow, and deliberate, and very frightening. The rest of the film can't live up to the energy generated by the beginning. But still, I recommend this because the beginning alone is better than most fright flicks in their entirety.","user":"Backlash007","rank":[43,53]}]
