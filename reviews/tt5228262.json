[{"title":"A Very Uninteresting and Unfortunate Failure","rating":4,"date":"29 January 2019","review":"That's one way to explain what was a missed opportunity with the ensemble cast featured in this alleged comedy. A single father (played by the rapper/actor Common), is suddenly beset by a relationship revelation and a curious incident at his place of employment. While his daughter waits for his Career Day presentation at her school, that very place is the scene of a man's dead body at the school. It's being handled by administrators in a curious \"we must keep this secret\" fashion. The directing debut of Judy Greer (professional \"best friend\" in multiple rom-coms) doesn't hold much appeal beyond some scenery. Most characters here you care just enough about, but it's in a mostly unfunny script.","user":"ChrisMIN43211","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Utterly forgettable","rating":3,"date":"30 October 2018","review":"I think I laughed 3 times in the entire movie. Also, Keanu Reaves is the first actor listed in this app and he's in the movie for all of 5 minutes.\nI remember when comedies used to be funny.","user":"enigma-947-339467","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"what?????","rating":2,"date":"25 October 2018","review":"This is not horror,thriller,romance,drama,sci-fi,musical or comedy, its just a bunch of actors that are usually above average standard in the art of acting, clinging to a ozone layer thin storyline about stupid teachers, a dead man,a lottery ticket,a damaged coffee machine,dultrey and adultry and soforth.\nits just a mess of a screenwriters decline toward alzheimer because it shows all the signs of a demented person. this comedy didnt even make me smile,it didnt even engage a braincell which ive got tens/tons of,a motheaten product of nothing. i give 2 because of the children.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[10,19]}]
