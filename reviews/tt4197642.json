[{"title":"Sensitive, funny and a feast of acting talent!","rating":9,"date":"3 October 2016","review":"A film that is original, topical and profound all at the same time! Modern cinema is typified by having a multiplicity of story-lines and an equal diversity of often unintelligible accents. Not so this production! The viewer is taken gradually into the inner workings of several characters by a director who knows how to tell a story with total clarity.<br><br>The acting is so exceptional and the cinematography so unobtrusive that I found myself totally engrossed in the reality on screen. Having worked with people not unlike \"mad Mary\" I found the portrayal remarkably accurate and touching. There is a great balance of sensitivity and humour. Although the story is based in Ireland, this is a tale that will strike chords around the world. This is a very special piece of cinema.","user":"redisle","rank":[25,30]},{"title":"This film is very special","rating":9,"date":"1 March 2017","review":"Yes great acting and great actors. Yes a very good soundtrack and some sharp writing and excellent dialog. The relationship depicted between mother and daughter was especially on target. But the the thing that really makes this film outstanding is the existential subtext. Take Irving Welsh and \"Trainspotting\" and its final last minute narration:<br><br>\"The truth is that I'm a bad person. But, that's gonna change - I'm going to change. This is the last of that sort of thing. Now I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life. I'm looking forward to it already. I'm gonna be just like you. The job, the family, the big television. The washing machine, the car, the compact disc and electric tin opener, good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage, starter home, leisure wear, luggage, three piece suite, DIY, game shows, junk food, children, walks in the park, nine to five, good at golf, washing the car, choice of sweaters, family Christmas, indexed pension, tax exemption, clearing gutters, getting by, looking ahead, the day you die.\"<br><br>Becoming an adult is a con game. The con you pull is on yourself. Frankly I have spend the better part of 20 years coming back to what my true core is, and who I really am. Mary is at that \"place\", where everyone is settling and literally settling into the person that society dictates, that family dictates. Social mores and binding observance of societal \"normality\" are not for everyone. Sometimes the price is too high.","user":"fashinrashin","rank":[22,31]},{"title":"Brilliant Piece of film making from Ireland","rating":8,"date":"13 May 2017","review":"Mary McArdle has just been released from prison after doing time for a violent crime. On here release she goes home to Drogheda where she can't wait to catch up with her best friend Charlene. But Charlene is getting married and despite having Mary as 'Maid of Honour' she seems heavily reluctant to hang out with her erstwhile closest friend.<br><br>What is worse Mary has not even got a 'plus one' on the Wedding invite as she has no boyfriend. So she sets out to get herself a date and then by dint of force of character make them join her for the Wedding. Seems like a simple plan but we all know what happens to the best laid plans, and in that department Mary is no exception.<br><br>Now this is a comedy drama and it deals with real life issues, often in an unflinching way but this is brilliantly juxtaposed with some razor sharp comedy and moments of wit that border on being genius. Seana Kerslake as 'Mad' Mary is perfect for the role and bodes well for more to come in her career. The entire cast though are spot on and the Grandmother gets two of the best lines, so the fun is spread round.<br><br>It is directed by Darren Thornton who co wrote it with Colin Thornton and I think they should be very proud of such an unassuming film that packs such a big cinematic punch. This is a film I can recommend all day long.","user":"t-dooley-69-386916","rank":[11,14]}]
