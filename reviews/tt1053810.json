I can't believe that people don't get it. <br><br>I've always admired people who where passionate about things in life. Be it model trains, woodworking, stamps or traveling.

They seem to give high ratings to mindless movies and fail to appreciate the good ones.<br><br>The Big Year is a beautiful drama-comedy picture, starring 4 of my favorite comedians - Steve Martin, Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Jim Parsons. <br><br>It is a touching and heart warming story, which has it's comic points and showcases most valuable life lessons - family coming first, the price people pay for being the greatest in any field, choosing between priorities etc.<br><br>It's a wonderful effort and it deserves a watch, and the a minimum 8 star rating.","user":"prashanta_guha","rank":[160,192]},{"title":"A underrated but heartfelt little movie","rating":7,"date":"27 February 2012","review":"With the lead cast consisting of Owen Wilson, Steve Martin and Jack Black, you would think The Big Year will be just another slapstick comedy with little to no story and cheap laughs. You would be wrong.<br><br>The Big Year is beautiful. Three men of different ages cross paths in their interest for birding; spotting as many birds as one can in one year.<br><br>But the film isn't really about \"birding\", it shows us life through three different views and the challenges life can bring and the choices that everyone has to make.<br><br>The Big Year is not a movie you will sit through laughing out loud, but you will be smiling for the better part of the 100 minutes.<br><br>One of the most underrated movies of 2011, The Big Year suffered from lack of promotion and a misleading poster and trailer.<br><br>Do yourself a favor, and watch this, you will not regret it!","user":"egjweb","rank":[69,81]}]
