[{"title":"Spectacular","rating":10,"date":"21 October 2018","review":"I knew little of Herve, despite that the show Fantasy Island was such a mega hit (I didn't watch the show but knew well of it). Dinklage presented a portrait of a man like I have never seen before; simply mesmerizing. I truly believe Dinklage may be the greatest living actor at this time, he is simply the most genuine and talented person in his craft. He is genius in GoT, but he simply amazes in his channeling of Herve. The story is well crafted and beautifully told, although a side story involving the reporter's personal life crisis seemed, well, not complete or fitting. However that is but a small portion of the story. The supporting cast was great too; Andy Garcia's Ricardo Montalban was shear excellence, and I love David Strathairn in anything he does. I thoroughly enjoyed this superb presentation of a fascinating story. Don't miss it.","user":"GonzoDanMan","rank":[70,84]},{"title":"Peter Dinklage","rating":9,"date":"21 October 2018","review":"Any weakness in this film be it script, direction, other cast members cannot hold a mention compared to the brilliant, consistent performance by PETER DINKLAGE . brilliant!","user":"merrigaytullock","rank":[53,64]},{"title":"A compelling tribute to the flawed individuals we all are","rating":7,"date":"24 October 2018","review":"It took me a while to let go of the 'that's not the type of dwarfism he had' problem, but when I was finally able to do so, I was able to appreciate the story much more. It touched (lightly, admittedly, but also in an 'everyman' (sic) kind of way) on the themes of self-belief, self-control, and self-congratulation, and how thin the line between them is. One false move can see you fall on your face, or require you to push someone else out of your way; and we never know when that false move may occur or what may prompt it to happen.","user":"Sabyn_Venator","rank":[19,21]}]
