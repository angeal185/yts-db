[{"title":"Best opening title sequence... ever!","rating":8,"date":"22 October 2004","review":"We all have unique reasons for loving a film. That's what makes cinema so magical. It's personal. You can love the meat of the movie, or you can love the trimmings. <br><br>There's a bunch of good stuff here. Most people my age will refer to \"Superman\" as THE definitive superhero film. None will ever take it's place. A position no doubt dictated by the age we were when first viewing it. As with films like \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", WHEN you experience them is just as important as HOW you experience them. <br><br>As we age, youth's eyes fade. Cynicism creeps in. Experience leads us to see the many injustices this life offers and we become more critical... less likely to accept that which we would rather believe. After all, an adult who clings to the youthful ideals of wonder is simply naive... right?<br><br>To this day, the opening title sequence for \"Superman\" fills me with the same magical joy it did over twenty years ago. Never was a score so perfectly crafted around a film. John Williams and Richard Donner created such an indelible experience that over 25 yrs later, Bryan Synger will use the same music and theme to bring the magic to a new generation of wondrous eyes. <br><br>As for me though, this will always remain the best.","user":"LookingforJulia","rank":[171,202]},{"title":"A Classic best origin story of a superhero of all time!","rating":10,"date":"24 October 2015","review":"Superman: The Movie (1978) is the Original film and the only that is the best origin story of a Superman who changes himself into an ultimate superhero. Christopher Reeve is and always will be the only SUPERMAN! No one could play Clark Kent/Superman like Christopher Reeve, the film is still instantiate classic till it's day.If anyone could be Superman. It is Christopher Reeve, he fits the part perfectly as the shy yet great reporter Clark Kent, Kal-El last son of Krypton, and Superman, Earths savior from the forces of evil. It is one of my personal favorite Superman movies.<br><br>Superman is a world known icon and is permanently set in stone as the best Superhero of all time. Though, the only Superman movies I enjoyed are the first three Superman movies that had Christopher Reeve in it! This is the best superhero of the 70's before Marvel and DC start making superhero movies. The origin story of a man who can fly, is terrific, believable and awesome. Marlon Brando's role was one of his best, the most films that become memorable for me are The Godfather (1972), Apocalypse Now (1979) and this film Superman, he completed 1.year earlier this film, before he started filming Apocalypse Now (1979). <br><br>What else can I say, that was already told? I love this film! I grew up with this film, this is the real original film which has a heart! Man of Steel (2013) reboot to Superman (1978) does not have a heart! This is the real film! The special effects are great, the CGI are barely in it, they aren't. The plot and the story are terrific. The cast is wonderful and acts believable. Superman and Christopher Reeve are the most beloved iconic heroes till it's day. For me Superman will always be Christopher Reeve no one else! I love Smallville (TV Series 2001-2011) and Tom Welling was playing young Clark Kent. Tom Welling will be Clark Kent for me, but Christopher Reeve will be Superman. Reeve also appeared in Season 2 and 3 as special guest in Smallvile which I love that so much. It is sad That Christopher Reeve died in October 10, 2004. John Williams theme score is the best score done for the character. I hear it and it makes me feel so uplifted and I feel like I can do anything. Great cast, beautiful score, and an Epic feeling that is lacking from movies in today's age. It is my favorite superhero film. Superman and his portrayal by Christopher Reeve is a masterpiece and is timeless . Incredible after all this time, this film still holds its own against more recent superhero films and all the CGI that goes with it. Richard Donner's work is a true homage to this classic hero that we have all come to love. I still get shivers when I hear the soundtrack as well. <br><br>This is a classic of the comic book hero genre, and in most respects the one that really set the standard for all comic book hero films that follow it. The special effects, sets, haircuts and wardrobe may all look dated, but Superman: The Movie remains among the most beloved films of the 1970s. Director Richard Donner brings the comic book hero to life in Christopher Reeve, who admirably adapts from the bumbling Clark Kent to the ultimate caped crusader. The entire cast is brilliant in its supporting roles. Gene Hackman gives a great performance as the unapologetically wicked Lex Luthor. And Margot Kidder delivers a portrait of a strong, ambitious Lois Lane at a time when women were starting to break the glass ceiling. But it is Donner's dedication to the spirit and style of the original Superman's comic book roots, as well as to inject a heavy dose of humor, that make Superman: The Movie a classic. In some ways, it has still not been surpassed, even by the CGI effects and faster-paced action of today's superhero movies.<br><br>The special effects and CGI look great and they don't suck. This film has a heart and it does not suck and is not bad. Marlon Brando was wonderful a touching movement performance as Jor-El, Clark's father. Incredible after all this time, this film still holds its own against more recent superhero films and all the CGI that goes with it. Richard Donner's work is a true homage to this classic hero that we have all come to love. I still get shivers when I hear the soundtrack as well. <br><br>A box-office smash, an Academy Award winner* and a fan favorite since it first flew into theaters in December 1978, Superman: The Movie assembles a cast and creative contingent as only a big movie can. At its heart (just as in three sequels) is Christopher Reeve's intelligent, affectionate portrayal of a most human Man of Steel. Watching Superman again isn't just like being a kid again. It's better. The movie's legacy soared even higher when director Richard Donner revisited this beloved adventure 22 years later and integrated eight minutes into the film. Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando (Jor-El), Gene Hackman (Luthor) and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane) give indelible performances that fuel the film's aura of legend. <br><br>Superman (also known as Superman: The Movie) is a 1978 superhero film directed by Richard Donner. It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name and stars Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, and Ned Beatty.<br><br>I love this film and is the best superhero classic film ever made!!!! 10/10 it is my personal favorite Superman movie.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[55,63]},{"title":"You'll still believe a man can fly","rating":12,"date":"12 May 2001","review":"Every once in a while you'll be flipping channels or meandering through the aisles of the local videorama, and you will stumble upon a film that takes you back to your childhood - and the child-like wonder that accompanied it. After 2 decades, as well as numerous (inferior) sequels and remakes, the original Superman is back.<br><br>Well, okay, maybe this wasn't the ORIGINAL one, but certainly no other version of the legend has had such a lasting impact as this one. Nor has any other telling of the tale been as thorough and ambitious as that put forth by Director Richard Donner and Story writer Mario Puzo. Add to that the utterly inspired (and inspiring) score by John Williams, and you have a dose of that good old movie magic. Even the opening credits manage to raise your adrenaline levels, as the Superman symbol soars through space across the screen and Williams' opening theme perfectly builds to a masterful crescendo. It will make you want to stand up from your couch and soar out of the nearest window, though I don't recommend it if you live on anything above the first floor.<br><br>The film begins on Superman's home world of Krypton, a dazzling planet dotted by crystalline cities which, combined again with William's incredible theme music, seem to present an image of heaven itself. A super-race of highly advanced beings, the Kryptonians' only weakness is their pride, as the infant Superman's father, Jor-el points out. It is that pride that leads them to ignore Jor-el's warnings that the planet is doomed by an impending supernova. In a last ditch effort to save his son, as well as some remnant of his race, he sends his infant son Kal-el to the planet Earth in a deep space probe. Marlon Brando, in the role of Jor-el, gives one of his best performances. His role is the stuff of Hollywood legend, since he was paid 4 million dollars for his role of about 10 minutes, but despite his exorbitant fee and minimal screen time, his performance is no less worthy.<br><br>The probe crashes in a farmer's field in the early 1950's, to be discovered by the Kents, with Glen Ford in the role of Pa Kent. Though he seems to have even less screen time than Brando, his role as the young Superman's moral example is no less pivotal to the story. Superman's childhood and most of his teen years are completely skipped over, however, Jeff East gives an excellent portrayal of the teen Clark Kent, who is only beginning to discover the real extent of his powers. <br><br>Most of the supporting cast equally distinguish themselves. Gene Hackman creates a charming and amusing villain in Lex Luthor, and while Margot Kidder's portrayal of Lois Lane is a bit forced and grating at times, she still shines with a kind of charm, and it is always fun to watch her slip from the tough-as-nails reporter to the flustered schoolgirl every time the Man of Steel hits the scene. If you still don't like her performance, watch the \"Lois Lane screen tests\" in the special features section of the DVD, which includes tryouts by various prominent actresses of the day. After watching them, I think you'll agree that the filmmakers made the right casting choice.<br><br>But of course, the person we will remember the most is Christopher Reeve as Superman, and this is the way he should be remembered. It was certainly his greatest role, and although he overplayed the nerdy and fumbling Clark Kent, and his Superman sometimes pauses to deliver silly platitudes, he does so with an air of wry amusement. He may act like a goody two-shoes, but mostly he just seems to be having a good time showing off, and damn it, why shouldn't he? He's Superman, after all. If I could fly, you could damn well bet I'd be showing off too. This is confirmed in a brief but enjoyable restored scene in which, after saving Lois Lane and the President, as well as foiling several crimes, Superman flies back to his Fortress of Solitude to discuss it with his \"Father\", or rather, the persona of Jor-el which has been preserved in memory crystals and sent to earth with the infant Kal-el, so that he could benefit from Jor-el's knowledge and wisdom. He admonishes his son that, while it is natural to enjoy being able to show off his powers, he must learn to be humble and keep his vanity in check.<br><br>It is surprising how little moments of restored footage such as this one seem to breathe much more life into the characters, giving them a depth not seen in their previous cinematic incarnation. And while the film is a tale of the power of good, it is ultimately a tribute to the power of love. It is love that makes Superman more vulnerable than even kryptonite, love that makes him betray his Kryptonian father's admonition to \"never interfere with human history\", and love that makes him truly human. <br><br>Though it is nearly an hour into the film before Superman finally makes his first heroic and world-stunning appearance, it is well worth the wait. The action gets more and more exciting, rivaling anything that today's action counterparts, like \"The Mummy Returns\" can dish out. The effects, though antiquated by today's overblown CGI standards, are still impressive and manage to maintain their looks and grace in their old age. As Lex Luthor launches a diabolical plan involving hijacked twin nuclear missiles, the subsequent chase, followed by Superman's efforts to save an Earthquake-ravaged California, are breathtaking even by today's standards.<br><br>Like the superhero of title, the film itself is not without its weaknesses. In trying to keep in touch with its vintage comic book roots, it can be a tad cornball at times, and occasionally gets bogged down by what I call the \"golly gee-whiz\" factor. Yet it does so in a very tongue-in-cheek manner, retaining enough adult sophistication and genuine drama to keep it from lapsing into a mere kiddy show or a parody of the source material. In fact, the film has several surprisingly mature nuances. If, like me, you hadn't seen this film since you were a kid, then you will be in a much better position to fully enjoy the subtleties of the film now. (i.e, Lois Lane, in her rooftop interview of Superman asks \"How big are you . . . er, I mean . .. how TALL are you\". I obviously missed that as a kid, because it had me rolling with laughter this time around. <br><br>But despite a few loose threads in the cape and tights, The Man of Steel remains quite intact and appropriately larger than life. It is therefore fitting that this film has been re-mastered and re-released in collector's two-sided DVD format. The sound and picture quality are excellent, wiping away the tarnish of age and making the film shine again. Some of the many features include the aforementioned restored footage (about 10-15 minutes worth), a few additional deleted scenes (which, I thought, should have been restored into the film as well), commentary by director Richard Donner, the Lois Lane screen tests, specials on the making and origins of the film, and a music-only track (well worth the price of the DVD alone).<br><br>If you haven't seen this movie since you were a kid, and you want to feel like a kid again, rent it now. If you've never seen it at all, then the release of this DVD has taken away your last excuse. You will believe a man can fly.","user":"y2mckay","rank":[102,125]}]
