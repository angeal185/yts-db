[{"title":"Clich√©d to the Core but Latifah, Martin and Plowright Add Their Own Touch","rating":25,"date":"25 March 2008","review":"This is pretty much another one of those typical culture clash comedies where a streetsmart character meets the classy rich character, there's conflict and then the conflict is resolved and friendship blossoms, then there's another conflict but that too is resolved by the end. The story has been told x number of times. But what makes 'Bringing Down The House' likable is Queen Latifah, Steve Martin and Joan Plowright. These three provide some laugh-out-loud moments some including Martin and Latifah's dance number, Martin dressing and talking 'black', Queen Latifah and Missy Pyle's catfight and doing a break-dance, Plowright's pompous and stuck up character getting stoned, Peter's neighbour catching him and Charlene in a compromising position. The chemistry between Latifah and Martin is convincing and both have a good comic timing. Thus, even though the story has nothing new to offer, the funny moments make 'Bringing Down The House' fun to watch.","user":"Chrysanthepop","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"Really something, Boo.","rating":6,"date":"18 March 2006","review":"OK, so the white-yuppie-and-black-ghetto-person-joining-up idea has been used a number of times in movies, but the dialog between Steve Martin and Queen Latifah makes this one worthwhile. Probably the best scenes are Betty White's nasty comments, Queen Latifah teaching Missi Pyle a lesson, Steve Martin dressed - and attempting to talk - like a rapper (especially because of what Joan Plowright ends up doing in that scene), and of course, Eugene Levy's statements ending with \"Boo\". \"Bringing Down the House\" really does bring down the house. Completely silly, but fun nevertheless.<br><br>Who ever would have imagined Joan Plowright (aka Laurence Olivier's widow) doing what she did and saying what she said in the rapper scene?","user":"lee_eisenberg","rank":[18,19]},{"title":"Beware of who you meet in the chat room.","rating":8,"date":"20 March 2003","review":"This film, although badly reviewed by many people, proves to be a fun time at the movies. Adam Shankman and Jason Filardi have teamed up to give the viewers lots of laughs. It's hard not to be amused by what's being presented even though it might not be the greatest, or the funniest picture.<br><br>\nQueen Latifah has more charisma in her ample body than any other actress working in American films these days. She never gives a bad performance. This is quite a stretch from her role in Chicago; in fact, she steals the film with her charm. She can hold up her own against her co-star.<br><br>\nSteve Martin seems to blend himself into this joke of a lawyer, who is so uptight and anal that he never has enough time for his children. He has some hysterical scenes at the hip hop club playing an Eminem-type character, outdancing everyone. Mr. Martin's experience in the chat room brings him a lot more than he bargained for: the irrisistible Charlene, who turns his life upside down.<br><br>Eugene Levy has some bright moments as Steve Martin's friend in the firm. Joan Plowright repeats herself into the role of the ogre with a heart of gold, once she loosens up with the right kind of smoke. The rest of the cast is good, working with the material they're given to perform.<br><br>\nIf you are trying to get away from the horrible news being bombarded at us these days, this is the film for you.","user":"jotix100","rank":[29,34]}]
