[{"title":"To The Naysayers I Say. Did You Even See The Film?","rating":7,"date":"11 July 2019","review":"Being a low budget film, I wasn't expecting much. The ability of Maria to put together such a beautiful piece on a shoestring says a lot about her talent and attention to detail. I was immediately touched by the level of thought that was put into every scene. The aesthetics, lighting and locations were amazing. To say I'm looking forward to more of her work would be an understatement.","user":"bob_james9397","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"A good look!","rating":8,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"I really like the production value of this film. The director Maria Allred did a great job making the small numbered cast hold down a full movie! You will enjoy this film!","user":"brianberry-45740","rank":[20,32]},{"title":"Mind bending drama","rating":9,"date":"7 June 2019","review":"So this has the feel of an actor piece say like a Mike Figgis or Henry Jaglom with the more modern sensibility of a modern blockbuster in a visual sense, in some ways reminded me limitless. It's a worthy watch right up until the end as I do not want to give away any spoilers.","user":"davidjzellis","rank":[21,34]}]
