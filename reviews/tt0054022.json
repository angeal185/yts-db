[{"title":"A Sweet Film","rating":13,"date":"13 February 2002","review":"Unlike many others who have left comments about this film, I really enjoy it.  This is definitely not high on the intellect scale, but it is a sweet romantic comedy. I agree this is not Marilyn's best film, but her performance in the role is better than anyone else could have done it; very cute and believable.  Some of the writing really seems to target Marilyn's own personal life (I don't know if they did that on purpose), especially when she talks about going to night school.  Also during the song \"Incurably Romantic,\" Marilyn's dress is flying up (a parallel to \"The Seven-Year Itch?\").  Her performance of the song \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\" is just great.  It's really a lot of fun. The cameos are awesome, they really make the film into a \"time capsule\" of the most popular comedian, dancer, and singer of the time.  Tony Randall has a nice supporting role throughout the film; he is great in the scene where he sees Jean-Marc Clement's \"softer side.\" Yves Montand and Marilyn Monroe have the strangest relationship in the movie, and you have to feel bad for Jean-Marc!  He is not used to NOT getting the girl!  Yves plays this very well, I think.  They may lack some chemistry, but the two characters are cute and likable and you really want them to get together. So what I'm saying is, this is well worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of Marilyn or Yves, just don't expect it to be intellectually challenging... it is a great rainy day flick. :-)","user":"marilynm216","rank":[51,56]},{"title":"All About Charm...","rating":26,"date":"26 November 2002","review":"This is one of my favorite Marilyn films.  No, let me amend that--this is one of my favorite Marilyn performances.  She is sweet, natural, sympathetic, adorable. She has no character to play and no script and no director (Cukor was sliding fast at this  point)  But she and Montand are lovely together; two great charmers surrounded by an overblown 60's confection of \"guest stars\" and constant costume changes (although some of Marilyn's outfits  are so flimsy one wonders  why they bothered to dress her at all?!)  \"My Heart Belongs To Daddy\" is classic MM, but I have a perverse fondness for \"Specialization\" with Monroe hopping around (she  really couldn't dance) in this INCREDIBLE gown, belly and backside bulging, a Reubens come to  life. It's a very minor film, especially sandwiched between \"Some Like  It Hot\" and \"The Misfits\"  but there is pleasure to be found if you're into Miss M.","user":"denis-38","rank":[40,46]},{"title":"I have changed my opinion about this film!","rating":6,"date":"11 January 2007","review":"Not regarded as one of MM's best films by her legion of fans. \"Lets make Love\" isn't as bad as one might think. Gregory Peck and Carey Grant were originally asked to be her co-star, but after reading the script I guess they soon declined. Neither were game to play 2nd fiddle to a screen sensation.<br><br>Plot line reads as follows: Rich man (Yves Montand) wants poor girl.(M.M.) Rich man pretends to be poor. Rich man gets poor girl then looses her after he tries to tell her the truth. Rich man eventually woos and gets the girl. <br><br>With Marilyns clout at 20th Century Fox studios one wonders why she chose to take the role as Amanda Dell. She's not altogether bad as the character. The script simply had little to offer her. But I have to say after repeated viewings, the film has grown on me. I am a huge fan of MM and to be fair Monroes first appearance singing \"My heart belongs to Daddy\" is a clever and exciting opening performance. What an entrance, she is on fire in this 3 minute masterpiece. I love the kiss and wink and staging of this classic piece. That scene is the best musical number in the picture. This sequence might have been filmed and added at the last minute after 20th Century Fox exec's saw a rough cut of the film. <br><br>Marilyn does look very comfortable and relaxed on the screen. But, at times she appears distracted.(Probably George Cukors uneven direction) There is something a little charming about the whole production. The musical score will grow on you and \"Incurably Romantic\" is very well done. This film was nominated for an Oscar for best musical score. I also loved the fantasy sequence with Yves and MM in the board room on the table where she is knitting with gold yarn. She even makes that chore look sexy!<br><br>Marilyn and Yves are finally given a chance to show some real spark in the final scene of the movie when the whole charade comes to a close. Trapped in an elevator (and looking her best in the film) with a starry eyed Yves, Marilyn finally succumbs to his musical rendition of the title of this movie. They kiss passionately and we finally see AND hear what all the gossip was about. Her very heavy breathing during the kiss is caught on film, just turn up the volume... there is nothing \"Method acting\" about that! Aside from her sensitivity, intellect, and training with the Strasbergs this is what Monroe the movie star sex goddess was about.A fine line between acting and reality was beautifully blurred in \"Lets make love\"s final 2 minute scene. Released in 1960 The audience when asked \"Lets make love\" apparently said no thanks. The film was a box office failure.","user":"emhughley","rank":[13,14]}]
