[{"title":"Don't bother","rating":1,"date":"15 April 2019","review":"I love indi-horror. I always try to find something to appreciate in these kinda low-budget flicks. This movie, however, fails of every level. I have never regretted watching a movie so much before. Do not waist your time.","user":"TheSchinppenSchnaff","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":3,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"The film was absolutely terrible. The plot got very boring with a lot of talking and hardly much action to keep you entertained. Don't get me started on the acting, it was very poor. Do not buy and save your money.","user":"bloodborne-78820","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"ScareNo","rating":4,"date":"15 February 2019","review":"It's exactly as bad as you'd expect any horror movie to be that has the word 'bride' in its title.","user":"bartrkottelaar","rank":[4,5]}]
