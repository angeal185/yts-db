[{"title":"Almost amateur standards","rating":1,"date":"4 June 2017","review":"Sorry to the producers of this attempt at a charming boy and his heroic pet saga, but it really is awful. The animations were just odd, the direction so wooden I felt like building a camp fire. The story leaps about at points with characters turning up in places from scene to scene with no explanation of how they got there and the military's motivation for being there is only something you guess about long after it even matters. Certainly not for adults and my two grand kids were very bored.","user":"stuartp7","rank":[37,54]},{"title":"You know what it wants to be, but it doesn't manage it.","rating":4,"date":"10 September 2017","review":"I have low expectations for children's films because they're usually terrible. This film isn't very good, even by those low standards.<br><br>You can see that it wants to be a family friendly action film, with a bit of heartwarming stuff between the kid and his dinosaur.<br><br>It fails pretty hard at that. There's no humour or charm here. There's no chemistry between the actors, or between the actors and the cgi creatures. The set pieces are weak.<br><br>Both my child and I got bored very quickly.<br><br>It's a shame, because it could have been so much better. We deffo need films like this.","user":"dan-bealecocks","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"film should have died with the dinos","rating":2,"date":"7 September 2017","review":"Badly acted, kids performances made the adult actors seem even worse, couldn't be bothered waiting for the dinos to show up.<br><br>Not a lot to like about this film, was expecting something better.<br><br>Do yourselves a favour and watch, How To Train Your Dragon, the cartoon characters are more believable, likable and watchable.","user":"sguilly","rank":[17,26]}]
