[{"title":"You need your thinking head on, but it's a good movie.","rating":7,"date":"9 January 2020","review":"I enjoyed this film from the opening credits right through to the end. It's nicely photographed and well acted. Certainly the story contains some challenges for the viewer - at the start of the film information comes in from all angles, but stay with it and it assembles into a good story.","user":"ListenToChris","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"All Mixed Up","rating":4,"date":"8 January 2020","review":"I like films that mess about with time, space, etc BUT this just messed up. Even now I am looking at my '4' rating thinking it could be a '3'. Similar films that cleverly worked for me are Convergence &amp; Triangle. I thank you.","user":"targetlad72","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"Average movie, great actors","rating":6,"date":"9 February 2020","review":"For how bad the plot and the idea was, Thomas Brazzle and Dylan Grunn characters and performances were great.","user":"skamarakasliutauras","rank":[0,1]}]
