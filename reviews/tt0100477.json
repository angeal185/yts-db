[{"title":"Completely likable sequel, that is under-appreciated!","rating":8,"date":"27 February 2009","review":"It isn't as good as the immensely charming original, but I enjoyed this very much. You do realise that this was released 13 years after the original, and a lot of the characters had to be animated again. I forgive them for that though, as the animation was surprisingly good, especially the scenes with Marahute, who blew me away at the sight of her. Though Bianca does look different than she was in the original film, she had chubbier cheeks here. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor are great as Bernard and Bianca, although there was a significant change in both characters. John Candy was hilarious as Wilbur. If there is one element that is better than the original, but only marginally, it is that Wilbur is funnier than Orville. The plot was also very good, on a parallel with the original, but that was the intention, and the music by Bruce Broughton was appropriately fitting. Cody is very likable, but sometimes his dialogue is a bit unnatural, and I know that people commented on his accent. George C. Scott, a fine actor, was suitably menacing as McLeach, although his animation at times was a tad frightening. I really enjoyed this movie, it's not perfect, but it is one of the better animated sequels to come out. 8/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"Underappreciated Gem","rating":10,"date":"3 November 2000","review":"I have always been one of the, maybe, eight or nine big fans of this movie and I have only one small question about it.<br><br>WHY CAN'T THEY MAKE MORE LIKE THIS???<br><br>If you have not seen this movie yet, you must.  It's the first Disney movie to use fully rendered CGI backgrounds throughout and you definately get the sense that the animators wanted to play with this new method.  What I'm getting at is that some of you may want to down some motion sickness medicine first.<br><br>There are *no* song and dance numbers.  Reason being that this is a surprisingly dark, more emotionally complex story for a Disney movie.  They went out on a limb and chose not to break the tone up too much.<br><br>This is the number two Lost Disney Movie (number one, without a doubt, is \"the Hunchback of Notre Dame\", which I also love).  It's own creators barely acknowledge its existance.  The very best evidence of this is on the new video release box's plot summary, where a MAJOR character's gender is misidentified.  <br><br>On the other hand, I sort of enjoy the idea of a \"cult\" Disney movie. Instead of marketing \"Down Under\" to death, Disney can only be accused of the opposite mistake.<br><br>So, anyway, here I go again running to this movie's defence.  I'll tackle the one major critisism of it before I go.  Many critics were expecting another \"Rescuers\".  In my humble opinion, these two movies are two entirely different animals.  The original \"Rescuers\" is an example of where Disney was in the sixties and seventies.  \"Down Under\" is a time capsule of late eighties, early nineties Disney.  In other words, you can't really say that one is better than the other as the only thing they have in common are three characters (what I'm getting at is that this should be thought of more as \"Rescue Aid Society: the Next Generation\").<br><br>By the way, I've got an idea that I'm just going to throw out to the proverbial wolves here.  Why not make more \"Rescuers\" movies instead of sequels to Disney movies where follow-up stories make no sence?  They are sitting on one heck of a potential franchise here.  Just thought I'd let you know.","user":"La Gremlin","rank":[51,60]},{"title":"Most underrated Disney movie ever!","rating":9,"date":"27 August 2011","review":"This has been a family favorite ever since it came out and it's sad that not many people appreciate it for what it is.<br><br>This is less of a sequel and more of a separate story with only three characters (the chubby mouse in charge of the Rescue Aid Society, Wilbur, and Miss Bianca) returning, this time to rescue Cody, a young boy who is attempting to rescue animals from poachers and is kidnapped in the process. His most recent animal rescue is Marahute, the golden eagle.<br><br>While disjointed in places, this film proves to be a fun little thrill ride. The main characters are fairly well-developed though typically one-dimensional. The only one who shows a character arc is Bernard, who finally has a chance to move past his superstitious, worrisome nature and find some courage.<br><br>MacLeech, the poacher villain, is sufficiently creepy and his huge lizard sidekick Joanna is awesomely funny. Our family has even developed the habit for calling 'Joannaaaaaa!' whenever we see a really big lizard, so enthralled we are with the reptile. Another funny character is Frank the frilled lizard, who never fails to bring giggles.<br><br>The good parts about this film are the typically wonderful animation (first animated Disney movie with computer animation!) and the AWESOME music. It's wonderful! No song-and-dance numbers and a sweeping score, composed by Bruce Broughton (Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey). The liberal use of woodwinds serves the story well, able to bring sadness in certain areas and playfulness in others.<br><br>The best part in the movie is easily the flying sequence, which never fails to bring goosebumps. I would go so far as to say the third shot from the last (where Cody is pushed off the edge of the waterfall) is the best shot in Disney animation history.<br><br>Overall, a fun romp that doesn't have enough appreciation.","user":"DirectorCarrie","rank":[10,10]}]
