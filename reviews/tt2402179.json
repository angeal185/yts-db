[{"title":"Analysis of the Contemporary Movie-Making Business that Misfires Slightly","rating":13,"date":"13 November 2013","review":"SEDUCED AND ABANDONED begins with a fascinating premise, as actor Alec Baldwin and filmmaker James Toback try to raise funds for their proposed new movie, tentatively entitled \"Last Tango in Tikrit.\" This documentary charts their efforts to schmooze a variety of investors from various countries into giving them the $15m. necessary to finance the movie. Some of the situations are extremely funny, especially when Toback tries his level best to convince the investors of the viability of his proposal, even if it means agreeing to any and every suggestion the investors propose. However the film's principal subject-matter gets lost, as many of the movie people interviewed (including actors Ryan Gosling and Jessica Chastain, directors Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola) discuss various topics, including their origins, the arts of acting and directing, and their views of filmmaking as a whole. As a result the narrative tends to sag in places, despite numerous reminders - in the form of visuals - that the film business comprises 95% hustling and 5% filmmaking. On the plus side, both Baldwin and Toback come across as basically likable and sincere, the kind of artists that should be encouraged in their future endeavors.","user":"l_rawjalaurence","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Baldwin's tap-dance","rating":8,"date":"16 November 2013","review":"Everything was painfully familiar to me but I managed to laugh nonetheless. The meeting with Avi Lerner should be obligatory viewing for beginners. And Mark Damon? He was an actor in Italian films of the 60's, not Fellini mind you but the others who made low budget epics. The landscape of \"how to get financing for movies\" has changed radically in the last few years but this is a residue of something that is still very much alive. Alec Baldwin pitching the idea to tired foreign sales agents is a delight and the comments from Martin Scorsese and other giants, are priceless. If you're in the business you'll laugh in recognition, if you're a civilian with ideas to join the film world of independent movies, this may give you pause.","user":"abelardo64","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Fun, upbeat and educational","rating":9,"date":"26 January 2014","review":"There are times when this \"documentary\" strayed but at all levels it was quite a thing to see and to learn from. ++SPOILER ALERT HERE+++ Watching billionaires turn down Alec Baldwin's request for money is always good film fodder. Scorcese and Gosling (old and new school, respectively) brought some much needed light to how the industry works and used to work, what's \"bankable\" and why. The Johnny Depp example is something we're all probably aware of but to have it spelled out like that was an eye-opener. There's a lot to absorb from this little game, and I have to assume it was a game. I mean, Baldwin didn't even bring a script to market so my assumption is that it was all a bit of a hoax. At any rate, it was very educational to see so many players in the biz sit down before a camera and be so candid about what Hollywood was and what Hollywood is now.","user":"rumhouseproductions","rank":[5,7]}]
