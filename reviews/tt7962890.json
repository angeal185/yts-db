[{"title":"Profit optimization versus Consumer health: 1-0","rating":6,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"Although the documentary gives the impression of having been filmed with a webcam of the 50s and does not disclose any sensational news, it is clear and educational. It's a priori the main objective. Moreover, it offers cold comfort via a sad ascertainment: in Argentina or elsewhere, in France for instance, it is unfortunately everywhere the same refrain with overproduction in the disregard of both consumers and environment.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[12,13]}]
