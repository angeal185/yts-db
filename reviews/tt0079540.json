[{"title":"This is one of my all-time favorite films","rating":21,"date":"21 January 2002","review":"'Meatballs' is a nice and surprisingly, bittersweet film. It remains every bit as fresh, funny and entertaining as the day it was first released. Forget the sleazy in-name only \"sequels\". This is the one-and-only, the original. It is a very good-natured and uplifting film. It makes and leaves you feeling good, but a little bit sad when it is over. It perfectly captures the experiences of being a kid, summer camp, camping and growing-up. It also captures just as well the memories made by making friends and having a good time and the pain of having to say goodbye. There are many memorably funny moments and even some touching ones, as well. It is unthinkable how anyone could not like this film or give it bad reviews. Having grown-up in the late 1970's, it is a nice trip to the past and fond memories of summers gone-by. I highly recommend this warm, charming and upbeat film. Don't miss it!","user":"DMichaelDavidson","rank":[40,42]},{"title":"Spaz! Spaz! Spaz! Spaz!....","rating":8,"date":"17 November 2002","review":"I can hardly call this a great film but it is entertaining.  In my case I, at the time this film was released, was the same age as some of the junior campers in the film.  For me watching this film brings back the memories of my camp years.  While some of the pranks that takes place in this movie, like carrying the camp director out in his bed and leaving him on the side of a road, strung up in the trees or out on a lake, are a bit over the top some of the other pranks are not.  When I went to camp the campers and counselors pulled similar stunts such as running underwear up the flag pole, canoe battles and boys raiding the girls cabin.  As I grew older I realized these night raids to the girls cabin that I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so that we wouldn't find the girls in embarrassing situations but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun.  That's what MEATBALLS (MB) is.  <br><br>MB captures not only the scenic beauty of camp surroundings but the beauty of being young and carefree.  MB give a great example of pre-teens, teens and young adults living their summer with no concerns other than guys hooking up with girls and girls hooking up with guys and booth having as much fun as they can before they head back to junior high &amp; high school and college.  The opening title song that goes \"Are you ready for the summer?...no more homework no more books, no more teachers dirty looks...\" describes exactly how summer is viewed by school kids. <br><br>\nI personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink.  What boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend all camp trying to cozy up to some pretty girl camper? What guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors?  While these two characters are somewhat over the top I bet everybody who watches the film can't help but to like these two guys.  These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown from PEANUTS and Jack Tripper &amp; Larry Dallas from THREE'S COMPANY.  I would bet that most viewers even cheer for Spaz in the egg carrying competition and for Fink as he attempts to \"beat the stomach\" in the hot dog eating contest. <br><br>Lastly, this movie had normal looking kids and counselors.  No super models for counselors or campers that wore trendy clothing.  It is fun to just kick back and watch this film and remember when life was as fun as this movie.","user":"AbeStreet","rank":[50,56]},{"title":"The first and best of the MEATBALLS movies!","rating":23,"date":"23 October 2001","review":"I caught this on television one day when I was young and loved it. In the 1970's, there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise. It's one of the best comedies of the 1970's and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to Murrary's excellent comedic performance, which still stands as one of his greatest. This is the film that really got Ivan Reitman noticed as a director. Reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this film is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that it's fun, MEATBALLS 3 and MEATBALLS 4 are absolutely dreadful. Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.","user":"jellyneckr","rank":[19,20]}]
