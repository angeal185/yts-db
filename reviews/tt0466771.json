[{"title":"Not that bad","rating":6,"date":"16 May 2006","review":"If you go into watching this movie looking for the pothead humor of Half Baked or even That 70s Show, you will not find what you are looking for. By that I mean there is no \"Man I am so high\" giggle giggle jokes. Although there is a fair share of toilet humor, literally. The acting, in my opinion was good. There is nothing I hate more than an actor playing up to all the stereotypes to make themselves seem \"intoxicated.\" Smoking marijuana may not make you the smartest person around, but you can still function. With the writing, it seems like they were trying to make built in catchphrases, by repeating the same lines at several points. It's not like they were randomly spoken, they fit every time. I just don't see them getting to be as big as say, \"Your mom goes to college.\" But who thought that that would catch on? Irreguardless, I'm sorry, regardless, it is a decent movie. A good example of why a movie should go direct to DVD. It's likable, just not a blockbuster hit. It's good marketing not to waste money advertising it. The people that are going to see it know about it and are going to rent it or buy it either way. It's complex.","user":"geny82","rank":[23,29]},{"title":"Excellent modern Cheech and Chong mirror movie!

All weekend long, ha ha! ha ha! A MUST SEE!","user":"stephensandrew","rank":[20,26]},{"title":"it was nice","rating":7,"date":"11 December 2006","review":"excuse me for my terrible English. it isn't my first language.<br><br>i watched this movie last week, after rolling a few joints. i thought it was hilarious. yesterday, i watched the movie again, but this time there wasn't any weed involved. i still thought the movie was funny, even though it's a very very low budget movie.<br><br>i like to smoke weed, and maybe that is the reason why i can laugh about these jokes. i don't think this movie will be a favorite of any person, but i think most people don't like the idea of watching a movie that contains 2 people smoking weed.<br><br>i gave it a 7, just because it made me laugh.","user":"poserman-mailinglist","rank":[26,38]}]
