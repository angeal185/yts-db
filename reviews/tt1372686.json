[{"title":"AMAZINGLY relevant - even in 2011","rating":9,"date":"14 November 2011","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing Ralph Fiennes's \"Coriolanus\" at the St. Louis International Film Festival, on Nov 11th, 2011. I was on the edge of my seat through the entire film. Needless to say, the filming, production values, etc., were fantastic; but it was the relevance of the film that kept me glued to the screen. <br><br>Ralph Fiennes captured the timeless concepts that Shakespeare expressed in his play brilliantly - so much so that I feel there will be strong/visceral audience reaction to the film's depiction of themes that reflect in today's front page stories. <br><br>The theme of a military officer's political role resonated with me as a retired Navy Officer. The theme of the contrast between \"high society\" and the proletariat resonates in the \"Occupy XXX\" protests occurring today. The conflict between liberal and conservative (dare I say Democrat vs. Republican) ideals played very loudly in this film. Even the issues in European politics reflected themes we see in today's news. <br><br>The acting by Ralph Fiennes, Vanessa Redgrave &amp; Gerard Butler propelled the story and kept it moving swiftly. Some have panned the use of Shakespeare's original language. I, for one, had no trouble following the language. This film ranks with Kenneth Brannagh's \"Henry V\" and Baz Luhrmann's \"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet\" for making a film in Shakespearean English accessible by 21st Century Man. <br><br>I've always believed that some folks in the U.S. malign William Shakespeare's writings today, because they were forced to read his plays in a cold classroom setting in their youth. Shakespeare didn't intend his works to be read. He meant them to be performed and watched. This film proves the power of a good telling of a Shakespeare tale.","user":"dbaggett1","rank":[152,186]},{"title":"Spectacular","rating":9,"date":"20 January 2012","review":"A jaw-dropping interpretation of Shakespeare's Coriolanus. I was literally in awe when I left. Admittedly, I know my way around the story, I've read Coriolanus a few times. But I have to say that this adaptation is so well executed that I caught myself discovering incredible lines and themes and ideas to which I had never paid attention before. Ralph Fiennes' interpretation of Coriolanus is solid. The pride, the wrath, the one-track-mindedness are all very palpable. And one couldn't wish for a better Volumnia. Terrifying. Fascinating. I've always been reluctant to modern settings, but this time, I loved it. It just worked. Go and see for yourself. As for me, I'm definitely going to watch it again.","user":"laurenchide","rank":[97,119]},{"title":"Look out Kenneth Branagh","rating":8,"date":"27 February 2011","review":"This is my first review on IMDb so bare with me. Coriolanus has the right ingredients for a good movie, great story(can you top Shakespeare?) and a strong cast.Only thing that was unknown so far is the director.IMO Mr. Fiennes did very well in his debut, his camera moves around at eyes height and often lingers close up to actors faces(it keeps the film from being stagy and lets you see all the nuances they convey).Locations are interesting and there are couple of nice fight scenes.The language is Shakespirian but i had no problems understanding it( not my native lang.), musical score is kinda tribal and quite appropriate for the theme of the film. It's a very dark movie and it gets a bit bloody sometime so if you're not into that be warned. My vote is 8/10 i recommend it to everyone and hope to see more of Mr. Fiennes work behind the camera. P.S. Look out Ken Branagh you've got some competition now :)","user":"gervasiustvinkleminkleso","rank":[176,233]}]
