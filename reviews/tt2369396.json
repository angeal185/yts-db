[{"title":"Exploitation trash at it's best.","rating":8,"date":"25 September 2013","review":"I got to see this without knowing anything about it and wow, was I surprised. Any fans of trash/sleaze/exploitation films will love it as it really knows just what it is. the story is a very simple one. Bounty killer's in the future hunt white collar criminals and give their bodies in for cash. Everything is fine until \"drifter\" has a bounty put out on him and he has to make it across \" the badlands \" and gangs of crazed killers out for his blood to clear his name.<br><br>What follows is a frenetic, comic book style, sci fi, action flick with ass kicking women, dressed in next to nothing, some toting guns. Exploding heads, lashings of violence and a load of humor. <br><br>Bounty Killer clearly knows what it is and loves it. It has the kind of energy that's missing from most films these days but reminded me of the original Death Race 2000 and even Faster Pussycat Kill, Kill. It's a mans night in film. Sit back, get drunk and enjoy.<br><br>I get the feeling it will get it's own cult following.","user":"nexus62010","rank":[61,75]},{"title":"Apocolyptic Action in it's Purest Form!! Cult Classic!!","rating":9,"date":"30 September 2014","review":"Awesome movie. B-Rated Cult movie in it's finest. This is probably an unintentional stroke of genius. No matter what it is \"Bounty Killer\" has it. So much, in fact I had to write my first movie review. I did it based on the fact that I think everyone should try this movie out just once. <br><br>Everything was done to max effect, despite the apparent budget. Matthew Marsden did real good as the brooding \"Drifter\" &amp; Christian Pitre as \"Mary Death\" stole the show with her spicy combination of ruthlessness &amp; sexy. Supporting actor Barak Hardley did a good job as the comic relief gun caddy \"Jack\". Supporting roles by Gary Busey, Eve, and Beverly D'Angelo also were not a wasted. <br><br>All I can say from my personal experience, is that I came in looking for a time filler movie and found a very entertaining cult raunch movie in the same vein as Quentin Tarantino &amp; Robert Rodriguez films. The only thing that separate this movie from the other ones is marketing &amp; a bigger budget. If it'd had those things, it probably would've took Hollywood by storm. *(Hollywood Execs--hint, hint)* Wondering if you'd like it: If you like the movie poster, then chances are you're REALLY gonna like this film. It's exactly what you thought It was lol","user":"marquettemcneal","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Mediocre Cinema, Great Entertainment","rating":8,"date":"26 September 2013","review":"First of all let me say that I was compelled to create an account after watching this movie despite the one overly negative review of this film. While not my favorite, I had an enjoyable time watching this film and feel it was one of the better action comedy's I have seen in a while. Nothing too thought provoking or deep here, just simple entertainment that succeeds by not trying to be more than it is. <br><br>Its post-apocalyptic, Its based on a graphic novel, the main character is called \"Drifter,\" Barak Hardley declares PBR Tastes like boobies. Overall I have to side with San Francisco Chronicle reviewer G. Allen Johnson's assessment that everyone in the film looks to be having a good time. <br><br>If you can get over (or enjoy) the general campiness, excessive gore, and the fact that Gary Busey never says \"Butthorn,\" it should be a good time for you too.","user":"i-r-henderson","rank":[39,52]}]
