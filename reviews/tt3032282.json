[{"title":"What not to do on a desert Island","rating":2,"date":"14 January 2017","review":"Why do some movies get made? Why did this one? No, really, I'm asking, because I don't for the life of me know why. Production values seem reasonably high - the plane crash, CGI for missing limbs etc. Why didn't they spend a few bucks on the script?! - it is just stupid on top of stupid. E.g. they are marooned on a desert Island with few supplies, needing to conserve strength, yet they run around playing soccer, continuously swim back and forth between two Islands (a mile apart) engage in sexual relations constantly (but zero nudity) - and I could go on, but I will not waste any more of my energy on this turd of a motion picture","user":"krusadk","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"What NOT to do to survive...","rating":3,"date":"27 November 2016","review":"LOTS OF SPOILERS!!! <br><br>So your plane crashes next to a deserted island. Some die, some get hurt, some are okay. You have plenty of salvaged luggage, an amount of food and water, and plenty of stuff to make shelters from. Within two days you've decided to kill of the injured people to conserve water and someone's committed suicide?! Blimey! What happened to planes having transponders or flight plans, or perhaps a relative wondering why your flight never made it? They have a flare gun and a life raft so the obvious thing to do is swim to the other island a mile away. Repeatedly. It only takes them ten days to start killing each other. Heck, by day eleven they probably would have eaten the bodies :/","user":"niceone-786-892901","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Not bad but defiantly below average","rating":5,"date":"1 January 2016","review":"The acting is decent, the quality of production was decent. The characters do not have depth and the story plot is predictable. Its essentially lord of the fly's but instead its with adults. The Team is a elite soccer (football) team that fails to adapt to there situation. They fail as a team and each other, both in a psychological sense and a physiological sense. There unable to support each other and build on each others strengths and weaknesses. But if your into shallow men who are constantly flexing there muscles and running around with jeans tighter then the yoga pants your probably wearing right now, I highly recommend this movie to you.","user":"joshuaallred","rank":[12,14]}]
