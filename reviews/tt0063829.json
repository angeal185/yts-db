[{"title":"UNplanned Parenthood!","rating":9,"date":"23 August 2005","review":"\"Yours Mine And Ours\" is one of the best \"family films\" of the 1960s. (Very) loosely based on the real-life story of Helen North, a Navy widow with eight children, who married Navy career man Frank Beardsley, a widower with ten children of his own. Lucille Ball bought the rights to Mrs. Beardsley's book \"Who Gets The Drumstick?\", co- produced it, and took the starring role of Helen North. For those who know her chiefly as a comedienne, this film will be a pleasant surprise. For not only does she have the opportunity to indulge in some of the slapstick she is famous for, she proves conclusively that she was an excellent dramatic actress as well. Moreover, she can switch abruptly (and seemingly effortlessly) from comedy to pathos, sometimes in the same scene! Henry Fonda takes the part of Frank Beardsley and gives it both dimension and strength. As his bachelor friend, Van Johnson is a welcome presence, as is Tom Bosley as a sardonic doctor. There is also a hilarious performance from Louise Troy, as Frank's date early in the story. The kids are well cast and include future notables Tim Matheson, Suzanne Cupito (who grew up to be Morgan Brittany), Mitch Vogel and Tracy Nelson. A good deal of the plot involves the mutual dislike most of the kids have for their step-siblings, but a great deal of charm is present as well. Aiding the production is a nice score by Fred Karlin, a lovely song \"It's A Sometimes World\", and handsome San Francisco location photography. A remake has just been completed and will be released around the holiday season, but it's not likely to top this one. Incidentally, if you read the original book by Helen Beardsley, you will most likely come away with a far different picture of the Beardsley family, one which may not have transferred as well to the screen. This may also explain why there is no mention of the book as the story source in the movie's opening credits.","user":"phillindholm","rank":[46,52]},{"title":"Best Family Movie of the 60's","rating":9,"date":"10 October 1999","review":"I have to admit that I had trouble with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in the leads largely because they both were really too old to play their respective characters (Ball was about 57 at the time and Fonda about 63).  In the end the film is so well done that I forgot about that.  Aside from the film \"Please Don't Eat the Daisies\", this is probably the best family movie of the 60's. The best thing about the film is the realistic way in which the family blends together.  The usual problems are all there and the way in which Fonda and Ball deal with it is about what one would expect, a certain amount of good intentions, a bit of mistake making, sacrifice, and providing a good deal of love and support. The writing may not be politically correct in this day and age (the scene where Fonda's kids get Ball drunk, Ball spanks one of the boys, and there is also a certain amount of gender stereotyping), but it is this that gives the film its appeal and relatability. As Leonard Maltin points out, look for a some well known faces in the supporting cast.  Tom Bosley as the doctor, Tim Matheson as Mike, a four or five year old Tracey Nelson, Morgan Brittany of Dallas fame, 70's TV staple Ben Murphy as the oldest daughter's boyfriend, and well known child actor Eric Shea who gives an endearing performance as young Philip, the kid that seems the most lost in the big family. All in all Dad Fonda sums the whole thing up when he describes for the oldest daughter (who's being pressured by the boyfriend to have sex) what love is really about and how this family is staying together, \"It isn't going to bed with a man that proves that you love him it's getting up in the morning and facing the drab, miserable, wonderful everyday world that counts. I suppose having 19 kids is carrying it a bit too far, but if we had it to do all over again who would we skip, you?\"  And that is exactly what Helen and Frank are doing together, and the kids admire and respect them all the more for it.","user":"suessis","rank":[50,57]},{"title":"Love This Movie!!","rating":14,"date":"14 September 2003","review":"I have always just loved this movie!  I saw it as a teenager in the 60's, getting ready to go off to college and thought it was great fun at that time.  Since I was a teenager, I remember really enjoying the character of Mike, played by Tim Matheson.  I always thought he would go on to be a real big movie star instead of TV movies, since he had lots of charisma and maturity at that young age.  However, he has done very well in the roles on television he has played and is always a real treat to watch.  I don't think I thought Lucille Ball was too old the first time I saw it, because anyone over 25 seemed old to me at the time!  I recently caught this movie on TV and enjoyed it again from an adult perspective. It was a little corny but still a good film.  Life in the sixties even with Vietnam and all was a much more innocent time especially with what kids face today.  I would give it a 100 just because it is so uplifting.","user":"artistathome","rank":[20,22]}]
