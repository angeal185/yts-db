[{"title":"So bad it's ALMOST funny but not quite","rating":1,"date":"1 August 2018","review":"This movie is unbelievably bad in an almost comical way. It looks like it was shot on a budget of $169, with a script written by a child and actors who should be banned from ever appearing in a movie again. Aliens come to take something back, and I still have no idea what it was. For some reason, Washington DC is now located in the desert and the President of the United States in a way too small suit (and no underwear, if you watch this it's very obvious) runs around a lot with other bad actors whose make-up jobs keep changing from scene to scene, uttering the stupidest dialogue ever committed to film. The Aliens, who move slower then turtles and have really bad aim, are about as scary as being chased by your own shadow. Every action in this movie is preposterous. It's actually worth watching just to laugh at how bad it is, the plot, the insanity of it, the idea that someone thought to make this. 1 star is generous, but if you watch it as a comedy it's probably a 5.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"Don't do it","rating":1,"date":"23 July 2018","review":"Under no circumstances watch this movie it is 2 hours of your life you will never get back it's possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life if I could have given it a minus ratings I would have the acting is terrible the story line is even worse there is not one redeeming thing I can say about this film.
