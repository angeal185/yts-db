[{"title":"Emotionally powerful film about childhood","rating":10,"date":"14 February 2003","review":"This is an emotionally powerful (and sad) film about a boy coming to terms with the fact that his mother, who he loves dearly, is dying. It is also about being a child in a world where everyone older than you treats you with great condescension. Adults make decisions affecting his life without so much as asking for his opinion. No one talks about death, but it is in the back of his mind at all times. Everyone tries to hide what is really going on, as if \"what you don't know won't hurt you\", but the boy is hurting badly.<br><br>There are no car chases, shoot-outs, or space aliens in this film. This film is about real life, about growing up, and about children's sexuality. It is told wonderfully well, from a child's perspective.<br><br>A magnificent film.","user":"JazBrown","rank":[81,90]},{"title":"A really great coming of age film","rating":9,"date":"18 November 2004","review":"In 1950s Sweden a 12 year old boy Ingemar (Anton Glanzelius) is sent to live with relatives. His father is away and his mother is slowly dying of some unnamed disease (I think it's tuberculosis) and can't handle him (he's VERY mischievous and always getting in trouble). With his relatives he grows up and learns how to deal with life, love, feelings of abandonment, sex etc etc.<br><br>Sounds pretty obvious but it isn't. This film is beautifully directed by Lasse Hallstrom and perfectly captures what it's like to be a young boy growing up. That it takes place in 1950s Sweden makes no difference--all young boys go through the feelings and emotions shown in this movie. Some posters have complained about a (brief) instance of a topless young girl. Well--like it or not, kids that age DO think about sex and do \"explore\" their feelings with other kids. I actually think it's great that this film didn't shy away from that subject. Glanzelius is just great in the role and has a VERY expressive face (some of the looks he gives are fascinating and hilarious too). An excellent film. <br><br>This was a surprise hit in the US in 1985. It was so big Glanzelius actually toured the country with his parents to promote the movie. I remember seeing it in 1985 and loving it--it still holds up. A must-see.","user":"preppy-3","rank":[68,75]},{"title":"Straight to the heart","rating":10,"date":"8 March 2005","review":"I finally got to watch this film from beginning to end last night, after having caught glimpses of it on television. What is there in this film not to love? Beautiful Swedish landscapes in summer and winter. Attractive blond haired children or women. Hilarious eccentrics who spend their entire lives hammering nails into their roof shingles. Children on the cusp of puberty who engage in a completely unrepressed journey of sexual discovery without tilting the film into x-rating.<br><br>This is a true story based on the life of a real child whose mother was a famous Swedish writer, who had a terrible temper and also died of a disease of the lungs. As a special, there is a delightful interview with the director which is insightful on several levels. He talks about what it was like working with the child actors and how natural they were about their work. He talked about how he only realized how unconsciously hooked into the film he had become after seeing it several years after completion. The reason given was that he too was the child of a famous writer/mom who needed her space and privacy. He too had children and then was divorced. So, on many levels he found the film a cathartic experience AFTER he had watched it in a theater and watched how other people responded.<br><br>What is clear about this film is that it is charming without being cheap or smarmy. The unpretentious manner in which a touching and sad story is told is such a joyful antidote to the average Hollywood film. Unlike most American films which say too much, are too loud and spoon feed all thinking into the audience with the assumption that we are dumb, insensitive and unable to connect the dots, this drama delights with it's simplicity, allowing the drama to come to us in an unhurried telling. This film won several awards and most deserving it was. At the end we both cry and smile at the outcome. What is strengthening to know, is that the real life boy whose story this is, thrived. A really great film indeed.","user":"fred-houpt","rank":[55,62]}]
