[{"title":"One of the Darkest and Most Brilliant Films Ever","rating":10,"date":"1 February 2005","review":"I know why people hate this film. They are wrong, but I know why they hate it. They take it too seriously. They are too easily offended. They fail to pick up on the subtle little reminders that Peter Berg includes every once in awhile to let you know, \"hey, this is a comedy.\" The story revolves around a main character, who is soon to be wed to a dominating fianc√©, who seems to love the idea of having a big wedding more than she loves her her future husband. Well, our main character and his four closest buddies are off to Vegas for one last night of freedom and fun. In the group you have a pair of Jewish brothers that hate each other, a confused mechanic, and a real estate agent that is a cross between Anthony Robbins and Charles Manson. Well, not to give anything away, but let's just say that some very bad things happen in Vegas, very bad things, and how it will play out after that, well, it is just too entertaining to watch. The acting in this movie is superb, I mean great. The story is fantastic, with tons of hooks and switches. Yes, there is violence and somethings happen, that if they occurred in real life, well, you might be disturbed. HOWEVER, this is a movie! And it is one of my favorite films of all-time. I give it a 10, without hesitation.","user":"Mr_Vai","rank":[123,162]},{"title":"Very Black Comedy - wonderful","rating":9,"date":"30 October 2004","review":"One thing that's great about actors turned directors, like Peter Berg, is that they can be great at eliciting performances from the cast.<br><br>Acting is everything in this movie - as the plot spirals out of control, the acting has to maintain the necessary suspension of disbelief. Here it does.<br><br>Daniel Stern gives an eyeball-popping tour de force among a cast with some excellent character actors.<br><br>A gory and grotesque comedy nightmare masterpiece!","user":"peterdavis","rank":[72,96]},{"title":"As stated previously \"One of the best dark comedies ever\"!","rating":8,"date":"8 March 2003","review":"I have seen this movie three times and each time I am amazed, humored, frightened and relieved with the poetic justice at the end.  And it's about time that I watch it again.  The only problem I have with this movie is the title.  Every time I try and remember the name I can't think of it. Maybe it should have been called Bachelor Party or Stag Party.  I guarantee once you've seen it, you'll never forget it.  Especially when your sons are planning marriage.  The plot is great...fun time in Vegas. Girls, gambling, maybe sex.  Then the plot thickens and from the bathroom scene on, you will not be able to leave the movie.  Have your pacemaker checked, your box of tissue nearby, to wipe away tears of laughter, and enjoy.  If there were higher than a \"10\" rating for a movie, Very Bad Things would achieve it hands down.  It's not for children though, so view it after the little ones are in bed.  Teenagers are fine, they know more about life then we want to believe.  This movie has the comedy, the macabre and a justified ending. Rent it, buy it, watch it!","user":"DCCALPENA","rank":[29,36]}]
