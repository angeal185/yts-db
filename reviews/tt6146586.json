[{"title":"the fighting scenes get dull after a while","rating":6,"date":"27 May 2019","review":"This franchise has obviously become a parody. It seems that a very high number of the World's population serve the High Table. They're everywhere, behind every corner, but they cannot kill one single man, even if they stab, shoot, throw him from the hotel roof or hit him with a car at full speed. And the Head of this \"powerful organization\" lives among camels in an African desert ... There are some entertaining moments, however the numerous fighting scenes become dull after a while.","user":"dannton","rank":[945,1]},{"title":"Too much action, lacking storyline","rating":6,"date":"19 May 2019","review":"I liked the first two movies, both had a meaning behind all the action that takes place, this movie the plot is weak and the fight scenes way too long for the weak plot. Keanu still portrays his character as the Boogeyman really well, I enjoyed it but just felt it dragged on a bit much and the fight scene especially with Halle could have been cut down.","user":"imamdin_rabia","rank":[856,1]},{"title":"Brainless","rating":2,"date":"7 July 2019","review":"Hollow plot interspersed with the most boring fighting scenes ever. Dozens and dozens of inept villains, who are there just to be shoot. Gone are the fresh sequences of the first movie.\nSuper-uninteresting main villain. Very poor climax. Twists, just for the sake of twists. It seems like there's nobody out there capable of writing a movie anymore.","user":"mgd_m","rank":[721,1]}]
