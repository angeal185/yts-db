[{"title":"World's best Karlsson!","rating":8,"date":"22 September 2006","review":"I saw Karlsson first when I was about 5 or 6 years old and it became my favorite movie as a child. Every time they show Karlsson in Holland on TV, I watched it every time, even when I was in my 20's. When they showed the movie in the early days it was the original Swedish version with Dutch subtitles but later they did it with a Dutch language so kids could understand the story. I didn't like the Dutch version so I bought the original movie in Swedish and still love it very much. The whole story is just fabulous. A little boy, Lillebror, is the youngest member in the family and sometimes he is bored. Suddenly he meets Karlsson from the roof, a little, fat, baldy kid/man with a propeller on his back. He can fly. Lillebror tells his family about Karlsson but they don't believe him. What I most like about this movie is Karlsson himself, he is so funny and opinionated. He is really hilarious compared to the sweet little Lillebror. Karlsson and Lillebror have all kinds of adventures when Lillebror flies on Karlsson's back. When you like Pippi Longstocking, you definitely like Karlsson.","user":"linda-summerof69","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Swedish preciousness","rating":9,"date":"17 November 2011","review":"I like this movie, it's childlike but utterly charming. Astrid Lidgren surely knew how to captivate children with her books. As so many of these books were adapted into movies, then swedes have a rich and complete history on movies especially for children. That's not to say that they aren't appropriate for older audiences - they are, depending on the public.<br><br>This is a light comedy type of movie, pure, magic, with nothing to insult anyone and no bad stuff, just innocent and captivating.<br><br>When children, most of us certainly had our imaginary friends. Well, cute little \"Lillebror\" has just found the kind of friend that could only exist in children's fantasies, except that he isn't fruit of a child's imagination, he is real! That new friend is Karlsson, an eccentric and peculiar boy with a propeller on the back which gives him the power to fly. Now \"Lillebror\" has found the friend many children aspire to. More than that, \"Lillebror\" can also fly by sitting on Karlsson's back and see unique vistas of Stockholm.<br><br>The scenario is very nice and complete, in good old Scandinavian tradition....<br><br>Mats Wikström is perfectly convincing as Karlsson. Our beloved \"Skorpan\" (or \"Lillebror\", in this case), Lars Söderdahl, couldn't be better, he always proved to be a fine Swedish child-actor.<br><br>This should definitely be on Top 250.","user":"Atreyu_II","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Childish but cute","rating":10,"date":"14 November 2011","review":"This Swedish motion-picture is one of endless movie adaptations of a novel by the great Astrid Lindgren. This film is more aimed at children but any adolescent or adult with a youthful spirit can perfectly enjoy it.<br><br>The story is both cute and funny. Svante Svantesson (called \"Lillebror\" - \"Little Brother\" in Swedish - by everyone) is a normal child who makes the most unusual friend in unexpected circumstances. That's Karlsson (a boy with a propeller on his back), met through the window during one of his flights. Soon they spend time and have fun together: in \"Lillebror's\" bedroom, in town (where they even go to an amusement park), flying through the roofs of Stockholm (Karlsson carries \"Lillebror\" on his back) and they even help the others and prevent thieves from stealing. <br><br>Karlsson is nicely portrayed by Mats Wikström. Karlsson is amusing, eccentric and a prankster. Whenever he pranks someone is hilarious, especially the two thieves who are so stupid that you have to feel sorry for them. <br><br>The charismatic Swedish child actor Lars Söderdahl (\"Skorpan\") is great as \"Lillebror\". \"Lillebror\" is cute, sweet, innocent and at the same time very serious - qualities which that kid actor knew very well how to portray.<br><br>It's not a perfect movie but has a discreet charm, it's original, cute, innocent, harmless and typically Swedish.<br><br>Haven't got any idea about the title of this in Portugal.","user":"bts1984","rank":[2,2]}]
