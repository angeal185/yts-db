[{"title":"Spirited, if minor...","rating":6,"date":"25 May 2001","review":"Animators on assignment from Walt Disney tour South America (along with Donald Duck!) to soak up new cartoon ideas. This long-unseen Disney item is full of color and music, but is obviously a holding-pattern release for the company. I watched the film on video, coupled with the quite-entertaining additional 20-minute documentary which regales even more of the non-animated adventures. Never too popular with the kids, probably because a major cartoon segment involving Pedro the Airplane isn't very funny and lacks the local flavor. Otherwise, some visually dazzling bits but not as good as the similar \"The Three Caballeros\", released in the US in 1945. **1/2 from ****","user":"moonspinner55","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Great feature about South America! I love Saludos Amigos!","rating":10,"date":"18 February 2007","review":"This feature was made to improve relations with South America. It features a few animated shorts with live action breaking the scenes up. The live action is designed to teach about South American culture.<br><br>I am someone who really likes this feature (even though it is short). I love the scene with Jose Caricoa (sp?) where Donald can't pronounce his name. \"Joe-say...\". I would watch this at my old job at a video store every chance I got! I would recommend it to everyone, but since some people are not impressed with this feature I would suggest renting it first.<br><br>Overall very good!!!","user":"kristinaa","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Historical Disney - not much else unless you're a devotee","rating":10,"date":"10 December 2007","review":"This more than any other film shows the plight of the Disney studio in the years following \"Snow White\" and \"Pinocchio\".<br><br>WWII had broken out, cutting off Disney's European market. In addition, striking cartoonists and their formation of a guild/union meant that the massive about of labor needed to create a \"Snow White\" or a \"Pinocchio\" now amounted to a substantially higher production cost then either of those two films (which had not been cheap to begin with).<br><br>Thus, Disney was trying to explore new ways to both package his product for another market, as well as develop new product.<br><br>They released this movie and capitalized on the then-popular South American craze. Now, however, it looks dated.<br><br>You can still it watch it though and see the genesis for several of Disney's later films: \"The Three Caballeros\" and the whole \"How-To\" Goofy series are the most obvious.","user":"nycruise-1","rank":[8,9]}]
