[{"title":"Thoroughly enjoyed it!!!","rating":9,"date":"30 August 2019","review":"I thought the film was great. For a microbudget production, I thought the direction was great, scenes and locations were quite expansive and varied, and the story was well written. There was also well developed and likeable characters, great acting all round and a good sense of humour, suspense and horror motifs. It is certainly worth a watch for any fans of proper indie horror!","user":"pezzberry","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"Well at least the people involved in the movie like it","rating":1,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"After seeing the first three 9-10 star reviews were written by people who only have one review it is obvious they created accounts so they could pretend someone liked their movie.","user":"casydav","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"Cleaver returns.... with daughter!","rating":9,"date":"11 August 2019","review":"A UK Independent No Budget feature Film that promises a lot and delivers on many levels.<br><br>The film is very much set in the US but filmed in the UK on a \"zero budget\" basis. But the quality of the film far exceeds that 'no money' situation. More incredible is that this film is one of a series in the Mycho Universe. The limitations of filming in the UK and yet setting the story in the US are cleverly worked out in advance so that it is very believable what is seen on the screen. There are some inventive solutions to difficulties in attempting some of the horror moment and the story itself is captivating enough that you don't need to have seen the prequel - just accept that there is a clown called Cleaver and he happens to kill people...<br><br>One of the trademarks of the Mycho-verse is the quality of colourful lighting on scenes and thats true in Cleavers as well. A good, fun, watchable film that is enjoyable and clever.<br><br>Oh, and a few characteristic verbal jokes along the way.","user":"imdb-13887","rank":[6,12]}]
