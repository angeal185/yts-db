[{"title":"Pretty good...","rating":14,"date":"14 February 1999","review":"This film was good.  That's really what I can say about it.  Some of the parts (look for one part with a man being ground up, for instance) were a little over the top gory... but who doesn't like a little gross out, now and then?  The acting wasn't anything to be raved upon but was good enough to be overlooked.  Overall, this movie was really great to me (though, many others would disagree) so I'm giving it a 9 out of 10.  WARNING : The beginning is NOT for the squeamish!","user":"horrormb","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Don Barrett IS Acting Royalty!","rating":26,"date":"26 August 2001","review":"Don Barrett is certainly one of the funniest actors in history.  Just about every word that comes out of this man's mouth is a perverse joke.  As for the plot, it was a typical slasher that had pretty good acting, great music, and a sadistic killer in Buddy. The opening credits scene was absolutely beautiful.  It'll probably reassure all the vegans out there that they're doing the right thing, though it didn't bother me one bit.  ***1/2out of****This film has to be one of my personal favorites and is worth a couple of looks.  It certainly deserved the DVD treatment that it got.","user":"horror7777","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Porno for the Deliverance Hillbillys","rating":4,"date":"22 March 2005","review":"I can only imagine what those freaky hillbillys from Deliverance would think of Buddy, the 300+ pound mentally handicapped killer who grunts like a pig rather than speaking normally. He'd surely be an upgrade from poor Ned Beatty! The plot centers around old man Lester Bacon who gets his property, slaughterhouse and all, seized so a larger slaughtering factory can move in. Lester isn't going to take this lying down, so he lures the foreclosing son's of guns to his slaughterhouse so son Buddy can slaughter them.<br><br>Joe Barton, as the deranged swine-friendly killer, is the chief reason to watch this film. The soundtrack redefines abysmal, and the rest of the cast is standard.<br><br>\"Squeal like a piggie!!!\"","user":"BloodTheTelepathicDog","rank":[9,12]}]
