Unfortunately my nightmare was manifested, this movie offered nothing new, creativity was as dead as a dodo. To put it simply, it's a shoddy reboot of the original Barbershop.<br><br>The movie plays out in the following sequence; Barbershop is successful with the regulars, insert some crude comedy in relation to some sordid situations, neighbourhood issues awakens people up, Barbershop wants to close due to these circumstances, Barbershop re-opens with a glittering end.","user":"mr_iceman","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"The best of the series with one of the best messages of any movie in the last few years. I recommend this for that","rating":7,"date":"25 July 2016","review":"\"Barbershop used to be a place of peace.\" Chicago is in a bad way. The violence has begun to take over and it finally hits the area around Calvin's (Cube) barbershop. When Calvin's son becomes involved in gang violence he has to once again wonders if the best course of action for his family is to close the shop. This series has been very strange. The first one was funny but didn't think it needed a sequel. The second one was really bad and I didn't like it at all. This one though I thought was the best of all 3. That being said that all pretty much have the same plot. This one has nothing all that original and the movie is fairly predictable but the reason to watch isn't for the plot. This movie has a great and very timely message. It was a little strange to see the guy responsible for F the Police to have such a strong anti-violence movieÂ…but that actually adds a little to the impact of it. Overall, the best of the series with one of the best messages of any movie in the last few years. I actually recommend this for that, and the laughs. I give this a B.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[7,8]}]
