[{"title":"A film not worthy of all these bad reviews..read on and I'll explain.","rating":4,"date":"4 July 2004","review":"So its fluffy and predictable. It's unrealistic and sickly sweet. Who cares...this film pretends to be nothing more than what it is intended to be. Light romantic comedy.<br><br>Since stars like Cary Grant, Kathrine Hepburn and Irene Dunne, lit up our cinema screens in the 1930's with films like The Awful Truth, Bringing up Baby and My Favorite Wife, Hollywood and of course the movie going public have reserved a special place in their hearts for RomComs, screwballs and battle of the sexes comedies.<br><br>Identical plots, Identical jokes but none the less jokes and plots that will never go out of style and will always be relevant in any age or location, whether it be New York of the 30's or New York in the present day.<br><br>Hollywood has always worked on the basis that they stick to what has been tried and tested and has proved to work, that is why with a small plot change and a rehash of old jokes and situations they are able to reinvent their movies for a new generation of film buffs. It was through this formula that Doris Day and friends were able to continue RomCom history throughout the 60's and every one of them box office winners.<br><br>A recent example of this would be Down With Love starring Ewan McGregor and Rene Zelwegger. Who could not see plot comparisons to Pillow Talk or Lover Come Back? Yet it did not make this film any less enjoyable. Our entertainment lies in seeing our actors of the day fill the roles of the great actors of yesterday and how the scripts and jokes are adapted and told within a backdrop of 21st century life etc.<br><br>Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson made this film with impeccable comic timing and enjoyable performances. Of course with Goldie Hawn for a mother, Hudson comes straight from comic stock so I would have been disappointed if she failed to meet the challenge but she didn't. Some of her facial expressions and mannerisms almost had me convinced I was watching an old episode of \"Laugh In\" <br><br>McConaughey also held his own and proved himself to be a gifted comic as he did in the Wedding Planner.<br><br>This plot seemed quite original and as a battle of the sexes comedy, they seldom come as good as this. Again the formula was followed and we were under no illusion on what the final outcome would be, but their journey to this ultimate destination is what we find entertaining.<br><br>This type of film has been popular for seventy plus years and their simularities are what makes them so. Instead of slamming them..watch some of the predecessors and appreciate their origins.<br><br>Be thankful they are still making these types of movies today as in an era which is threatening to be devoured by action thrillers, fantasy adventure and shoot 'em ups this seems to be the only diversity left in motion pictures.","user":"Scaramouche2004","rank":[168,200]},{"title":"Better than I expected","rating":30,"date":"30 December 2003","review":"The fact is, I had not intended to see this movie - ever.  I had not heard good things.  But my wife saw it, and liked it.  One evening she caught me in a mellow mood and I watched it with her.<br><br>To say it is contrived is an understatement.  To say it is generally predictable is to state the obvious.  It is a piece of fluff romantic comedy familiar to viewers of old movies.  But there are a lot of people who LIKE fluff, and frankly, I think we will probably watch it again some day.<br><br>The writing was occasionally witty, often funny, and sometime knee-slappingly hilarious, without degenerating into the completely silly. The chemistry between Kate and Matthew was great, and their performances were what made this movie rise above the mediocre.<br><br>Don't waste your time with this movie if you insist on depth or insight into universal truths - it ain't happenin'.  But if you want a good time with a charming flick, you could do worse.","user":"markandbeck","rank":[88,110]},{"title":"hey i actually liked this movie!","rating":10,"date":"3 June 2004","review":"OK, to be honest i didn't expect much out of this movie,being a romantic comedy and all,but in the end i actually liked it, yes it's a chick flick ,and yes some things in it wouldn't really happen in reality,and the movie being so sweet and funny,the ending could have been a little better,but hey,these kind of movies always have something that we would like to be different,all in all i actually liked it,and enjoy watching it over and over again...<br><br>Kate Hudson was really sparkling in this light spirited comedy, and i for one would like to see her more in funny comedies like this...<br><br>Denny","user":"season-4","rank":[89,125]}]
