[{"title":"A heartwarming film with some flaws","rating":8,"date":"31 July 2016","review":"This movie was touching especially to those who follow the same faith or better yet, those who are already familiar with the saint. For a 2-hour film, story line was smooth, although it was dragging at some parts. They could have added more of his past life into the movie, and not just 30 second flashbacks. In my opinion there were a lot of important things that happened in his past that could have been squeezed in. The cinematography isn't that great either; it felt chopped up most of the time and the camera angles were sometimes off. The message of the movie was clear and simple. The acting was great, although their accents were heavy so I suggest watching it with subtitles. <br><br>All-in-all it was a good film! Would recommend to everyone interested in the life of St. Iggy ðŸ˜Š","user":"wyldstyle","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"The Soldier Saint","rating":31,"date":"31 August 2016","review":"\"Ignacio de Loyola\" traces the life of St. Ignatius from childhood up to his exoneration at the Inquisition at Salamanca in 1537, and subsequent departure for a university in Paris to further his studies. In between he experiences a transformation from a soldier of the king to a soldier of Christ.<br><br>It is an intense transformation, having pledged his life to a princess then switching allegiance during his recuperation from a battle wound to a life in the service of God. His wound left him with a limp, a mark of dishonor since he could no longer soldier. It is here that the narrative acquires interest, as the earlier battle scenes had an artificial quality, as though filmed on a sound stage. It takes off as he finds his true calling and is accompanied by some excellent, well written dialogue, especially in some admirable speechifying instances. The overall quality of the script sets 'Ignacio de Loyola\" apart from most other films made nowadays and accounts for my rating.<br><br>This movie will probably get a bad rap from critics due to its religious nature, but \"Ignacio de Loyola\" is about much more than that. It is about change, a change of mind and of lifestyle, a change of values and the discovery of what was front and center all the while, what really counts in life. Ignatius Loyola is a saint, but came by it the hard way - steeped in the temporary and ignoring the spiritual. We can all relate to that.","user":"GManfred","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"The Risks of Watching 'Ignacio de Loyola'","rating":9,"date":"3 August 2016","review":"If you're expecting a documentary that explains the life of St. Ignatius in detail, complete with direct quotes, references, and biblical passages, you will be disappointed. If you're expecting a film on how to be a perfect and holy Christian, you will be disappointed. Just as the filmmakers took many risks to create this film, watching it will be a risk to you... You risk crying a little, laughing a little... You risk asking questions you might not have asked in a long time... You risk remembering painful memories -- losing a job, a heartbreak, a serious illness, a humiliating moment, the death of a loved one... You risk spending time discussing and arguing with your friends afterwards over coffee... You might even risk putting down your phone and praying again. I strongly encourage everyone to see this film. At the very least, you risk having a good day. At best, you just might figure out how to live a good life.","user":"markrobertdy","rank":[12,14]}]
