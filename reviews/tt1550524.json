[{"title":"A Tremendous film.","rating":20,"date":"20 April 2010","review":"I was invited to an advanced screening of White Irish Drinkers with no expectations of the film, and I must say I was truly impressed.<br><br>From the acting of Steven Lang, who, as always - was extraordinary, to the under-appreciated Karen Allen in one of her best roles. And finally to Nick Thurston who delivered a strong, measured performance that anchors the story.<br><br>In addition, Seamus Tierney provided some exceptional cinematography shot on location in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn - rarely seen on film since Saturday Night Fever in 1977, which coincidentally is the roughly the year when Drinkers is set.<br><br>But it is the director/writer/producer John Gray who's long career of solid work has served him well in bringing this powerful story to life.","user":"Irish365","rank":[28,36]},{"title":"Great Movie, Wonderful Acting and Writing","rating":10,"date":"7 November 2010","review":"This is an incredibly good movie, the kind they don't seem to make anymore, with a pretty simple, straightforward conflict, amazingly good acting and writing, and it evokes a time and place (Brooklyn 1977) perfectly.<br><br>At the top of a long list of very good performances are Stephen Lang as the alcoholic father, Karen Allen as the stoic but deeply-loving mother, the amazing Nick Thurston (who I had not heard of before) as the son, and Leslie Murphy as his love interest. <br><br>In smaller roles Peter Reigert and Geoffrey Wigdor are extremely good.<br><br>John Gray's script and direction are extremely moving without being overblown or showy.<br><br>This movie is very emotionally honest. It clearly was a labor of love for everybody involved.<br><br>Lots of movies seem to me to be overly clever and self-regarding, throwing curve ball after curve ball at you while they're looking in the mirror smirking. This movie is a fastball right over the plate.","user":"crcauthen","rank":[20,26]},{"title":"The story of our lives","rating":9,"date":"1 September 2010","review":"(I wanted to give 9.5 because almost nothing is a 10, but fractions are not allowed ...)<br><br>Invited by a friend of a friend, I saw a preview and was prepared to politely praise the film even if I didn't like it. But I was surprised. This film is sincere, unpretentious, extremely well written and well acted. The story captured my interest from beginning to end. High marks go to all of the actors -- Karen Allen, Peter Riegert, Nick Thurston at an existential crossroads, Geoffrey Wigdor as his older brother who is already lost to the streets, and especially Stephen Lang (the baddie from Avatar), a formidable actor who digs his fingers into your heart. I saw grown men in our audience surreptitiously wiping their eyes! <br><br>I don't know much about film-making, but I know what holds me. Whatever the makers did, they did right. Good luck!","user":"karamlinda","rank":[23,32]}]
