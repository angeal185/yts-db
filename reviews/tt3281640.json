[{"title":"Ethereal and surreal - not your typical \"ski movie\"","rating":9,"date":"30 December 2014","review":"As a longtime snowboarder, I tend to shy away from ski-oriented films (especially the corny self-absorbedness of Warren Miller's yearly offerings), however, the description for this one on Netflix piqued my interest as it seemed to offer something other than toothy grins in day- glo jumpsuits.<br><br>The film's dramatized story revolves around a community of free spirits who have set up camp (\"Valhalla\") in the snowy mountains of BC, led by a bodhisattva of sorts. Mesmerizing footage of skiing and snowboarding is interspersed with biographies of - and tales associated with - various \"tribe\" members. The common Warren Miller devotee will likely find such depth and reflection unappealing, but for those of us who enjoy something more to life than Jaegerbombs with \"bros\" and Dave Mathews Band playlists, this film is very refreshing.<br><br>The soundtrack alone (criminally unreleased, btw) is worth the price of admission as it features an eclectic, dreamy tapestry designed to further enhance the inescapable feelings of bliss obtained while viewing.<br><br>Check this one out. You don't have to be a skier, snowboarder or even an outdoors enthusiast to enjoy it - just someone who can appreciate life outside of societal conventions and constraints.","user":"LawnBoy-4","rank":[8,9]}]
