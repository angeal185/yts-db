[{"title":"Good action!!","rating":6,"date":"22 February 2020","review":"Mile 22 has a simple goal in its script, maybe too simple, get this man from point A to point B. The script itself has a great twist at the end, but for the rest of the movie it's lazy. We get to know everything about Mark Wahlberg's characters through 2 minutes of exposition, which is Michael Bay-type lazy. And for the rest of the movie he doesn't really change, nor do any of the other characters. The action is entertaining, but it is shaky and quickly cut together, and not like Paul Greengrass, more like Columbiana. I thought Hollywood was done with this trope of cutting quickly to hide the action, John Wick and Atomic Blonde showed us that. But this movie does it again. Overall, the movie is just meh, not great, not the worst, just meh. And I expected better from Peter Berg.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[38,39]},{"title":"What's with the really low reviews on this movie? hein?!","rating":8,"date":"23 August 2018","review":"Well, sure it aint oscar material here, and it won't be getting any prizes for originality, but for what the movie is supposed to be, it is surely not deserving anything less than a 6, i have seen endless 1 -3 star reviews, what's up with that?, i mean seriously? have this people even watched the same movie, or are we just lobbying right now? because you have tones of absolute garbage movies here on IMDB being rated 9 and 10's deceveing people and on the opposite end, you have ok movies being rated 1 and 2's.<br><br>The Mile 22 is as expected an action packed movie, it is fast paced, has a decent plot, it is somewhat realistic, (if u compare with the likes of other recent action movies like let us say, Skyscraper) and yet, people are just throwing 1 and 2's like if this was some sort of sharknado B movie of the action movies, Jesus people, rate movies seriously, what is wrong with u people these days???","user":"andre-filipe-santos","rank":[588,784]},{"title":"Decent action but Wahlberg's character was pretty annoying throughout","rating":5,"date":"17 August 2018","review":"I've been looking forward to this movie for a while now and I have to say I was a little let down. The action is really good but the plot and script were not so good, especially Wahlberg's character. He wouldn't stop talking in these OCD ramblings as they tried to make him look like a gifted mind that is on overdrive 24/7. He came off like an old Dennis Leary except not funny and more rambling.","user":"dseann-105-396156","rank":[253,338]}]
