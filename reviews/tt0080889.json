[{"title":"A true delight","rating":6,"date":"6 January 2004","review":"I saw this movie when it was released twenty-four years ago and I am happy to say that it has not aged at all. It is just as funny and delightful today as it was then. \"Hopscotch\" is a diamond in the rough and a real gem. Walter Matthau plays an experienced CIA agent, Miles Kendig, who is sentence to a desk job by his idiot boss, for disciplinary reasons.<br><br>If you are a Walter Matthau fan then this is a must see movie. If  you are not familiar with Matthau then `Hopscotch' will be a great introduction to one of the most talented actors in Hollywood history. Even though `Hopscotch' is based from a novel the role of Miles Kendig must have been written for Walter Matthau. He was brilliant!<br><br>I certainly don't want to over shadow the terrific supporting cast. Ned Beatty and Glanda Jackson were superb. You will also get to see a very young Sam Waterston. Pay special attention to CIA agent `Ross' played my Matthau's son David.","user":"pollhouse","rank":[46,51]},{"title":"Impressive film","rating":7,"date":"5 February 2004","review":"The most impressive thing about this movie is the way the director manages the tone of this film. The balance between comedy and drama is handled with great aplomb. This is best in encapsulated in the Myerson character. His ineptness is clearly the comic relief yet he also is trying to hunt down Kendig. I had seen other films where Matthau was in a supporting role like Mirage and Charade but here he is the star and he carries the film perfectly. The new Criterion Collection DVD has a very interesting interviews that add immensely to the appreciation of the film. 8/10.","user":"perfectbond","rank":[36,40]},{"title":"Great comedy thriller for adults","rating":1,"date":"1 October 2002","review":"I don't think a movie like this could get made today. Funny, clever and understated, it's exactly the kind of movie that does not lend itself well to Burger King merchandising or witty catch-phrases (although \"I'd say he has you well and truly by the short hairs\" comes close).<br><br>\nInstead, this is simply a funny, charming and romantic spy thriller that's all about Walter Matthau's great acting. As others have said, this is a movie I can see again and again for the great acting and hilarious moments. Thankfully, it's finally available on DVD.","user":"McGonigle","rank":[25,28]}]
