[{"title":"Not Worth a Dime","rating":1,"date":"1 November 2018","review":"There were several former well known actors I wanted to see. Unfortunately their talents were wasted on this poorly made fiasco. Direction is non existent and the script is high school level.<br><br>Guess everyone needs a paycheck","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[25,34]},{"title":"Let's all cheer for stereotypical clich√©s","rating":2,"date":"19 October 2018","review":"I gave this two stars for the acting only, which was decent. Everything else was typical stereotyping. So, the only \"good\" black man is a robot, the rest are worthless and abusive. All southerners are rednecks and racist. \"computer nerds\" just watch porn in the basement. The list goes on. 0 creativity, 0 originality. I could handle the political bent but, I know this is a movie, I found the stereotypes to be most offensive. Low grade B movie.","user":"vmalast","rank":[34,50]},{"title":"Just awful","rating":1,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"Acting is below porn-level.\nNobody should watch this","user":"diegosilberstein","rank":[13,17]}]
