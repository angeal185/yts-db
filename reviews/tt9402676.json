[{"title":"Lock your door safely !","rating":6,"date":"18 June 2019","review":"It is a psycho killer thriller. Story is simple one liner. A bank working woman get frightened by knocking door of his apartment by unknown man.. He is actually a psycho killer. And it is hard to guess who is killer. Good suspense thriller. However it does not keeping its tempo all time. Somewhere movie loses its grip and we can see repetitive incidents instead of revealing suspense. End is okay as it should be. Watchable at one for killer thriller.","user":"saptesh786","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"5.5 Stars From Me","rating":6,"date":"13 March 2019","review":"A woman lives alone in a one room apartment. She wakes each morning with an awful headache and after a weird incident of someone beating on the apartment door and trying to come in she starts to believe that something very strange is going on.<br><br>This wasn't a bad film but it moved at a slow pace and some things just didn't make a lot of sense. There was a nice build up of tension at times yet it fell flat at others. There was a lack of detail in a few key areas and I never really reached a point where I felt invested in the characters.<br><br>To be fair, the subtitles I was using were in a broken english so there may have been things that were literally lost in translation. However, I don't think it would have been enough to have pushed them film to have had a much higher score from me.<br><br>So,my takeaway is that it isn't awful but it left something to be desired.","user":"Foutainoflife","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Mind blowing tense storyline","rating":8,"date":"11 June 2019","review":"Simple storyline actually, but they execute this movie very well to present a bunch of tense scene.","user":"fernonmilicent","rank":[4,5]}]
