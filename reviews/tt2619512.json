[{"title":"A Pretty Straight Forward Story.","rating":4,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"This was a pretty straight forward story. A film producers fails miserably at attempting to blackmail a Hollywood actor with a DVD recording of him being with tranny, and that's where the story goes, stays, and ends. It's not a long drawn out journey story, but it does take you on a nice little blackmail extortion ride and brings you to the destination. A little funny, yet serious, kudos to the all the actors making this watchable. This formula that has been done a few times, but for these characters and with this story line, it was decently done. I definitely recommend ....good watch","user":"whitemanfromtowne","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"Definitely worth watching","rating":9,"date":"14 September 2018","review":"I would watch this movie again for the cinematography alone which is stunning and was one of the first things that drew me into the film. The directing is really top-notch as well. Every shot was well composed and the performances of the actors were spot on. Overall there was a strong tone to the piece and a complete artistic vision.<br><br>If there's any weak link to the movie, it's that the script could be tightened in places in terms of character development and dialogue, but overall I enjoyed watching it and found myself laughing out loud in a number of places. The characters were quirky and endearing and pulled me into their story with ease. By the time it was over, I really cared about them. The ending (which I won't give away) was done extremely well. Overall the film is likeable and fun and definitely worth watching.","user":"aglet-59348","rank":[12,23]},{"title":"Good short film worth a watch","rating":8,"date":"11 September 2018","review":"It's a little short, but worth a watch.
