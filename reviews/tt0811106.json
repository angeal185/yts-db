[{"title":"About 3 commandments worth of comedy","rating":3,"date":"26 November 2007","review":"There were some good ideas for the sketches but it seems like the writers couldn't figure out how to develop them. The result is something you might see at a high school production with a single sight-gag or punchline stretched to fit the allotted time. It's not that the gag is bad or stupid (though sometime it is) - it's just that you can't fill 10 minutes of dead time with one joke.<br><br>There are a couple of funnier commandments that got more than half a laugh. Winona Ryder is a scream - she of course is in the sketch about the do not steal commandment. (See how clever that is - this movie is full of them...) Unfortunately, the funnier sketches are at the end of the movie and you have to sit through an hour to get there.<br><br>This reminds me a lot of SNL - the current incarnation - not the \"classic\" incarnations. If you watch SNL you'll probably like this. If you find SNL an interminable bore, like I do - then avoid...","user":"lhhung_himself","rank":[61,99]},{"title":"A poorly constructed, offensive and dull set of comedies","rating":1,"date":"22 October 2007","review":"It has been so long since I've had the urge to walk out on a film... but I stayed through this one just to see the credits. I wanted to really make sure that people I had had great respect for in previous incarnations had made this piece of trash. Unfortunately they had.<br><br>Half the theater walked out while I was watching, however. More power to them.<br><br>I am an atheist, yet I found this religiously offensive. I am a liberal, yet I found this politically offensive. I am an independent film lover, but I found this cinematicly offensive. There were a few laughs, to be sure, but most of what the creators thought was funny I wish they had kept to themselves.","user":"btchakir-1","rank":[47,81]},{"title":"Camp with a budget","rating":7,"date":"17 January 2008","review":"This literally reminds me of skits put together at summer camp. The stories are so ridiculous, it's as if they were written by people who never actually expected them to make it to a big screen.<br><br>But alas here they are, in a pretty decent-looking production, no less. Nothing B-movie or low-budget about it. Well, about its looks, anyway.<br><br>Where this movie really \"shines\", though, is in the acting. Not only did this movie somehow attract a fair amount of A-list talent, but these actors really gave of it, considering the material they were handed. Extra points go to Winona Ryder, who was an especially good sport, shoving her tongue into the mouth of a wooden puppet and all.<br><br>Basically my 7 score is based on the fact that I had at least a smile on throughout most of this movie. Seeing all these big names, all perfectly willing to \"lower\" themselves to the level of this material, just really renewed my faith in humanity.","user":"equazcion","rank":[30,50]}]
