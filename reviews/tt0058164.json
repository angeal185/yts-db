[{"title":"Honest screening of a great play","rating":8,"date":"4 November 2002","review":"The Caretaker is a truly great play and lends itself only to minimal tinkering for the screen.  Thank goodness, that's what the makers of this film decided to do, so the film is barely an adaptation.  One or two short scenes are moved out of Aston's claustrophobic attic room, but for the most part we're stuck in there, just like the play.  I'm too young to have seen the original cast on stage, so it is good to see how Alan Bates and Donald Pleasence must have plied their craft on the stage.  Robert Shaw does an excellent job of Aston, a part that is often under-rated as it is best performed under-stated.  I have seen two fine productions of this play on the stage, back in the 70's I saw Max Wall play the lead and more recently the mighty Michael Gambon supported brilliantly by Rupert Graves as Mick and Douglas Hodge as Aston.  If you can get to see a great production of this play, I recommend it for the stage rather than film.  In the absence of a fine cast just down the road, this film is a super second best.","user":"ian_harris","rank":[25,27]},{"title":"hypnotic","rating":10,"date":"14 October 2005","review":"Like the other commenter I too am wondering why this isn't available on DVD. Luckily I video-taped a PBS broadcast years ago but Pinter deserves to be immortalized in a DVD collection with all the supplementary material available. (Perhaps now that he's won the Nobel) This movie was my introduction to Pinter and while I have to acknowledge the acting it was the script that hypnotized me when I happened upon it channel surfing one evening. So brilliantly absurd that you may join it as I first did from any point in the play and be instantly compelled by Pinter's bizarre reality. Bates, Shaw and Pleasance are perfectly cast but Donald Pleasance reveals a brilliance pitifully missing in his many supporting Hollywood roles. One wonders if the actors felt the magic their collaboration conveys and if so they must have been ecstatic.","user":"nicoli282000","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"first rate theatre film","rating":9,"date":"9 June 2004","review":"This hard to find movie is now availible on an import DVD (with that \"opened up\" car scene) and it's worth seeking out.  It's almost as good as the excellent<br><br>\"Homecoming\" film, and while Bates and Shaw shine, it is Donald Pleasance<br><br>who steals the show. How this great actor ended up in grade Z films at the end of his career must be a sort of tragic drama in itself.  It's wild to remember this \"kitchen sink\" classic came out of England the year the Beatles took the world by storm.  Those were the days.....","user":"rufasff","rank":[16,20]}]
