[{"title":"Does not make sense","rating":3,"date":"4 December 2019","review":"All through this movie I kept asking \"who acts like this!?\"\nIt seems like everyone has a beer in their hand all the time.\nThe bar owner immediately hires a guy who looks like he's a homeless drunk.\nThe near empty bar has a guy playing guitar in the corner.\nShe rents out her room to a guy without checking out anything about him. Even though she lives alone with her brother.\nThe boyfriend always is grabbing at her all the time in every scene. I just wanted to shout \"ok we got it!!\"\nRidiculous movie","user":"brian-ogrady","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Dreadful waste of time","rating":2,"date":"5 December 2019","review":"The acting is poor, the plot is nonsensical. Sticking pins into my eyes would have been less painful than sitting through this drivel.\nDon't waste your time.","user":"bricyn-667-289099","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"A good little indie","rating":8,"date":"12 March 2020","review":"While the story is slightly predictable, there is depth to the emotions of the acting in the film that rings true for anyone who has experienced trauma or grief. Definitely worth the watch if you like dramas","user":"fuzzydugan","rank":[0,0]}]
