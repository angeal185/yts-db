[{"title":"Cameos by Michael Madsen and Eric Roberts. You've been warned.","rating":3,"date":"14 January 2020","review":"I'm giving this movie three stars because the cinematography could have been much worse given the low-budget. This is as if someone saw Constantine and thought \"I could do that\" (only much worse), then threw in some Dragonball Evolution for good measure. Bad CGI, really bad casting (I mean, Nicholas Turturro?), and shockingly miscued music. If you want to see demons, give this one a pass and go watch Nekrotronic (or Evil Dead II).","user":"avadams","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"Wow..... So bad","rating":1,"date":"20 January 2020","review":"From terrible acting, to bad CGI, to inconsistent audio. It seems like someone was just throwing it together to get something ot there. Each scene became steadily worse. I could only stand about 20 minutes of a 86 minute movie.","user":"bwfarr_01","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"So Bad!","rating":1,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"Seriously, do not waste your time watching this film! Awful storyline, bad CGI &amp; even worse acting. Extremely disappointed as thought I would have loved this movie.","user":"amberella-29241","rank":[4,4]}]
