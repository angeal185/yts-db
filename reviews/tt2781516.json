[{"title":"A Canadian Masterpiece","rating":8,"date":"5 March 2015","review":"As a series of strange and violent events start happening, an alcoholic policeman (Leo Fafard) realizes that he has been turned into a werewolf as part of a larger plan, so he investigates with the help of his partner and his friend.<br><br>Bloody Disgusting gave WolfCop a positive review and stated, \"A perfect storm of creature action, the occult, gore, intrigue, humor, and lycanthropic puns, WolfCop is destined for cult glory.\" Darn right, Bloody Disgusting. This film is hilarious, gory, and downright clever. This is the sort of thing that deserves a sequel and then another. Heck, it already ranks better than \"Maniac Cop\".<br><br>The film is great just for the puns alone: \"the fuzz\", \"Dirty Hairier\" and many others. The folks behind this are geniuses.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"The best film of all-time...about a wolfcop.","rating":7,"date":"17 June 2014","review":"An alcoholic cop wakes up one morning feeling a little different. His senses are stronger, dogs like him and when the full moon hits, he turns into a killer werewolf. A killer werewolf with a sense of duty to uphold. He becomes the WolfCop.<br><br>A low budget Canadian horror comedy flick in the style of Hobo With A Shotgun. While Hobo was decent, I felt a little underwhelmed with it. It was a little too serious for a low budget grindhouse flick that was suppose to emulate the 70's and 80's of cheesy horror. WolfCop seems like the type of film that would fill those needs and for the most part it does. With a modest budget of a million dollars, Lowell Dean manages to make the film look and feel like it belongs with those 70's and 80's flicks you'd find at the bottom of a dollar bin at Wal-Mart. If the film was too crisp and smooth, it wouldn't fit the atmosphere. <br><br>Dean tries his best to blend horror and comedy, a lot of the jokes fall flat, but there is just enough in there to make it entertaining. The execution was never going to be able to match the concept. I wanted more of the WolfCop on duty, foiling one robbery and crashing one drug op wasn't enough for me. <br><br>The monster effects are decent and there is a bit of comical gore to be had. I couldn't help but laugh at the faceless screaming man. For those wondering if a WolfCop can have sex with a human...he sure can. In a late night Baby Blue 2 on CityTV kind of way. <br><br>The theatre wasn't packed, but the audience who was in attendance seemed to enjoy themselves. This film does not take itself seriously, which is a good thing. I hope the film manages to find a cult following and if the ending of the film holds true, we will see a sequel sometime soon. Until then, enjoy the \"it's so bad, it's good\" nature of WolfCop.","user":"Matt_Layden","rank":[48,68]},{"title":"Straightforward B-movie fare","rating":5,"date":"22 December 2015","review":"WOLFCOP is a straightforward B-flick about a cop who turns into a werewolf. There's no more to it or less to it than that. It's very much in the spirit of the MACHETE films, albeit with a lower budget, in that it goes for a whole retro/non-serious vibe and just about gets by on goodwill alone.<br><br>The low budget is often apparent during this production, so the scriptwriter goes for a jokey tone throughout to make things easier to watch. The acting isn't very good, but the quality of the special effects is a real surprise; they actually turn out to be very good indeed, with some excruciating werewolf transformations that work well. The titular fiend looks rather cheesy but then that's the point.<br><br>Otherwise, the film is chock-full of grindhouse-style violence and some jumbled plotting. It's an amiable time-waster although those looking for genuine originality or insight will be disappointed; WOLFCOP is a film that offers nothing new for fans and instead is happy to go through the usual and expected motions.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[11,13]}]
