If you're not, don't be shocked when you don't see famous actors and million dollar special effects. These movies are made on shoestring budgets by people who are passionate about making them. Jeff Kirkendall has put together a real gem here. The Directing, Editing, and Camera work are top notch for the genre, the 4 vignettes are fun throwbacks to the old horror anthology films like Creepshow and Tales from the Crypt, and there's a nice variety presented here. And it's always great to see so many familiar faces show up in these movies. Keep 'em coming!!!","user":"joerasputin","rank":[2,5]}]
