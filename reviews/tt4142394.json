[{"title":"Terrible, slow Film!","rating":3,"date":"6 July 2019","review":"I'm a Dolph Lundgren fan but this was terrible!\nOne of the worst editing jobs I've seen. It's like a bunch of randomly filmed scenes all put together, no flow of any kind of story. Very slow and the action sucked. They used stand ins for Dolph on almost any scene that was shot from the back, acting was bad and nothing made sense. Just avoid at all costs and hopefully next time we get a decent action flick from Lundgren.","user":"canike07","rank":[29,33]},{"title":"Why, Dolph?","rating":2,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"Dolph Lundgreen has the looks. He has the skills. And he has had a lot of opportunities to go big, playing parts in big productions.<br><br>Then why does he do these amateur movies? He's obviously the only trained actor - the rest are extras with no acting skills. The filmography is just as ridiculous as the score, and it's evident that no real writer was attached.<br><br>This is not even at par with film school projects, and Dolph is not getting younger.<br><br>I would love to see him play the lead in an adaption of just about any Robert Ludlum film adaptation.","user":"Plazeebo","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"Why even make this movie","rating":1,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"This is a very useless movie that they should never have wasted time and money on making. It has parts of a story, but not all, maybe there is 30% of the story here. And seriously no background on anyone. Suddenly there is some drugs and then there is a kidnapping... Looks like Dolph Lundgren took a vacation to italy and managed to include a little acting...","user":"zathan-32848","rank":[33,41]}]
