[{"title":"I swear it was great, and I have no connection to this production.","rating":9,"date":"5 September 2003","review":"It was a hot day and I decided to hit a movie. \"Dickie Roberts\" just happened to start at the right time for me. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. Great script, perfectly cast (especially the kids) and it was really kinda heartwarming.<br><br>If you're a pop culture nut, you'll get a big kick outta seeing all the former child stars in the poker scene and then again at the end (stay for the credits).<br><br>Spade completely pulls it off. Lovitz is his usual outstanding (but then again I'm a big Lovitz fan).<br><br>Go see it. C'mon, go ahead.","user":"joebua","rank":[37,46]},{"title":"Old man tells it like it is.","rating":10,"date":"7 November 2003","review":"I was actually surprised at how well my family and I liked this movie. It was a really nice movie, It started out like the other Spade movies where the character he plays kind of annoys you but in the end you really like him and want everything to work out for him. So I will be adding it to my DVD collection when it comes out. I hope there will be some more former child star extras on the DVD.","user":"wdforty","rank":[19,24]},{"title":"I loved this movie!","rating":10,"date":"6 September 2003","review":"I saw this movie last night and really enjoyed it! I laughed out loud many times and the story was really sweet. David Spade is hilarious in this movie and really made it work. Go see it! Oh, and the final song with former child stars will leave you laughing long after you leave the theater!","user":"nccgirl","rank":[20,27]}]
