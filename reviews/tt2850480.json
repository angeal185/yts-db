Fortunately, it was just weird enough to hold my attention until I was interested. It's a good film with a good story, but it is a bit on the sad side. See it with your significant other.","user":"thegarlicconnection","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Fantastic!","rating":10,"date":"26 February 2018","review":"This is a phenomenal picture. I haven't enjoyed a film this much in a long time, and I have no friends, so I watch a lot of movies. <br><br>It's a refreshing, uniquely written, feel good story that I'm not going to explain. Just watch it. The entire experience felt effortless and real and easily absorbed.<br><br>The acting was outstanding, especially Dash Mihok as Victor and Suki Waterhouse, as \"The Girl\", who also did a commendable job. Their relationship was both entirely believable and adorable. <br><br>Let's not forget about the score. It was literally perfect. Rich in atmosphere, charming, and perfectly suited for each scene. I found myself \"Shazamming several songs throughout the movie.<br><br>It's a real shame a movie of this quality goes under the radar because there isn't an \"A-list\" actor involved. In fact, too many movies are overshadowed by A-list actors and the the roles they are famous for.<br><br>For example, had Victor been played by Anthony Hopkins instead of Dash Mihok, I'm pretty sure I would have been wondering when Hannibal Lector was going to bite the girl's face off, rather than fall innocently in love with her, if you catch my drift. <br><br>With that being said, had Emma Stone or Ellen Paige or Ryan Gosling been casted, this gets nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe, no question. I guess that's just part of the politics of show business. Lame indeed.<br><br>Regardless, this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've had the pleasure of watching, in a long time. It's that good and shouldn't be missed.<br><br>Highly, highly recommended.","user":"robharrand","rank":[6,9]}]
