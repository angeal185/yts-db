[{"title":"Not meant to be a traditional comedy.","rating":9,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"Ignore where Hulu or whatever threw this in the genre category. The people giving it a low rating just because they didn't find it funny are missing the point of the film. I mean, come on, some are writing in here that they didn't even watch the whole thing and you need to to get the point. Yes it has its funny moments but its not that kinda movie. It's to show us that, yeah, us guys get a bit competitive around eachother and our testosterone plays into it and women enjoy gossip because it helps them feel more in tuned to the society they are in. But we shouldn't jump the gun based on assumptions we may have with the opposite sex at times and at other times it's those differences that make eachother stronger. Whitney Cummings is brilliant. Anyone who's actually listened to her speak publicaly like when she's on Rogans podcast knows she knows her stuff so to say she's just making up what she is saying needs to pick up a book. Please watch this with an open mind and pay attention to the details it's trying to show.","user":"coolbirish","rank":[22,27]},{"title":"What did we learn?","rating":3,"date":"18 February 2018","review":"We learn from this Misandry-loaded film, that scientific results are legitimate only then they are politically correct. And when I see a volunteer to one of her tests say \"good morning\", only to switch to a gratuitous image of a tied pig, I get the sorry state of mind of the makers of this hate film.","user":"almonious-87486","rank":[63,99]},{"title":"Undecided between comedy and documentary","rating":2,"date":"18 February 2018","review":"So, I am finishing watching the movie right now and noticed that it is listed as comedy but all it tries to do is justifying women's behaviors by using NOT SCIENTIFIC data. There is a female narrator all the time and she keeps pointing out that \"we used to think ABC about women's brains but since I read a study on a blog, now we, the entire human kind, think differently\". Which is obviously not comedy, but a feminist rant that has no correlation to reality and scientific data, since scientific axioms depend on data being collected through several years, by several different studies, most of the time thousands of them (Example: Einstein's relativity took more than a 100 years to get fully checked and we are still trying to figure and validate some of its aspects), and when they CONVERGE, the scientific community declares it is true to science. Which is NOT the case for any of the affirmations on \"women's brains\" made on the movie, like the one that says \"now 'we know' that women and men have the same amount of brain cells\" (obviously a lie because as I said one study alone means nothing to science, as well as only a dozen of them and cerebellum is different from brain, they are two different organs). One could argue \"but it's a comedy\". Well, as I said, it doesn't look like comedy because in comedy you don't try that hard to justify your opinions. Which makes the movie look so lame that you can't actually laugh at all. Also, the main female character looks superficial (futile sub-intelectual type). The male characters look artificially dumb and misogynistic on purpose but not in a funny way.","user":"jackdan-05273","rank":[46,72]}]
