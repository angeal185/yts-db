[{"title":"It was okay and all but the characters were a little bland","rating":7,"date":"7 December 2018","review":"Okay i like Kikoriki the voices were good but characters like that mole guy with hat and glasses was flat if you ask me same goes to the Mexican dogs they had a few funny moments for but they were bland i liked Krash's Ancestor was the best character in this film as for the Kikoriki villagers in beginning they acted off character to Krash they said he caused so many disasters i liked how flashbacks were in flash animation they seemed to fit with they were saying but at the end of film they acted like their normal selves as for Krash he was just a little off but was still funny and wacky as he was in the original series i honestly think Peter Linz was the best voice actor for him.","user":"jonesfrankjr","rank":[2,3]}]
