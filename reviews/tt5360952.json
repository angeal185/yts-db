[{"title":"Hard Rain Remake","rating":5,"date":"28 October 2018","review":"Spoilers<br><br>This is an okay movie. It just really seemed like a remake of Hard Rain but without Morgan Freeman, Randy Quaid, Christian Slater or Minnie Driver. All the same characters but with different actors. Corrupt driver who's the inside man. Corrupt police force. One man and woman stands in the way. The only difference is we added a brother.<br><br>My one question, did they leave the military guys locked in the cage to drown?","user":"sherbearhi","rank":[24,25]},{"title":"Very good B-movie","rating":6,"date":"28 March 2019","review":"Like I always say, I write only because of one of the three reasons:<br><br>1) if the movie is extremely good\n2) if people are unnecessarily bashing a good movie\n3) if it has a low rating.<br><br>I decided to write this review because of 1st reason.<br><br>I expected a Low-Budget action movie (B-movie in short), in the likes of Dolph Lundgren, Steven Seagal and Van Damme but it was surprisingly better one. I can not call it a B-movie, it is somehow in-between a B-movie and the big-budget action movies of Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It does not have story development or planning of those big action movies but it is original, funny and has a really good Hurricane (best part of the movie). Go, forget the world, grab something to eat, sit and enjoy. you will not watch it 2nd time but for one time watch, hell yeah :)","user":"arnuld-mizong","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Fake southern","rating":3,"date":"12 June 2018","review":"These are the fakest southern accents I've heard in a long time. And cheesy acting. Also hurricane is blowing away cars and stuff but not people","user":"mangruma","rank":[38,49]}]
