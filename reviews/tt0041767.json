[{"title":"Fox's Prince","rating":6,"date":"29 July 2009","review":"Produced by Sol C. Siegal for 20th Century Fox in 1949 PRINCE OF FOXES is a splendid romantic adventure story set in Renaissance Italy. Stylishly directed by Henry King on actual Italian locations it has one unforgivable drawback - its Monochrome cinematography! So for once I cannot say - for the life of me - in glorious black &amp; white! For if ever a movie needed to be filmed in colour PRINCE OF FOXES is the prime example! One story has it that there was not adequate funds to film in colour. But the preferred excuse was when the company arrived in Italy in 1948 to begin shooting they found that there was not a colour camera to be had in the entire country. And being behind schedule already the unfortunate decision was made to film in Monochrome. But Fox Video should have made an effort in making some kind of amends for this by colorizing the movie for this DVD release, thereby preserving - to some degree - the scenes in the magnificent ornate palaces and churches of the Renaissance whose interiors were used in the picture. After all they had done an excellent job with colour on the DVD re-release of the classic \"The Mark Of Zorro\" (1940) a couple of years back, surely PRINCE OF FOXES was a more deserving cause! Ironically the only Acadamy Award nomination the picture garnered was for Leon Shamroy's Monochrome cinematography!<br><br>As it stands however it is still a fine movie with a cracking screenplay by Milton Krims based on the novel by Samuel Shellabarger. Tyrone Power is excellent in it and brings great depth to an already well written part. Also there's a striking performance by Orson Welles in the plum role of Cesare Borgia. The story involves a young adventurer, Andrea Orsini (Power), who is appointed as a sort of ambassador by Borgia to some kingdoms he hopes one day to acquire. When he goes to a mountain state ruled by the kindly and elderly Count Verano (Felix Alymer) and his attractive much younger wife Modonna Camilla (Wanda Hendricks) he becomes aware of a better way of life. He turns against the Borgias, is imprisoned and tortured (in a startling sequence his eyes appear to be gouged from his head). Later he is freed and leads a revolt routing the Borgias. Finally the old count dies from his battle wounds leaving Andrea and the young widow free to marry.<br><br>Despite the shameful absence of colour Shamroy's Monochrome cinematography does however lend King's well told story a certain visual style. Also an outstanding addition to the overall picture is Alfred Newman's ravishing baroque score. After the exhilarating Main Title music there is the sumptuous main theme. First heard hauntingly sung by solo male voice over the Venice canal sequence it is then fully developed in glowing orchestral form and is used to point up the growing love between Andrea and Modonna Camilla. An exquisite broad rapturous theme full of engaging warmth which positively surges with passion. It is arguably Alfred Newman's loveliest melodic inspiration! This dazzling score can be heard for its own merits isolated on the audio track.<br><br>Performances in PRINCE OF FOXES are throughout generally well played with Power and Welles being particular standouts. Excellent also is Felix Alymer and Everett Sloane but Wanda Hendricks in the female lead is terribly miscast. She doesn't suit the picture at all! One wag observed \"She looks like a bobbysoxer lost in a great Cathedral\". My sentiments exactly!<br><br>The DVD is of exceptional quality! With well defined imagery that is sharp and clear. Extras, besides Newman's arresting score, include a still gallery, a good trailer and a very appropriate Movitone News excerpt showing Ty Power and Linda Christian being wed in Italy which took place while he was making the movie there. NICE ONE FOX! BUT IT IS A SHAME YOU DIDN'T COLOURIZE IT!","user":"jpdoherty","rank":[29,37]},{"title":"One of the Most Beautiful B/W Historicals Ever Put Onto Film; Well-Acted","rating":8,"date":"26 June 2005","review":"This is the only film whose producer ever rented a country. The tiny country rented to become \"Citta del Monte\" in Samuel Shellabarger's well-plotted \"Prince of Foxes\" was actually the real country of Andorra. The historical novel on which this beautifully-paced and emotionally satisfying film was made left Milton Krims, scenarist, with an unsolvable problem--which he proceeded to solve. The plot line involved Tyrone Power as ambitious young Andrea Orsini with Cesare Borgia's scheme to unite and rule Italy; Orson Welles does well as a charismatic Borgia, whose plan it is to marry his sister played by Marina Berti to the Duke of Ferrara; poison will follow, and the key to Italy will drop from the dying Duke's hand into his own grasp. But Andrea must first perform a mission involving the betraying of the strategic Citta Del Monte into Borgia's hands. His Mother, played by Katina Paxinou, is horrified when she hears what he is becoming; and during the mission, undertaken with Everett Sloane as an assassin he takes into service-- his own death having been the one planned--he decides to serve the Lord of the city, ably played by Felix Aylmer and also his daughter, with whom he if falling in love, miscast but hard-working Wanda Hendrix. The final battle is fought, and a happy ending is achieved--for all save Cesare Borgia and those whose death his schemes have wasted. This is a beautiful B/W drama, with lovely sets by Thomas Little,, Alfred Newman's fine music, Leon Shamroy's exquisite photography and period costumes by Vittorio Nino Novarese that I found unforgettable. Kudos also go to Roy D. Webb as 2nd Unit Director for the action scenes that relieve the very competent dialogue portions expertly crafted by director Henry King. This film, which could have been badly made, glows like a ruby set in the hilt of a dagger flashing back the rays of a spring sun. It is well-remembered, and a benchmark of a production against which other historical dramas are measured still.","user":"silverscreen888","rank":[33,43]},{"title":"Magnificent Medieval Melodrama","rating":9,"date":"17 May 1999","review":"Just this weekend I stumbled across this lovely film on American Movie Classics (AMC)while fiddling around with the old remote. I was absolutely astounded by the realism of the sets: one felt transported to Renaissance Italy. Castles, palaces, towers were all faithfully replicated. The costumes were gorgeous. The armor and weaponry appeared accurate and deadly. Even the catapults were genuine; they did not appear to be models.<br><br>The acting was superb! You take for granted that the performances of Welles and Sloane would be excellent. But the very pleasant surprise came with Tyrone Power's portrayal of Orsini. I never considered Power more than just a pretty face (and an excellent swordsman). However, this film changed my opinion of his acting talents completely. In fact, all the supporting cast turned in satisfying performances.<br><br>This is a true gem of a film, I would love to see it on the big screen.","user":"ecomcon-2","rank":[24,31]}]
