[{"title":"Old School Classic.","rating":6,"date":"23 December 2016","review":"I like this movie not only because it is typically Poe, but because it brings back an age of classic horror movie genre. The acting I'll admit was rather flat line but the story is what nightmares are made of, and I would recommend it to anyone who maybe trying to come up with a horror movie ideas of their own. Nowadays too many directors confuse gory slasher movies with horror and that should never be the case, good horror movies may display certain elements of gore for the shock effect, however, true horror movies has the ability to stay in the sub-conscience and when you hear things that go bump in the night; it will have the ability for the viewer to recall what they are relating their present apprehension with. <br><br>Gabriel C.

He takes his satchel and follows her. While climbing a cliff, he falls and faints. He wakes up with amnesia in a lighthouse and the keeper Walsh (Vernon Wells) explains that they are isolated in a remote peninsula where nobody can leave. The only means of transportation to San Francisco is a ferry that will arrive two weeks later. Last but not the least, he warns that he shall always keep a light burning during the night. He goes to the woods in the morning and meets the woman again. He learns that her name is Nora (Rachel Riley) and they fall in love with each other. When he returns to the lighthouse, Nora explains that Walsh is crazy and she cannot go there. During the night, the young man blows out the candle and sees spectral creatures. What are the secrets of Walsh, Nora and the lighthouse?<br><br>\"Edgar Allan Poe's Lighthouse Keeper\" is a strange horror movie developed in a nightmarish style, giving the sensation of a nightmare to the viewer. The plot is intriguing and creepy but unfortunately the conclusion is rushed and messy. Would J.P. be Walsh himself when he was young? But anyway the story startles in many moments. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"Very, VERY Old Fashioned Horror Story done well with a nice Classic, atmospheric style... Blu-ray: Excellent A: 9 V:9","rating":7,"date":"13 January 2017","review":"3.4...??? Seriously? <br><br>Well, maybe if a person just doesn't like this type of old school Horror film or the Retro style of movies like this really bores them. Then yes, I guess so... But, when a person rates a film like this poorly when it is one that they wouldn't like anyway, does that help the rest of us to know HOW WELL it was done? See what I mean? For example, I personally loathe and detest Torture Porn Horror films, but I certainly do not come here and give movies like 'HOSTEL' low ratings, do I? Why...? Well, because that doesn't really help people who might actually LIKE those kinds of films and who want to know if a particular one is done well. So, likewise with this one.<br><br>Sorry about the long intro, it kind of bothers me when people do that here, because as I said, it's really not helpful to others who DO like these types of films. Well, you can probably tell by my rating that I really liked this movie (the reviews of the two other people so far here seem to agree...) This movie is indeed for people who actually DO like these kind of Old School Ghost Stories (can you say, 'THE FOG' anyone...? YES, the original, NOT the lame remake : ) So, if you are the kind of person who likes older style Ghost Stories (especially ones based upon Classics like Poe) then you will probably really enjoy this movie.<br><br>In my lowly and wretched opinion, I thought it was put together in a very effective and moody way with a lot of Classic style and atmosphere. I felt that it was told in a way that served the story very well and maintained a good level of Suspense. The acting, although not stellar, was decent enough and did not detract from the mood of the story. It IS a very simple story though, so you will need to keep your expectations reasonable. I'd say if you like modern versions of Classic Horror stories like Stuart Gordon's 'DAGON', for example (although this one is much simpler and likely with FAR less money) you should really enjoy this one.<br><br>Again, a good, old-fashioned, Old School, creepy and atmospheric Ghost Story. Nicely told and well done considering the clear limitations of how much money they could spend on it.<br><br>(P.S: Please be careful with Claudio's review below (above?) as it has some, I'm sure, unintended Spoilers in it!)","user":"lathe-of-heaven","rank":[18,26]}]
