[{"title":"Deserves a higher rating","rating":8,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"This is a pretty good movie. It has a science fiction element obviously, but once you're past that, everything is completely believable as good science fiction ought to be. The aging man is sent into retirement and finds himself in a stale and lifeless situation. Thus, his retirement gift has particular relevance to him given his damaged ego, low self-esteem, and monotonous marriage. The gift of course is the glasses which provide a life-like companion programmed with AI to tend perfectly to the needs and whims of the wearer. It's an interesting premise that reminds me somewhat of \"Her\" which deals with similar subject matter. But this movie isn't just a cheap copy of \"Her\" as it has a fresh take on matters. The AI character is played by Christen Harper, who is absolutely gorgeous in this. I'd watch the movie just for her, and in a way you're sharing the main characters experience of interacting with her. It's completely relatable the man needs a break from his bossy and overbearing wife and finds refuge in the beautiful companion. There are a few week points to the movie - it's fairly predictable, and the pacing feels a bit slow. And without going into specifics, the ending isn't really satisfying. That aside, it's definitely worth watching and the IMDB rating should be a bit higher in my opinion.","user":"franklindf","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"I have seen much worse , higher rated movies that's for sure","rating":8,"date":"21 September 2019","review":"I think the suspense and originality of the movie provides enough for it to be higher rated than it is","user":"onlinevirtual","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Could be the future??","rating":8,"date":"21 September 2019","review":"Spooky movie if you think this could be the future!
