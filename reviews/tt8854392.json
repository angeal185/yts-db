[{"title":"Very sweet, very predictable","rating":6,"date":"18 March 2020","review":"Being sick (not this corona thing) and almost unable to sleep I watched this - yeah, with low expectations. And some experts say that comedies are good for recovery, what myself can confirm. Watched BBT and That 70'es multiple times, so something new, pls. And this is really fresh.\nReally nothing original, just usual high-skool things, combined with some competition in singing, acting and dancing,<br><br>No doubt, Avery is main character, best looking, and they did not miss chance to show her (well, actresses).\nScript deserves max some 4, rather 3. Acting probably 5. But it was fast paced, well directed for this kind of movie, so overall 6 from me.","user":"pkpera","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Sweet G rated dance movie!","rating":10,"date":"16 March 2020","review":"If you like dancing singing and comedy, this is a great movie for you. It's perfect for younger kids as well as teens. Jaden Bartels and the rest of the popular cast are fun to watch in this sequel.","user":"MiaLico2017","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Even better than the first one!!!","rating":10,"date":"15 March 2020","review":"To The Beat! Back 2 School is really great and even better than the first one!!! A lot of the new characters are really interesting. I think it's pretty interesting that Mackie and Avery are friends now. I hope we get a third To The Beat soon! I'd love to see that!!!","user":"mschmid-69341","rank":[1,1]}]
