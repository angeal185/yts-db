[{"title":"Great kids / family movie","rating":10,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"Absolutely great family movie! If you grew up in the 90's you will love it and so will your kids but even if you didnt, grab the popcorn, turn off everyone's phone, curl up on the couch and escape to some family fun and laughs for 90 minutes.","user":"jimfritz","rank":[10,16]},{"title":"Great for Kids and Adults with Sense of humor","rating":8,"date":"31 January 2020","review":"I had a few laugh at loud moments during this. My kids however 5 and 10 where completely entertained. Watching them was worth the whole thing. If you have kids looking for a movie to watch or just want to watch something from your 90s childhood, i'd say this one's great for that.","user":"movielover-21414","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"kids don't stop laughing","rating":10,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"This film keeps kids laughing all the way while sending a great message about being yourself and standing up to bullying","user":"mdillingham-28312","rank":[8,14]}]
