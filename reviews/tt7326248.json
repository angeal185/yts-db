[{"title":"Before he could only make so many...","rating":7,"date":"8 October 2017","review":"In 2036: Nexus Dawn (and Nexus, for those who may recall, is a key word in the Blade Runner universe for those darn replicant), somehow Jared Leto has a better Joker scene in a Blade Runner short film prequel than he did throughout his entire actual performance as the Joker. This is not to say it is so much in the performance as it is in the writing, that sense of unpredictable menace which his character brings to the others he is in front of as they sort of discuss \"prohibition\" against creating replicants coming to a close. Or, of course, not, as it turns out to be here.<br><br>I enjoyed this short, though mostly for Leto - who, again, I now am excited to see what he does in the full 2049 film - and for the cinematography. It's a tricky thing to come to this as it is meant (I guess like how there were other prequel-appendix shorts to Alien Covenant) to provide some other context before we see 2049. But on the other hand, where is the context for *who these* characters are? I can pick up enough parts from the trailer and this to get who Leto is playing. Everyone else, however, make it more uncertain and it had the feel of a fan film of some kind. I also wasn't a fan of the editing, how Scott cuts together his beautiful digital cinematography and lit shots together, a little jumbled. All this said I liked the dark and menacing tone, I liked the whole purpose of where it leads to (the \"man\" next to Leto in the scene and what he does), and I'm further intrigued to check out more shorts.","user":"Quinoa1984","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"\"Make a choice\"","rating":7,"date":"18 February 2019","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this short. I saw the movie, and now, after watching the short, I recall the great, great, great performance of Leto in the film. Few actors catch my attention the way he does. Bravo! to him and I hope so see him play at his best in every movie he encounters to play in.","user":"mihai_alexandru_chindris","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Decent appetizer","rating":6,"date":"29 September 2017","review":"\"Blade Runner 2049 - 2036: Nexus Dawn\" is a 6-minute live action short film from very recently as this is not just a 2017 release, but actually only about a month old. And the title tells us that it is a little work to promote the new upcoming Blade Runner movie, but it is not just a fan film, but was directed by Ridley Scott's son Luke and this is far from the first time that he came up with a bit of additional material for his father's blockbuster work. Also happened on Alien recently, even if Scott is of course \"only\" a producer on the new Blade Runner movie.<br><br>This one here is really all about Leto's character, who he is and what his abilities are. His acting career has been on a rise since his Oscar win and one can only hope that this one here turns out better than his turn as a Joker or lets say the entire film that did not result in a good reception at all, even if it won an Oscar. But back to this short film here. A really good watch for all Leto fans and tolerable for everybody else too I guess. I give it a thumbs-up and hope the new Blade Runner will be on a similar level quality-wise.","user":"Horst_In_Translation","rank":[5,8]}]
