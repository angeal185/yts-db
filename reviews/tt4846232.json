[{"title":"a twisted odyssey","rating":10,"date":"29 March 2019","review":"Robert Pattinson has steered very clear from his Twilight years to give us an impressive resum√© of independent films that have scrubbed off his Cullen brand and moulded him into a compelling actor. The Safdie Brother's Good Time is but a testament to his ability, giving us what could be his best performance yet.\nTwo brothers, Connie and Nick Nikas, attempt at a bank robbery but fail and Nick lands in jail. This sets Connie to embark on a desperate and dangerous journey to get his brother out. What seems like a simple premise, quickly descends into a twisted odyssey, offering more than just a casual heist-gone-wrong flick.<br><br>Pattinson stuns as Connie Nikas with an approach to the character that will make you ponder on his motivations and lead you to question what he will do next. This is far from anything he has done prior, Connie is unsympathetic, desperate and immoral as he evades the ludicrous situations he finds himself in with but a tinge of luck. The other characters, played splendidly by mostly newcomers, paint a picture of debauchery and excess for New York's underworld, forever maintaining a true level of authenticity that often feels part- 70s arthouse and part- contemporary anthemic.<br><br>A large fraction of the success of Good Time is thanks to masterful direction by Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie and a consistently stellar performance from Robert Pattinson. A sleeper hit for 2017, all the more reason to watch it.","user":"raphaellecat","rank":[58,68]},{"title":"Very good movie","rating":9,"date":"8 October 2018","review":"Greetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"Good Time\" (2017) is one of the more involving movies I've seen in some time now. This is a good thrill ride from start till finish. It has a very good directing, good and involving script, great performances and great pacing. The movie is pretty brutal, but its not a blood fest. It has a simple premise and keeps on to it till the end.<br><br>Overall, i really enjoyed \"Good Time\" for its all 1 h 38 min run time. It never dragged and i was very involved into this story superbly told. Very good movie on all accounts.","user":"851222","rank":[47,55]},{"title":"Intense and Enticing","rating":9,"date":"19 July 2018","review":"Quick and to the point, Good Time exceeded my expectations. The acting, (especially Rob Pattinson's), direction by the Safdie Brothers, and soundtrack all came together to create a masterpiece. It's not a regular type of film, which might be why some people don't enjoy it. It was raw, edgy, and intense. The movie pulls you in and leaves you wondering what to do once its over. I can't wait to see what Josh and Benny Safdie will come out with next!","user":"groll-28516","rank":[22,26]}]
