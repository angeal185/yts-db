[{"title":"Wonderful black comedy...","rating":8,"date":"1 July 2003","review":"I don't know what all these people are complaining about - I saw this movie in a film festival over here and spent most of the movie trying not to p*** myself with laughter. How the characters get in and out of such completely off the wall situations, and the deadpan way they said some of the lines left me in hysterics.<br><br>Granted it isn't a perfect film, but it's a good 7/10","user":"heyhey","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"few news in...","rating":7,"date":"28 November 2002","review":"\"Gamle maend in nye biler - Alte MÃ¤nner in neuen Autos`, the prequel to \"I kina spiser de hunde\". Part-time-chef and gangster Harald is here again, together with his subordinates, including Vuk and his Serbian  body-guard. New among them is a Swedish psychopath, specialized in killing every woman he meets. But not in Denmark. There he meets the love of his life. Like in \"I kina...\" the cold-storage room becomes the mortuary, cooking becomes side-line. Though Harald's subordinates would rather take part in a pastry competition instead of supporting his criminal machinations.<br><br>Lasse Spang Olsen made a solid gangster flick but does not come up to \"I Kina spiser de honde\". Too much action too long, too much violence (esp. against Vuk), that does not result from comic accidents. Therefore, this \"prequel\" lacks the anarchic sense of humor, one would have expected. Solid, but not as good as \"I kina..\"","user":"ruben-heim","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Absolutely hilarious","rating":9,"date":"4 December 2005","review":"Comedy at it's best! The humour in this picture varies from lighter more jackass'isch to dark satirical aspects and sometimes borderline evil. The plot is probably totally impossible to explain for someone that hasn't seen it, with twists far beyond comprehension; the turns are as many as they are crazy. The characters are twisted and shows both the best and the worst sides of humanity(or lack thereof). The only thing one could complain about is the music -you could wish for a bit more, but that's just a minor thing.<br><br>There are several, independent, movies with the same characters which I highly recommend(all danish).","user":"thenudeferret","rank":[14,19]}]
