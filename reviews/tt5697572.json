Now i have fewer friends. The cgi is a nightmare. The plot is non existent. And they used Taylor as a promotion tool and she appeared in the movie for like 10 minutes.","user":"mariamelkott","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"I wish I could score this less than 1 star","rating":1,"date":"22 December 2019","review":"This movie reminds me of that scene from Jurassic Park where Jeff Goldblum says \"You were so preoccupied with whether or not you could, you never bothered to ask if you should.\" This was hands down the most disturbingly awful movie I have ever seen. Whoever greenlit this should never be in charge of the light ever again. How dare they do this to me?!? Please don't go see this movie. And if you do, may God have mercy on your soul.","user":"michaelely-01627","rank":[2,2]}]
