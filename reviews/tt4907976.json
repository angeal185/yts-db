[{"title":"The movie I wish I didn't watch.","rating":2,"date":"19 August 2018","review":"I guess I have the honor to be the first reviewer for this piece of garbage. You'll guess that I really didn't like this movie. First of all, the story, it's boring, going nowhere, and you won't get any explanations on what happened. Then you have the acting, and that is pretty mediocre. The movie is very slow, with almost no action at all. I'm not even going to talk about the suspense because there is just none. And then you have those little details that just shows how mediocre this movie is. A woman smoking, that obviously never smoked a cigarette before in her life. Why would you put that scene in the movie as it clearly shows the actress not knowing what to do? Another scene is showing a woman getting up in the early morning at first daylights, seeing she has to get groceries, walking of with her son and then coming back with two small bags when it's pitch black outside suddenly, a couple minutes later they are talking inside and you can see it's bright daylight again outside. Those are small things but they say enough about the quality of this movie. A big waste of my precious time.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[7,11]}]
