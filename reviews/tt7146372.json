He uncovers a plot to blow up Dodger Stadium because Kamy D. Bruder likes to kill and is a Giant's fan. And OMG, he can't read a line to save his life. The characters should have been better scripted and the police chief should have worn socks. About 40 minutes into the film I noticed choppy sound as they shifted camera angels and the sound production got progressively worse. Acting needs improvement and the script wasn't believable.<br><br>Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[0,2]}]
