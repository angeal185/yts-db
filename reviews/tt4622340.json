[{"title":"It's not too bad.","rating":7,"date":"8 November 2018","review":"Realize that because of my grandchildren I watch a lot of Curious George &amp; to be honest, I can't stand this monkey &amp; his cast of humans who think it's fine to leave a monkey in charge of everything. That being said, I kind of enjoyed this movie. The story was somewhat interesting, the music was fun &amp; the animation was really good. I really like George Goodman &amp; as usual, he performed a bang up job. So sit down with your little ones &amp; enjoy.","user":"deenapetrick","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Good family film!","rating":9,"date":"9 March 2020","review":"Although this one isn't \"as good\" as the others, it is still a great story and wonderful for the littles in your life. Clean, wholesome entertainment! My kid loves George including this one !","user":"wingodsaysso","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"My 2 year old son's favorite movie","rating":9,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"Not only is it my son's favorite movie, it's one of the few that I don't mind watching over and over. Great soundtrack and original songs. George never fails to disappoint me, and while I'm not the target audience, I'm always satisfied with the message this animated series teaches to our youth.","user":"ayers-timothy","rank":[0,0]}]
