[{"title":"I just...","rating":5,"date":"9 September 2018","review":"The acting was spot on, as for the rest...<br><br>What?<br><br>A completely empty shell.<br><br>It was like an MTV/Disney coming of age movie about the racial struggles during 6 months of a persons life where at the end they are enlightened and one with their self. Barry is a drama queen, he's overly sensitive, and really it's like he just came out of puberty and is embarrassed that he has pubic hair.<br><br>The kid who plays Barack though deserved a better script, had the President down to a T.","user":"djkaine","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"This is not the \"Barry\" we know.","rating":7,"date":"16 December 2016","review":"To counter the only other \"review\" which is, in fact, a political complaint about the Obama administration and implies that the author had not actually watched the film at all, I am writing this. <br><br>This is an interesting look at the life of \"Barry\", who isn't a politician and has no interest in politics at all. It looks at conflict, race, trying to fit into two worlds and not feeling like you belong in either... It's about learning who you are in a world that isn't sure where it thinks you belong. It was a wonderfully interesting peek into a time that helped to shape the man who would go on to be the leader of the free world.<br><br>A very good watch if you can manage to set your political affiliations aside for long enough to actually watch it.","user":"anissa-taylor","rank":[94,135]},{"title":"Not insightful.","rating":4,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"The writing was not strong. I found it overly stereotypical regarding race, 1981 or not. The acting was fine but they really were not given material that could reveal a more appealing portrayal of Barry in his years at Columbia. It really does not add to what we know of Obama.","user":"Anyanwu","rank":[5,5]}]
