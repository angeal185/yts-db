[{"title":"Unrealistic","rating":6,"date":"19 April 2019","review":"Who would dump a hot girl like that? Sure, she is not the perfect ten because she doesn't have ling hair, but she is not shorthaired either, is thin and has a great body and of course knows how to dress and be pretty. No man would dump a babe like that! It makes watching and believing the story difficult.","user":"trijalpasquale","rank":[19,19]},{"title":"love letter for kiritani mirei lovers!! :)","rating":9,"date":"8 February 2019","review":"If u really love kiritani mirei then u have to watch this!! she is soo powerful n cute at the same time in this movie that it will definitely drag u to love her more!! just loved it!!","user":"mohammadirfan274","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Good Enough","rating":8,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"If you love Mirai Kiritani, then you'll have to watch this one. It is cute and powerfull at the same time. The politics in this one are subtle and just give this movie a foundation to built the character development on it. The leading lady, moreover, was dislikable at first, but she goes through a major change and we learn that some people weren't who we thought they were at first. Overall, the romance is cute and sweet, as the couple had chemistry, the performances were really good, the story entertaining, though it was cliche packed, and the ending was just okay. So, 8 out of 10.","user":"pennyelenabooks","rank":[0,1]}]
