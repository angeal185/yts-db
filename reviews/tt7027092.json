[{"title":"Just not that funny","rating":4,"date":"3 June 2019","review":"There was 2 or 3 laugh out loud moments but at best it was watchable it's wasn't boring as such but unoriginal and nothing new to the scene watching dubbed in English I do wonder if some of it was lost in translation also as most fell flat. Could have been a lot worse however.","user":"muamba_eats_toast","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"The Hangover in French","rating":8,"date":"4 March 2019","review":"I was born and raised in Budapest, but I live in the west since over thirty years now and even if I think, that some of the things in the movie were a bit exaggerated and maybe possible after the fall of communism, during the years when nobody knew how to continue, but not today, I also think that the other reviewers giving this movie a 1 star rating out of national pride, are just disgusting butthurt snobs and probably nationalist scum, who have no humor and actually hurt the image of Hungary more, than they would believe.\nDo not listen to them.<br><br>The movie is very funny and knowing that it's true and that you can really visit their website and book these trips makes it even funnier.<br><br>It's a shame that the site is only in french and you can't book these trips from the country I live in.<br><br>I laughed and enjoyed myself very much during the movie and the Hungarian music they used made me nostalgic.<br><br>If you liked the first Hangover, you will like this one too.","user":"Hopstimop","rank":[12,18]},{"title":"Wow, what a waste of Time","rating":2,"date":"6 March 2019","review":"A bad copy of Hangover.
