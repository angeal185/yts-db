Mr. Nakamura (Garret Sato) is not happy. Armando is caught with his secretary Luna (Joanna Zanella) is a compromising position by his wife (Markella Giannatou). The film moves to a remote desert cabin with one of the folks always tied up in a chair. Mild torture that is off camera.<br><br>The film had promise but it was too short. Didn't care about any of the characters. The twists were not clever. Skipped all the good scenes.<br><br>Guide: F-word. Brief sex. Brief body double nudity (Mariel Gumsrud)","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[3,7]}]
