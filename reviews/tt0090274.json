[{"title":"One pretty funny movie","rating":7,"date":"14 January 2004","review":"I don't see why this film has such a bad reputation, and is probably regarded as the worst in Tom Hanks' career.  Sure, it's no \"Forrest Gump,\" but as a broad comedy it works out well.  Hanks is passionate about every role he plays, and this case was no different.  He's very funny as his snooty rich character.  Adding to the comic relief are Gedde Watanabe (of \"Sixteen Candles\") and the always-funny John Candy.  The plot is predictable, but there are many amusing moments.  Plus, it's refreshing to see a comedy that's Rated R!!!  Sure, it's no hard R, but nowadays filmmakers are so afraid to release comedies with R-ratings that it's not even funny--no pun intended.    <br><br>My score:  7 (out of 10)","user":"MovieLuvaMatt","rank":[24,27]},{"title":"Excellent film spoofing many of the great classics.","rating":12,"date":"12 April 2001","review":"\"Volunteers\" successfully spoofs more classic films than any other - from Casablanca, through Bridge over the River Kwai, to Lawrence of Arabia, they're all there if you're watching carefully enough.<br><br>It also offers a glimpse of a much younger, fresher and more natural Tom Hanks than the over-processed multi-millionaire product we see so much of today.<br><br>Full of belly-laughs and quick fire one liners, and packed with so many more subtle references that you'll have to pay close attention and watch it many times to pick up even half of them, this hilarious film really does the job. The Austin Powers and Naked Gun series are almost the only others packing this much fast paced humour into a feature film. Highly recommended!","user":"nrt","rank":[24,27]},{"title":"classic pre-oscar tom hanks!","rating":6,"date":"6 April 2004","review":"before they started winning oscars, struggling actors such as tom hanks and robin williams used to be... SURPRISE!! funny! volunteers is a great example of a movie that refuses to take its leading actors seriously and is all the better for it. this is not a \"star vehicle\" but is rather an irreverant tongue-in-cheek romp. it takes its cues from saturday night live, sctv, monty python, and cheesy off-broadway one-act plays. in return, it is spoofed by one particular hollywood blockbuster to follow, austin powers goldmember. mike myers must have been as impressed with the \"reading the subtitles\" joke, as well as the \"asian guy on the toilet/being chased by sumo wrestler\" schtick. but rather than beat the jokes to death, volunteers assumes we are smart enough to catch them on the fly. i bought this in a $5.00 dvd bin, and was reminded why i liked the movie so much in the first place. it is never particularly mean to any of its subjects, including the primitive thai villagers, the communist revolutionaries, yalies, jews, liberals, conservatives, or any of the other fringe elements put into play. as a result, volunteers doesn't insult me as an intelligent movie viewer. by the way, i had forgotten how humorously effective was the \"lawrence's bar\" scene where the local musician plinks out an oddly romantic version of \"as time goes by\" on an asian sitar.<br><br>\nvolunteers is the sort of movie actors must do just for fun. y'know... when they're not too busy trying to win oscars.","user":"boonewilliams","rank":[21,24]}]
