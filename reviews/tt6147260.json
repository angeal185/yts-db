Its a bit hard to follow the story from time to time, but the story moves FORWARD and no silly jumping back in time to mess up the timeline.\nThe story is really well written, something that is rare when one writer directs the movie, and the other two are actors in the movie. I actually get the feeling that the story could been pulled straight out of the newsdesk @ your closest town :p\nThe caracters are likeable and the actors do a good job.\nIts blood, sex, drugs, drama, death and a big bunch of black humor.\nStamped this with 9 thumbs up. only missing the big 10 because of punchlines lost in translation.....","user":"SpecialWeirdo101","rank":[6,13]},{"title":"good fun !!","rating":9,"date":"2 August 2018","review":"Pretty cool movie with some laughs. i'm not sure it would be the same for English speaking audience and subtitles but if you can speak Polish then this is a great movie. Smart script with great acting is always a strong recipe.","user":"fbabka","rank":[4,10]}]
