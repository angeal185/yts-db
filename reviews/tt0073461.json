[{"title":"The Blind Dead's Creepy Finale","rating":7,"date":"23 February 2007","review":"The fourth installment of Amando De Ossorio's 'Blind Dead' series, \"La Noche De Las Gaviotas\" aka. \"Night Of The Seagulls\" is a very creepy Spanish Horror Exploitation flick, and, after the great original, the second best part of the series.<br><br>When Dr. Henry Stein (Víctor Petit) and his wife Joan (María Kosti) come to a fishing village in the middle of nowhere, where Henry is to replace the old local doctor, the locals seem hostile and refuse to talk to the young couple. The young couple hear strange noises at night, and after they employ a local girl, Lucy (Sandra Mozarowsky), they begin to find out why the locals are not so keen on talking to strangers. The little village is haunted by the Living Dead. Devil-worshiping Templars, who had been blinded and executed for their evil habit of sacrificing young women and drinking their blood in order to gain eternal life in medieval times, rise from their graves for seven nights every seven years. And the villagers have to pay a horrible price to the blind dead for sparing their village...<br><br>\"Night Of The Seagulls\" is not quite as great as \"Lan Noche Del Terror Ciego\" aka \"Tombs Of The Blind Dead\", the first part of the series, but it is definitely a very entertaining horror flick and creepy as hell. The performances are better than in the second and third part, Víctor Petit and María Kosti are good in the leading roles and Sandra Mozarowsky (who was only 16 when this film was made, and who sadly committed suicide at the age of only 18 in 1977) fits into the role of Lucy very well. Amando De Ossorio definitely invented some of the horror cinema's creepiest creatures when he created the Blind Dead, and these evil Templars are once again scary as hell. This fourth installment of the series is, in my opinion, actually the second-creepiest part after the first. The incredibly eerie score was one of the greatest aspects of \"Tombs Of The Blind Dead\", and since it worked so well with the first one, Amando De Ossorio wisely used it for all of the sequels too. And I couldn't imagine any other score that would fit as well into \"Night Of The Seagulls\", as this eerie choir, which manages to even intensify the creepiness and suspense. The last part of the \"Blind Dead\" series, and the second-best to the first, \"Night Of The Seagulls\" is a creepy and amazing little film that no lover of Eurohorror can afford to miss!","user":"Witchfinder-General-666","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"It doesn't suck like the one before it!","rating":6,"date":"8 May 2018","review":"Here we go again. The Blind Dead return and this time they are holding a coastal village in a grip of terror - demanding a virgin to be chained up on the beach for seven days in a row, every seven years. Why? Don't ask me, and definitely don't ask that nice couple that have just moved in because they've obviously not seen the previous three Blind Dead films. Lucky escape for them when it comes to the third one.<br><br>You see the guy is the new doctor in town but the locals don't seem to like him or his wife, right down to plain acting as if they weren't there! The couple find this behaviour rather odd but what I found rather odd was that the new doctor had never checked out the place he and his wife were moving to and instead just turned up one day not knowing anything about the place they were staying in? \nWhat these two quickly find is that the villagers are too scared to stand up to the Blind Dead, and that they might be a bit short of virgins, or is that young ladies? When I think about it I'm not quite sure it was virgins they were after. Why am I overthinking this?<br><br>You can guess what happens next. With only the help of the odd villager (the village idiot, some young girl) the couple have to escape the clutches of the slow motion underfed Knights, but unlike the previous film, this one piles on the atmosphere. Right from the start these two unsuspecting victims find themselves right in the middle of strangeness, what with the weird villagers and such like. The pacing is much better too, so you won't get too bored.<br><br>One funny bit was when they used the Blind Dead's horses to escape, then acted surprised when the horses just went back to the Blind Dead's castle. What did you expect to happen?\nThat's enough Blind Dead. This film holds the distinction of having the longest purchased to watched duration of any DVD in my collection. Must be about twelve years!","user":"Bezenby","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"La noche de las gaviotas: Weakest and last in the series","rating":3,"date":"13 March 2018","review":"This fourth and finale movie in the Spanish zombie franchise The Blind Dead is sadly the worst one in a series that progressively got worse and worse from the outset.<br><br>My ratings were 8, 6, 4 and now a 3 so maybe it's best that the franchise ended when it did.<br><br>I really was blown away by the first film, I simply didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did and gradually became mortified upon realising that this franchise wasn't going to continue with that level of quality.<br><br>The first film was original, atmospheric, well paced and genuinely fascinating.
