[{"title":"Just a funny & simple Neil Simon-esque movie","rating":7,"date":"24 February 2004","review":"I can't believe the reviews from these Roger Ebert wannabes that tear it down; it wasn't supposed to make a statement or have a sound plot --- it's a COMEDY, you idiots!  The numerous one-liners in this movie are priceless, and if you can't appreciate how enjoyable it is, you've gotten way too serious about movies, folks.  Its humor has withstood the test of time and it's a solid 7 of 10.  This is one of Williams and Matthau's funniest and well worth your time.  Would you believe that I never noticed that Robin flashed his genitals in the hospital scene until my wife saw it for the first time and pointed it out --- women have a heckuva radar for those things!","user":"marvelous-marv","rank":[38,49]},{"title":"Unjustly overlooked: a very funny movie","rating":7,"date":"9 August 1999","review":"The Survivors was unjustly overlooked. It's a very funny and original comedy featuring one of Robin Williams' most inventive performances. It's a chance to see Williams at his most volatile and daring, before he adapted his persona to bland \"family\" movies like Patch Adams. He has an excellent foil here in Walter Matthau. Check it out.","user":"Kralik","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"A superb comedy","rating":10,"date":"17 September 2006","review":"When you come across one of those moments in life when you really need to catch hold of a spark of brilliance you should hold onto it and glow warmly in its presence. This film is one of those moments. It sparks and creates a wonderful mix of tragic characters interacting in a modern world, confused and not sure about their place, shattered by stupid events that happen around them to place them together. Robin Williams decent into understandable weakness provides cream for your coffee Â– sacked by a parrot, driving the same car as all his fellow corporate colleagues he blunders into a world he only read about and slipped and scrawled crashing into a frightened world where the big cesspool awaits. Walter in a parallel world falls lower and lower creating empathic moments trying to get by in a simple world where his daughter strolls in his shadow in adolescence. This film contains some superb dialogue and creative comedy that charm the watcher. Robin is sublime and Walter makes sense where there is none. Jack is colossal as a nemesis and indefatigable in his pursuit until his humanity appears on the floor of a wood cabin when all the characters come together. Do not listen to those who believe this is poor, they have not watched and wondered at the connections. Brilliance and eclectic!","user":"david-bornor","rank":[18,25]}]
