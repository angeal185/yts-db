[{"title":"More Than Simple Humor","rating":10,"date":"10 July 2004","review":"Although not part of the Dexter Riley series (in fact made just after the first one), it carries Russell where Dexter might have gone after college. The same type of humor skims the surface of this movie but, it is the biting satire that is it's heart. Playing to the pretentious attitudes of people who cater to each other more than their clients, in this case the TV audience, they are completely stumped when an outsider successfully predicts the new favorite shows. But Russell holds a secret that would completely demoralize everyone in charge. Never mind a young mail clerk seems smarter than seasoned pros, but what about a monkey! <br><br>This movie showed a maturity the Riley series never did, although the concept of a bunch of college slackers was ahead of it's time, and stood out from the rest of the Disney fare at that time. Well worth viewing as it shows Russell at the beginning of his adult career. His comedic timing and relaxed, natural acting talent are quite evident here.","user":"GeorgeSpiggot","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Silly but kids will like it","rating":5,"date":"13 April 2007","review":"Young idealistic Steven Post (Kurt Russell) wants to get ahead in the TV industry but obnoxious boss Francis Wilbanks (Joe Flynn) constantly ignores him. Then Steven's loving girlfriend Jennifer (Heather North) gets a chimp (don't ask) who can predict what TV shows will be hits (!!!). Steve uses the chimp (without telling anyone) and becomes vice-president of a network in no time (just like real life huh?)...but Wilbanks is VERY suspicious of how he knows what shows will be popular.<br><br>VERY silly Disney comedy. The humor and slapstick are either stupid and/or predictable, the characters are 1-dimensional and the lines would be laughed off \"The Brady Bunch\" as being too corny...but the kids will like this. Unlike the G rated movies today there's no crude humor, no violence and no jokes about bodily functions. This basically has good clean (if silly) humor.<br><br>I admit most of the movie had me rolling my eyes but I did keep watching. I actually did laugh a few times towards the end (the reactions of a woman being interviewed on the street were very funny) and it was fun seeing Russell and John Ritter so young. Also Flynn has his moments as does Harry Morgan as the president of the network. North is sweet (but not TOO sweet) as Jen and look for Bill Daily at the end. And the chimp was adorable! So it is silly and predictable with a title song that makes you want to cut your ears off...but it's perfect for the kids. I give it a 5.","user":"preppy-3","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Monkey movie with a difference","rating":13,"date":"13 July 2002","review":"All the way through this film, part of me was saying \"I don't like this kind of film\" while the rest of me was replying \"No, but I'm enjoying it!\" The rather offensive premise here is that the tastes of the great american television-watching public can best be assessed by a chimpanzee.<br><br>There's a little go at political-correctness, major swipes at TV production values and some great characterisations of TV exec types.<br><br>\nI watched it while laying carpet tiles and it made a welcome distraction and a good excuse to take a break.  I enjoyed it","user":"georgethetee","rank":[9,12]}]
