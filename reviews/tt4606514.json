[{"title":"Excellent Documentary","rating":10,"date":"26 August 2016","review":"I've seen many documentaries relating to Bobby Moore, and they all seem to focus on the 1966 World Cup. This wonderful piece of film is very different - it is all about Bobby Moore and his football, family, outlook, lifestyle..... It's entertaining, detailed, enthralling at times and reveals what he was like as a young man through to his sad departure. I enjoyed some of the many personal and touching moments that evoked sadness at times along with a feeling that I knew him. Some of the detailed excerpts showing his affection through to his commitment as a man and a footballer come across as deep and meaningful. I really liked this docu-biopic.","user":"m-pugh486","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Rather sad","rating":7,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"What is quite touching is how many people interviewed in this film come close totears when recalling the death of this icon.The fact that he was so badly treated by the FA is no surprise bearing in mind the way they treated Alf Ramsey.It is to the eternal shame of football the way he was cold shouldered in life and immortalised in death.","user":"malcolmgsw","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Only one Bobby Moore","rating":5,"date":"5 November 2018","review":"I have seen a lot of documentaries on Bobby Moore in recent years and in 2017 there was even a 3 part mini series on the marriage between Tina and Bobby.<br><br>Bobby just had little to say that I did not already know, even the post football retirement stuff was not new. I felt that the same old lines being trotted out again.<br><br>When talking about how bad Bobby was treated by the FA or West Ham. Do not get a geezer like Harry Redknapp to be the one to do it. Every club he has managed allegedly ended up in some kind of turmoil.<br><br>Bobby tells the story of the only England football captain so far to life the World Cup. It is clear that Bobby Moore was a world class player, cool under pressure. We hear from friends, family and fans from his early footballing days to the 1966 World Cup victory and beyond.<br><br>However in business Bobby was not so lucky. He just mixed with too many dodgy people, maybe he was ill advised but financial issues dogged the rest of his years as well as his recurring cancer.<br><br>If you know nothing about Bobby Moore, then this would be a good documentary.","user":"Prismark10","rank":[1,1]}]
