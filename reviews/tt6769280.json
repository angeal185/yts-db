[{"title":"More heart than mind - not much Sci-Fi to see here.","rating":9,"date":"12 November 2018","review":"A boy-genius meets the love of his life.\nA few months later they have split up - cue the time machine to get her back.<br><br>At first glance I knew I had definitely been here before - but I was wrong.<br><br>On the surface you can enjoy this as a very simple, quaint romance with the odd joke thrown in.<br><br>The sci-fi element of this is kept on the down low.\nThere are no annoying sequences about paradoxes, dichotomies or accidentally shagging your own parents here.\nThis is all about the relationships of the three main characters and the choices we make in life.<br><br>Straight away the leads do not look like they are an actual couple and I assumed their chemistry would be garbage.<br><br>This, however, is one of the strengths of the film and what sets it apart.<br><br>This will really resonate with anyone who (like me) has gone out with someone who is clearly hotter and more vivacious than themselves.\nThere was something painfully familiar seeing the lead character snowballing trivial disagreements in to major issues due to a lack-of-confidence, fear and jealousy.\nThen of course the harder he tries to fix things the more damage he causes.<br><br>The characters are great in this; they are so believable they almost feel like people from my actual past.\nThe story is simple but non-judgmental - I found myself rooting for all parties involved all the time.<br><br>Despite having some depth this remains a nice light watch, there is no nudity, violence, political agendas, and it won't stretch your brains or emotions too far either.<br><br>An excellent watch!","user":"thekarmicnomad","rank":[51,63]},{"title":"You can't change past but why would you want to?","rating":7,"date":"10 November 2018","review":"Stillman (Asa Butterfield) is a physics genius who's girlfriend Debbie (Sophie Turner) breaks up with him and she says that it's because she is unhappy. So he creates a time machine to go back and change all the times that he made her unhappy, with the help of his friend Evan (Skyler Gisondo).<br><br>What I loved about this movie was that it doesn't take itself to seriously and there were some genuine laugh-out-loud and enjoyable moments. The acting was top notch from all three main characters. The chemistry between the struggling couple is electric and very relatable and the banter and bond between the two friends is very amusing.<br><br>But that said the writer and director (Andrew Bowler) did a brilliant job of understanding the possible consequences of changing the past and creating a \"perfect\" life. His message is that if we don't make mistakes and struggle in life then we don't learn or grow. We would be stuck in time, never moving forward which is expressed in a romantic \"boy meets girl\" rather than dramatic \"save the universe\" way, which I thought was a breath of fresh air.<br><br>This movie visualises a situation I for one have thought about, where often someone is the Yin to our Yang and opposites attract at first but over time one of you realises that you're growing a part. When you look back on the relationship after it has ended, your life seems to be over and it's easy to wish you could have a do-over. But that isn't how life works, we're meant to hurt, struggle, make mistakes and most of all learn from them. All so that when someone does come along who seems perfect for us we don't make the same mistakes we did in the past.","user":"skye-richards","rank":[30,41]},{"title":"good teen feel good movie","rating":6,"date":"10 November 2018","review":"Put this on not expecting a lot but also because I enjoy time travel movies.\nI am sure there will be people who didn't like it ot will spell out all the problems with the time travel theories. But if you just sit back and watch this movie and dont take it too seriously it is pretty good. Enjoyed Sansa Stark as well.<br><br>Over-all 6.4","user":"natcalgary","rank":[17,24]}]
