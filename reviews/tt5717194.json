[{"title":"Oh Dear Oh Dear","rating":17,"date":"17 January 2020","review":"I thought Guy was better than this. What an awful movie. Bad story line, badly told and really bad acting. Even if you are bored and just want something to watch just sit outside the cinema and watch the clouds go by, it will be far more entertaining","user":"cga-39691","rank":[45,55]},{"title":"Awful","rating":3,"date":"17 January 2020","review":"I've never watched a Guy Pearce film I didn't like until now. What the hell was he thinking starring in this? That was dreadful. I'm sure he walked out of the premier thinking the same thing. I don't want to waste my time getting into detail but the story was extremely unrealistic. Not to mention literally every actor other then the two leads were horrible. Whoever produced this film should be thrown in jail for stealing an hour of my life. 3 stars","user":"Draysan-Jennings","rank":[43,54]},{"title":"The Worst Way possible to start 2020","rating":1,"date":"6 January 2020","review":"I went to this movie hoping to watch an \"Action Movie\" expecting a minimum of 5.5 to 6.0 to be honest .. just by watching the trailer and the cover poster.\nAm grateful to this movie, because I decided to create an account in just to start reviewing starting with this movie.\nI feel bad because there is no ZERO rating in the website, because it literally deserves zero. lets sum it up:\n<ul><li>Acting wise</li><li>Action wise</li><li>scenario wise</li><li>actors</li><li>unbelievable cliche</li><li>stupidly predictable</li></ul><br><br>one example: a man was taken into custody by guy pearce,, he diverted him to go against the bad guys after a supposedly motivational speech of honor ...
