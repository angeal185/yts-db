If you didn't read the novel, you will probably also hate this movie.","user":"jaltrogge83","rank":[13,21]},{"title":"Should have had a different title","rating":4,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"To say that this movie was based on Chesterton's novel is a stretch to say the least. The names are the same. There are a couple of loosely associated similarities in the story line. However, the point, the ideas, the philosophy bear no resemblance. Truly disappointing. Chesterton would be sick to know that his story had been so warped and that the product of that derangement was presented in such a base fashion with his title associated.","user":"roowood-117-8013","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Save your time","rating":1,"date":"11 January 2019","review":"I didn't enjoy the novel in the first place but good Lord this is really a piece of junk. The movie made me laugh and for all the wrong reasons. Everything looks cheap and tawdry. Thin plot, the main actor should be changing job and this Ularu girl has a bright future in portraying the bad girl with a thing for flashing her body and showcasing a dominant role in 'those activities'","user":"vavuvavu","rank":[0,9]}]
