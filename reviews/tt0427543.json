[{"title":"Bleh","rating":3,"date":"9 December 2019","review":"Could've been good but nah, they missed the mark.\nThe lead, was fun to watch but terribly miscast ~ he was playing an addict who as the doctor said was near death with all his vital organs barely working, yet he looked like Fitness instructor.<br><br>His nude scenes saved this film imho.","user":"alainp-936-297886","rank":[24,27]},{"title":"Has its moments","rating":6,"date":"4 September 2019","review":"A strong central performance about a film that dances around the edges of the grim reality at times and at times was poorly paced sometimes rushing sections and dragging other parts out. Still does a good job making you care about most the characters unlike some similar films. Unfortunately however it doesn't quite all come together and falls just short of being anything more than reasonably good.","user":"muamba_eats_toast","rank":[19,25]},{"title":"I hope the message of this tale helps those who need to hear it.","rating":9,"date":"9 December 2019","review":"Aside from the fabrications and embellishments, the core of this story rings true to someone who has known people who have fought (and continue to fight) for their recovery.<br><br>This movie was evocatively directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. I give immense kudos to her skills. I was brought to the point of tears more than once. And the movie left me with a feeling of realistic hope.<br><br>I'd also like to heap praise on all the cast whose performances made this an honor to experience.","user":"chicagovesuvi","rank":[9,13]}]
