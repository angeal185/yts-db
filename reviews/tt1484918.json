[{"title":"Boring and a lousy plot","rating":3,"date":"28 August 2011","review":"I do not recommend this movie at all. I don't know what dafoe was thinking when doing this movie.<br><br>First, the protagonist is a girl that leaves her country, to italy, with a writer that only met a few times. I don't know if shes naive or so stupid.<br><br>Second, she tries to fulfill the role of the writes dead wife in a really annoying way. This movie lacks music, people and smart dialogue.<br><br>Finally, the ending is really disappointing.<br><br>The only good thing is the beautiful scenes from southern italy, but anyway its a waste of time. Don't bother watching this.","user":"newtr0n","rank":[11,21]}]
