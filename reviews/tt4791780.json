[{"title":"Don't waste your time","rating":1,"date":"11 March 2018","review":"Generic plot about crooked cop, etc.\nWeak script, bad dialogue and much worse acting - either too wooden, or worse - too much yelling that I guess passes for \"acting.\"\nIn too many spots, the music background was too loud - a sign of a rank amateur that wants to drill it into the viewer's head when the \"cool\" heroes on on screen. In case, you know, the viewer is too slow.\nAlso too much use of gangstar rap, an already overused and boring genre.","user":"musicreporter-1","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Oooozes Low Budget","rating":1,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"A mix of mostly wooden acting, off-centre cinematography, audio that sounds like the microphone was on top of the camera, poor continuity, and poorly matched audio effects make this resemble a student grade production recorded on a Handy Cam. There are some exceptions, but not enough to make this enjoyable to watch..","user":"jessenifnaf","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"I liked it!","rating":10,"date":"16 March 2018","review":"I liked the film!
