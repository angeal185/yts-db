[{"title":"Nice to be surprised","rating":8,"date":"15 April 2018","review":"So often these days you find movies where the trailer was better than the movie itself. This movie is simple and honest. A good story well told and well acted. I love indie movies for this reason. It entertains without pretense and delights with small surprises. If this movie does not surprise you I would be amazed. Loved it.","user":"eyefordetail","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"Wasn't expecting to love it this much","rating":9,"date":"29 March 2018","review":"I watched this on tmn on demand. They don't always have great movies but I put this on because I was bored and planning on falling asleep to it. \nI loved it. There's a great message to it, the script was great and the acting was amazing. I've never reviewed a movie before, but this one was just awesome. Definitely worth the watch","user":"counting_starss","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Irene is a hoot!","rating":8,"date":"25 June 2018","review":"Irene wants to be a cheerleader and she'll do just about anything including licking the boys locker room floor.
