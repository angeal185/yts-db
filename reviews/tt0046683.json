The plot had already been used to death by 1954, and it was quite juvenile to begin with. But:<br><br>It had a catchy Nat Cole song which had been a hit when this movie was released In its own way, it is a protofeminist film Female desert brigands attacked on horseback, many of then standing on their horses, wearing only bra type tops Preternaturally attractive leads; exotic looking feature players (esp. Blake and Stack) Some great lines (e.g. Female outlaw leader to captured woman dancer: can you ride and use a sword? Dancer: I have other ways of conquering men) Nice color Quick and simple entertainment.<br><br>What is impressive about this not-very-expensive looking film is that all stunts were done by real people. Much more fun than computer generated effects.","user":"howardeisman","rank":[11,13]}]
