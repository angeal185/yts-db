[{"title":"Parody turns into charming combination of romantic comedy and thriller","rating":8,"date":"4 February 2003","review":"\"Hot Enough for June\" started as a funny sendup of the Bond movies of its day, but by the end had metamorphosed to a nice combination of suspense adventure and romantic comedy.

Nicholas Whistler ( Dirk Bogarde ) is dragged out of the dole queue, and sent to Prague by what believes to be a glass-manufacturing company. In actual fact, he is being used as an unwitting secret agent by M15, to recover a stolen Communist formula. Once Whistler realises the awful truth, the film turns into 'The 39 Steps' revisited! Bogarde plays Whistler much like Dr.Simon Sparrow, the best performances come from the irreplaceable Robert Morley as the delightfully droll Colonel Cunliffe, and gruff Leo McKern as his Russian opposite number. Sylva Koscina provides glamour as McKern's daughter, with whom Whistler falls in love. Ralph Thomas expertly mixes the comedy and suspense, the audience is cheering Whistler on as he makes a desperate attempt to enter the British Embassy in Prague at the climax. Good fun.","user":"ShadeGrenade","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"The Case of the Incidental Spy","rating":6,"date":"9 September 2007","review":"MASTER PLAN: capture that spy! A restrained yet witty, surprisingly entertaining parody of the James Bond/spy genre so prevalent during the Cold War of the sixties. Keep in mind that the connection to Bond may be based on the fact that agent 007 was killed at the end of the original novel version of \"From Russia With Love.\" The hero and main character (Bogarde) is not actually a spy - that is, trained for or knowledgeable of the arcane profession. He's actually a bit of a layabout, an unpublished writer content with collecting unemployment to get by. He's not even truly interested in getting a job, but when the prospect of a good salary unexpectedly comes up, he's unable to resist the offer. He thinks, based on his meeting with his new boss (Morley), that he's being sent to Prague on typical corporate business and because he understands Czech. Some warning signals go off in the back of his mind with the thought of going behind the dreaded Iron Curtain and using a code phrase (the title of the film) as part of his instructions. Well, he should have heeded those signals more. It's intriguing that he doesn't know who his contact is - the return code phrase has something to do with September - and this sets up some amusing scenes.<br><br>Bogarde is excellent as the slightly naive but nevertheless intelligent, quick-on-his-feet dupe. The story bogs down just a bit as he acquaints himself with the new locale but it really kicks into full gear when he's finally targeted by the enemy (headed by McKern). The audience and the character himself find out that he's actually pretty well suited for the cloak-and-dagger business, much to our astonishment. The actress Koscina had a more flamboyant role in the similarly imitative \"Deadlier Than the Male,\" but she exudes a lot of sultry appeal here. And old pros Morley and McKern show how such experienced thespians can add much to such a film. Since much of the story's premise points to the pointlessness and 'running-about-in-circles' of the espionage business, this translates into a rather frivolous, pointless overall scheme for the film, but you're engaged while viewing it. Also, this early in the decade, this was more derivative of the early \"From Russia With Love\"-style of the 007 thrillers, rather than the 'world-threatening/domination' plots of later imitators, such as Flint and Matt Helm. And, I'm still trying to figure out the meaning of the alternate title, \"Agent 8&amp;3/4.\" Hero:8 Villain:7 Femme Fatale:7 Henchmen:6 Fights:5 Stunts/Chases:5 Gadgets:4 Auto:6 Locations:6 Pace:6 overall:6","user":"Bogmeister","rank":[9,11]}]
