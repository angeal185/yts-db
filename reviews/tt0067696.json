[{"title":"A Fun If Middling Giallo","rating":6,"date":"9 February 2008","review":"\"Seven Blood-Stained Orchids\" (1971) is a middling, fairly goreless giallo from director Umberto Lenzi that should just manage to please fans of this genre. In it, a hunky-dude designer, played by Antonio Sabato in a one-note performance, investigates when his pretty fiancée becomes the latest target of yet another Italian serial killer. With the help of this fiancée, appealingly played by German actress Uschi Glass, the couple realizes that all previous murder victims had stayed at the same countryside hotel several years before. But will this bit of knowledge enable them to save future targets of the killer? And why does this homicidal whack job insist on leaving crescent-moon medallions (NOT half-moon, as widely reported elsewhere!) at the site of his slayings? The film, as you may have discerned, tells an interesting story, with a twisty, slightly confusing plot that does ultimately manage to hang together. Lenzi has directed his film in a competent, no-nonsense manner, while the picture's score, from Riz Ortolani, is alternately somber, cool, menacing and lovely. The film's killer utilizes many expedients to off his victims, including beating, drowning, strangulation and--in a scene that should please most gorehounds--a power drill, and this many years before similar nut cases picked up their Black &amp; Deckers in films such as \"The Tool Box Murders,\" \"The Driller Killer\" and \"The Slumber Party Massacre.\" Several scenes are indeed quite suspenseful, such as the ones with the poisoned kitties and the female mental patient. Shriek Show is to be thanked for this fine-looking DVD (sadly, with no subtitles) of a film never before released in the U.S. Oh...one other thing. Do NOT watch the film's trailer before viewing this picture. Amazingly, it reveals the killer's identity not once but several times! Talk about spoilers!","user":"ferbs54","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Lenzi's masterful giallo","rating":8,"date":"10 May 2002","review":"Seven Blood Stained Orchids (Sette orchidee macchiate di rosso, 1971) is extremely pleasant and atmospheric Italian mystery, giallo from the beginning of the 70's. Lenzi himself likes this film too, but doesn's think it is his masterpiece. I have not seen too much of his work (I have seen at least Cannibal Ferox, Mangiati Vivi! and Il Paese del sesso selvaggio) but when I saw this 70's classic I knew that Lenzi is at his best in this genre.<br><br>\nMurders take place and soon the main character starts to notice some connections and relations between the murdered ones. Couple of years ago something evil happened and now it seems to be payback time.<br><br>This is almost as masterful as Argento's Profondo Rosso in the suspense department. Argento's work is more stylish and artistic but Lenzi is definitely not less interesting or less skilled. Couple of scenes are very scary and shocking especially if the film is viewed alone in the dark..Music by Riz Ortolani is great, but not as great as in Cannibal Holocaust or La Casa sperduta nel parco by Ruggero Deodato.<br><br>In these giallos, there is always pretty confusing and non-believable plot but it doesn's matter because these films don't have to be realistic; they can be supernatural as well and it doesn't diminish their impact. Plot in this film isn't too confusing but many twists and turns take place during the film.<br><br>Seven Blood Stained Orchids is highly recommended for Italo fanatics and horror fans alike. Lenzi directed his most notorious cannibal films only because of money, so these mystery films are far more personal and artistic too. And the lead lady character played by Uschi Glas is unbelievably charming and sexy, and she is very nice to watch.<br><br>8 out of 10 and recommended!","user":"Bogey Man","rank":[9,14]},{"title":"A fair murder mystery ..","rating":4,"date":"8 January 2005","review":"Handsome Antonio Sabato (father of Antonio Sabato Jr of such films as THE BIG HIT) and his wife are on the trail of a cold blooded killer whose only clue is the crescent shaped locket he leaves behind at every murder he commits. The killer has already tried and failed to kill her, will he be able to finish the job? This is just one of the questions that SEVEN BLOOD STAINED ORCHIDS asks. Another is how the hell did I manage to sit through this without falling asleep? I guess it was the funky retro finger painting free loving SWINGIN' SEVENTIES STYLES!! Seriously though, while this film has dated a little, director Umberto Lenzi crafts a moderately engaging murder mystery. Plus there's a fair amount of gore and nudity to engage the rest of us.","user":"Space_Lord","rank":[9,15]}]
