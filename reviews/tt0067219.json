[{"title":"Don Knotts at his finest","rating":9,"date":"4 November 2006","review":"This zany film rivals the Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's finest film performances. Knotts is an accountant for a Podunk city hall that is good for swindling the citizens. They fire the \"three competent bookkeepers and keep the dumb one\" (Knotts of course is the dumb one). When his garbage collecting cohort accidentally empties the wrong trash can, Knotts finds himself wrapped up in a bizarre trap set by the city council for him. Funny moments in the movie include the Bowling Alley Restroom scene, and the cemetery scene is absolutely hilarious. Typical Knotts, the nervous ninny act is well used, and as usual he is surrounded by lots of crazy character actors from the sixties. Such actors as Frank Welker, and Pitt Herbert add to the mayhem. As one may expect Knotts's armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real clue of what he's doing. Fun for anyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but just about anyone will love it.","user":"bakerd1-1","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Lesser of Knotts' Classics--but...","rating":5,"date":"23 August 2006","review":"...it is still entertaining and interesting. Many people have complained that this is Don on autopilot. Nothing could be further from the truth. Granted, the FILMMAKERS were on autopilot. The overt kiddie flick tone of \"Figg\" was obviously an attempt to counter the perceived flack the studio got from the mild sexual overtones of Knotts'previous film, the classic \"The Love God?\". And \"Figg\" is a goofy, childish film in many ways--similar to the worst of Disney's live action romps like \"Herbie Goes Bannanas\" or \"The Million Dollar Duck.\".<br><br>But the film does do one thing rightit changes up the standard Don Knotts film character. As everyone notes, the standard character in Knotts' five classic Universal flicks is basically Barney Fife. But it's more complex than that. In the first four films, the Knotts character was invariably a naïf loser who is put upon, becomes an undeserved success, gets a big head, is brought down again, and eventually perseveres. Through it all, however, he is always a nice guy. <br><br>This, however, is only half of the Fife persona. The other half is what I like to call the \"Dick Barney,\" as in \"The Barney Who Acts Like a Dick.\" This angrier Barn is evident in the \"Andy Griffith\" episodes in which Barney is in charge of Gomer or Goober. Seeing them as inferiors, the inferiority-complex riddled Barney is always compelled to order them around, yell at them, and call them stupidin other words, to just treat them like a dick. This kind of interaction was the source of many hilarious \"slow burn\" Barney tantrums.<br><br>The Knotts we see in \"Figg\" is not the Nice Barney, it is definitely the Dick Barney. So, even though the plot of \"Figg\" is pretty much a cookie-cutter slice of the standard Knott's formula, the lead character is a definite change for the film series. The substitute Gomer in \"Figg\" is Knott's best friend Prentiss, played by voice artist Frank Welker. And Prentiss makes Gomer look like a freakin' genius (in fact Welker's performance is so over the top childlike that he seems literally retardedbut no one really seems to notice). Knotts' Figg character verbally rails on Prentiss without mercy, eyes popping, veins bulging, his whole body vibrating with rage. IT IS A RIOT TO BEHOLD!<br><br>So, even though the script, supporting cast, and direction of \"Figg\" were all substandard, Knotts himself did at least try to give us something different instead of simply rehashing the same ole same ole. Gotta give him credit for that!","user":"curtis-8","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Average Slapstick Film -- Great For Knotts Fans","rating":6,"date":"5 March 2012","review":"Don Knotts is Hollis Figg, the dumbest bookkeeper in town. When the city fathers buy a second-hand computer to cover up their financial shenanigans...<br><br>It was nice to see Yvonne Craig as a character other than Batgirl, even if she was merely the evil temptress. And Dick Warlock on stunts? Wish i knew exactly what he did, because Mr. Warlock is someone I admire for all the wrong reasons.<br><br>The film as a whole is good -- it is funny, silly and has some dumb moments (and I use \"dumb\" in the nicest way possible). I would not go so far as to call it a \"good\" film, but it is enjoyable... and I do love me some Don Knotts.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[5,6]}]
