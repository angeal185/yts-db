[{"title":"Pleasantly surprised","rating":7,"date":"13 November 2019","review":"The main character is an almost insufferable vlogger stereotype, but the humor is able to carry it regardless, and I was pretty entertained throughout. Would definitely recommend for movie night with friends or similar.","user":"TheRealMisterMan","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Very light weight humor, kinda juvenile, coulda been better, though.","rating":5,"date":"23 March 2020","review":"The main setback is that the vlogger character has way too much screen time and he's tiresome. to see and hear after 20 minutes. Someone so utterly stupid is never funny more than five minutes in because for the rest of the movie you keep thinking, \"This would be more fun if he got what he deserved, got dispatched, in the second act, then the show could go on.\" That would be achieved by making all the Ben Lyk characters responsible for carrying the movie, rather than the putx hwo is stuck at age five all the way through. Yes, in real life utter imbeciles may surive to a mature age, but in entertainment, we are not obliged to reflect that much realism.","user":"clivejamesrd","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Kill Ben Lyk (2018) review","rating":16,"date":"16 April 2020","review":"This 2018 British film, maintains a delicate balance between comedy, whodunit style mystery and thriller. Three people called Ben Lyk all get murdered, leading the Scotland Yard to gather all the Ben Lyk's in London under their protection to figure out who's behind the murders. At only an hour and 17 minutes, the film goes by in a blink of an eye. Directed by Erwan Marinopoulos and written by himself as well as Jean-Christophe Establet and Oliver Maltman. Visually Kill Ben Lyk looks like a b-movie more than anything. The performances by Eugene Simon as the main Ben Lyk and Simone Ashley as The Girl are the movie's highlight as the chemistry between the two actors is excellent, as they provide the comedy in the story. The rest of the actors do a decent job with the material they have been given.<br><br>The film falters in its script, as not enough back story is given about secondary characters such as the bad guys and the audience isn't given a chance to get to know or relate to any of the other characters leading to a shallow script. The mystery elements make this film stand out more than anything. Ben Lyke had the potential to be a lot better; instead, it ends up being warped and incomplete.<br><br>1/5","user":"Wreyogfilms","rank":[0,0]}]
