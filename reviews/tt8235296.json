[{"title":"\"Christianity Is Not About Religion, It's About A Personal Relationship With Donald Trump\"","rating":1,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"I firmly believe anyone and everyone has the right to believe and follow any relgious ideology or political affiliation they'd like. I also believe that people have the right to know how terrible a movie is before they see it, and that's what I'm doing here, because wow...<br><br>The Trump Prophecy portrays the \"incredible\" true story about a man who had a vision where God told him Donald Trump would be our next president, which then inspires him to lead a nationwide mass prayer movement. Even for Trump supporters, I really don't see much of a story to maintain a motion picture runtime, and as it turns out, the filmmakers didn't succeed in creating one either. Most of the film is painfully dull, with tediously endless long dialogue sequences only intercut by the occasional unintentionally funny moment. Many characters (actually, practically every single character) announced that they don't much like Donald Trump. However, the film implies that God opened up all eyes of true Christians to help them see Trump was the worthy candidate, and that God himself stopped those crazy anti-American liberals and the she-demon Hillary Clinton. Isn't that a bit insulting to its audience? <br><br>Regardless, every aspect of the film itself is atrocious. Stephen Schultze's direction is clueless and unkempt, with random pan-ins and sharp edits that make no fillmatical sense, almost as if the film is being helmed by a 10-year-old. Speaking of the editing, it's some of the worst I've seen in a theatrical release. It's edited like a low-effort high school project, with uncomfortably long pauses between cuts that - no joke - make it feel very similar to Birdemic. I clenched every muscle in my body to hold back the hysterical laughter from the hilariously awful editing; did the editor not think his work was terrible? The acting is about on par with Birdemic too, as the entire cast is stiff, uncharasmatic, and hopefully still have their day jobs. While the script and story are atrocious in their own rights, it's the craft of the film production that makes the film almost unwatchable.<br><br>I'm sure some conservatives will love the film regardless and will accuse any unethused critics of either being payed to hate the film or are just angry liberals who will blindly bash it because of its source material. Trust me, nobody has paid me and I'm not the biggest democrat, I'm just a man who likes good movies. The Trump Prophecy is not a good movie. In fact, it's one of the worst of the year so far, if not the bottom worst film of the year, and I say that with zero political bias. It's just that abysmal. If I were a Trump supporter, I'd demand better.","user":"Dwright1212","rank":[197,250]},{"title":"This is just ridiculous.","rating":1,"date":"9 October 2018","review":"I'll say right now I'm not a fan of Trump but I find his support by the Republicans and the evangelical community to be puzzling. The man is a New York Liberal. He was a registered democrat for most of his life. He never was a religious or pious man. He's been married three times, cheated on every single wife he has and yet is seen as being a family man. <br><br>How is this even possible? It's because some people simply don't care who the candidate is and just blindly support the guy with a \"D\" or \"R\" beside his name. And this movie is a perfect example of this. <br><br>For some reason we're dealing with people that believe that God not only exists but actually cares about how is in charge of the United States. He doesn't seemingly care about any other country like North Korea. No, only the United States matters in his eyes or at least that's what a lot of American evangelicals seem to believe. <br><br>What we have in this movie is terrible acting. Terrible special effects. Terrible reasons for supporting Donald Trump and a desire to ignore all the bad stuff he's done. <br><br>And yet the faithful will go see it, praise it's message, and give it 10/10 because they're a bunch of sheep. There's a reason why a congregation is called a \"flock\". They just sit there and accept whatever is told to them. <br><br>Maybe they'll wake up in a couple of years when America is no longer a superpower.","user":"Java_Joe","rank":[177,229]},{"title":"Horrible - Slow, filled with misinformation, lots of get ready to go to war and fight for Israel stuff","rating":1,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"We went to this - It was like 3 movies - all of them bad - although the first part, the firefighter who is told by God that God wants Trump, was not just propagandistic, but it was so slow and poorly done. Designed to make people afraid so that they are receptive to the ideas put forth in the next two sections - which run like slick ads for going to war - (they sacrificed themselves and now it is our turn music playing to a bunch of pictures of folks with loved ones in frames who fought wars), and then the final part which is a bunch of interviews with mostly white guys talking about the founding father's setting forth a Christian state (they did not - they were secular humanists) and Capitalism (which is an economic system and not a political system) being the political system of the US. Most of this was just manipulative propaganda.","user":"aelisabeth-19506","rank":[154,204]}]
