[{"title":"Decent movie","rating":6,"date":"4 August 2019","review":"This is an interesting storyline. I enjoyed it because I havnt seen a movie with a similar plot so it had me thinking. The acting is pretty good in particularly the main male lead and his family. This movie isnt the best I've ever seen but if you enjoy the thriller/horror genre like I do and often watch ones with terrible plots and questionable acting... This movie isn't like those and is worth a watch.","user":"mudvayne-90245","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"Intense physiological Thriller.
