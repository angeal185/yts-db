[{"title":"Outstanding film with Oscar-worthy performance by Penn","rating":9,"date":"19 April 2019","review":"I wasn't thrilled about a biographical film story regarding a dictionary, but this one impressed me! Who would've though to know the history behind a dictionary?<br><br>Farhad Safinia makes his first full length feature film debut as writer and director, and nailed it. Produced by and also starring Mel Gibson - who was also great in his role, this film was directed exceptionally well, and the writing was good. I felt the screenplay was all over the place in a few areas, and the 124 min length a little too long for the story being told. I'm not a fan of slow paced films, but this one was just right. Casting was great, including Game of Thrones' Natalie Dormer, but wow did Sean Penn give an Oscar-worthy performance in his role as Dr. Minor. Glad to see him back on the big screen. The score was perfect and the sets/costumes on point for the era.<br><br>This is by no means an action packed Hollywood blockbuster, but instead a historical biopic produced extremely well, and a must-see.<br><br>A well deserved 9/10 from me.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[165,183]},{"title":"A phenomenal story to learn about","rating":10,"date":"2 June 2019","review":"First of all, I didn't ever think Sean Penn could out perform his role in Mystic River for which he won the oscar for and is one of my favorite movies. But he took his role in this film to a different level and couldn't have been done any better by anyone else. Mel Gibson's role was just as powerful and I don't think anyone could have done it better than him and goes to prove that Mel can still play a leading role and still be considered at the top of the list to make a memorable movie. Sean Penn will definitely be a contender to win another oscar and in my opinion, he should win it again because I highly doubt he'll be surpassed this year by another actor. This year's oscar belongs to him hands down. The Professor and the Madman is a remarkable story of history that deserves to be told and rewarded.","user":"masontwin","rank":[67,72]},{"title":"Screw the critics ... quality storytelling wins out again","rating":10,"date":"23 June 2019","review":"When politics and social messaging run rampant in today's movies, it's hard to find a good story (even better when true) with a script and actors who sign on to simply do the job at hand - making a quality film worthy of anyone's time. It doesn't matter who you are or what your views are to be completely engrossed and enlightened by this one. It has friendship, courage, kindness and sadness at its heart. It's also further proof that reality is stranger than fiction. Not over-acted or overly anything. Ignore the critics again on this one and enjoy a little known story you won't forget.","user":"staceyallyn","rank":[96,107]}]
