[{"title":"Laughed and laughed","rating":7,"date":"9 March 2018","review":"Is this Oscar material, nope, but I did enjoy the movie. It was corney but exactly what you would expect. I watched it on TV, not in the theaters and I found the plot was suspenseful and the little old ladies, especially Florence Henderson were delightful.
