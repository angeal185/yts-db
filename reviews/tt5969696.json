[{"title":"The Battleship Island Review: A visual masterpiece, deserves to be seen.","rating":9,"date":"13 September 2017","review":"Movie: The Battleship Island (15)<br><br>Rating: 4.5/5<br><br>I'll be straight: the film was breathtaking. I started watching and didn't realise when 2 hours passed away. It was really engaging, and well executed. Visually it looks like a fantasy. Ryoo Seung-wan's recent release THE BATTLESHIP ISLAND is a well made action film that never gets too melodramatic and the entertainment quotient remains quite high throughout. <br><br>It's another time I'm impressed with Hwang Jung-min. He delivers another great performance as he did in ASURA. So Ji-sub was decent in the action sequences, but one would wish his character got a proper scope in the second hour. Song Joong-ki's character was extremely well written and he delivers a great performance. Kim Su-an does another mindblowing job after TRAIN TO BUSAN. One can only wish she does more such roles because she really acts well. Same for rest of the cast. <br><br>The screenplay is excellent: it stays focused and never deviates from storytelling. The action sequences are jaw-dropping and mindblowing: make sure you watch the film in a very high quality so as to appreciate the film even more. The cinematography is excellent and captures the eye-catching visuals very well. The editing is decent and really, I didn't wish the film was shorter.<br><br>THE BATTLESHIP ISLAND turns out to be a terrific action film which should be seen not just because of its high quality technical values but also to know about this extremely well-narrated tale of survival.","user":"Prashast_Singh","rank":[20,35]},{"title":"a meaningful & extremely moving film","rating":10,"date":"22 January 2019","review":"Profound for the simple reason that this film breathes life into history by presenting this extraordinarily gripping true story. Absolutely stunning. One amazingly kinetic experience, splendid production values and some of the most intense staging and action you'll see within the korean film industry.","user":"aminifatimaaa","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"A mediocre period drama bolstered by extreme patriotism","rating":15,"date":"15 August 2017","review":"Like \"Wolf Warrior 2\" in China, the commercial success of \"The Battleship Island\" in Korea can be largely attributed to its extreme patriotism. From a pure critical point of view, \"The Battleship Island\" is rather mediocre, if not utterly catastrophic. <br><br>Admittedly, the film is not a total disaster. There are some brutal and bloody action scenes. But this rare merit is easily overshadowed by more CGI-enhanced (in other words, fake) action sequences. Also, Hwang Jung-min and Kim Su-an perform well in the movie such that the love between their characters, the father Kang-OK and the daughter So-hee, undoubtedly moves the audience. Yet most characters in the movie are flat and one-dimensional, especially Park Moo-young, played by Song Joong-ki. <br><br>To make things worse, countless problems lie in the plot, the storytelling and the editing. How did Park arrive at the Battleship Island? Why did Park survive long after being shot and severely wounded? Why were the Japanese completely unaware of the meeting of the Koreans? Why did the Japanese give up after the death of their commanding officer? Why did the Koreans see the explosion of the atomic bomb, which was physically very far away? Why does the movie end suddenly without a fourth act?","user":"TheBigSick","rank":[30,58]}]
