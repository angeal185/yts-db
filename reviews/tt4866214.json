[{"title":"A good idea wasted.","rating":4,"date":"5 August 2018","review":"The photography is bad, many planes closed, bad lighting and camera out of focus.\nThe actor Sal Rastegar could fit into a Tarantino movie, but here it looks a bit out of context.\nIn \"action\" scenes you never see any full-body character shots.<br><br>It is worth taking a look at the director's short films, they are better than this movie.","user":"pidrosoft","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Dry and tedious","rating":1,"date":"17 August 2018","review":"A story about a sentient AI that could have been good. But the acting was unbelievably dry, the camera work was really poor, and the dialog was .. predictable and bland. I feel sorry for the actors in this movie.","user":"kinthiri","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"This could have been good.","rating":3,"date":"16 June 2018","review":"But it started dreary and then got boring. It's the old rehash of ideas with none of the action. I could not even finish it. Rare.","user":"raven-sirius","rank":[2,2]}]
