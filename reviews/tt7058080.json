[{"title":"thought provoking and well acted piece of entertainment","rating":9,"date":"16 August 2019","review":"Haunted by her tragic past and fighting a bitter custody battle with her ex husband Lizzie is losing her grip on reality. At her son's friend's birthday party Lizzie sees a girl named Lola and somehow recognises in her the baby she lost many years ago. Convinced against all logic that Lola is her own daughter miraculously brought back to life, Lizzi starts following the girl around. As her obsession intensifies, how far can she go before a new tragedy befalls all involved?<br><br>ANGEL OF MINE is one of those films that benefits from walking in blind and just taking it all in at face value. Based on the French drama film L'EMPRIENTE the English version is much further into thriller territory than the original, building up an almost unbearable tension.<br><br>These are tour de force performances for the stars Noomi Rapace (Lizzi) and Yvonne Strahovski (Claire, Lola's mother) as the first spirals out of control and the second is consumed by suspicion and fear. Their dynamic easily warrants a second viewing.<br><br>The plot may read as a standard thriller, but this is not the case at all. With its nuanced performances, pacing and intelligent script the film keeps its cards close to its chest. The ending will not disappoint.<br><br>Moving location from Paris to Melbourne, Australia is an interesting choice, as Melbourne can be as moody at times and as stunningly beautiful.<br><br>ANGEL OF MINE is great to see with a large, focused audience, where you get all the gasps and laughs which makes it a perfect movie experience.<br><br>While being a remake ANGEL OF MINE stands on its own as a much more tense version. It is a thought provoking and well acted piece of entertainment.","user":"mjfhhh","rank":[135,161]},{"title":"More people should know of this gem!","rating":1,"date":"1 November 2019","review":"What a fantastic movie. You know the synopsis by now and you have heard complaints of slow paced first half. Ignore that because the pay off is worth it. I am not going to give you a clue just trust me. The one point I will make is that in the wrong hands and with the wrong cast this could have backfired but this is in perfect tune with incredible performances by all. I mean stunning, award winning level. Not just Noomi Rapace but Yvonne Strahovski too. I suspect they helped each other tremendously because their interactions are so believable to watch. If you are deciding to watch it just do it, it is a little gem.","user":"middleearthmusic","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Simple Review","rating":6,"date":"8 September 2019","review":"Both my wife and I fancied this movie from viewing the trailer.\nActing and direction is at a good standard but I found two thirds of the movie boring and so did my wife but I'm glad we stuck it out until the end as the last third of the movie was very good.\nWe both scored this movie a 6 and agreed that it was worth viewing.","user":"andrewgrgtwn","rank":[19,23]}]
