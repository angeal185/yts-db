[{"title":"Drivel","rating":1,"date":"24 November 2018","review":"There is a bleak hedge scene in this movie. It's an old English Yew. All I can say it's much more interesting and fast moving than this movie. Plot is utter nonsense. Scenes that don't tie up with what's subsequently said and done. Low budget drivel.","user":"nacblackwell","rank":[16,24]},{"title":"Micro budget","rating":2,"date":"27 December 2018","review":"Why didn't they get any actors? Or a sound engineer? Come to think of it a script writer.","user":"mail-mark-collins","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"The Pits","rating":1,"date":"8 December 2018","review":"Watch first 2 minutes, 2 in the middle and skip to the end. You will save yourself an hour or so and a vacuous script. Actually the acting was so bad it made the script look better.\nThis is a plot formula which has been used on numerous occasions. The director had a dream, no not Martin Luther King's, no he thought he was Hitchcock. He isn't.\nThere are reviews disparaging others' views. Surely comments should be about films seen and not other reviewers comments?","user":"seamasoshea","rank":[5,6]}]
