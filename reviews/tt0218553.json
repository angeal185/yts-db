[{"title":"Above average, but must be viewed as part of the Ringu series","rating":8,"date":"19 March 2005","review":"Taking place immediately after the events of Ringu (1998), Ringu 2 features Mai Takano (Miki Nakatani) continuing the investigation into the events of Ringu. At the beginning of the film, Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) and Yoichi Asakawa (Katsumi Muramatsu) are still in \"hiding\"/\"on the run\" after their ordeals in Ringu. Both the police and Mai are hoping to find them. Meanwhile, Masami Kurahashi (Hitomi Sato), one of the two girls from the beginning of Ringu, is now in a mental hospital, the police have the remains of Sadako Yamamura's (Rie Inou) body, they're trying to recreate her living appearance through forensic modeling, and they've located a man who is supposedly Sadako's father, Takashi (Yoichi Numata).<br><br>Series note: As should be apparent from the above description, it's imperative that you watch Ringu before seeing Ringu 2. You may also wish to watch Ringu 0: Basudei (2000) before Ringu, and for fun, the original \"Ring 2\", Rasen/Spiral (1998) before or after this \"replacement sequel\" (this one was produced when audiences were dissatisfied with the very differently toned Rasen/Spiral).<br><br>Unlike Rasen/Spiral, Ringu 2 is so close in tone to Ringu that it seems more like a \"second half\" than a sequel. Also unlike Rasen/Spiral, I think that Ringu 2 is much more uneven. There are long swaths where the film is extremely bland. But there are also moments of brilliance, plus there is added value from the momentum of Ringu. They all average out in the end so that Ringu 2 earns an 8, or a \"B\", just as Rasen/Spiral did.<br><br>Many fans were dissatisfied with Rasen/Spiral heading off into sci-fi territory, on the way providing something of a scientific explanation for what turned out to be a \"Ring virus\". They thought it ruined some of the mystery from the first film. It's curious in that light that many of those same fans like Ringu 2 much better. There is also an attempt here at explaining the curse, and it also ends up in sci-fi land. There's even a seen that amusingly resembles sci-fi elements from John Boorman's underrated Exorcist II: The Heretic (1977). For much of the film, the Ring curse is more or less abandoned while the focus becomes Yoichi as a surrogate villain, perhaps as \"possessed\" as Regan was, just by a slightly different force.<br><br>Admittedly, though, the explanation for the curse in Ringu 2 is much different than it was in Rasen/Spiral, and despite the sci-fi, the strong mystery genre \"investigation\" elements that many loved so much in Ringu are woven throughout the plot. The sci-fi here is more psychological than Rasen/Spiral's medical sci-fi. There is a lot of talk of intentionality and theories of intentionality being physically manifested. The film's ontology has it so that \"mental energy\", emotions and thoughts can be suppressed and subsequently \"concentrated\" to such an extent that when released externally, they can be dangerous to others. Sadako, the chairperson of the Ringu villains, is the principal, most focused example of this, primarily because she's had 30 years in a veritable isolation chamber to effectively bury her thoughts. Is this an attempt to provide a subtext about the suppression of one's \"real feelings and desires\" in Japanese society? Maybe, but it doesn't work very well as such because the points are so shakily, ambiguously and infrequently realized in the film.<br><br>So we have to evaluate Ringu 2 more on its surface level. A lot of the film is a fairly pedestrian drama. Early ostensibly horrific events--such as the perusal of Reiko's apartment, deaths of supporting characters, possible \"ghost\" appearances, and the supernatural events surrounding Masami in the mental hospital--too often come across as a bit flat, almost banal. Ringu 2 is nothing if not a slow cooker. It improves, but very gradually.<br><br>By the time we get to one particular, very significant death, the film is cooking with full gas, but that's nearly an hour into a 90-minute film. Before that point, Ringu 2 is much closer to a 7, or a \"C\", if not slightly lower. I won't mention who dies in this pivotal scene, but it is beautifully realized. We never really see the body, but instead Nakata shows us bright red blood slowing flowing across pavement, trickling down cracks, filling up depressions.<br><br>From here to the end, Ringu 2 is much more even, often a 9 or above. The bulk of the \"atmospheric\" or \"creepy\" material arrives in this last half hour to forty minutes, such as the videotape of another young girl suddenly changing, her head bizarrely, violently shaking similarly to an effect first made popular in Jacob's Ladder (1990). Another standout moment is at the Yamamura family \"hotel\", when both Sadako and her mother eerily appear.<br><br>By the time the climax rolls around, the film is quite exciting, and Nakata forgoes dramatic sci-fi for more focused, horrific surrealism. Like Ringu, there is a climactic scene in a well, this one much more enigmatic, possibly meant to be a symbolic journey to the core of the pent-up emotions associated with Sadako (opposed to a more \"journey to hell\"-styled symbolism of Ringu), with the emergence from a light-filled \"ring\" representing the physical manifestation and release of the emotions through a person's eye (eyes are important ring-like metaphors/symbols throughout the film). In the finale, Nakata also more literally combines the ring symbolism with the series' ubiquitous water symbolism--water more than likely being used to represent a kind of unifying \"spiritual\" (\"kamic\" might be a better word) ether that permeates the world. Of course, he still leaves an opening for another sequel as well.<br><br>Unlike many films, Ringu 2 is impossible to evaluate \"properly\" in isolation. It must be contextualized with Ringu. It may be far from an excellent film on its own, but it's certainly above average when viewed in conjunction with the series.","user":"BrandtSponseller","rank":[26,28]},{"title":"Doesn't quite emulate `Ring's smartness but, as horror sequels go, stands strong","rating":30,"date":"30 June 2002","review":"This movie takes place a week after the events of `Ring', making the first movie pretty which a pre-requisite for viewing (director Nakata fortunately doesn't feel the need to waste too much time on annoying exposition). We now look at those who were in contact with characters from the first movie and how they're getting on. This calls for the reprisal of most of the cast, including the lead Reiko. This time Reiko fears that her son, whom she saved in the previous flick, may be under the influence of the evil of Sadako. Guess what? She's out to stop her!<br><br>There's less tension evident in `Ring 2' than the previous, less a sense of worry and desperation. Part of this is due to the shifting of character's prominence. Another element is because this movie takes a somewhat more analytical approach to the events of the first  the police are involved, scientists are trying to understand the phenomena. While this makes sense from a realism angle, it does somewhat detract from the underlying menace of Sadoka.<br><br>Structurally the movie takes the same idea as the previous  a slow build up to a climatic event, interspersed with some moments of terror. Some of this terror now comes from a child  playing on innocence  and the child in question, Yoichi, is quite capable of being frightening in a blank-faced way. However he's just not as  capable as having the greater, unknown, terror the previous movie produced  like any sequel in the genre there's the feeling of the killer slashing their way through each flick.<br><br>Nakata is fairly competent with what he has. The lighting is often muted, the camera work focused (without being intense), his actors giving grand performances but somehow the second time it doesn't work out quite as well. This, coupled with a disappointing ending, left me somewhat disappointed. There's some good moments in it  particularly with the television images  but overall it fails to quite grab you. Still a far more intelligent fare than the gore-drenched horror that most adhere to in this genre, and you could do a lot lot worse. 6/10.","user":"Aidan McGuinness","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"More plot, more scares, more idiocy","rating":8,"date":"22 October 2002","review":"Even though Sadako had been around for a long time (there were Suzuki Koji's source books and two previous TV movies), it was the theatrical version of Ring that made her huge.  So, of course, there has to be a sequel (which, oddly enough, wasn't based on the next book in Koji's series; different filmmakers had already adapted that as Spiral).  It's a daunting task to make an effective sequel to one of the all-time creepiest movies, but the filmmakers pull it off.  Unfortunately, a lot of stupidity gets in the way of the scares.<br><br>A lot of plot in this one.  The movie opens a week after the first one ends. Reiko's dad has just died, and she and her son have gone into hiding.  Mai, who found Ryuji's body at the end of Ring, is investigating her boss'/boyfriend's death.  She thinks Reiko and her son hold the key to this mystery.  So she teams with one of Reiko's co-workers (who's still working on the story of the cursed videotape) to try and track Reiko down.  At this point, there's already enough plot for a movie, and I haven't even mentioned the return trip to Sadako's old home, the doctor who thinks he can get rid of Sadako, the burial of Sadako's physical body, the girl the co-worker betrays (and literally comes back to haunt him), and the weird, scary \"exorcism of Sadako\" finale.  Plot, plot, plot.<br><br>Before I tear this movie a new one, let me say one thing:  minute for minute, this one has more scares than the first one.  In fact, the filmmakers have realized that Sadako has become so commonplace (a Sadako doppleganger appears in almost every Japanese horror movie made after the first Ring) that they need only show her trademark hair to invoke fear.  And it works.  But the massive, ridiculous plot nearly kills this movie.  While it tries to explain the occurances of the first movie, it raises more questions than it answers (why does everyone suddenly have psychic ability?; why are people who haven't even seen the tape haunted by Sadako?; how does that girl see the tape if all the copies have been destroyed?)  Still, with all of these potholes, the movie still works.  It's also nice to see almost the entire cast of the first film reprise their roles (even the dead ones). An effective thriller, even though it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Fans of the first one won't be disappointed.","user":"Jerry-93","rank":[17,21]}]
