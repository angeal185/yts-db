[{"title":"Little Known History","rating":7,"date":"4 October 2018","review":"I read a good review in the paper. Since my mother and her family grew up in Benson Arz. I had a personal interest. I taped stories by my grandfather about his early days in Arizona but he never mentioned this part\nOf history. He was there when it happened. He worked in a mine and later on the El Paso &amp; Southwestern\nRailroad. Perhaps he was embarrassed to talk about it. <br><br>I thought the movie was very well done. The towns people made good actors. The story was a real human \nInterest story. It was so wrong to deport the striking miners. My today's standards it would have been a huge crime. According to my grandfather Southern Arizona was rough quite lawless. Vigalanties and\nGun fights like Hollywood movies have depicted for decades.. I am sorry this movie did not get wide\nCoverage.<br><br>Alan K Weeks","user":"Domino6145","rank":[19,28]},{"title":"Interesting Topic, Bad Presentation","rating":3,"date":"16 July 2019","review":"The film makers took an interesting historical incident and in an effort to add \"drama\" or something ended up with a boring series of meandering shots that left me actually asking the television if we could please get on with the story. It opens with a long shot of a guy standing alone in front of an empty school building first asking some guy to keep everyone quiet and out of the shot, then stands there doing and saying nothing for what seems like forever and the rest proceeds at the same snails pace. When they got to some weird side story about Tombstone, AZ and how they're \"Second Amendment City\" I finally gave up. Apparently it is possible to make someone stop caring about a story simply through bad self-indulgent film making. Just read the Wikipedia article and you'll get the gist without all the \"Indie Film\" foolishness.","user":"jackdog1-1","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"Writers forgot something!","rating":3,"date":"19 September 2019","review":"It was alluded to in the movie, but was ultimately not portrayed. What happened to the deportees? Look it up and you will find out that some deportees MADE money from their deportation. There was a class action lawsuit with such substantial settlements that some bought ranches, started businesses, etc. Just wondering why this wasn't portrayed in the movie?<br><br>Also, some deportees might have been emotionally damaged and moved around afterward, not being able to settle. Yet, if you read their prior history, they were moving around before. This was the Wild West after all.<br><br>One more thing - Anarchists and Communists we're running riot throughout the country and the world. They were a real threat.","user":"rae-18810","rank":[8,19]}]
