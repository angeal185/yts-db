[{"title":"disapointing","rating":4,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"The real events were much more captivating and interesting than those depicted in the movie , very bad script a lot of cliches which do not match with the time that took place the event (plus too many headshots like in a videogame) , however I give 4/10 for the historical truth of the creation of the GIGN and their good deployment on the field at that time, but otherwise the creators of this movie missed a good chance to make a very great movie","user":"cretzulegionaru","rank":[26,37]},{"title":"Lousy","rating":30,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"Good action sequences in this though tepid French war drama inspired from actual events. But acting and directing - except in action sequences - are forgettable, if not laughable. Those French militaries look too much like superheroes for some one like me. Look out on the way they can shoot one hundred hostiles as targets in a side show without even be hit themselves- excet in the foot for one of them. The overall topic is OK, only some directing flaws mess up the whole. The director Grivois had already made another film about marksmen.","user":"searchanddestroy-1","rank":[22,37]},{"title":"whats more fun than watching terrorists get massacred?","rating":7,"date":"17 June 2019","review":"I enjoyed this movie.\nThe acting, production and story is great","user":"zathan-32848","rank":[13,22]}]
