[{"title":"Diablo Marooned","rating":22,"date":"22 December 2001","review":"In the film PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES, there is an undeniable creeping dread, a very real sense of terror, in every scene. Despite the obvious lack of money, Bava wrung some eerie, disturbing imagery out of his sf schlock piece. Considering this is an Italian production of the mid-60s, director Bava infuses some real originality into his story, taking a 1950s crew of square-jawed astronauts and forcing them to confront the future of horror: a horde of gore-streaked zombies, an omnipresent supernatural force invading the crew's minds, and a nihilistic ending. <br><br>What is great about POTV stems from Bava, his dynamic camera, and his framing. The marooned spacecraft atop a craggy hillside, approached by rescuing astronauts, looks like a haunted house against the black-clouded sky of the planet. When the living dead begin stalking the pitted, fiery surface of the planet, intent on killing the astronauts, Bava effectively uses the new horror icons of fear: not of fear, but of zombiefication, of characters who could be us, once just human, but now horribly returned as mutilated living corpses set to kill friends and family. <br><br>PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES is exciting, arresting in places, and nuanced in small ways even by the actors involved, all of them physically fit with numerous fight scenes. Sullivan and Bengall aren't creating their<br><br>characters, but they react realistically as human beings in an increasingly hopeless situation. The final scenes, of the<br><br>astronauts attempt to escape the planet, set upon by the living dead, have a psychological edge to go along with the action, as these noble travelers overcome their fear of the planet, of the zombies, and the horrible prospect of becoming zombies themselves, in order to end the hungering menace all around them. These scenes predate the best of George Romero's DEAD films or any John Carpenter flick, where a group of survivors are whittled down to just a few, and then to one, by a wave of seemingly unstoppable supernatural force.<br><br>\nIt should be noted that \"vampires\" refer to parasites, not classic monsters, and truly this is more of a \"zombie\" film than a \"vampire\" movie. The film Bava made is gory and violent for 1965 when it was released, and as interesting as it was then, it's just as interesting now to see how POTV influenced later horror-film greats, not only in theory but in execution. And it's still better than 95 percent of the recent Hollywood sf-horror films of the past decade, bar none.","user":"robotman-1","rank":[30,34]},{"title":"A treat for fans of Italian sci-fi movies","rating":7,"date":"2 October 2001","review":"This new release in the \"MGM Midnight Movies\" series of DVDs is an absolute must-have. The print of this 1965 classic is gorgeous, and for the first time since its theatrical release viewers can see the film in its original wide-screen format. For those who -- like me -- purchased the HBO Video version on VHS, don't worry: The original spare-but-effective electronic score has been restored, instead of the \"updated\" abomination that made the VHS print almost unwatchable.<br><br>Although I've never heard Dan O'Bannon acknowledge it, certain elements of this film must have been in his mind when he was working on \"Alien\": Two spaceships are drawn to an eerie, fog-shrouded planet by a mysterious radio signal, then snatched from orbit by an irresistible force. After crash landing, the surviving crew find themselves pitted against their own dead shipmates, resurrected by the parasitic mentalities of the planet, a dying race who must find a new home. There's even a scene where Barry Sullivan and Norma Bengell investigate an ancient, derelict alien spacecraft, complete with giant skeletons (any of this sound familiar?)<br><br>The set designs -- the cavernous interior of the spaceship and the appropriately alien fixtures of the derelict -- are some of the best you'll find in any pre-1968 science fiction film. Sullivan is suitably stoic as the warrior-scientist Captain; the supporting cast and in particular the luscious Ms. Bengell turn in remarkably understated performances, perfectly conveying dread verging on panic. While this movie may disappoint fans of director Mario Bava who are more familiar with his horror films, as a science fiction film buff I rate it a solid 7.","user":"henri sauvage","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Another Bava gem!","rating":26,"date":"26 May 2003","review":"For many people the directors Mario Bava and Sergio Leone are the cornerstones of Italian popular cinema. They created estetic conventions which other, sometimes just as talented, directors followed. Bava's legacy not only extends to horror and thriller films but as this film shows also to the science-fiction film. For, Planet of the Vampires, is by any standard an important and influential entry in this genre. It is not without the faults which trouble several sixties sci-fi films, such as the occasionally silly sets, but Bava's feat is to rise above the American B-movie narration and create a tense, exciting atmosphere.<br><br>In a story which plays like a forerunner to the first installment of the Alien-series, two spaceships receive an emergency signal from a nearby planet and decide to check it out. Once they have landed all sorts of mysterious events takes place, such as the crew members starting to kill each other off. One of the crews manage to destroy themselves completely and its then up to the other crew, led by the captain played by Barry Sullivan, to find out what's going on. It turns out that the dead are being re-animated and possessed by a parasitic breed of aliens who intentionally lured the spaceships to their planet. And thus the battle for survival begins...<br><br>The film drags in places but is on the whole fascinating, mainly thanks to a clever story(co-written by the Danish cult figure Ib \"Reptilicus\" Melchior) and a tight direction by Bava. One of the best sequences is also the one which quite obviously was an influence on Ridley Scott's Alien(1979). The captain and a lower-ranking female officer goes off to explore a crashed space-ship, of course not before placing the obligatory \"soon to mysteriously disappear\" even lower-ranking officer on guard outside the crash site. The ship turns out to be very old and filled with giant skeletons of an ancient alien race - a technically stunning and wonderfully atmospheric creation from the filmmakers here.<br><br>Produced by American B-movie mogul Samuel Z. Arkoff this could easily have ended up in less talented hands and turned into a boring mess like Arkoffs similar sixties sci-fi films such as Journey to the Seventh Planet (also written by Melchior). Instead we got another Bava gem, which again shows him adept to shift his talents to different genres.","user":"KREEPY","rank":[27,31]}]
