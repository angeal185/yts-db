[{"title":"Confused and confusing","rating":3,"date":"29 May 2018","review":"The film should be commended for an interesting premise, and some good filming on a low budget. However, there are many negatives to this movie, which when added up lead to an unenjoyable film. <br><br>Firstly, the gratuitous sex scenes are both unnecessary for the plot and character development, and feel like a slightly perverted indulgence on the filmmakers behalf. <br><br>Secondly, the sound. I was so disappointed that the sound recordings in many scenes and shots were below par. Bad sound can take you out of the moment, and remind you this is a low budget Kickstarter movie. <br><br>The plot builds acceptably, but loses coherence in the 3rd act and ends without any conclusion that would be satisfying. Sometimes an \"open to interpretation\" ending is brilliant... sometimes it is a poor attempt to hide a mess of a conclusion; the equivalent of \"and then I woke up\". Ayla falls into the latter category. <br><br>This could have been a much better film if the horror/supernatural element built to something that actually induced terror. It doesn't, so it isn't.","user":"soraprint","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Huh?","rating":1,"date":"22 April 2018","review":"Brother and dead sister sexual tension with a \"wait, was that the ending?\"","user":"chicagoslim","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Dull and uninspiring","rating":1,"date":"5 April 2018","review":"I watch an hour of this film which I will never get back. The cover makes it look like an Insidious type title. I expected some horror but it was dull and uninspiring. In the hour I watched next to nothing happened except some weird sex scene. I wanted so much more but it didn't deliver.","user":"theloststudio","rank":[16,24]}]
