[{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"17 August 2019","review":"I have seen this movie, and it's basically a sci-fi bootleg of Cat &amp; Dogs. One of the main problems with this one is the animation feels unfinished, as the mouth movements are off, the bodies don't move. Also, the characters sound annoyingly terrible, and the music is there, but is hard to hear as it is at the point where the voices are louder. Also, the movie uses dog puns way too much, and has some lines of dialogue that can be seen as inappropriate for kids by some parents.","user":"jeremycrimsonfox","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Boring","rating":1,"date":"20 August 2019","review":"My kids watch it for 5 mins and they were bored. they complaint about the poor quality of the dogs mouth and they said ...it looks very weird.\nVery disappointed.","user":"sgouraud","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"The worst movie ever","rating":1,"date":"28 September 2019","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
