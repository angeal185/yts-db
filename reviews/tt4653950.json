[{"title":"Fun, beautifully filmed, family film!!!","rating":10,"date":"15 October 2017","review":"I've seen this movie twice now and loved it both times! I had a smile on my face from start to finish. It's a charming film that you can bring the entire family to and you don't need to be Greek, or a golfer, to enjoy it. However, if you are Greek or a philhellene, you'll particularly enjoy the gorgeous Greek scenery and the authentic representation of Greek people. And, this is the first time I've seen a fusion of the Greek Orthodox Church and Nikos Kazantzakis philosophy working together in harmony to support the themes of the movie. Well done!!!!!!","user":"nina-antonakes","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"The \"Hero's Journey\" gets a modern makeover with a Grecian flavor","rating":9,"date":"26 September 2017","review":"If you enjoy stories about underdogs who overcome evil villains in the face of insurmountable odds, you will definitely enjoy Swing Away. As added bonuses, golf aficionados get a glimpse into the world of the LPGA, and travel buffs get a taste of Greek village life in the 21st Century as local residents find themselves fighting for their way of life against a greedy, heartless real estate magnate. Add into the mix a bit of intrigue on the part of two clever lawyers and an unlikely champion, and you have a fun film for the whole family.<br><br>Highly recommended.","user":"mcelrathkj","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Feelgood movie!!","rating":6,"date":"13 May 2019","review":"A decent,fun to watch family movie.Nothing we haven't seen before,follows all the norms faithfully and in the end leaves you with a sweet taste!!!!","user":"tkatsoufris","rank":[3,3]}]
