[{"title":"A Misunderstood Work Of Genius","rating":21,"date":"21 March 2006","review":"Surf Nazis Must Die is one of the best films to be distributed by Troma and sadly, one of the least appreciated. The IMDb voters who briefly put the film in the bottom 100 should be strapped down and forced to watch Driving Miss Daisy until they come to their senses. I even disagree with the reviewers who lump the film in the \"so bad it's good\" category. I think Surf Nazis Must Die is simply good.<br><br>In comparison to many of its low budget contemporaries, the writing in SNMD is positively Shakespearian. The film has some semblance of a plot, the jokes are actually funny and the action is well paced. Most surprisingly, the film has a bizarre feel-good quality, which could almost be described as wholesome (if you look past the violence, sex and foul language). This is largely due to film's sympathetic heroine, the awesome Eleanor Washington, who vows to single-handedly take out the members of an evil beach gang (the titular \"surf Nazis\") after they kill her beloved son.<br><br>In addition to Eleanor, the film's minor characters also have a lot to offer. Smeg's relationship with his mother is hilarious and the surf Nazis are wonderfully tasteless, with members being named after Nazi \"luminaries\". The director makes several very obvious references to A Clockwork Orange, but despite their eye make-up and swastikas, these gang members are about as chilling as the Goonies.<br><br>The inevitable bloodshed is rather low key and the gore effects are simplistic at best. However, the innovative use of hooks and speedboats more than makes up for any lack of carnage. Unlike many zero budget action films, SNMD does not rely on blood splatter or gratuitous sex to pass the time - which under normal circumstances I would consider to be a huge failing. However, SNMD is generally in such poor taste and overflows with sardonic humour to the point where the film becomes utterly irresistible.<br><br>Surf Nazis Must Die is a brilliantly conceived beach holocaust drama/revenge thriller that you can enjoy with the entire family. Forget about the low IMDb rating and brace yourself for this evocative masterpiece.","user":"Crap_Connoisseur","rank":[40,53]},{"title":"Possibly the best title ever...","rating":3,"date":"3 February 2003","review":"...but the film fails to live up to it, unfortunately. No, not for the reasons that most other reviewers have stated. It's Troma...so I EXPECTED bad acting, thin plot, hilariously bad dialogue, etc. That's why I watch Troma flicks in the first place. No, the reason that Surf Nazis doesn't live up to its brilliant title is that it isn't outrageous enough. It's far too tame for a Troma film, as far as I'm concerned. <br><br>When I first heard about this movie, I was psyched up to see it. Why? Because when you think \"Surf Nazis Must Die,\" in conjunction with the name \"Troma Films,\" you just expect something completely twisted...full of sex, gore, and sick humor. You know...a TROMA movie. But the bulk of this movie just doesn't live up to the expectation that I had.<br><br>This is atypical Troma, and not even all Troma fans will appreciate it. But hey, I guess it's not that bad. But with a title like Surf Nazis Must Die, Troma should have done better.","user":"james_oblivion","rank":[28,36]},{"title":"Classic 1980's Troma Rubbish!!!","rating":10,"date":"12 August 2005","review":"For, amongst other things, the excellent soundtrack, for having a character called \"smeg\",for the lush shots of the sky and the bunker area, and for the immortal line \"taste some of mommas home cooking Adolf\", this films deserves 10 out of 10.<br><br>I think the films worst enemies were Troma themselves for the misleading cover art and hyping up the title by adding the \"must die\" part. I think many people will be disappointed because they are taken in by the cover and blurb. Here in Britain the film was originally released simply as \"Surf Nazis\" and featured a less sensational cover, you knew more what to expect, although the \"a clockwork orange for the 1980's\" tag line was a bit of a joke.","user":"kingofchelmsford","rank":[21,28]}]
