[{"title":"Powerful and raw! Speaks to very heart of today","rating":10,"date":"12 January 2019","review":"Just finished the movie....as a vet with both a TBI and PTSD that I've battled since 2005 this was crushingly candid and hit my core. Thank you for the powerful portrayal of what many of us battle everyday","user":"lyn_balfour","rank":[48,60]},{"title":"An honest review - for a change","rating":6,"date":"2 April 2019","review":"I'm pretty sure this film must hold the IMDb record for the most fake (every) 10/10 reviews lol. Clearly the overall rating speaks for itself, and it's a very generous 6/10 from me.<br><br>I think Max Martini wore too many hats with this film. His acting was great, directing (camera) decent, but the pacing and length needed work. The screenplay is where this film had problems, with plot issues and too many long dragged out scenes, that along with the slow pace, dragged down this film's entertainment value. The delusional comrade (of which the content of the conversations were mainly boring and unbelievable) and all that narrating (again, mainly boring) were unnecessary, and I feel it really toned down and took away from the film. Directing his cast also needed work.<br><br>This film's production felt like one of those Hallmark/Lifetime films, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, but had it been edited down to 80-90 mins instead of its long 125 min runtime, it would have been more enjoyable.<br><br>Omari Hardwick, Gary Sinise as well as the rest of the supporting cast were good, but I felt Lily Rabe was over the top to the point of annoying in her opening scenes.<br><br>Nevertheless, an underwhelming film with a great story that should have been told better.<br><br>Still, mad props to Max Martini for putting his all into this film, and still pledging 30% of the film's proceeds to three charities that support veterans suffering from TBI, PTSD, and veteran homelessness.<br><br>Would I see it again? No. Would I recommend it? Yes, if you can get past the productions issues to see the reality of how PTST affects veterans. More of a Yes if you pay to see this film to pass on the financial support pledged to the Vets.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[32,45]},{"title":"Ok so it's not great but...","rating":7,"date":"25 May 2019","review":"Even though it's relatively formulaic, trite and unimaginative. Especially the direction and editing. The cinematics are generic. but the writing is subtle and actors (including some notable cameos) carry a loosely cogent story through. There's a depth to the characters and dialogue and narrative that is compelling. Worth watching it's message is clear and obvious but personal.","user":"c7flat13","rank":[8,9]}]
