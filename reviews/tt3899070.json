[{"title":"God awful!","rating":1,"date":"21 July 2017","review":"I want the hour and thirty minutes of my life back. Nothing but clich√©, boring and predictable action scenes. Poor acting, poor writing and lacks any originality. This isn't fit for a ten year old to get excited about. I cant count the times I rolled my eyes, put my tongue firmly in my cheek and outright left the room hoping I had to urinate. I don't know who this director/writer is - but maybe he should try working at a Starbucks instead of trying to entertain the public. He deserves the ed wood award, or the golden raspberry - but its just another mindless, linear narrative with no sub-text, character development or redemptive quality. All it needs was to star Steven Seagal and it might find an audience who enjoy cookie cutter action films with nothing to call original. This film belongs in the 99 cent bin at Walmart where the director should be working as well. Don't waste your time.","user":"josephmeans","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"Loved it","rating":10,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"I came across this movie last night and I loved it.
