[{"title":"A captivating crime thriller with enuff tension n suspense. Devgan was terrific n so were the dialogues.","rating":9,"date":"20 March 2018","review":"Saw this in a theatre. The plot is about an honest n brave income tax officer who conducts a raid at a very powerful man's house. As a fan of Devgan, i went to see this without watching the trailer or reading any reviews.\nIt is a very mesmerizing film with solid tension n suspense throughout. Apart from awesome acting by Devgan n Shukla, the best part was the editing. U dont feel bore for even a sec. The climax reminded me of a zombie film where hordes of angry mob have surrounded people who are inside a house n anytime the mob can barge into. The background song during the climax was good too n so was the mild twist.\nTwo things bothered me, first the romantic song n second, during the end scene it takes the mob a helluva time to break n barge into the room even after the door being wooden n glass one whereas.......\nStill i loved the film n Devgan was terrific. His HMT watch was awesome.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[41,44]},{"title":"stars sometime not the benchmark","rating":9,"date":"16 March 2018","review":"It's not a masala movie...\nit's not for those who take advantage of corruption...\n\"RAID\" real life events...\nand superb acting by all actors...specially ajay devgn, saurabh sukla and mother of Saurabh sukla.\nGreat filmography Bodhaditya Banerjee...\nSong \"Jhuk Na Paunga...\"\nmy rating 4*","user":"nitaixp","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"Much needed film","rating":8,"date":"8 June 2018","review":"Very good content explaining, on &amp; around rules of an actuall Raid.\nAs it shows how a TAX fraud tries to protect his family wealth Obscenely..!","user":"legionwings","rank":[5,5]}]
