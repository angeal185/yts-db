[{"title":"Unjustly shadowed by Hendrix","rating":8,"date":"19 June 2005","review":"During the Monterey Festival, D.A. Pennebaker shot the whole festival, and then released 2 special films focusing on 2 artists, one is Jimi Hendrix (which I've also reviewed) and the other is Otis Rettig. Let me just pause here and say I knew NOTHING about Otis when I watched this (he wrote Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay, right?) and while I STILL don't know much about him, I sure got to see him perform! It's interesting to see that this film by Pennebaker gets higher ratings by the people who have seen it, and I agree, because this guy puts on a SHOW that even I was amazed by. Full of great soul numbers and surprise inclusions (Satisfaction and Respect get great covers) the man doesn't care if it's pouring rain out (which it was) or if it was 1:00a (ditto) all his energy went into this performance, and it truly is a sight to behold.","user":"Spuzzlightyear","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"Electrifying Concert Footage of the \"Big O\" at Monterey Pop Festival","rating":10,"date":"15 May 2000","review":"Otis Redding was one of the titanic figures in rock/soul music history...this video should be required viewing for ALL fans of music, if for no other reason but to see what we lost so long ago.  Redding took what soul artists were calling \"Whitey's Festival\" and made it HIS showcase, despite getting the worst spot on the bill.  Again, a \"must see\" for any music history fan.","user":"Popeye-8","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Shake and Respect will give you Satisfaction","rating":8,"date":"14 March 2019","review":"This short film is only nineteen minutes long, but if you stand up and try to match Otis Redding move for move, it will wear you out. This was Redding's first major appearance before a predominantly white crowd and it made him an overnight success. Backed by Booker T. and the MGs and the Mar-Keys, Otis puts on a dazzling display of energy and showmanship, putting his all into songs like 'Shake', 'Respect' and the Rolling Stones' first major hit, 'Satisfaction'. His attempt to slow things down a bit with 'Try a Little Tenderness' eventually results in the same manic energy as the rest of his act. Filmed in 1967 at the famous Monterey Pop Festival, this companion piece to the movie of the same name wasn't released until 1987, along with \"Jimi Plays Monterey\", a somewhat longer set featuring Jimi Hendrix and his Experience. Both are worthwhile to seek out on their own merit, and in some respects, might be even better than the longer film. It would have been cool to hear Otis sing the major hit he wrote, \"Dock of the Bay\", but unfortunately, he didn't record it until December of that same year, 1967, only three days before his untimely and tragic death. Just think what might have been.","user":"classicsoncall","rank":[0,1]}]
