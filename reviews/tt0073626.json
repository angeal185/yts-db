[{"title":"A nice change of pace","rating":27,"date":"27 December 2002","review":"I may be cynical, but sometimes I look at my collection and see 50 copies of the same movie.  Explosions, love interest, conservative \"twist\" ending, cut!  Revolver may be just as derivative of 1970's flicks as the explosion fests of the 21st century are today, but for some reason it was refreshing to watch.  I can't see anyone lavishing \"rabid fanboy\" praise on it, but Revolver was enjoyable, moving at times, and had two great performances. If you thirst for a change of pace, but want to retain the comfortable action standbys of guns and violence, Revolver may be right up your alley.  The fantastic extras don't hurt either.<br><br>I've never seen a movie quite like this.  The best descriptor I can muster is \"spaghetti thriller\". It's a seventies crime drama with a bit of Dirty Harry, a helping of Reservoir Dogs,  a few drops of eau de western, a scoop of melodrama, and a dash of political commentary.  Though it oscillates between boredom and epic, Revolver delivers the kind of entertainment that today's movies can only parody.  If you buy into the characters, you'll be treated to a satisfying drama.  If modern sensibilities prevent that, you can at least enjoy the campier aspects (bad lip synch, fur coats) and delight in the commanding score.  The score alone is worth it.","user":"Rob_Lineberger","rank":[29,31]},{"title":"Nice Italian crime flick with ingenious plot that contains surprises , turns , tension and , a suspenseful ending","rating":6,"date":"22 April 2016","review":"¨Revolver¨ is an entertaining and thrilling Poliziotteschi , it was retitled \"Blood in the Streets\" for its American theatrical release . It is an interesting drama/thriller plenty of thrills , taut , intrigue and twists . The picture deals with a prison warden (Oliver Reed who regularly turned-up to the set inebriated) and a small-time crook (Fabio Testi) who is a prisoner at a state penitentiary . As the Italian warden's wife (Agostina Belli) is abducted , and the kidnappers demand that an inmate be released in order for the man to get his wife back . He gets the convict released but then abducts him himself , in order to ensure that the man's compatriots don't murder his spouse . Then , the band sets out to free their colleague and kill the official who took him . At the end it takes place the last battle between crime and the law in the major city in the world : Paris .<br><br>This is an exciting but complex thriller plenty of emotion , noisy action , car crashes , pursuits , twists and turns . Some actors claim they made his own stunts , as Fabio Testi told that he did nearly all the stunts in the movie himself, including a difficult roof jumping stunt in Milan that the stuntman was unable to do . Very good acting by Oliver Reed as an enraged warden ; however , there had problems because of his alcoholism , as he become difficult to work with . In fact , co-star Fabio Testi also expressed that it was both exciting and difficult to work with Reed due to his alcoholism, and he would become violent on the set on many occasions . Support cast is frankly good , full of European familiar faces such as Frédéric de Pasquale , Marc Mazza , Reinhard Kolldehoff , Bernard Giraudeau , Peter Berling and Salvatore Borghese . Furthermore , two gorgeous Eurotrash actresses : Agostina Belli and Paola Pitagora . Colorful cinematography by Aldo Scavarda , though a perfect remastering being necessary . Special mention for the sensitive and enjoyable musical score composed and arranged by maestro Ennio Morricone ; including a marvelous song : Un Ami Written by Ennio Morricone and Performed by Daniel Beretta .<br><br>The motion picture was compellingly directed by recently deceased Sergio Sollima , he even choreographed the fight scenes himself because he wanted each character to have a fighting style tailored to their personality . Sergio Sollima's direction is well crafted, here he's less cynical and more inclined toward violence and too much action . Sergio wrote and directed all kinds of genres such as Pirate films as ¨ Sandokan ¨ and the ¨ Black Corsario ¨ ; Peplum : ¨Rocha¨ , \"Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators\" , \"Triumph of the Ten Gladiators\" , ¨Ursus¨ \"Goliath Against the Giants\" ; Euro-spy : \"Requiem for a Secret Agent\" , \"Agent 3S3: Hunter from the Unknown\" , ¨Tanger 67¨ ; being especially known for his ¨Cuchillo trilogy¨ : ¨Run Cuchillo run¨, ¨Face to Face¨ , ¨The big Gundown¨. And this ¨Revolver¨ is essential and indispensable watching for Oliver Reed fans . This is a satisfyingly violent and thrilling flick that avid fans of the genre will love .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Italian Action from the 70s- lovin' it","rating":13,"date":"13 July 2004","review":"If you are a fan of Sergio Sollima then I don't have to tell you that you will enjoy this film. I am so glad that I have discovered Italian action films from the 1960s and 1970s. I only wish that I could see some of these films on the big screen. There is something special about these films. <br><br>Revolver takes the viewer on a sort of chase. There is elements of mystery and action, but during the course of the film the relationship between the two<br><br>characters, played by Oliver Reed and Fabio Testi, evolves in a way that brings in drama into the story. Like Sollima's other films,  there is fast paced action, violence, and a little bit of sex. <br><br>There is a gray area between who is good and bad, and that is something<br><br>Sollima has stated in interviews. In fact he has said that he has always been a fan of bad guys because sometimes the good guys mess things up more in the<br><br>end then the bad guys. He shows that in Revolver.","user":"ericdetrick2002","rank":[12,17]}]
