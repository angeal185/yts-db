[{"title":"A gentle and heartwarming comedy.","rating":7,"date":"11 March 2018","review":"This is one of those community spirited films in the manner of The Full Monty, and the Ealing comedies, that British film makers often do (but don't always do particularly well). \nA fairly formulaic plot of 'let's get the old gang back together for the one last tilt at the establishment' is brought to life by some good acting and some very likable, and in some cases eccentric characters. \nIt's not full of belly laughs, but you can't help but have a smile on your face much of the time. \nStephen Graham, Julian Sands, Steve Furst and Jill Halfpenny all turn in great performances (Jill Halfpenny in particular), and there's some lovely Yorkshire scenery to enjoy.","user":"acunnington-49732","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"Good fun if you look back at Panto style 80's British wrestling with fondness","rating":9,"date":"22 August 2018","review":"I can't understand the bad reviews for this movie, as its as good as most other lower budget British under dog comedy's in my opinion. <br><br>If you remember the family fun Panto style 80's British wrestling with fondness, you will probably enjoy this movie and better understand some of the jokes (otherwise you may not get it). <br><br>This movie itself has a pantomime stye villain and other over the top characters (particularly Julian Sands as sweet cheeks) with a lot of over acting but when watching, you just need to accept this is the format of the film.","user":"davidstevenhall","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Crawl like a Panther.","rating":3,"date":"14 March 2018","review":"Hard to believe with all the household names here,they could make such a duff film.I never laughed once but was annoyed a lot at how purile and immature the characters were.This would have been bad in the 80's.In 2018 its a dam right insult.At near 2 hours long the pace drags as you wait for some comedy or special moment that never happens.","user":"meshborg68","rank":[6,14]}]
