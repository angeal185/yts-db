[{"title":"too cute to be bad","rating":9,"date":"3 March 2007","review":"This movie is absolutely adorable. Having seen it many times throughout the years, each time I find more fun and silliness in it. The silly and animated acting reminds me somewhat of \"Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken\", another great adventure film. It is not meant to be a \"romance movie\" as it is too ridiculous, but more an adventure, with breathtaking scenery. Peter Fonda's part of a 35 year old or so gambler, never does anything to abuse or hurt Wanda, \"Brooke Shields\" who is coming of age and wants to see the world and be a star. He is very respectful of her and respects her younger age. The only one who really announces his desire to \"have her\" is the sidekick of the bad guys, who ends up dead hanging on a cross. Bo and Wanda both are looking for the \"Pot O Gold\" in their lives, and happen to partner up. She brings out the good luck charm and they end up happy together, yeah, so there is a slight difference in age, there is no sex or nastiness in the movie. The so called \"bad acting\" that some people mention is their hamming it up to add to the script. I think they are having a great time with it, and those of you that think it's so bad, lighten up and have a laugh. Maybe you'll enjoy life more.","user":"iponigirl","rank":[29,32]},{"title":"A fantasy masterpiece","rating":7,"date":"12 November 2005","review":"For some strange reason, the odd couple consisting of Peter Fonda and Brooke Shield works in this movie. The movie plot is basically a fantasy and you shouldn't try to see it as a western or a drama. Both of them somehow wind up being partners in a gold prospecting trip inside the Grand Canyon. Brooke Shields is portrayed in her usual role as a much more mature than her natural age girl, who's an even match to the older prospector played by Peter Fonda. The comical part is the way she tries to sell herself as an adult to Fonda, and eventually Fonda takes her in as his partner. The plot may not work for mature audiences in this country, but in other parts of the world, such genre exists as fantasy/adventure and might be getting high marks. I give two thumbs up for Brooke Shields and Peter Fonda.","user":"ebiros2","rank":[26,30]},{"title":"I was 15 when I first saw it... *spoilers*? not sure, so just to be safe...","rating":20,"date":"20 December 2006","review":"And I loved it! It's very hammy as the previous poster noted, but that is part of its simple charm. I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for it - and yes, the scenery is gorgeous! I can agree to one extent about the age difference, but having been a young gal who always had crushes on older fellows, I don't see anything seriously wrong with this one. I see nothing serious happening in it, just hints and in 1979 that was just \"kinda\" creepy.<br><br>I saw this before there was much internet and surely no IMDb -- so finding Henry Fonda's name in the credits (Yep, used to read those) was quite the thrill! Luckily it was on cable and I got to watch again and watch Hank more closely - what a gem.<br><br>Sweet movie, simple fun, no big heavy stuff to deal with. I also enjoyed the time it was set in. :)","user":"pinmv","rank":[12,13]}]
