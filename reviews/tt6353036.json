[{"title":"Excellent thriller","rating":9,"date":"16 January 2019","review":"I must say it was much better than I excepted, as it was a totally unknown or marketed film so far. Josh Lucas was a very convincing villain. Definite must see. Besides \"Vice\" I would say this is the best film I have seen in a long time.<br><br>This is based on a true story which makes it even scarier. I am looking forward to the upcoming festival screening.","user":"gmorten-33943","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Interesting film based on a true story","rating":7,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"Is it possible to hypnotise someone to rob a bank? And can the hypnotist be judged for the crime? THE GUARDIAN ANGEL is based on a unique true story and that makes the film itself unchartable. The fine actors and the historical setting worked for us and we kept on discussing the thrilling plot.","user":"ulrik-69854","rank":[4,6]}]
