[{"title":"It's okay","rating":5,"date":"25 October 2019","review":"Straightforward simplistic story with the standard (dog movie) flow. Sometimes funny. Sometimes forced funny. The movie could have been shorter. And I personally thought the dance of the squirrels was awkward because it made me think of Michael Jackson... while watching a movie for children... But all in all okay. I think most children will enjoy it.","user":"anna_regenboog","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Don't be fooled","rating":7,"date":"31 August 2019","review":"Simple story line, straight forward emotions and a sneaky musical style make this a hit with my 7 year old! The rest doesn't matter really as long as the children enjoyed. And this is how u I have this film 7 stars.","user":"aminekh1","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"Kid liked it","rating":5,"date":"26 January 2020","review":"It is a movie about a rich lady that offers her inheritance to the nephew who also needs to take care of her beloved dog.\nThe dog gets lost and has to adapt to the real street life in search for home.
