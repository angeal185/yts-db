[{"title":"Excellent dark pirate adventure/comedy","rating":8,"date":"12 February 2003","review":"Pirate movies are few and far between.  Its hard to get people to buy off on a script containing ~40 minutes of \"Arrrr\" and \"Aye Matie\".<br><br>\nHowever, Pirates is just a great fun romp through being a nasty, dirty, pirate.  This is one of Walter Matthau's best roles.  He literally becomes Captain Red.  At no moment do you associate this man w/ any of this other roles.<br><br>Too many jokes and gags to list, but not a comedy in the traditional sense. It is an adventure first with humor thrown in.<br><br>Less of a comedy and more adventure than Yellowbeard.  Darker, deeper, better, and less glitzy than Cutthroat Island.  All around, a great classic pirate movie and virtually defines the genre.","user":"iqof20","rank":[44,50]},{"title":"Walter Matthau's Captain Red leaves a lasting impression","rating":24,"date":"24 June 2003","review":"Roman Polanski's Pirates, starring Walter Matthau as the avaricious Captain Red, is an absolutely hilarious comedy/adventure.  The cast of characters is varied and interesting and the sets appear very authentic.  The movie contains excellent dialogue, good swashbuckling choreography and plenty of physical humour which borders on the bawdy at times.  The story is simple and dynamic and is completely driven by the characters.<br><br>I like this movie for its characters.  Each one's desires become the focus of fanatical efforts.  Throw in some fascinating (though often exaggerated) character quirks, and the cast makes this movie.  The rough, oafish Captain Red desires gold.  The handsome, quiet Frog desires Dolores.  The stiff, foppish Don Alfonso desires power.  In the end, who will get what he desires?  Most assuredly not EVERYONE.<br><br>I only have ONE favorite movie and this is it.  I know it is not for everyone (my wife hates it).  However, for Matthau fans, or fans of the historical genre, this movie is a fun night out with plenty of laughs.  I recommend it strongly.","user":"Zack_Hobson","rank":[28,33]},{"title":"Apparently savaged, for inexplicable reasons, by critics who should know better","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2005","review":"This enjoyably foolish romp was apparently a flop, and mauled by the critics. Why? Good question. I speculate three reasons: lack of an obviously American lead and presence, an opening set-up that pays off in the long run but doesn't provide a beginning with a bang, and an anarchic, politically incorrect, almost amoral tone that was not digestible to Disneyfied mainstream audiences. These, and the length of the piece, would have been strengths if this had been released as a children's book, and I further speculate that it would have been well received in such a format, as a homage to old stories like Treasure Island. It could then have been adapted into a hit movie (with more explosions and an ethically impeccable American hero who does get the girl in the end).<br><br>As it is, there is much to admire, delight and entertain, with legitimate criticisms being some of the dodgy casting and (lack of)linguistics (especially as regards the Spanish characters) - Walther Matthau's gloriously over-the-top performance honourably excepted - some lapses of logic in the plot (why doesn't the Frog just swim after the rowboat and bring it back when they get stuck on the chain?), and the fact that it is slightly too long.<br><br>Ripe for a sequel, if, like me, you ever wondered what happened to Cap'n Red and his beloved throne, and The Frog and his beloved Dolores.","user":"ephraimwaite","rank":[29,36]}]
