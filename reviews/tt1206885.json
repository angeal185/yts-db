[{"title":"If you're a John Rambo fan you'll love it","rating":10,"date":"20 September 2019","review":"Sylvester Stallone, a thin plot, the Mexican Cartel, lots of inventive ways to make enemies dead, it's an absolute cracker. Don't listen to critics who are for some reason looking for something different from a Rambo movie. This is Rambo for Rambo fans.","user":"kobrasec","rank":[944,1]},{"title":"Last Blood","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"Dark, brutal, graphic and extreme are some of the words I would use to sum this movie up. Pretty standard story but it does take us to some unexpected dark places. Sly does what he does best in a strong, silent brooding role. The big winner here is the action. As we come to expect the final climatic battle is very violent and graphic but executed very very well.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[54,64]},{"title":"Stallone Has Truly Done It Again","rating":9,"date":"18 September 2019","review":"Rating 9.0/10\nTruly amazing Rambo Last Blood. Sylvester Stallone is a very talented actor. No one could ever touch the character of John Rambo the way he did. I wish after he come out of retirement can remind the new generation what he have done. Rambo Last Blood is a grounded drama and action must see. To all of you, go see it a bloody good time !!","user":"ymyuseda","rank":[667,878]}]
