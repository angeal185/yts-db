[{"title":"This guy is awesome","rating":9,"date":"27 October 2018","review":"If you want to watch something that will inspire you this documentary will certainly do it. You don't have to be a body builder fan to appreciate this mans story and the struggles he faces today. He always has a smile on his face no matter what and his story will move you. If you didn't know who Ronnie was 15 years ago you will certainly become a fan of his now. Great documentary and worth watching. Ronnie you're an awesome human being...","user":"brett-76260","rank":[24,25]},{"title":"Very Inspiring","rating":9,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"I have been a gym rat for almost 20 years and I know of Ronnie Coleman. I always knew that he was a beast on the circuit and a legend in the bodybuilding world. However, I did not think that this movie would show you the man that was Ronnie Coleman.\nYou can check my reviews and I am normally very critical, but this film really reached me. I highly recommend it. Ronnie Coleman is a great man. This documentary showed that, his will, and problems after competing.","user":"bryan_becze","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Genuine, humble, hero","rating":10,"date":"25 November 2018","review":"Wow, I had tears in my eyes admiring this amazing man!
