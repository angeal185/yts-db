[{"title":"All the potential with no substance.","rating":4,"date":"8 May 2019","review":"I want to start by stating that the music by Wynton Marsalis is really well researched and played. The costumes were also very well crafted, and true to the period. The acting was suitable, even though the actors said next to nothing.<br><br>In one of the opening scenes, the audience sees Buddy get thrown out of a hot air balloon, and parachute to the ground while playing his cornet to a cheering audience. I thought, wow this is going to be a creative and fun take on his life. Yeah, I was wrong. That was the best thing in the whole movie.<br><br>As far as the story, it goes in a couple of different directions. Time jumps around from Buddy's life as a child, as a budding talent, and his final years in a turn of the century institution. The story is shown in Buddy Bolden's disordered flashbacks of his life.<br><br>Buddy Bolden's character is an enigma, and the supporting characters are underdeveloped. It's like shaking your keys at a baby to keep them from crying. The writer was hoping the audience is so distracted by all the nudity and violence, they won't care that there isn't a story<br><br>There were lots of interesting settings, but nothing happens. Any detail about Bolden's relationships with his many partners are just lust filled scenes of lust. I thought for a second that this thing should be on skin-a-max, probably will be.<br><br>The movie was a long time in the making, a total of eleven years. Multiple reshoots, and at one point got an entirely new cast.<br><br>All and all, they spent a lot of money on a dud.","user":"tonyulesich","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"Confusing","rating":3,"date":"3 May 2019","review":"I knew nothing about Buddy Bolden before seeing this film and after seeing it I know even less. This film is put together like a two hour trailer, the scenes jump around in time and never seem to build to a satisfying emotional conclusion. There are individual shots that promise something interesting, but never seem to finish. Even the jazz numbers which are well arranged by Wynton Marsalis, do not get to finish. And most music varies in fidelity and we move thru time and space.<br><br>The period details are perfect as is the music, sounding like it's played on period instruments. The performances are believable especially Gary Carr as Buddy Bolden who presents a broad range of emotions. He can be exhibiting a youthful energy exploring the nascent possibilities of jazz, or suffering trough rough parts of his life. The most familiar face in the cast is Ian McShane, but his charter is presented in such a choppy way, I have no idea who his character was or how he figured in Bolden's life.<br><br>I saw this at a special screening with the writer director Dan Pritzker in attendance, and he acknowledged that no recording of Bolden exists and so little is known about Bolden that he has no idea if he invented jazz or not, he just thought it was a good tag line.","user":"segaltoons","rank":[14,22]},{"title":"Style Over Substance","rating":8,"date":"24 December 2019","review":"The story could have been told more clearly. I understand that they were trying to mirror the flashbacks of an insane genius, but it would have worked just fine if the story had a little more order and clarity. I honestly figured from the trailer that the storytelling might have been off, but I was so drawn in by the music and the overall look of the movie that I still just had to see it. Despite some major drawbacks in plot, I do not regret watching it at all. The music! That's what I came for. The actor playing Bolden wasn't half bad to look at either. The actor playing his manager (who also had a significant role on Boardwalk Empire) has a look that seems to fit that time period so well. He is fun to watch on screen. Not much to the plot, but the look and sound (the sound!!!) of this film definitely worth the watch. If you like jazz or if you don't, watch it for the music. Now that I've finished I can do some of my own research into Buddy Bolden who seems like a fascinating enigma.","user":"allisonstarrh","rank":[3,4]}]
