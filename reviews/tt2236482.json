[{"title":"A bug documentary","rating":7,"date":"12 March 2017","review":"The last word in the title is gross and describes some parts of this documentary. But most of it has and shows information you probably didn't know - like how they survive and why their very existence is so important to us. (you might find that pretty surprising at the end) It's a nice break for a change from the science fiction, horror and love stories we usually watch.","user":"dttgrfanever","rank":[0,0]}]
