Not a Christmas romance like most of the new Christmas films that are released. Very funny and humble at times. Clever story line. Barbara Eden graces the film as Mrs. Claus! She was great!!","user":"thewave-67015","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"So cute","rating":10,"date":"3 April 2020","review":"Denise Richards is wonderful. Patrick Muldoon and she have great chemistry while Barbara Eden as Mrs. Clause is the cherry on top!","user":"Tjwuphill","rank":[0,1]}]
