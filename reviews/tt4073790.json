[{"title":"When I was 12 years old I would have loved this movie...","rating":9,"date":"18 August 2018","review":"...now I'm 45 and guess what?\nFrom ET and The Gonnies to Harry Potter and Stranger Things I've enjoyed this genre of Sci-Fi/fantasy TV and movies. Nothing warms my heart more than the riteouus innocence of youth vs the cruelty and bitterness of \"grown ups\". Likely another serial, in the same vein of Hunger Games or Maze Runner but hey, why not? Sure give this a score of 5 if you want then complain it's not original enough or the acting isn't worthy of an Oscar! -or- Like me, smile and be thankful that someone's still making movies like this, movies that remind us of what it's like to be a kid. A kid, who dreams of special powers and a future were we get to be boss for a change! It's far too easy to pour scorn and cynicism here but I don't see you detractors doing any better. It's a solid 9 out of10 for me. Keep up the good work.","user":"mattcurtis-50459","rank":[246,312]},{"title":"Entertaining movie","rating":7,"date":"3 October 2018","review":"After reading some of the 1 star reviews I began to wonder if we were watching the same movie or if they even watched this movie at all. The movie does have a plot, decent cinematography and the acting is decent. I did not read the book but I enjoyed this movie although I wasn't the target audience. Judge it for yourself and don't allow others to guide your opinion either way.","user":"mtjohnson-18549","rank":[189,241]},{"title":"It was fine","rating":7,"date":"13 August 2018","review":"I think they did a pretty good job. Sure it wasn't revolutionary good or didn't show anything we haven't seen but it was good on it's own. And They made me want more.","user":"zeynepsertyel-728-391628","rank":[64,83]}]
