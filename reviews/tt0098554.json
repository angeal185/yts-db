[{"title":"Here's a quarter. Go downtown, and have a rat gnaw that thing off your face.","rating":11,"date":"11 February 2004","review":"Candy's best performance ever.  As hard as it is to pick a favorite role that John Candy ever portrayed, I'd have to say it was Uncle Buck. Although this wasn't the only title he and Culkin ever shared, it was the only film the two ever shared any time on screen together.<br><br>Basic plot:  Candy's sister-in-law's father has just had a heart attack in the middle of the night and the two parents rush trying to find someone to watch the kids for them while they hop the next flight to go see her father. In a desperate last resort, they call the husband's brother.  Buck.  Of course, the concerned uncle comes to the rescue and takes the task with no complaint. However, the oldest of the children doesn't care for her bumbling uncle, and the discipline and protection he places upon her, while her parents are away.<br><br>A great heart-warming comedy that will make you laugh and possibly even cry at times.  A classic, and certainly a triumph that wouldn't have happened without John Candy.  Hollywood truly lost a great actor.<br><br>I give this movie a 9 out of 10.  One of the funniest and most wonderful stories, but not my favorite.<br><br>And that's my review.","user":"Pookyiscute","rank":[94,100]},{"title":"Uncomplicated simple and pleasant","rating":8,"date":"27 December 2004","review":"I gave this an '8', which is one or two more points than it really should get, but the simple fact is - I enjoy watching it over and over. John Candy shines as Uncle Buck. He brings the character alive and you can't help but wish you had a crazy guy like that as an uncle.<br><br>Well, maybe a distant uncle, but still he's warm, lovable and helpless in so many ways. As one would expect, the story is simple, the scenes mostly predictable (except maybe the ax-murder scene?) and of course there's a happy ending.<br><br>The little kids, Maisy and Miles, played by Gaby Hoffman and a slightly younger Macaulay Culkin, are simply adorable! The teenage daughter (Jean Louisa Kelly) perfectly portrays a teenage girl in the throws of that classic imbalance between childhood and adulthood.<br><br>Anyway - no one dies. No one loses an eye or an arm. No houses burn down. There are no explosions, no fighter jet scenes, no wild car chases - just plain old silly fun.<br><br>Go watch it. This is not a request! Uncle Buck says watch it!","user":"johnrp-1","rank":[74,80]},{"title":"THIS MOVIE CHANGED MY LIFE","rating":4,"date":"4 September 2003","review":"This movie changed my life...literally.  My friend had seen a local community article on a girl in our hometown newspaper.  He thought she was attractive and looked up her Dad's name (listed in the article) in the phonebook.  He then proceeded to call her and make small talk.  I don't know how he ever convinced her that calling up people you see in the paper is a normal situation.....but anyway he did .....and she agreed to go out on a date but only on a double date.  He then invited me along on this crazy escapade on the condition that she would bring a friend as well.  The double date was set and we all agreed by phone to  see a little movie called Uncle Buck.  By the way...all this happened when I was about 15 (Uncle Buck was released in '89}.  Anyhow, my friend met his newspaper girl....and I met my future wife.  I can still remember being nervous sitting next to her and watching John Candy driving that blowed-up car and hearing Tone Loc's music blaring from the theater speakers.  And to Amanda, Trust me, If I'd known What I Know Today, I'd Have Taken A Sip Of The Mountain Dew.  Hee Hee.","user":"usiii","rank":[31,33]}]
