[{"title":"Why are you threatened?","rating":9,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"I cannot understand why a certain population finds documentaries like this so freaking threatening??? It's like they feel victimized. The facts are simple the earth cannot sustain man's hunger for meat so things will be changing. This documentary gives you a glimpse of what our future may look like as we shift to a plant-based diet. More so it gives you a look at many present trends as this shift is already underway, as well as the technologies that will play a role in this transition.<br><br>Like global warming (AKA climate change) this is reality not fanaticisms ... so please open your eyes and try and keep up. Economics dictates that almost all of us will need to change our diet ... meat as we know it today will be a thing of the past. This is evolution ... change comes whether you like it or not. Watch this and you will see where we as a species may be going as we approach a population of 10,000,000,000.<br><br>POST: For those who like fact ... this doc has nothing to do with AOC.<br><br>POST: Those parts about animal justice ... that was getting pretty silly!","user":"chrissso","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"Thought provoking","rating":8,"date":"22 July 2019","review":"Interesting documentary, providing good information for why we can't continue consuming meat and dairy.","user":"mikalrkayn","rank":[5,10]},{"title":"More vegan lunacy!","rating":1,"date":"22 June 2019","review":"Agenda driven, I'll be polite and not say it's loaded with lies, but say \"misinformation\", instead.<br><br>I've watched several of this type of \"documentary\" lately, and they would be alright if presented just as an alternate lifestyle, but they're meant to change everyone's eating preference to be like theirs.<br><br>Our teeth are \"omnivore\" ie we eat everything lol, not grass grazers.\nAlso, if meat was so bad, why do vegans so often make their food imitate the taste of meat?!<br><br>Ultimately, the same vegan fanaticism, you won't learn anything new with this one.","user":"rsvp321","rank":[16,47]}]
