[{"title":"cringe worthy","rating":1,"date":"27 March 2019","review":"I was excited because it was filmed in my home town perth {at least partly} but 10 minutes in simone kessel was doing a bad katey sagall impersonation. it reminded me of so many kiwi gangster movies very unrealistic.","user":"darryljonparker","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Boring and predictable","rating":2,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"It's like an Australian Sons of Anarchy, with the fun, wit and quality scriptwriting sucked out it and replaced with various dirty looking meatheads grunting at each other. Every character sticks to the stereotype and the ending is the predictable \"crime doesn't pay\", even though most of the movie is trying to present the opposite.","user":"justinwilson81","rank":[16,30]},{"title":"They broke the code","rating":2,"date":"3 February 2019","review":"This is an Australian biker film. Mark, saves his dimwitted brother Adam and strikes a deal to launder his gang's dirty money with a rival gang. The problem is Mark is not in charge of the Copperheads. Knuck, who is in prison and soon to be released, is in charge. When he gets out, he undoes all the goodwill and plans that Mark has made, leading to internal conflict.<br><br>The bikers had a club where the pole dancers kept their clothes on and we never see them sell drugs or do anything to generate dirty money. Knuck is bisexual which didn't add anything to the film. PLOT SPOILER: Abbey Lee is the final girl. Weak plot.<br><br>Guide: F-word, sex, partial nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[10,17]}]
