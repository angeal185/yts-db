[{"title":"Brilliant story of friendship, and a journey into madness","rating":9,"date":"21 March 2001","review":"Birdy is a difficult film to describe. It's about the developing friendship between Al (Nick Cage) and Birdy (Matthew Modine), but it's also about a descent into madness, and the lengths to which Al goes for his friend.<br><br>The film starts in the late 60's, in a US military mental hospital. Cage has been seriously wounded, and has had reconstructive surgery on his face, but he's been brought in because Birdy is here. He's uncommunicative and appears to recognise no one, spending all day squatting on the floor of his cell squinting up at the window.<br><br>The story is mostly told in flashbacks, either Al recounting incidents in their growing friendship as neighbourhood kids or, later, Birdy remembering other incidents. From the start the two are pretty dissimilar - Al is athletic, outgoing and popular while Birdy is quiet and introverted - a typical nerd. The two are, paradoxically, brought together by Birdy's love of birds, and the stupid things they do - making suits out of pigeon feathers to befriend more pigeons, climbing on (and falling off) factories trying to capture more birds.<br><br>Al tries to set Birdy on a 'normal' track; they buy a wrecked car and fix it up, and head off to the beach. But Birdy is just too wrapped up in himself for this to work, and it's a wonder he doesn't alienate Al with his strange behaviour.<br><br>In the 'present', the doctor is putting more pressure on Al to get Birdy to respond; if he doesn't, then Birdy will be written off and sent to a permanent mental institution. The flashbacks continue, and it becomes clear that Birdy's love of birds has turned into an obsession, and then into the darker realms beyond that.<br><br>The final few minutes of the film cover a lot of ground; Al finally realises that Birdy is pretty well off the deep end; they both go off to fight in the war; Al gets his injury, while we see the incident that left Birdy in his present state. Meanwhile the doctor finally decides that time has run out, but Al decides he's not leaving.<br><br>The ending of the film is incredibly powerful, and it should be a criminal offence to give it away. Is it 'appropriate' to the rest of the film? I dunno - but I thought it was pretty damn good.<br><br>The film stands or falls on the performances of Cage and Modine - and, for me, it stands tall. Cage is excellent in his role, capturing the bravado of his character perfectly; but Modine is simply brilliant. During the flashbacks he portrays his nerdy character completely believably, but it's the way he handles the scenes in the asylum that amazed me. As soon as you know his obsession, it is crystal clear that he's not squatting in his cell, but perching, wishing to fly.<br><br>Alan Parker has made some great films; this might just be his best.","user":"Megabuck","rank":[46,50]},{"title":"Flying Away From Society (a kind of long synopsis of Birdy's themes)","rating":9,"date":"9 July 2001","review":"Note: this is best read *after* having seen Birdy, as it contains some general spoilers.<br><br>`As scary as a bird's life may be, they always have that.  They can fly away.'-Birdy.<br><br>To say that Birdy is a film about a young man obsessed with birds and flying is to oversimplify a great deal.  Birdy is an extraordinary film that deals with the longing to fly, and everything that such a yearning entails about a person.  It's about people who weren't meant to live in this world, this society, who don't belong, who don't fit in and don't really want to fit in.  It's about the overwhelming frustration of not having asked for any of `this', yet constantly being reminded that no matter how much one doesn't want to be a part of it all, just by being human there is no escape; the world will not let you do as you want, and one cannot fly away. In director Alan Parker's vision, these feelings that are so hard to put into words are articulately and beautifully expressed.<br><br>I'm not going to focus on plot details as much as on what Birdy is `about', but I will just say that Matthew Modine gives an incredible performance as Birdy.  At moments his greatest power simply comes from his eyes and facial expressions (especially in his scenes in the military asylum).  This is a perfect example of superb casting and an actor just disappearing into his role. Obviously the character of Birdy is central to understanding the film, and his fascination with birds and particularly their flight is his way of trying to deal with a cold, insensitive world while being a sensitive individual.  His growing obsession with his birds and disassociation with the outside world comes with his realization that he is alone and no one understands him, even Al (Nicholas Cage), his best and only friend.<br><br>Birdy doesn't care about the outside world, and his ideas of what is truly important and what freedom is couldn't be further from the society that tells him to be concerned with superficial things. He is pure to the highest extent in that he is not in the least tainted by the constant pressure the world places on him to fit in and be `normal'.  Al connects him to the outside world, and allows him to share some of his dreams to a certain degree, but Birdy more or less continues to live in his own little world.  And even though Birdy isn't disturbing anyone, it seems that just the little things that mean so much to him are what are constantly threatened to be taken away.  His own mom always threatens to get rid of his birds, and uses this to force Birdy to go to the prom, which he has no interest in. This serves as an example of a relatively trivial matter that is looked upon as some major event in every young person's life.  Here Birdy is  more or less being told 'fit in, or I'll take away the one thing that you have that truly matters to you'.  Similarly, all of Birdy and Al's chances of fun and freedom are taken away throughout the film--their car for example, the closest thing they have to being able to get up and take off. And they get into trouble when they haven't really done anything too bad, showing the ways the uptight, unreasonable society tries to force everyone into line.  How it sucks the life out of people is also shown, especially through adult characters like Birdy and Al's parents. While it's true that Birdy's parents just want better for him, they could never understand what would be better for him.  This idea of losing any sort of idealism and settling down is shown in Birdy and Al's father's jobs.  Birdy's dad is a janitor at his school and Al's is a garbage man.  I think I can honestly make a judgement that no one grows up dreaming of or even expecting to become one of the above jobs.  But time and time again the world crushes ideals and hopes and dreams and forces everyone into some kind of role.<br><br>Birdy and Al's going off to Vietnam is not only the ultimate example of being forced to do something one doesn't want--- of no escape and no choice--- but also shows the irony of war for people like Birdy, who doesn't want anything to do with this world anyway, and the anti-authoritarian Al. Supposedly they are fighting for freedom; yet is this really freedom for people who never even wanted to be part of this society in the first place? Freedom for the very society that crushes their souls and determines how they will live, to continue to exist? The film is brought to its climatic height in the scene that shows what sent Birdy over the edge.  As bombs explode and men die around him there is nothing he can do but sit and watch as all sorts of species of birds fly away from the horror.  Birdy is sent over the edge with this realization that he *can't* fly like a bird, he is not free and will never truly be on this earth, as a human being.<br><br>\nFinally, I guess at this point it's practically mandatory to comment on the much-debated ending.  I personally like it and happen to think its one of the funniest moments in film I've ever seen. But besides, it also fits into the context of the film.  Here we have a whimsical film about quirky people doing quirky things.  So why should a quirky ending suddenly be considered a cheap gag? Sure it's abrupt, but the entire film has been unconventional and has also had its share of  humorous moments. Furthermore, I've noticed a great deal of symmetry throughout Birdy, especially with the `jump/fly' scenes; where every time Birdy gets himself in trouble and it looks as though he's about to fall to his death, and Al gets all worried,  Birdy manages to be okay and land on his feet (sort of). If you watch closely, and also listen (to the music which seems  to signify these scenes) a lot more than you may have expected  will fall into place. I also just want to quickly mention how beautifully and poetically shot some of the scenes are (a great moment is when we fly from a bird's point of view).  Obviously,  a lot more can be said and be gotten out of Birdy, and I didn't use many specific examples because there are just too many to choose from, but here I just tried to best sum up what strikes me the most about this film.  Anyone who's ever felt absolutely out of place in this world and frustrated with being stuck on the ground here will almost certainly be able to make a connection with this film.","user":"-744","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"\"Birdy\" flies away into cinematic greatness","rating":8,"date":"4 August 2005","review":"(I was flipping through the channels one quiet evening at home when I stumbled across this picture, \"Birdy.\")<br><br>To some, the character Birdy (Matthew Modine) has an unnatural and (quite) unhealthy obsession with birds. Well, he spends most of his time with birds, has dreams of flying away from his real-world troubles, and his only friend is a neighborhood tough named Al (Nicolas Cage). So because of his obsession with birds, Birdy has to be crazy, right? So is Al even crazier for befriending him well, isn't he?<br><br>It is these questions and many more that make up the central theme of Alan Parker's superb 1984 drama \"Birdy\" (adapted from William Wharton's novel), a film about two crazy guys whose friendship is ultimately tested by each other's mental sicknesses. Both of their lives take drastic turns before and after they have done tours in Vietnam, and ultimately wind up in opposite ends of the psyche ward of a state mental hospital, with Al, who's been left virtually unrecognizable by his facial bandages and Birdy, who's stuck in a catatonic state as a result of an accident out on the killing fields.<br><br>It is also the feelings of isolation between the two that brings them together, as flashbacks during their stay help to emphasize their emotions. Birdy, feeling like he is the only one that understands his bird \"dream,\" may in actuality be the only \"sane\" character in the whole film. Al, who is injured from a shell explosion, questions who he is because he's not even sure who it really is underneath the bandages on his face. And it is liberation, whether it be physical or mental, that is expressed greatly by the film's ending, and Birdy's eventual coming to grips with his own current predicament.<br><br>Director Parker has always made it a point of capturing human suffering on celluloid, and this has been the main subject in a number of his films, including \"Midnight Express\" (1978) and \"Angel Heart\" (1987). Here, his subject matter is fairly lighter than those films, since the audience is spared the really intense mental anguish that accompanied \"Express\" and the graphic carnage of \"Angel.\"<br><br>There's a kind of deep spiritual undercurrent flowing through \"Birdy,\" which is most apparent by the lead character's fascination with his quarry  birds. To him, birds represent freedom, a kind of freedom that can only be obtained by literally taking to the skies, and soaring high above all his problems (fans of Terry Gilliam's political satire \"Brazil\" should take notice here). This of course leads to the film's profound ending on the mental hospital's rooftop, where Al and Birdy must make a desperate choice  choose freedom, or choose confinement  of the body, or of the psyche.<br><br>I won't reveal any more than those close details but you'll have to see what happens for yourself. It really caught me off guard and in a lesser movie might seem tacky, but the way Parker and the actors handle just makes the on-screen action that much more moving. But you can be sure of this: Birdy flies. And \"Birdy\" does fly into underrated classic movie status because of its performers and director Alan Parker's direction.<br><br>10/10","user":"dee.reid","rank":[24,27]}]
