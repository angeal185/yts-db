And I didn't ever know if the dialogue was written or not, that's the biggest compliment I could ever give to a film. So Watch it and have fun!","user":"sherlock-holm","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"It was just okay","rating":5,"date":"14 August 2019","review":"What I liked about this movie was the realness of the script. At some parts... it was a bit inappropriate, but that actually added to the movie I think. Also, the brothers seem to have a great relationship in real life and it shows on camera.<br><br>I was rooting for the older brother, since he was more mature and not as obnoxious. It was nice to see the brothers put their relationship before a girl. The moms boyfriend was a good addition to the script, since it showed the boys progression with their manners during the movie.<br><br>I don't know, I didn't hate this movie, but it wasn't great either.","user":"lanaxo","rank":[1,1]}]
