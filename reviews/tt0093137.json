[{"title":"Realism and Radicalism","rating":9,"date":"23 April 2001","review":"This is an excellent depiction of the insanity that was the war in Viet Nam. My view as a naval officer during a scenic tour of the Mekong near the Cambodian border and the Vietnamese city of Chau Phu, permitted me to be a witness to many, many occasions involving the wholesale abuse of humans by humans.  The strain on mind, body and soul takes years (if ever) to repair and this film captures it.  There are brief glimpses of this agony in some of the other films mentioned here in the reviews, e.g., Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and Platoon.  Each of these films have merit but are deeply flawed.  Apocalypse Now is steeped in moral allegory to the expense of an accurate portrayal of the war; Full Metal Jacket is only 2/3 completed; Platoon becomes a Levi-Straussian moral tale with an arch villain and virtuous hero-- the latter heinously slain by the former with revenge exacted by the weary sojourner on the odyssey.  OK.  What do we have here with Hamburger Hill?  A story? Heroic acts?  Action?  Not really.  What we have is the horror and insanity of war.  The film ends on the same pointless note as it began. But, you know what?  Reading through the detractors of this film who touted the other potential three and slammed this one, I would not hesitate to bet they were never there.  I could glance at the reviews and pick out the vets-- not just on the basis of whether they liked this film or not but of how they reacted to it.  I know and know damn well.  I too was there, brothers.  See this film.  It's well produced, directed and the cast is damn good.  Check it out.","user":"artzau","rank":[128,140]},{"title":"I was there. This film gets it right.","rating":10,"date":"24 July 1999","review":"I was an infantryman in the field in Vietnam.  There are only 2 Vietnam movies that are even close to real - this one and Apocalypse Now, and they are both as close as a movie can get.<br><br>Hamburger Hill gets it right in many ways, the banter among the grunts, the fatalism mixed with the desire to survive a vicious war, the emotional stress of seeing your fellow GI's become casualties.  The GI jargon used in the writing is the most authentic in any movie about that war.  But most of all it depicts the incredible, to me mystical, bravery which drives any man into terrible battle in any war, on any side.  This movie is an unpretentious marvel.<br><br>As for Apocalypse Now, it gets it right in a very different way. Everything in that movie actually happened in Vietnam, crazy as each scene may be to one who wasn't there.  Take it scene by scene.  Believe everything you see. (Except, of course, the whole Col. Kurtz - private army - assassination theme, which was out of the book about war in South Africa.  It made a great hook for this movie, but no U. S. Army senior officer ever went off the deep end like that.)","user":"SquirePM","rank":[116,128]},{"title":"One of the best about Vietnam","rating":10,"date":"22 September 1999","review":"Drawing from a good book by the same name concerning a real battle, the film chose to concentrate on a single unit of the 101st Airborne during this engagement instead of the strategies and tactics of the battle. Fictionalizing the characters we see the typical group of soldiers, some new, some veterans, some black, some white, some Hispanic, conduct assault after assault on a hill for some reason that they only have a vague concept of.  But instead of making the battle slick and interlaced with subplots about the possession of souls (such as \"Platoon\") or a work of art (such as \"Apocalypse Now\" or \"Full Metal Jacket\") the characters are real and the battle is believable.<br><br>Whether intentional or not, it is hard to identify individuals in this film. The viewer is aware that there are ethnic and class separations but identities are harder.  I believe that this was intentional to some extent by the director so that the impression could be made that this could be any unit and the soldiers could be anyone that you may know.  Like the faceless names on the Vietnam War monument during the opening of the film, these soldiers are essentially faceless forcing the viewer to place a face and personality that they are intimate with.  The real star of the movie is the battle and the tragedies that resulted.  As with the better, and more accurate war films, there are no heroics, just fear; there is no glorious flag waving over a captured fortification, just survivors.<br><br>Again, with the better war films it is the little stuff that separates the good ones from the \"cowboys and Indians in battle dress\" ilk: the radio operator calling in an artillery strike in panic and is reprimanded for not using proper radio protocol, the mud slide down the hill right in the middle of the battle, the officer trying to call for reinforcements and realizing that his radio was blown to bits along with his arm.  All of these \"touches\" are real and give credibility to a film.  In this case \"Hamburger Hill\" stands apart, and somewhat higher, than most films about the subject.","user":"DumaNV","rank":[47,52]}]
