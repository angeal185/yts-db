[{"title":"Laughable crap","rating":1,"date":"24 July 2019","review":"This so called horror movie is nothing but a couple of expired Hollywood actors who were thrown a few bucks to speak some of the most laughable dialogue I've ever heard. Poor Mike Madsen ... a very long fall from \"Reservoir Dogs\".\nThis movie was really painful to watch, and the plot is just plain sad.\nDon't waste your time on this one.","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[10,17]},{"title":"Michael Madsen becomes ur boyfriend, best friend, roomate, father, and ur local sheriff all at once","rating":7,"date":"28 July 2019","review":"Awesome lower budget indie horror film with great picture and sound brought to you by one of indie horror's classic greats, Tom Holland. Fast paced and innovative, filled with ideas and although its an over told story, there's plenty of creativity here because honestly an idea could be done to death but each director brings thier own flavor and spice so it makes each film unique. Rock, paper, scissors is complex, fun, twisty, and quite creepy. The acting is good and it's quite a bang for Holland who proves that after all these years he's still got it. Much better than one might think at first glance. The imdb rating of 4.6 is one of the few ratings on this site I actually disagree with. It should be rated somewhere between like 5.2 and 5.5","user":"TuesdayThe17th","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"Just another bad horror/comedy movie.","rating":1,"date":"5 August 2019","review":"It is a disaster, very bad acting, very bad camera scenes,very bad movie effects, very bad everything.\nThe voters are probably their friends and neighbors, because u canÂ´t vote more than 2 if u are person with the normal taste for movies.","user":"psxexperten","rank":[2,3]}]
