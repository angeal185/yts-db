[{"title":"Superb","rating":10,"date":"27 May 2019","review":"Excellent excellent excellent, this is a must see movie, on the scale of large budget Hollywood flicks, with a limited budget. It will move you, and remember based on true account and pictures.","user":"hawaiialin","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"Horrifying and gripping","rating":10,"date":"4 March 2019","review":"I don't understand some of the low scores and comments on it being unengaging and hard to empathise/connect with the characters.<br><br>I was gripped from the start and was with the characters all the way. It was horrifying and at points edge of your seat. I was also really struck by the end titles, which showed some of the original photographs that were eventually rescued from destruction. You could tell that a lot of research had gone into the film, to get the staging of these photographs right.<br><br>It's a story that I knew nothing about and I'm glad it's been told. Would definitely recommend this film.","user":"sallytyro","rank":[46,52]},{"title":"An extremely underrated film. A must watch.","rating":9,"date":"22 February 2019","review":"A film that brilliantly portays the true horrors\ncommitted by the Nazis and how the victims fought back. The filmography is quite elegant and so was the acting. The 6.5 rating(at the time of writing) is quite an understatement.","user":"amodsandeepa","rank":[64,83]}]
