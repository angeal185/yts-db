[{"title":"As a horror or monster movie fan you should give it a go !!","rating":8,"date":"21 September 2009","review":"Pig Hunt get's 8 out of 10 points from me. It has everything that should be in a horror movie, some weirdos (like the \"redneck family neighbors\" or the \"hippie community\") and some strong characters like Jason Foster who sometimes visually comes up like a sort of \"badass\" Aragorn ( by the way Travis Aaron Wade and Tina Huang as main char's did a great job, too). The story has multiple threats what makes it more interesting than other films in this genre, it contains enough suspense, horror and gore (great job on the special FX even the mutant pig) and good action too! As there are many horror movies simply duplicating old \"hits\" this one does not come up with really something new, but it has enough potential not to see it as a copy of the older genre stuff because of his mixture of horror and monster movie. As a real fan of this genre i spend a good time on that!","user":"broeoeh","rank":[20,32]},{"title":"Variety review from Dennis Harvey","rating":8,"date":"15 April 2009","review":"A mashup of elements from \"Razorback,\" \"Deliverance\" and other rural-peril faves, \"Pig Hunt\" proves an enjoyably offbeat hybrid horror exercise. Helmer Jim Isaac's first indie production, following several compromised studio efforts including sci-fi slasher \"Jason X,\" amplifies the quirkiness of Robert and Zach Anderson's screenplay by unpredictably mixing disparate pacing, tones, humor and brute action. Sum isn't entirely satisfying, and the current marketplace preference for formulaic scare pics won't help B.O. But fans tired of rote remakes and ripoffs will appreciate the pic's idiosyncrasy. It's currently playing limited theatrical gigs while in search of a wider distribution deal.<br><br>Four twentysomething buds, led by John (Travis Aaron Wade), leave San Francisco for a weekend of game hunting in rural Mendocino County, though the guys-only plan goes south when John's g.f. Brooks (Tina Huang) -- who turns out to be the group's sharpest shooter -- insists on coming along.<br><br>After being warned about an improbable 3,000-lb. \"Pigfoot\" (aka \"the Ripper\") roaming wild, they acquire uninvited company in the form of two local yokels who have an apparent score to settle with John.<br><br>City-slicks-vs.-hicks tension soon gets ugly, resulting in full-on war waged by the large, inbred Tibbs clan against the panicked visitors. Meanwhile, carnivorous Hogzilla turns out to be no mythical beastie.<br><br>A local \"hippie commune\" consisting of one charismatic male (Bryonn Bain) and his sizable harem of Amazonian babes further adds to the eventual mayhem, which doesn't explode until halfway through the pic's runtime.<br><br>Slow start has its own rewards in atmosphere and slyly offbeat rhythms; when the porcine stool finally hits the fan, the action (especially that taking place chez Tibbs) is no-holds-barred muscular. Given the welcome sense that the story might lunge in any direction at any time, however, the final payoff (which involves some not-very-convincing creature effects) is a little less kicky than one might have hoped.<br><br>Perfs are enthusiastic, tech and design contribs above-average.<br><br>Score by Les Claypool of Primus adds to hipster cachet; he and blues mouth harpist Charlie Musselwhite contribute cameo roles.","user":"MysticalGibberish","rank":[23,45]},{"title":"Not your typical weekend outing.","rating":7,"date":"5 June 2011","review":"Not for the faint of heart. James Isaac directs this gory low budget flick from Fangoria. John Hickman(Travis Aaron Wade)puts together a hunting weekend for some of his San Francisco buddies that is suppose to be a guys-only thing; but somehow John's girlfriend Brooks(Tina Huang)is a tag-a-long. Fine; John hustles the group off to his late uncle's property in the boondocks to hunt wild pigs. This outing will not be a typical weekend trip...there will be hillbillies, hippies, massive marijuana fields, muddy wallows and the legend of a big ass 3,000 pound wild boar named \"The Ripper\". Things get violent, insane and bloody. Others in the cast: Howard Johnson Jr., Trevor Bullock, Jason Foster, Rajiv Shah and Christina McKay.","user":"michaelRokeefe","rank":[5,7]}]
