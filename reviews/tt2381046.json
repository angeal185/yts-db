[{"title":"Only in Death","rating":9,"date":"1 September 2014","review":"The first time Jamie becomes alive is in his afterlife. He consoles another dead girl. A girl no one cared about when she was alive. Completely mistreated by her parents. She is in perpetual limbo as she cannot forgive her parents for creating the hell on earth that she had to endure while she was alive. Adam gets to witness the maturation of Jamie as he begins to find his place in the afterlife. This is a fresh and thoughtful movie about what it means to be loved. Only in death does Jamie begin to feel loved by other human beings. He was treated like a piece of trash his whole life and literally pizzed on by others. Only in death, can Jamie begin to have a friendship, unfortunately he..is dead. Adam is not dead, and as much as Adam wants to maintain an emotional connection with Jamie, he has his waking life to live. It's a very sad movie. I wouldn't call it a horror movie. Definitely not a shocker. It's an intelligent, well-made movie.","user":"LiamBlackburn","rank":[26,30]},{"title":"Haunting and effective","rating":30,"date":"30 August 2014","review":"It seems like no one has really seen this film aside from a very few, and I tend to not see films until I've heard enough reactions because, especially with indies like this, they always seem to, well, not be so good. This surprised me a whole lot. I thought it was going to be a horror film, and on some level it is, but it plays out like a coming- of-age drama. It reminds me of Let the Right One in/Let Me In in its slow pace, atmosphere, and pair of leads at the core. I think it's pretty fantastically directed, and the script, while not without its flaws, does a really good job setting up these characters and really giving some meat to the story. I strongly recommend this","user":"Red_Identity","rank":[41,51]},{"title":"Deserves Better Rating","rating":9,"date":"31 August 2014","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. There is no gore or stupid special effects, and is a drama more than a \"scary\" movie. The acting is good and the characters believable. I agree with the other user that this is a haunting film as It left me speechless and melancholy. Please give this film a chance-there are parts that my husband seemed to be bored with, like maybe they dragged out too much for him, but I found every minute to be intriguing, endearing, or slightly disturbing. I would watch this again but I need time to recover from watching it the first time. It took something out of me and I believe this is because the characters are so real and you feel their emotions.","user":"fitch1970-695-315390","rank":[38,48]}]
