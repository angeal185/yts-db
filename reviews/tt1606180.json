[{"title":"It's a great and touching movie!","rating":10,"date":"4 September 2012","review":"This is a type of a movie where you don't realize how great it is until the ending scene. No matter how movies like this one ends you'll end up crying(or not) because you feel as if you actually were with them trough all that happened. It doesn't matter if the movie has a happy or sad ending, you'll just be touched with the ending anyway!<br><br>It shows a classic example of American schools in the 1950s. We follow the story of the school boy Andy who's assigned to write a report with the biggest victim of bullying in school. Believing that he'll just have to finish the report and then be done with even talking to the loser, he ends up learning a lesson of a lifetime.<br><br>The movie is about finding out who you are and accepting who others are. It's about school, friendship and falling in love at a young age.","user":"bergenlive","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Teaching tolerance and loving one's self in a realistic, mature way","rating":8,"date":"16 May 2011","review":"Human Dignity + Compassion = PEACE. That's Mr. Simon's (Ed Harris)  award-winning four-word solution to world peace. Unfortunately,  children are cruel, and there isn't even peace in his 1965 junior high  classroom. \"That's What I Am\" is narrated by an adult Andy Nichol, who,  as an awkward 13 year-old is popular enough that he gets bypassed by  the bullies but he wouldn't want to jeopardize that by socializing with  the outcasts.  This is just a coming-of-age story, but it's personal, based on a true  story, and completely realistic that the lessons are meaningful, not  corny. This isn't just about teenagers struggling with the awkward  phases of life, or about playing up bullying for laughs, there are  serious undertones to the maliciousness of kids. And it's all too real.  Mr. Simon is the best teacher in the state of California (and there are  awards to prove it). He does what he can to bring peace to the world.  He pairs up Andy with Big G, the tall, skinny red-head who gets  tormented each day. Big G, however, doesn't let that get to him. That  doesn't deter the bullies, but Big G has an inner strength that allows  him to stay true to himself. Andy is inspired by that. And so am I.  It tries to teach tolerance and being true to one's self, but does so  through a beautifully-told, coming-of-age story that is more adult in  nature than juvenile. The events that occurred were real, and had  serious implications to the well-being of society. It has taken society  a lot longer to be tolerant than we would like; \"That's What I Am\"  doesn't trivialize it but focuses on the personal, positive resolutions  that the good characters come to. It's real, but we also get to see the  Andys of the world get the girl. I like that kind of world.","user":"napierslogs","rank":[42,54]},{"title":"Recommended Uplifting Fare","rating":7,"date":"2 May 2011","review":"what a refreshing film! though of course somewhat derivative (what schoolteacher drama is not these days!?) That's What I Am still manages to surprise and even delight in moments. I wandered into the Quad cinema looking for whatever was playing on a Sun afternoon, so expectations were very low, and I had not heard of this film--upon seeing the poster almost decided to read a book instead. but I went in, and very glad that I did. Ed harris is fantastic as the teacher we all wished we had. But the conflict of the story does not end in some far fetched deus ex machina, and yet...it paints a redeeming picture of humanity despite an equally visible and counter-vailing reality of distrust and salem witch hunting. I would recommend this for all ages (middle school and up) and think you will find it to be a very rewarding way to spend a couple of hours. I hope this film goes forward so more can see it.","user":"kwatinetz","rank":[26,34]}]
