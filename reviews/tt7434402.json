[{"title":"a movie ?","rating":1,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"At an hour long, this isn't quite a movie, and there isn't even a story. The strange part is, there was some character development although the acting is all over the place and it had a slight potential to be a cheaply done indie horror but it just doesn't succeed on any level. Imagine taking any horror/slasher script and the director filming just some of the scenes, people running around, and no explanation as to why anything is going on and then forgetting to film an ending.\nIt also looks like it was shot on an old video camera and sounds even worse, many garbled scenes. There is low budget and no budget and then there is this. One surprise, the background music was well done. An hour wasted.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[10,16]},{"title":"Um?","rating":29,"date":"29 November 2018","review":"It's interesting to me , as busy as kids tend to be nowadays , that a couple of 11 year olds could find the time to make a little movie. Although, Get a big sharp object run at people and slash, probably didn't take a lot of time to make. Good on ya kiddos.\nI'm really amazed at the level of films being put out, another sad commentary on our society.","user":"dflorcyk","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"Enjoyable!","rating":7,"date":"29 November 2018","review":"I stumbled upon this quirky gem, I wish it was a full length movie. With that being said, it was perfect for the allotted time. A to-the-point cabin horror flick, with a very nice twist. Its low budget, but the score and acting are done well. Worth watching for those underground horror fans who need a quick fix. 7 stars for great plot and acting, just wanted it to be further developed!","user":"amandakociszewski","rank":[6,11]}]
