[{"title":"A consistently entertaining shocker.","rating":7,"date":"10 January 2014","review":"The 1980 horror film \"The Unseen\" is diverting stuff: it's equal parts amusing, disturbing, and ultimately touching. With story credit going to makeup effects masters Stan Winston and Tom Burman, it's got some fine suspense moments, good makeup effects by Craig Reardon (but not very much gore), a fantastic music score by Michael J. Lewis, and capable acting from a well chosen cast. It moves along well to a terrific final third, when all is revealed. Some potential viewers may be turned off by the low body count, while others may admire the twisted nature of the story points. (For those who care, there *is* full frontal nudity from cast member Lois Young.)<br><br>Gorgeous, glamorous Barbara Bach, the Bond girl of \"The Spy Who Loved Me\", stars as Jennifer Fast, a reporter who travels with her crew, consisting of Vicki (Ms. Young) and Jennifers' sister Karen (Karen Lamm, \"Trackdown\"), to the tiny California town of Solvang to cover its Danish festival. Due to a mix-up with their reservations, they're without lodging, but fortunately they run into museum proprietor Ernest Keller (Sydney Lassick, \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"), who offers to let them stay at his farmhouse. Unfortunately, what they don't know is that Ernest and his mousy \"wife\" Virginia (Lelia Goldoni, \"Shadows\") are hiding a big secret in their cellar, which surfaces to terrorize the three lovely ladies.<br><br>Bach does well in the lead, even though in the last act she doesn't do much besides scream and cower in fright. Lamm and Young are likable, as is Douglas Barr ('The Fall Guy', \"Deadly Blessing\") as Jennifers' athlete boyfriend. Goldoni is so good that your heart just goes out to her character. But the movie really belongs to the late, very distinctive character actor Lassick, who here has one of the biggest roles of his career and makes the most of it. His truly creepy Ernest is the true monster of the piece, not the mentally impaired \"Junior\" (incredibly well played by Stephen \"Flounder\" Furst of \"Animal House\") who only wants to play and doesn't know his own strength.<br><br>This is a solid credit for the late cult director Danny Steinmann (\"Savage Streets\", \"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\"), although he was dissatisfied enough with the final cut that he took his name off the picture, to be replaced with the pseudonym \"Peter Foleg\".<br><br>Some of the same crew from \"Halloween\" (1978) are utilized here, including Don Behrns, Barry Bernardi, and camera operator Raymond Stella.<br><br>Seven out of 10.","user":"Hey_Sweden","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Good atmosphere saves a slow paced movie","rating":8,"date":"14 April 2002","review":"The Unseen is done in a style more like old Hollywood mysteries than a horror show.  The film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable.  The basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old, but good acting and production make the movie worth watching.  The movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects.  I rated it an 8 out of 10.","user":"silversprdave","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"GET this film if you can find it","rating":8,"date":"4 April 2006","review":"Get this film if at all possible. You will find a really good performance by Barbara Bach, beautiful cinematography of a stately (and incredibly clean) but creepy old house, and an unexpected virtuoso performance by  \"The Unseen\". I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Bach, whom I'd just viewed in \"The Spy Who Loved Me.\" I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little. So: we start with a nice fresh premise. TV reporter Bach walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a California town, Solvang, that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a big folk festival. She brings along a camerawoman, who happens to be her sister, and another associate. (The late Karen Lamm plays Bach's sister, and if you know who the celebrities are that each of these ladies is married to, it is just too funny watching Bach (Mrs. Ringo Starr) and Lamm (Mrs. Dennis Wilson) going down the street having a sisterly quarrel.)) Anyway  Bach's disgruntled beau follows her to Solvang, as he's not done arguing with her. There's a lot of feeling still between them but she doesn't wanna watch him tear himself up anymore about his down-the-drain football career. The ladies arrive in Solvang to do the assignment for their station, only to find their reservations were given away to someone else. (Maybe to Bach's boyfriend, because think of it  where's he gonna stay?). The gals ask around but there is just nowhere to go. Mistakenly trying to get into an old hotel which now serves only as a museum, they catch the interest of proprietor Mr. Keller (the late Sidney Lassick), who decides to be a gentleman and lodge them at his home, insisting his wife will be happy to receive them. Oh no! Next thing we know Keller is making a whispered phone call to his wife, warning her that company's coming and threatening that she'd better play along. Trouble in paradise! The ladies are eager to settle in and get back to Solvang to shoot footage and interview Swedes, but one of the girls doesn't feel good. Bach and Lamm leave her behind, wondering to themselves about Mrs. Keller (played heartbreakingly by pretty Lelia Goldoni) who looks like she just lost her best pal. Speaking of which  under-the-weather Vicki slips off her clothes and gets into a nice hot tub, not realizing that Keller has crept into her room to inspect the keyhole. She hears him, thinks he's come to deliver linen, and calls out her thanks. Lassick did a great job in this scene expressing the anguish of a fat old peeping tom who didn't get a long enough look. After he's left, poor Vicki tumbles into bed for a nap but gets yanked out of it real fast (in a really decent, frightening round of action) by something BIG that has apparently crept up through a grille on the floor  The Unseen! Lamm comes home next (Bach is out finishing an argument with her beau) and can't find anyone in the house. She knocks over a plate of fruit in the kitchen, and, on hands and knees to collect it, her hair and fashionable scarf sway temptingly over the black floor grille  attracting The Unseen again! Well, at about the time poor Lamm is getting her quietus in the kitchen, we do a flashback into Mr. Keller's past and get the full story of what his sick, sadistic background really is and why his wife doesn't smile much. Bach finally gets home and wants to know where her friends are. Meanwhile, Lassick has been apprised of the afternoon's carnage by his weeping wife and decides he can't let Bach off the premises to reveal the secret of his home. He tempts her down into the basement where the last act of the Keller family tragedy finally opens to all of us.<br><br>I cannot say enough for Stephen Furst, whom I'd never seen before; it's obvious that he did his homework for this role, studying the methods of communication and expression of the brain damaged; Bach and Goldoni, each in their diverse way, just give the movie luster. Not only that, but movie winds up with a satisfying resolution. No stupid cheap tricks, eyeball-rolling dialog or pathetically cut corners... A real treat for your collection.","user":"snausworldlove","rank":[8,11]}]
