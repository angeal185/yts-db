[{"title":"A hoot--see it","rating":9,"date":"26 July 2010","review":"I caught this at the Action on Film Fest in Pasadena this afternoon (July 26, 2010) and it cracked me up. This is high camp of the first order, NOT to be taken seriously, and very very funny. Lots of bang for a couple of bucks, and it's clear the actors are having a great time with the material. Morgan Mead is terrific in the lead role and newcomer Patrick Babbitt is dynamite as her intended, (as in Napoleon Dynamite, which the part reminded me of a little.) There's one goofy touch, which I won't give away, which was absolutely perfect--a visual gag played with a straight face throughout--bordering on brilliant. Needless to say: recommended.","user":"EisenstarkD-1","rank":[17,32]},{"title":"Maybe do a few 63's.","rating":8,"date":"4 December 2017","review":"Doug Shephard is a dorky virgin. His parents are corny Christians who believe sex must wait for marriage, yet make an instructional homemade VHS tape for their son. Doug is accompanied everywhere by an unexplained robot that no one questions. He is about to marry the cleavage endowed Callista DeFord (Morgan Mead) who has been trying to give it up to him.<br><br>Doug longs for his wedding night when he can go at it and maybe even do \"a few 63's.\" His longing for Callista allows him to overlook a number of things, such as apparent infidelity or when she and her bridesmaids become possessed vampires and suddenly start eating people.<br><br>The film is a campy comedy using horror as a background. Clyde (David Fultz who played a pedestrian in \"Dark Knght\") is our well played comedic Van Helsing. Instead of product placement the film has three overtly commercial outtakes.<br><br>I literally laughed out loud at a number of scenes, while some other scenes didn't quiet make it. A fun film.<br><br>Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"should be bloody annulled","rating":1,"date":"30 August 2014","review":"This whole waste of time, space &amp; effort is a spoiler.<br><br>It's becoming a very clear trend - written, directed and starring the same person = pure crap.<br><br>Another brain dead juvenile pile of pap for no apparent reason, written with no discernible intelligence.<br><br>A single cell amoeba would rise up in anger after being requested to watch even 60 seconds of this tripe.<br><br>Do yourself a favour - if anyone recommends this poop as worth watching, push them into a bath of cold water and throw in a high-powered electrical appliance - you'll have more fun in the free police ride to jail than anything this dross can achieve.<br><br>Avoid at all costs.<br><br>A million points below nothing is still too fair.","user":"adrossan","rank":[3,9]}]
