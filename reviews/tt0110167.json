[{"title":"Excellent romantic, feel-good film!","rating":9,"date":"2 January 2003","review":"I'm not really the type of person that gets all excited about romantic films, but there is just something about this film that makes you feel good all the way through.<br><br>Not only is the film very touching and quite romantic, but it also has something to say about honesty and greed in the world.  Although, this isn't the first movie in history to touch on these subjects, but I'm pretty sure it has never been done quite like this before.<br><br>The cast in this film is just plain excellent.  Nicolas Cage is as great as always, no big surprises or let downs in that department.  Bridget Fonda is spectacular in her role.  She delivers a very heart-felt performance and looks nothing less than fantastic throughout the film.  Both characters played by Nicolas Cage and Bridget Fonda were excellent characters and really seem like people that you enjoy being around.  Rosie Perez was very good in her role, I actually HATED her character, not in the sense that she did a poor job, but that her character was an unlikeable person.  Wendell Pierce's character (Bo Williams) was great too, also a person you would be proud to call a friend.  Isaac Hayes was nice touch in the film.  The rest of the cast was very good as well.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, romantic-comedies or just feel-good movies.  I really enjoyed this film quite a bit and I hope that you will too.  Thanks for reading,<br><br>-Chris","user":"LebowskiT1000","rank":[49,57]},{"title":"so hard to dislike","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2002","review":"Warm, enchanting, simply wonderful romantic comedy plays out like a fairy tale brought to life. Cage is a gracious, good-natured New York cop who wins the lotto; against the wishes of his demanding, mercurial wife (Perez), he splits it with a hard-luck waitress (Fonda) as repayment for not leaving a tip! Predictable every step of the way, and hard to believe (though it's purportedly based on a true story), but it's so well-performed, so irresistibly charming, so sweet and romantic that you really don't mind. Not only a good showcase for the film's three ideal leads, but also a kindhearted film that gives hope to the notion of human decency. ***","user":"Special-K88","rank":[48,56]},{"title":"The nearest any film's ever come to breaking me...","rating":9,"date":"5 June 2002","review":"...as a cynic.<br><br>I, through whatever reason, am absurdly cynical. A cynic, lest we forget, is somebody who puts very little faith in the good nature of humanity. Somebody who considers all good deeds to be selfishly motivated.<br><br>Somebody who should absolutely hate this film.<br><br>But I can't. I love this to pieces. No film has ever done as much to give me some faith in people. If Charlie can do the decent thing and split his ticket with Yvonne to fulfil a promise, despite the demands of a furious Muriel; if despite reaching a financial and emotional low they can still invite Angel in to put some food in his belly; and if the New York public can show their appreciation by doing whatever little they can to help out; then maybe, just maybe, there might be hope for the rest of us.<br><br>This. Is. Beautiful.","user":"Kinitawowi","rank":[76,96]}]
