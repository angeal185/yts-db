[{"title":"More comedy than horror","rating":6,"date":"15 February 2016","review":"I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, but as I was watching it, it was -- as another reviewer said -- a mix of two different genres (comedy and horror). However, I'd definitely classify at more as a comedy. The writing was clever and very funny, especially when the guys are discussing the plan to survive. If you're looking for a horror, thriller, slasher-type movie, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a fun movie with the horror aspect of it in the background, you might enjoy this. The acting was good, but you can tell from the cinematography that it was a low-budget indie. I'd advise you to give it a try. I've seen a lot of indie movies -- too many, really -- and this is a fairly well done movie. I was pleasantly surprised, though I doubt I'll watch it again.","user":"chrismackey1972","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Uneasy Mix Of Two Different Genres","rating":5,"date":"17 May 2015","review":"A quartet of four lads are having a stag do . Deciding on a novelty type of stag night they decide to go on a camping trip to rural Dartmoor and camping overnight they find they're being stalked by something . Something hot human and very hostile <br><br>Typing that brief synopsis it appears that's there's a lot of potential in this storyline . Okay it's absolutely unoriginal in having a \"there's something in the dark and it's coming to get us\" type plot but personally speaking I think the reason it's overused is simply down to the fact it's an efficient plot for a horror film , and of course because it doesn't rely on spectacle it doesn't cost much to produce . Writer Neil Craske and director James Shanks don't want to go down this very well trodden path and instead STAG HUNT is more of a laddish comedy <br><br>!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!! <br><br>The first half the film is entirely comedy based where four characters discuss an upcoming wedding . It's interesting to note that they're all played by actors who look like they're just about to enter middle age which in the grand scheme of the gene pool suggests they've probably got an inherent problem in getting the female of the species to find them in anyway attractive . They're not exactly the most likable guys in the world being rather immature with a slightly smutty sense of humour but to fair they're not exactly unlikable either<br><br>Before very long I had forgotten this was supposed to be a cross genre comedy horror and while the comedy is slightly flat I'm afraid the horror aspect is a bit flatter . Being set in the rural countryside during a full moon one can be forgiven for thinking the monster was going to be a werewolf and with hindsight I wish it was . The monster featured here is something along the lines of a beast of Bodmin Moor which isn't all that scary . I suppose the producers wanted it to be an enigmatic type of monster but I did feel cheated that the audience were (Pun alert) left in the dark as to what it was . The low body count was also disappointing as was the rest of film , but to be fair for such a low budget film the production at least tried","user":"Theo Robertson","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Great effort with a low budget and very entertaining!","rating":7,"date":"29 May 2019","review":"The scenery is gorgeous and is well shot, the characters are interesting and the dynamics between them work well as they interact. This is not a Hollywood star vehicle or blockbusting movie (thank goodness) and is all the better for it, don't set your expectations too high and you will find much to enjoy in this simple tale.\nI liked the music too, it worked very well.\nOne particular scene in the tents at night was genuinely very funny, great lads humour!\nAll in all Stag Hunt is a very good effort considering the low budget and the makers pulled it off really well. If you like independent film then you'll probably like this one.","user":"joepu-82816","rank":[1,1]}]
