[{"title":"Meaning of life","rating":10,"date":"8 February 2020","review":"I loved this film! Easy going funny and eye-opener. We buy way to much stuff to fulfill our needs with stuff what we don't need but the advert telling us that we do... Hope many people will see this film and make them thinking.","user":"zsinka","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"100 Dinge Review","rating":7,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"This movie is actually way more of a mix of comedy and \"drama\" than I expected. The cast is good and the main idea for the movie works nice. But I feel like this movie would be more fun if it chose one side. It should either be a comedy or a drama about consumerism. I do not know if I totally like where both main characters end up at the end.","user":"felipepm17","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Cool Idea, but that's it","rating":5,"date":"8 June 2019","review":"Great Idea, poor execution. It starts with a strong promise, but the characters end up trying to be depressing, existential, funny, friendly and romantic. He who attempts to grab too much ends up with nothing....","user":"kalashelarcangel","rank":[11,15]}]
