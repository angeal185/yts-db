[{"title":"Oh dear - more fake reviews...","rating":3,"date":"8 July 2018","review":"Don't know where to start with this film... It mentioned somewhere that this is an example of (one of) the best in British cinema! God help us if that's the case! The film was below average, with below average acting and many obvious goofs/impossibilities in the film. \nThe reviewers who have said that fake accounts have been created to artificially increase the rating of the film have really got a case. Simply awful! The plot??? Well - please don't let me start on that!","user":"contactmaz","rank":[49,61]},{"title":"A train wreck of a movie that has been loaded up with fake 10 stars and reviews.","rating":8,"date":"8 July 2018","review":"This is just an incoherent mess, it's like someone took pieces from various unrelated movies and spliced them together.","user":"braddy4","rank":[37,50]},{"title":"Utter Rubbish","rating":1,"date":"9 August 2018","review":"Definitely fake accounts hyping this movie up, this was the most boring, poorly scripted movie I've seen in a while. \nFar too much going on at one time and nothing really connecting the storylines. <br><br>Average acting, average storyline.","user":"hypernadgers","rank":[9,13]}]
