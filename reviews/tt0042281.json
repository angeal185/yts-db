[{"title":"Forgotten Classic Noir.","rating":8,"date":"8 May 2009","review":"Made in 1950 Warner Bros. THE BREAKING POINT is one of Hollywood's great and classic Film Noirs! Meticulously directed by Michal Curtiz it is, after \"Force Of Evil\", John Garfield's best movie! Beautifully written by Ranald McDougall, from a short story by Ernest Hemingway, this was the third time it was filmed by Warner Bros. Both earlier versions \"To Have &amp; To Have Not\" (1945) and \"Key Largo\" (1948) starred Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall but this version was the more definitive and broadest reworking of the story.<br><br>John Garfield giving one of his best hard boiled performances plays down-at-heel charter-boat captain Harry Morgan who reluctantly falls foul of the law while trying to make ends meet for himself and his family. His wife (Phillis Thaxter overbearing in an over written role) pleads with him to give up his boat THE SEA QUEEN (\"pop says you can have a job anytime on his lettuce ranch in Salinas\" to which Harry balks \"I'm not going to squat on my hunkers down in Salinas, trying to pick lettuce quicker than the bugs can eat it, I'm a boat jockey, it's all I know\"). But when a fishing party lets him down and he runs out of money in Mexico - a shifty shyster lawyer, F.R Duncan, (brilliantly played by Wallace Ford) entices him to take some illegal migrants back on his boat into the United States, Harry has no choice but to comply. \"Don't fight it Harry - relax - roll with it - let it happen\" Duncan repeatedly advises Harry, to which Harry rounds on him - \"you're poison!-....you'd sell your own mother if she was worth anything\"! Later in the movie Duncan inveigles him to take a quartet of gangsters out to sea when they flee after their racetrack heist - culminating in the picture's gripping and climactic set piece - a suspenseful and bloody shootout on board THE SEA QUEEN.<br><br>Peppered with sparkling dialogue throughout, everything in the film is splendidly executed. The movie just rattles along at a well defined pace. Crisply photographed by the great Warner cinematographer Ted McCord (\"Johnny Belinda\"/ \"Treasure Of the Sierra Madre\") his brilliant low-key black &amp; white camera work gives the movie a compelling visual style. Oddley enough though the movie goes virtually unscored but it does have a lovely and beguiling orchestral piece heard over the opening credits and for the finale. There is no music credit on the picture except for Music Supervision by Ray Heindorf but the piece sounds suspiciously like something Max Steiner would have written. In a letter from the esteemed composer to this writer in 1968 he intimated to me that he had indeed written the piece - without credit - adding that he wrote it as a favor to Ray Heindorf. The following year Steiner, again without credit, would oblige Heindorf with a helping hand with the score for the Cagney classic \"Come Fill The Cup\".<br><br>\"The Breaking Point\" is a terrific movie that badly needs a DVD release! I am surprised that Warner Home Video have not already included it in one of their noir box sets. Perhaps it will turn up in their next one? Or maybe in an overdue Garfield set - who knows?<br><br>Classic line from \"The Breaking Point\"....... when smart-mouthed good time girl Patricia Neal, drinking in a Mexican bar - ignores the clamour of a cock-fight taking place in the background - Garfield asks \"don't you like cockfights? To which she blithely replies \"all that trouble for an egg\".","user":"jpdoherty","rank":[46,48]},{"title":"Taut, terrific remake of \"To Have and Have Not\" more faithful to the original tale...","rating":5,"date":"5 August 2011","review":"Ernest Hemingway is said to have liked THE BREAKING POINT more than any other film made from one of his stories and it's easy to see why--especially if you compare this to the earlier version, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT, starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While that film sizzled with their chemistry in the leading roles, the story here is much more compelling and has much more urgency in the telling.<br><br>Of course, it's always a shame that Hemingway's anti-heroes fail to understand that playing around with crooked gangsters can be detrimental to the health of all concerned, but THE BREAKING POINT makes you sympathize with the character of Harry Morgan that Garfield plays so well. The shady lady in this case is smoothly played by PATRICIA NEAL, whose patrician presence made Garfield inform her (or so we're told by Miss Neal herself): \"You know, don't you, you're playing a whore.\" She tells this amusing anecdote in a documentary called THE JOHN GARFIELD STORY.<br><br>PHYLLIS THAXTER is the plain wife of boat captain Garfield, who lightens her hair when she gets a load of the woman (Patricia Neal) she suspects her husband is having an affair with. Thaxter gives one of her best performances as the loyal wife struggling to keep her husband straight, away from the gangsters she knows will ruin the lives of their small family. WALLACE FORD is excellent as the shady lawyer willing to take abusive treatment from Garfield as long as he goes along with the crooked schemes he has in mind.<br><br>The film has a stark film noir quality to the excellent B&amp;W photography and builds to a quietly effective ending after the long shootout that ends the story, an ending that makes the viewer more aware of the consequences of Garfield's stupid decision to conspire with gangsters who shoot his best friend. Michael Curtiz does a superior job of directing.","user":"Doylenf","rank":[43,47]},{"title":"Gripping, touching, beautiful, and a great story","rating":8,"date":"5 September 2013","review":"The Breaking Point (1950)<br><br>Forget for a second that this is a Hemingway story, or that it was more famously and loosely made into a movie (\"To Have and Have Not)\" with Bogart and Bacall in 1944.<br><br>Here was have John Garfield playing with great realism a boating man, Morgan, who has hit hard times. So he is tempted by an illegal run for some big money. And it goes badly. Then, to get out of that jam, he is drawn into yet another one, which goes even worse.<br><br>So this is really a story of a man against the odds. He's basically a good person, which we see in how he treats his partner, his wife, his kids. But it's partly because of those others that he feels he has to come through and make some money. In a way, this is what Hemingway's novel is all about--how a man copes with crisis. (This is always what Hemingway is about, in a way.) It's great starting material.<br><br>The two women in the story, made to look slightly similar, are key in a Hemingway kind of way, too, because a Hemingway man is essentially torn by love all his life. Morgan's wife is terrific in a simple, unexciting way, and when Patricia Neal appears very sexually hungry, Morgan at first is not interested. Neal's character is not quite a noir femme fatale, since she really wants nothing for herself, but is a distraction and siren.<br><br>The two of them are terrific. Around them are a whole swarm of characters, some with important roles and excellent character actors, but we really get inside the head of Garfield and we really feel the weirdly brazen and carefree intensity of Neal. <br><br>So why is this a forgotten film? For one, Garfield is a low key leading man. He always is. His effect is subtle. And Neal isn't a steaming hottie or an outrageous caricature like some leading (blonde) women in these crime films. And then, frankly, they don't totally have chemistry on screen, which is neither one's fault alone, and which isn't so inaccurate to the story.<br><br>And about Hemingway? The book is great. You have to like his style and his manly view, but if you can adapt to that, read it. Easy reading, too. And he set the scene in the waters between Florida and Cuba, which is where he lived and fished. The Bogart version was set in the war, working for the French Resistance in Europe. The Garfield version was set (and shot) in California, with a trip to Mexico. A later version (1958) is set in Florida.<br><br>This is actually a first rate movie. Part of the success depends on the writing-both Hemingway and the sharp, noir-influenced screenplay by Ranald MacDougall. Note that the photography is by the great Ted McCord (Sound of Music, East of Eden, etc.).<br><br>The plot has some deeply personal aspects, both with Morgan's wife and kids as they barely scrape by and with the temptation of the sort of femme fatale played with a cool sharpness by Patricia Neal. And it has a serious crime plot with several angles that develop and disperse and develop further. It moves from dark night scenes to open water scenes to a faked fog ending (a flaw, visually, because you can tell it's just been processed for lower contrast even though the sun is out). <br><br>The movie also has some aspects that strike me as socially relevant, starting with the smuggling of a group of Chinese people out of Mexico at the start and ending with the tragic dilemma of a little African-American boy left literally alone on a big open dock at the final fade. This last aspect (which I can't get specific about without spoiling something) points to one of the really big interpersonal parts of the film that is key, and that I wish had been developed just a hair more because it's so key.<br><br>On my third viewing, I continue to like it a lot. See it.","user":"secondtake","rank":[28,30]}]
