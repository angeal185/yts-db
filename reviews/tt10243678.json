[{"title":"Excellent","rating":9,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"Having viewed early reviews online, not many were positive. I recommend you watch this movie and make your own opinion.<br><br>Its different than your normal run-in-the-mill movie, its fun, smart, emotional all in one. Both Abhay Deol and Mithila Palkar take your attention, Abhay as the street smart artist (pun intended) and Mithila as the naive girl.<br><br>The movie left me thinking about my life, and may do the same for you :)","user":"ellennie15","rank":[22,30]},{"title":"Abhay Deol : The Road less taken","rating":10,"date":"2 June 2019","review":"I remember when Abhay Deol was doing movies like DevD, Oye Lucky Lucky Oye, Manorama 6ft Under, Socha Na Tha, there wasn't much space in Bollywood for movies like those as it was a gamble. He never got to be the most successful commercially, but whenever there would be a talk of bringing about change in Bollywood from masala musical movies to artistic thought provoking cinema or dark or satirical; Abhay Deol for me would be the name at the top. Sure Nawazuddin Siddiqui is mostly mentioned when talking about this changing genre of films along with Anurag Kashyap which is ofcourse true. But Abhay Deol was the first guy to start taking those risks especially considering he belongs to one of the top n most successful families i.e. Deol Family. Happy to see Abhay Deol back on screen with a lot more platforms to perform with online streaming playforms. What i mean is Abhay Deol indeed is truly an \"ARTIST\"","user":"SanDhuBoy05","rank":[20,30]},{"title":"A very well attempt","rating":8,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"A different premise. A different way of story telling. An attempt which needs to be appreciated. Very well acted &amp; well crafted. Give it a try it definitely has its moments. Camera angles, editing, symbolism &amp; so much more. A study material for an indie Filmaker.","user":"agrawalabhilash-72297","rank":[12,18]}]
