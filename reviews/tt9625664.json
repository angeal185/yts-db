[{"title":"Decent female driven single location thriller","rating":6,"date":"8 December 2019","review":"Slick shots and the slow build up of atmosphere turn a mundane hospital into something threatening and scary for the heroine. Bruce's character wasn't needed but I get why he's in it. Otherwise, the story kept my attention and was done well as a single location thriller. 5/10 for me.","user":"DirrrrectAmySeer12","rank":[82,110]},{"title":"Not bad","rating":5,"date":"18 December 2019","review":"This movie is OK but Bruce Willis' acting is very ham. I have no idea why all of a sudden he seems to have lost the ability to portray a believable character.<br><br>Apart from that, Nicky Whelan carries this movie from start to finish with superb acting. Unfortunately, the story is a bit sparse in depth.<br><br>OK to watch if it comes on telly, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see this again.","user":"mjsreg","rank":[41,54]},{"title":"At least Willis wasn't bored or falling asleep in this one","rating":6,"date":"9 December 2019","review":"This film was clearly a 'very' low budget B-grade film based on the few location sets, but had a fairly decent supporting cast for a change. Good to see Tito Ortiz and Steve Guttenberg, but Nicky Whelan definitely stole the show. I'm not sure why Willis was even in this film, but at least he didn't seem bored or falling asleep in this one compared to the previous bunch I've seen him in.<br><br>Novice director Matt Eskandari was fairly decent behind the camera, but needed to direct his cast better. The writing by newb Paul Da Silva was atrocious. Sure it was his first writing credit, but out of the almost 30 producers, you'd think at least one would've suggested a read-through by a seasoned screenwriter before going to action.<br><br>The 87 min is normally a decent runtime, but to have that time in such a plot-riddled nonsense seen-it-many-times-before unnecessarily long dragged out scenes wannabe Die Hard in a hospital *finally takes a breath* story, made me begging for the ending many times. As predictable as it was, I was hoping at least for a fun twist or something, but instead, we got Willis a role for a character that wasn't really even needed.<br><br>For an amateur extremely low budget B-grade film, it still had its moments. It's a generous 6/10 from me, and certainly undeserving of all these 1's and 2's, especially considering some new filmmakers gave it their best.<br><br>To see more of my 1000+ ratings and 700+ reviews, click on my username.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[38,53]}]
