[{"title":"Middle age kicks...","rating":7,"date":"18 October 2019","review":"Forty something single mum discovers she is pregnant to the mortification of her teenage daughter. That's the plot. Sounds basic and it is but it's still a charming watch. Bronagh Gallagher is fantastic and just owns the screen whenever she appears on it with her lovely warm presence. Lola Pettigrew as the daughter plays it just right and even the usually annoying Paddy Courtney provides nice support. Not the most cinematic of movies and probably belongs on TV but a likeable cast lives a slight plot and you'll leave the cinema Happy but guaranteed you won't remember this movie in a years time.","user":"nickphelan-25748","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"A breath of fresh air","rating":7,"date":"2 April 2020","review":"It's a lovely movie, very good actors and enjoyable to watch.","user":"lamessaleh","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Surprise","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"The storyline is million of times that I have seen in my life. But it's just lovely and adorable to watch this. It's a good example of execution the way how the story was told.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[0,0]}]
