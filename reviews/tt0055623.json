[{"title":"Not just another Elvis vehicle","rating":10,"date":"12 May 2005","review":"Funny thing. My local video store had this movie listed under \"musicals\". If there is one thing this picture is NOT, it is a musical. It is the one valid dramatic effort of Elvis' career, and easily the best picture he ever starred in. He sings exactly two musical numbers, both are fairly natural in sequences in the film. The first one early in the film while riding with sweetheart Millie Perkins (as Billie Lee) in a pickup truck. . . is a bit musical-ISH, if you will, in that it sort of comes out of a stylization contrivance of the film-makers. Yet it is very romantic and sweet. The other one is a serenade to Tuesday Weld (Noreen in the movie) that is very comfortably meshed in with this heartfelt story. Anyway, Elvis plays a young man, Glenn, who comes from a troubled past, evolving from country roots that were wild and unsettled between his father and mother. His father was a lazy good for nothing. His mother, who died in his childhood, is depicted as having been a good hearted woman. So Glenn gets in trouble with the law when he nearly kills his brother in a fight. His father wants him to go to jail, but a compassionate parole board, advised by psychiatrist Irene Sperry (Hope Lange) allows him one more chance with his uncle, where he helps with his uncle's distillery. His uncle has a daughter, Noreen, who has a child but no husband,(wonderfully played by Tuesday Weld) who is kind of wild like Glenn (but also tender hearted). In a complicated plot Glenn has both Noreen and Billie Lee to consider. Millie Perkins, as Billie Lee, is also quite inspiring and sweet. Eventually, as Glenn gets in more and more trouble, he ends up falling for the psychiatrist widow Sperry, and at that point he has more women troubles than any man SHOULD have. . . .BUT. . .it's all good. He gets discovered by the psychiatrist for his natural talent, WRITING! Believe me, the troubles this guy has. . . all of us guys would like to be burdened with. Some of the beautiful scenery from the Smokey mountains in Tennessee is quite stunning. Also, I really enjoyed the natural quality that can never be found nowadays in period pieces from the same era (1961). The cars are distinctly authentic, for instance, not all pristine conditioned masterpieces. I give this movie all 10 stars just from the sweet effort given by cast and film makers to NOT make just another money making Elvis vehicle, but a compassionate dramatic tale of moral strength and sweetness.","user":"emdragon","rank":[28,30]},{"title":"Beautiful babes w/decent Elvis!","rating":6,"date":"28 June 2004","review":"This film (written by Clifford Odets of all people) is one of the better ones in Elvis' track record.  The women are all beautiful accomplished actresses, especially Tuesday Weld, Hope Lange, and Millie Perkins.  Good story-line involving moonshine and other things important to most small-town Americans.<br><br>Not as interesting or involving as King Creole, this movie has qualities and showed that Elvis could have been a good actor if he wasn't doing tripe scripts all the time.  This is a normal movie without unnecessary fight scenes or boring young actresses PRETENDING to think The King is a hot guy. Check this one out.  Well worth your time for movie-lovers and Elvis fans.","user":"shepardjessica","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"I love this movie! 9/10","rating":9,"date":"8 March 2009","review":"\"A troubled young man discovers that he has a knack for writing when a counselor encourages him to pursue a literary career.\" Do me a favour: Do not think of this movie as any other Elvis flick, because this is one of the best classic films I've seen. Well, he sings a couple songs to his lovers and he gets into a couple of fights, but here it just doesn't happen randomly. The plot is excellent and Elvis blew me away with his acting. There's one specific scene where he's sharing stories about his dead mother with Hope Lange and it almost brought me to tears. His acting was very natural, as was Hope Lange's, Tuesday Weld's and Millie Perkins'. This is a fantastic movie and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did.","user":"aidosh94","rank":[12,14]}]
