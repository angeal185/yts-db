[{"title":"Quite simply the finest movie ever made about late-50s suburbia","rating":10,"date":"30 November 2000","review":"The script is sharp and at times, poignant, the acting is superb, and the overall impact is overwhelming.  It peels the label off of the seemingly happy suburban couples and, in so doing, provides the sharpest snapshot ever put to film about a time and place that no longer exists, the one that was written about by such giants as Updike and Cheever.  The only problem with this movie is that it's only shown on TV about once every ten years and it's not available on video.  One last comment.  After watching this movie, you'll never look at Tony Randall in the same way.","user":"Eclectic Critic","rank":[50,53]},{"title":"Obscure Gem","rating":9,"date":"29 June 2003","review":"\"No Down Payment\" is truly one of the great lost Fifties movies.  Released in 1957, the year that the forced integration of Little Rock and the Soviet's launching of Sputnik forced America out of it's smug complacency, this movie truly shows us another side of suburban utopia.  This flick was filmed when suburban California seemed to be everyone's ideal of the good life which, from the start, this movie portrays quite well.  Barbecues with the neighbors, kids playing in the yard, trimmed lawns and freshly painted houses, this neighborhood has it all.  What could go wrong?<br><br>The fact that Jeffrey Hunter and Patricia Owens were, frankly, not as good in their vocation as their fellow actors, somehow works very well here. They play the new couple in the neighborhood.  They're naive, filled with expectations and enthusiastic to make a home in this cozy corner of the suburbs and they manage to give the viewer a similar feeling.  We want what they want - the perfect neighbors - supportive friends and caring advisers who still allow us our privacy and our boundaries.  That's what this great cast has to offer...they're perfect.<br><br>But are they?  Skillfully, we begin to catch on to these neighbor's individual character defects.  Joanne Woodward, fresh off \"Three Faces of Eve\", plays her character with her usual complex aplomb.  Sheree North and Barbara Rush, two Fifties beauties, are comfortable here with their good looks and their knack for understanding men..or perhaps it's manipulating men?  As always, Cameron Mitchell takes his man's man character in an unexpected direction. And Pat Hingle, often the embodiment of stability in his roles, takes it all in stride or does he?  Then there's Tony Randall, sidekick of Rock Hudson in all those great light Doris Day comedies.  Tony Randall gives us a character we'll never forget...this performance proves Randall was and is a great, great actor.<br><br>Four husbands, four wives, eight stunning acting performances.  Was the dream offered to us by \"Father Knows Best\" and Ozzie's family really too good to be true?  Maybe not - suburban California is a far cry from the inner city tenements so many of our ancestors dwelt in...Except, this is 1957.  The turbulent Sixties are just around the bend.  California is about to explode into riots, war protests and hippies searching for the bum trip tent.  Besides, you know what they say about something being too good to be true..........","user":"humdinger","rank":[47,51]},{"title":"young families/post ww11 housing and getting back to American life","rating":10,"date":"26 April 2005","review":"I grew up in a post ww11 housing development, and all the characters of No Down Payment were our neighbors and family. Right down to the racial discriminating, only Mexicans were the people our neighborhood discriminated against. A pity. The buying of new cars,and ex-servicemen unable to find their niche, still living their war glory days. And young women who weren't really ready for married life,like the character portrayed by Joanne Woodward. The actors playing the characters were so believable, Pat Hingle even looked the part of the put upon successful man, Tony Randle played a depressed alcoholic,Jeffrey Hunter was an excellent college educated young man. I knew all these characters while growing up in a post ww11 housing development. Now I want to buy a copy of this excellent film.","user":"Heartofglass52","rank":[36,39]}]
