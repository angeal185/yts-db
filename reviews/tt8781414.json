[{"title":"Pretty Enjoyable Ride","rating":9,"date":"29 November 2019","review":"Freaks starts out (or so you think) as a film which promises to deliver some uncomfortable moments between an over-protective dad who may or may not be outright crazy as well as possibly dangerous, and a cute, socially inexperienced, awkward and defenseless little girl. If you know nothing about the film going in, like we did not, upon viewing the first few scenes, naturally, your mind can't help but run to all kinds of dark places, wondering where the filmmaker is going to take us.<br><br>Well, where it goes, although the ride hits a couple of small bumps, are dark and eerie places touching on the horror genre, and then surprisingly, it pulls back and takes an unexpected left turn into something completely different.<br><br>Much of the supporting cast is okay, but the real revelation is the outstanding performance by Lexy Kolker as the little girl, and just slightly less-so, although still great, her dad, played by Emile Hirsch. They pretty much carry the film. Bruce Dern also delivers, if not a riveting performance, at least a mentionable and memorable one. His role in their lives unravels slowly and is not completely understood until somewhere in the middle of the film. It takes a while to discern what his purpose truly is and for the viewer to see the entire picture. I enjoyed that.<br><br>I also liked that the film lets the viewer decide for themselves if what they've witnessed is abuse, trauma, or something else entirely. I also like that while I believe the characters are used as a stand-in or metaphor for discrimination, it isn't anything that is heavy-handed or overtly pushed.<br><br>All in all, I found Freaks to be entertaining, and that its concept had been well-executed and delivered. The journey, despite the twists and turns, was captivating, and the destination was 99% equally pleasing and enjoyable, if not 100% where I had expected to go.","user":"Her-Excellency","rank":[194,230]},{"title":"Finally got to see this","rating":7,"date":"29 November 2019","review":"Been waiting awhile to watch this take on \"what if mutants (X-men) started popping up in the real world?\" Suspenceful script, taut direction and an excellent cast elevate this fine indie flick. Bruce Dern and Emile Hirsch star in this sci-fi thriller and with those two you know the movie is off to a good start. The claustrophobic atmosphere and smart script literally kept me on the edge of my seat for much of the picture. Really enjoyed it, well done.","user":"Mfbarry-90-773507","rank":[128,153]},{"title":"Now THIS is true Science Fiction... A slow-burning Mystery, but for serious Sci Fi fans it is worth it!","rating":8,"date":"1 December 2019","review":"My title pretty much says it all. For those of you who grew up reading 'serious' Science Fiction, you will appreciate this movie. It is very rare to find a Sci Fi film that would be what I would personally call 'serious', but this is it. Not exactly 'Hard' Science Fiction in the sense of it being real technical, but serious in the sense of it being in my lowly and wretched opinion, a DAMN good story!<br><br>I have no bloody idea who this little actress is, but if hopefully she can survive the dangerous rigors of Hollywood, she is going to be a PHENOMENAL actor... IS a phenomenal actor. Quite impressive. Most child actors usually I feel come across as either somewhat artificial or overdone, but definitely not this little lady. Restrained, controlled, and VERY believable.<br><br>Also, I got to hand it to ol' Bruce Dern... The dude was frigg'n MADE for this part. There were some very nice, but subtle touches of dry humour in just a few well placed areas too that gave the film a nice rounded emotional anchor. And, I loved the way the writers / director really did an excellent job keeping the audience truly guessing about what the HELL is going on, playing out the story and clues at just the right pace that I personally found quite riveting.<br><br>If you do enjoy serious Science Fiction and don't mind forgoing the big technological effects of your usual blockbuster Marvel film (not that there's anything wrong with that either : ) and you appreciate just a really well done story and a pretty darn good mystery if you go in cold, not knowing anything about it beforehand, then I think you will really find this movie not only very entertaining and involving, but also rather powerfully moving as well.<br><br>A nice find...","user":"lathe-of-heaven","rank":[119,142]}]
