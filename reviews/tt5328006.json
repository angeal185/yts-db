[{"title":"Love Greg","rating":5,"date":"11 August 2019","review":"Watch this movie totally cuz of Greg. It's not his top performance but it's nicely done. In terms of acting a mid life crisis man he did it good. Treasure the chance seeing these actors acted is the key point.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Watch if you like Greg Kinnear!","rating":7,"date":"22 July 2019","review":"Despite it's dismal rating of 5.4 at the time of this writing, I watched the movie because I have been a fan of Greg Kinnear for a long time. About 20-25 minutes in, I almost shut it off....glad I didn't. What I thought would be a dark comedy turned out to be a kind of \"feel-good\" comedy with some important life truths...The grass isn't always greener, count your blessings, etc. Somewhat predictable at times, I was also caught pleasantly by surprise a few times, especially at the end. Phil also seems to be Greg Kinnear's directorial debut. Nice job Greg, I look forward to your future endeavors whether acting and/or directing.","user":"mikemagine","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Good intentions but a bore","rating":3,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"The set-up is great - a despondent dentist who feels lost because of his broken marriage, he feels like a failed parent, and his dental practice offers no satisfaction - begins to stalk a patient who he sees as the \"man with the perfect life\". This action becomes a big mistake.<br><br>But the path Director/Actor: Greg Kinner takes to tell this story is so full of holes and ridiculous situations the story never reaches it's comic goal and quickly descends into a goofball story trying to make a valuable statement on life.<br><br>The Greek persona never becomes remotely convincing.","user":"cekadah","rank":[9,14]}]
