[{"title":"Enjoyable horror anthology outing","rating":8,"date":"6 November 2017","review":"Three tales of terror. First story, \"Midnight Macabre\" - Three girls play a game of midnight macabre in a house where five mysterious deaths occurred get more than they bargained for. This one builds a reasonable amount of tension and culminates in a grim conclusion, plus the gals are hot in a skeevy web-can model sort of way. Second yarn, \"3 A.M.\" - Two reality show ghost busters answer a call that turns out to be much more than they expected. Zach Thomas and Xavier Whittington are quite funny and likable in the leads; it's a hoot to watch these guys wimp out when faced with a genuinely dangerous supernatural force. Third and best anecdote, \"A Soul Was Sold\" - Young Nora (a solid and appealing portrayal by slim and attractive brunette Kody Evans) finds herself in considerable jeopardy when she decides to investigate the baffling disappearance of her brother. The creepy mood and chilling climax make this segment a winner. Writer/director Joe Haugh keeps the narrative moving along at a brisk pace, crafts a fun ooga-booga atmosphere, and tosses in a generous amount of tasty gratuitous female nudity for trashy good measure. Granted the production values are pretty rough around the edges, but this only adds to this film's scrappy charm.","user":"Woodyanders","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Little to write home about","rating":2,"date":"6 February 2018","review":"Another trio of indie horror shorts, presented by a woman in a tight, cleavage-baring latex outfit. The first story is about a bunch of young women who head off to a 'death house' on the anniversary of some unexplained deaths to play a dangerous game. The second story concerns a couple of ghost hunters who come across a genuine case of the eerie. The third story is about a woman whose brother goes missing, leading her on an unusual investigation. The one thing all of these have in common is that they're mostly set in people's living rooms with a bunch of cast members hanging around explaining the story, rather than showing it. As such, they're dreary and talky, and not worth your time.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[0,1]}]
