[{"title":"Use caution on other reviews, Bad movie.","rating":3,"date":"7 July 2018","review":"My quick rating - 3,4/10. I have to save people from reading obvious \"fake\" reviews on IMDB. This movie attempts to try and fool you, and if you don't think for a minute in this movie, you will be fooled. Into being entertained that is. In an attempt to be weird, just for the sake of being weird, the movie is a complete mess. Unfortunately the plot itself doesn't lend a hand to the sub par actors and give them something to work with. Without giving anything away, a guy wants to \"hack\" (using that term very loosely) the human mind to save the world. In doing so, with the electronics you most likely dropped off last time you recycled electronics, he finds himself and his best friend (oh, big plot point, does he exist?) trying to solve this plan, again, hacking your mind. Now since this movie doesn't rely on any theory, science, computer knowledge, etc. you just have to assume he is doing something. But of course, the bad guy (no plural, budget couldn't afford that) wants to stop him. Then again, is there a bad guy. If you are going to make a movie that relies on wondering these things, please write in some part of it to explain. It isn't that this movie is confusing, it is just so poorly done and trying to rip off by far better versions of the \"all in your mind\" idea, that this just falls so flat. I am unsure the makers of this movie were even sure which way they were going with this. Do yourself a favor, and don't bother with this one, you'll end up just being \"Mad\" \nP.S. If you worked on this movie, good for you, but don't jump on here and write BS reviews praising this as the new coming of Fight Club, etc. It makes you look dumb, and not everyone can see through the nonsense reviews so quickly. I knew it was coming after the first 10/10, but after seeing a few back to back, I figured the crew sat in the same room and passed the laptop around in a circle to get them done.","user":"jackmeat","rank":[25,33]},{"title":"Unbearable","rating":1,"date":"5 July 2018","review":"30 minutes in and I had to stop - I rarely do that once I've started a movie. The positive reviewers are definitely fake accounts (having only reviewed this movie) and should not be trusted. I thought I'd give it a chance and it's a half hour of my life I'll never get back.","user":"drquantum","rank":[23,38]},{"title":"it was an Okay Movie","rating":4,"date":"15 July 2018","review":"This Movie does have strong language and it has drugs, smoking, sexual content, nudity were a backside was shown. And Technology torturer inflicted by another human. I feel like I've seen this Movie done before which made parts for me a little boring. <br><br>I loved the plot and the special effects, I think is was an okay Movie but I think that it would have been better if it was a TV show instead of a Movie. I think the Movie was explained well at the start with the voice over and I like how at the start of the Movie how it didn't just leave us and not having a clue what it was about. but as soon as that first scene was over, it lacked. The voice over got me interested in the Movie and then that part just vanished. I would of liked it more if it had the voice over though-out the Movie without making the scenes to easy to guess what would happen next. <br><br>I liked mason he was funny and I liked his style of clothing. I liked mason and finn scenes. finn is like mason's imagination hologram. Anyway I found finn funny too I liked the scenes that he was in.<br><br>I liked this Movie but I wanted more, I wasn't jumping up and down in my chair in suspense, I think if it was more engaging I would have been hooked. My number one genres that I love is sci-fi. And I just really wanted to love this Movie and at first I thought I would. But After the first few scenes it started to drag and I would of liked it more if we had more charter development and back story. Like how he got into all this and how he learn about it.","user":"ChrisLFinch","rank":[4,5]}]
