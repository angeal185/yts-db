[{"title":"Enjoyable, but not as complicated as it pretends to be","rating":6,"date":"1 December 2014","review":"The movie starts out mysterious, trying to be a thriller. You'll see the main character (perfectly played by Arrow's Katie Cassidy), being a suspect in a murder case, who is also a mental patient. As a mental patient she lives in a building full of other mental patients who are too crazy to be credible, just as her head is inhabited by various personalities.<br><br>Obviously the movie wants you to wonder what kind of reality (or realities) you're in. While making you think, the movie transforms from a mysterious thriller into something more sci-fi / fantasy. This could be a good thing if it wasn't already well done by The Matrix, or Identity. As the movie transforms from mysterious to crazy and loses all credibility (yes, superpowers), somehow the lead characters succeed in becoming very interesting. Maybe the lead character isn't as crazy as we were meant to believe and her acting skills (together with her co-stars) make this movie watchable and fun, while all the puzzle pieces fall in their place.<br><br>My advice: don't watch this movie expecting something very complex, but it's good enough thanks to the actors who take their job seriously. The nod goes to Katie Cassidy. After disliking her in Arrow, she made me a believer. Thanks to her the movie is now a 6 instead of a 5.","user":"CountJonnie","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Missed opportunity","rating":5,"date":"26 January 2015","review":"Another picture that had way more potential than its final product. When a young woman with dissociative identity disorder is brought to some kind of madhouse, people start killing themselves for no apparent reason. With a bunch of eccentric characters and a visual style that provokes Sin City comparisons, this comic book adaptation will certainly entertain people and capture their attention till the last minute. Unfortunately it all feels a bit rushed, bloated and shallow. With b-listers like Garret Dillahunt, Gina Gershon, Kunal Nayyar, Billy Campbell and Richard Riehle, this movie has some fun acting and prevents from feeling amateuristic, but in the end it's just too much a \"been there, seen that\" movie...","user":"joris-nightwalker","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Interesting","rating":20,"date":"20 September 2014","review":"I quite liked this. I think it could have done more with its premise, but as it is, it's pretty visually stunning and the performances are quite good. I've never thought Katie Cassidy had real talent, but she does some fine work here, always elevating the material when it needs it and providing a good contrast to the other roles she's played in the past. Dillahunt is a joy to watch, like always, and probably the MVP supporting player of the film. It's nice to see so many of these TV actors in roles in this (Buffy's Eliza Dushku and Michelle Trachtenberg, as well as The Sopranos' Michael Imperiori). I do recommend this, even if I get that it's pretty problematic","user":"Red_Identity","rank":[31,43]}]
