[{"title":"I shot the Sheriff","rating":1,"date":"14 December 2019","review":"A group of about a dozen mercenaries are hired by Ardenmor to protect them from the Nosek frost giants and the Samada archers. The Serrian have the south blocked. The entire film takes place in a barn with an occasional arrow coming through the window and lowing their numbers. They bicker, argue, and swear as the talk the plot. The language is very modern military.<br><br>It appears like some SCA group got a camera and thought they could make an entire film inside a barn and talk about battle. At this point, you need real good acting and dialogue. They didn't have it. Clark Sarullo had a great costume but can't read a line without a long dramatic pause.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[31,55]},{"title":"Advanced Shelters & Soldiers","rating":5,"date":"6 February 2020","review":"Watched despite the obvious partisan commendations, the fake ratings that mechanically keep many of us away from movies.<br><br>I stayed until the end, most likely because I dig RPGs. Broken Swords is like a filmed role-playing game session, an episode of a large campaign. We get glimpses of a coherent, well-developed fantasy world as background, with character classes, original magic spells, etc.<br><br>The makeups and costumes are great. Easily the highlight of the project.<br><br>The acting, very uneven. Some performers are good, others are ridiculous. Natural selection shall do its thing.<br><br>The narrative is decidedly \"tell, don't show.\" That weighs heavily; it will lose many a viewer; it will lower the rating.<br><br>One thing I personally disliked, from the first seconds, is the characters talking like a contemporary military unit. Even touching their magical objects with today's gestures associated with very specific technologies.<br><br>To conclude, this is as close to a radio show as it is to cinema. Watch if you like your fantasy more talkative than visual.","user":"voyou-703-655350","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Fake reviewers you insult great movies & embarass yourselves","rating":1,"date":"5 February 2020","review":"Ignore the reviews giving it a 10 from people obviously involved with the production. Is this movie better than Citizen Kane? Gone With the Wind? Psycho? I think not. In fact, it's not better than the Super 8 movie I shot for a 6th grade project. Those people should be ashamed of themselves, It's an insult to great movies and it's embarrassing that they would give this movie at 10.","user":"bobkuhl","rank":[8,13]}]
