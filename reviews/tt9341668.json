The absurdity makes it comical in a very artful way. I was impressed how much this film draw me in.\nThe whole cast is amazing. The director got the best out of everyone of them. The work of the cinematographer and the makeup artist is outstanding. I have found that you need to watch Travis Mills movies more than once to appreciate all the details and hints beside the center acts.","user":"skyartists","rank":[4,23]},{"title":"Top Notch","rating":8,"date":"29 October 2019","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed\nThe Deadbeats. While I missed a few references from the beginning it didn't impact my enjoyment . I will watch it again for sure and please note if I watch a movie a second or third time I liked it a lot. Good job to the actors. Very authentic portrayals of the characters.","user":"auntiedd-66116","rank":[3,19]}]
