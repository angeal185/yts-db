[{"title":"The Miracle Season : Melancholy but will touch your heart .","rating":9,"date":"8 April 2018","review":"I did not know the film was based on real life events till the credits rolled. This film is melancholy . It has two Hollywood veterans William Hurt and Helen Hunt . Both do a fine job . But it is the young Erin Moriaty that shines in The Miracle Season . And tragic death of star volleyball player Caroline \"Line\" Found Danika Yarosh acts with such joy and passion that you feel very connected emotionally . Even if the story line while predicable a tear will run down your face . Excellent emotional film making 9 out of 10 well worth this true story being told in in the art of cinema.","user":"robfollower","rank":[30,40]},{"title":"Whoever gives this movie less than 8/10 doesn't have emotions","rating":10,"date":"20 April 2018","review":"I hadn't been so touched and overwhelmed by a movie since My Sisters Keeper; it's inspirational, empowering and based on true events. It's a must watch.","user":"mavagomez","rank":[25,37]},{"title":"Extraordinarily good","rating":10,"date":"7 April 2018","review":"The only other review here as I write this wrote a good review. However, they reviewed this as a fictional movie. This is based on a true story and real life often does not have the makings of a well-written fiction. Normally I do not enjoy anything about sports if it is not local sports and does not involve someone I know, especially family members. If I wanted to watch sports I would turn on the news since that is over half of what the news material includes. I am not Mike Heck who thinks the answer to everything is \"SPORTS\". The coach reminds me of my boot camp T.I., tough as nails, hard on the troops, but in her heart very caring. Other than Helen Hunt, the outstanding actor in this film was Erin Moriarty. I researched her when I got home and it seems prior to this she has not done much work of significance. Too bad. I think with good material like this she could do well and go far. I was surprised to see Tiera Skovbye listed in the cast. I don't even remember seeing her in the movie. IE. she did not make much of an impression.","user":"beachy-38431","rank":[22,33]}]
