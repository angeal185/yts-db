[{"title":"Character Driven Train Ride from Hell","rating":7,"date":"1 September 2008","review":"Brad Anderson is probably the best unknown director working today. He's the independent Christopher Nolan, often making character-driven, psychologically complex flicks that transcend the trappings of their respective genres. In the past he has successfully combined elements from time-travel thrillers and romantic comedies in 2000's \"Happy Accidents\", delivered a taut \"Shining\"-esque thriller in 2001's \"Session 9\" and then provided a stirring Hitchcock homage with 2004's \"The Machinist\" (which also featured a gonzo performance from Christian Bale). With \"Transsiberian\" Anderson attempts to breath life back into the often forgotten train-based thriller. Like those three earlier films, \"Transsiberian\" was made on the cheap, yet still manages to feature great camera-work and well known faces headlining the cast. In terms of the logistics of the location shooting in Lithuania (doubling as Siberia), this arrives as Anderson's most accomplished film from a technical standpoint.<br><br>The story starts off with an American couple (a goofy Woody Harrelson and a criminally underrated Emily Mortimer) returning from missionary work in China by route of the famous Transsiberian railroad. Once on board the train, they befriend a young couple (Kata Mara and Eduardo Noriega) who claim to be student-teachers returning from Japan but might be hiding something sinister. The screenplay does a good job of building up to \"something\" and developing the characters, especially Mortimer's Jessie, delving into her past with expository dialog that makes you care about where these characters are headed and think deeply about their motives. Without giving away too much of the film, entanglements ensue as a drug smuggling operation comes to light, and in steps Ben Kingsley (excellent as a Russian bruiser) as a narcotics detective with a special interest in the case.<br><br>There is a point, however, where (pardon the pun) the screenplay derails, and despite some unexpected twists, there never seems to be that big payoff. The film keeps the viewer on their toes with a bizarre turn of events at an abandoned church and a shockingly grim torture scene, but the psychological ramifications of these events are never probed as deeply as they could've been. The seductively cute Mortimer gives a nervy, complex, and excellent performance as Jessie, keeping the viewer invested in her character and what could happen to her even as the screenplay goes all over the map with her development. Woody Harrelson's performance is more of a conundrum as he seems to be playing a book-smart version of his moronic character from \"Cheers\". He makes you laugh during some of the more ridiculous scenes as the plot holes get deeper, and whether that was intentional or not to break the tension or gloss over the leaps of logic is never clear.<br><br>\"Transsiberian\" should please those looking for something different from your run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller. Though the screenplay initially gives us characters that feel like real people, the mechanics of the convoluted plot spoil the potential of that development. However, the film still offers up an exotic locale, solid direction, and interesting performances, which makes it easy to recommend.","user":"WriterDave","rank":[145,180]},{"title":"Great suspense film!","rating":9,"date":"9 September 2008","review":"Loved this movie and wonder why it was so under-marketed. I went to see it because I actually took the Trans-Siberian train this summer and so of course this movie intrigued me. (Luckily my trip was not so eventful!) While of course the movie was more personal for me since I could really relate to a lot of the scenes about life on the train and in the stations, this movie will appeal to anyone who likes a good mystery. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and is really well-done. And it definitely captures the current political and social climate of Russia today. Having dealt with the border guards in Siberia (over a visa problem) I witnessed first hand the 'wild west' mentality that currently exists in that country. It may be hard for Americans to believe that the events that occur in this movie are realistic. But they are. And Woody Harrelson is a revelation. Ben Kingsley is great as always. I was not familiar with Emily Mortimer prior to this film but I will be on the lookout for her next film. It's a shame not many people will see this movie. Hopefully they'll catch it on pay per view. Highly recommended.","user":"vickie324","rank":[101,140]},{"title":"Completely Unrelatable","rating":1,"date":"8 July 2013","review":"I'm a writer so maybe I think more about these things than certain other people... BUT SERIOUSLY - if you go to poor Siberian territory and 1) Don't learn the language 2) Shout \"I'm American\" every 5 seconds 3) Take pictures every five seconds with your GIANT camera 4) Let strangers into your room when your alone 5) Leave said strangers with your stuff 6) Go 4 miles off any main roads ALONE with random strangers 7) INITIATE a kiss and say \"I used to love a pointless f***\" 8) When, after initiating, he wants to have sex with you, beat him senseless. 9)After you beat him senseless, he is powerless and bleeding and for no reason at all decide to hit him really hard in the head with a 2x4 an extra 3 or 4 times.<br><br>THEN YES, bad stuff will happen to you. I'm absolutely shocked the woman who committed the above 9 deadly sins (any combination of 2 could get your stuff stolen or yourself killed) has the gumption to consider herself a pawn of the situation. If you love watching disturbingly stupid people get away with murder then this movie is absolutely for you! Go ahead, watch and enjoy.","user":"mitchlb452","rank":[51,71]}]
