[{"title":"Fun, meta, inside-Hollywood acid trip","rating":9,"date":"17 April 2019","review":"What an unexpected, enjoyable find this film was. Actor-turned-writer/director Rhys Wakefield and a blonde-haired Nick Cannon parody their experience in LaLa Land with a funny, smart, tight, twisting meta-narrative that draws you in and never lets go. A modern take on movies about Hollywood such as Sunset Boulevard or Mulholland Drive, the humour is biting, satirical and self-effacing. Wakefield establishes himself as a unique voice in cinema and one to watch.","user":"kanesenes","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"BERSERK is twisted, hilarious and trippy all at once!","rating":10,"date":"11 April 2019","review":"A movie within a movie, the story cleverly plays in to the classic format of a film script as the driving meta narrative to the film. The tension between Wakefield and Cannon's characters feels true to so many male friends in their late twenties that I know. Shot beautifully in the glamorous hills of Hollywood through the lens of a mushroom trip. Make some popcorn, grab your funny friend that loves a twisted story and watch this movie.","user":"bonniefwright","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"Don't call the police when you are high.","rating":6,"date":"14 April 2019","review":"Some Spoilers.<br><br>Evan (Rhys Wakefield) a Kato Kalin clone and wannabe actor/scriptwriter gets dropped by his agent. His agent agrees to look at his script if he can get it finished and get Raffy River (Nick Cannon) to commit to it. He takes his writer's block over to Raffy's house. They figure out the reason they can't finish the script is that they have never been scared...enter the drugs and weird stuff on Halloween night.<br><br>They do stuff and get scared. And not to give too much away, a person gets killed...Don't call the police when you are high. Raffy's girlfriend (Nora Arnezeder) shows up after pictures of Raffy and another girl gets posted on the Internet.<br><br>What I didn't figure out was how she got a blood stain on her dress. It wasn't there, it was there. I think they cut a scene with the dead man.<br><br>This is not a complex or twisty film, although they try to make it that way at the end. I did find it interesting and entertaining. Wasn't crazy about the ending.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[2,4]}]
