[{"title":"Carol Of The Bells is a wonderful Christmas drama film.","rating":9,"date":"14 April 2020","review":"This movie touched my heart because it was filled with happy reunions it gives a voice to to the world of developmental disabilities and adoption. It also contained important lessons about confronting the past similar to Disney's The Lion King, as both movies teach that you must make peace with the past to truly move forward. The story is good and the set design was amazing. The Johnson house was beautiful both inside and out. The city of Bakersfield was ideal choice to shoot an old fashioned film because the city has many old fashioned buildings like the churches and Woolworth's antique store and diner. Surprisingly, I connected with the private detective in the movie played by Dale Oprandy, because I love detectives and I relate to them because I'm good at solving problems and using logic and reasoning like they do.","user":"grantdan","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Carol of the bells","rating":10,"date":"14 April 2020","review":"Carol of the bells is a family drama film. The story of carol of the bells is when Scott finds his biological mother and finds out she has Down Syndrome. I felt happy and sad because he wants his son Jeremy to see carol and I felt sad because Scott doesn't want to talk to his biological mother and Scott just wants to move on. I connected to this story because it touches me deep down. The actor Helen Harris who played the character of Donna Mills was frustrated because Karen read a letter to her.","user":"nabransby","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Another great feel good Christmas movie","rating":10,"date":"14 April 2020","review":"\"Carol Of the Bells\" is about a man with cerebral palsy trying to find her biological mother, and he is shocked to see that she has down syndrome. At first, he gives up trying to find her, but his wife encourages him to reconcile with her, and they form a friendship. It is a feel good movie with a deep message. This story made me feel happy and sad at times. It made me feel happy when he finally celebrated Christmas and his son's birthday, because he finally cares about all that. It made me feel sad when his mother's mother didn't want them to see each other, because she doesn't know how that will affect Carol's mentality.\nRJ Mitte, who played the main character, Scott Johnson, gave a powerful performance as a person trying to escape his past. I really connected to him because he's struggling to forgive his mother for all of the bad things she did to him. Yuly Mireles, who played Scott's wife, Karen, also gave an impeccable performance as a woman trying to get her husband to reconcile with his mother. She is the glue that's keeping this family together. Elijah Maximus, who played their son, Jeremy, plays a child who you immediately fall in love with because he is...just the cutest little peanut. He's important to the story because he wants his father to care about Christmas and his own birthday. Andrea Fay Friedman, who played Scott's mother, Carol, the title character, was very good in this movie because you are convinced when she's sad because she misses her son. Donna Mills, who plays Carol's mother, Helen Harris, is a misunderstood woman who's running Carol's life. She's important to the story because she is trying to keep this family apart.\nThe technical aspect that helped tell the story is the cinematography, which is what I love about movies. This movie is beautifully filmed, like the shot of the tiny hand and the big hand holding each other. All of the lights on the set really stand out, like the establishing shots of the Johnson house, and the shot of the Christmas tree at the end. The drone shots of the city made this movie cinematic. The cinematography helped tell the story because, as a Christmas family movie, it should be a well-lit, well-shot picture, which it was.\n\"Carol Of the Bells\" is a movie about a broken family being brought back together, which is what Christmas is all about. In my opinion, it is an honest, heart-felt, meaningful movie that deserves to be shown every Christmas season.","user":"ryansurf-32791","rank":[1,1]}]
