[{"title":"My kind of humor","rating":8,"date":"7 August 2003","review":"This film is very funny....the teaming of Martin and Hawn proved an hilarious combination. Both actor's are accomplished in the comedy department and this is no surprise why this film works (well for me it does). Gwen (Hawn's character) cons her way into the life of Martin's...simply by using her wonderful imagination. After meeting him while working, she has a one night fling with him and somehow decides she wants to live in his newly built house. The only problem is Newton Davis (Martin's character) has no clue to what she's up to. The tricky predicaments she places Martin and herself in, are a treat to watch....a zany, clever comedy in my opinion. Please don't be misled by the rating on IMDb, because it really is an injustice....it is an enjoyable movie.<br><br>My vote 8/10.","user":"AppleBlossom","rank":[46,47]},{"title":"Quirky, witty rom-com fully entertains","rating":9,"date":"9 October 2003","review":"Wonderful romantic comedy with two of our brightest comedic stars.<br><br>Newton Davis (Steve Martin) is a bored, jilted architect who has little to no zest for life left in him. Gwen (Goldie Hawn) is a beautiful waitress with a checkered, ambiguous past who manages to catch the fringes of Davis's imagination by flaunting her various and sundry eccentricities and hinting just the tiniest bit, to the true person beneath the visage she has assumed.<br><br>Through a series of strange, fantastical, desperate decisions Gwen and Newton find themselves in a very precarious situation.<br><br>It is not long before Gwen becomes the very cynosure of Newton's life, and before he knows it, he's tasting the worm and wriggling helpless upon the hook that is Gwen.<br><br>I love this movie and watch it often. It is uplifting and creative. It has been called \"campy\" by some, but I find no camp in it. I have known people very much like Gwen's character, and realize the reality she portrays in this production. It reminds me of many beloved people from my past.<br><br>It gets a 8.8/10 from...<br><br>the Fiend :.","user":"Elswet","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"all i can say is... excellent!!","rating":7,"date":"7 August 2003","review":"all i can say is that, this is my all time favorite movie and i dont know what but there is something great about this film.  goldie hawn stars as gwen, a conartist who happens to stumble along the newly built house of newton davis after a one night stand in boston. it truly brings out the great giggly goldie hawn's humor and steve martin is at his best, they work great together.  i give this film an 11/10. dont rent it... buy it! trust me on this one.","user":"Nicholson74","rank":[24,26]}]
