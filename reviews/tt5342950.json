[{"title":"Decent DRAMA- Not a Mystery or Thriller","rating":6,"date":"10 December 2019","review":"This is MISCHARACTERIZED as a Mystery or Thriller or Suspense. It is a good Drama. And as a drama, albeit almost a ONE person drama, it is decent. All the itinerant characters are acceptably played and Watts is the keystone. I wouldn't pay money to see it, but few movies are worth paying to see anymore. But for a cyberflix of catmouse viewer it's okay, then if you really like it go pay to see it or buy it.","user":"jamosmonk","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Nothing, over and over","rating":2,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"It seems the creator of this movie wrote in a scene in the bath so he could tell funders he had a nude Naomi Watts and they gave him the cash. There seems no other way this script would have made it to production. It's barely a draft.","user":"catebaum","rank":[28,46]},{"title":"A pleasant surprise.","rating":8,"date":"14 October 2019","review":"I can only applaud this movie for portraying the most believable picture of anxiety and mental issues.\nAnd I love how we get the picture painted of New York and the world outside June's apartment only by looking out of her window and the occasional news broadcast.<br><br>This is the kind of movie I really want to re-visit. But I don't look particularly forward to another go at this darkness..\nAnyway..\nBy the end you really feel like you know this woman. Even though we have only had insinuations about her life before we meet her. Insinuations is in fact key in the telling of this story.\nThis movie is in my opinion very well written, very well, directed and very well acted.\nAs a result I was very pleasantly surprised.","user":"sevengunner","rank":[13,19]}]
