[{"title":"Possibly the worst movie ever made, in a good way.","rating":7,"date":"17 May 2009","review":"This film is a riot. It's badness is epic. It is hard to know where to begin in terms of describing the experience of Solarbabies, but one could start by saying that a central episode involves a chase scene of children dramatically escaping from a futuristic special-forces police force by ROLLER SKATING through the DESERT. I am not making this up.<br><br>The completely random plot and incredulously goofy bonding/friendship scenes between the child-prisoners and their glowing-ball alien friend could only have been the product of coked-out brainstorming sessions of Hollywood types in the 80s.<br><br>Are children lovable prisoners of a Nazi-Fetish, post-apocalyptic corporation/government agency that inexplicably decides to profit by running a child-labor camp in the desert? Check. Are the children also forced to play an arena sport involving roller skates? Check. Does a glowing alien ball appear randomly and befriend the children, with no apparent connection to anything else in the film? Check. Do the children breakdance with the glowing alien ball-friend? Check. Does the glowing alien ball require the children to escape the prison and go on a quest? Yep. Do the children \"escape\" simply by roller-skating away from the \"prison\" (through a desert)? Um, yes. Does the glowing alien ball-friend require the children to join hands in a ritualized new-age circle of friendship/love in order to achieve its full glowing alien ball powers? You betcha.<br><br>If this movie were any better, I would give it one star. But it charges so far past the normal constraints of the badness boundaries that it comes out on the other side and emerges as something that is actually pretty entertaining and fairly compelling. The bar starts out low, but the filmmakers just keep on lowering it, going way past the zero point, and actually discovering new ways to make a bad movie worse. It is like art in reverse.","user":"AllstonRockCity","rank":[27,32]},{"title":"Rollerskating orphans vs fascist government","rating":10,"date":"5 January 2007","review":"If you don't love cheesy scifi....are too cool and all, don't bother. I mean it. But if magic alien spheres, weird roller sports, tiretown, and eco warriors make you happy, than this is your movie. It has a subtle beauty. 80s madness at its best. From the misunderstood tribal kid who calls birds to the cool mascot hearing impaired kid, its just, well its just....just see it. The hair and music alone are worth it, even if you do not realize how awesome the story is. Check out the cut offs. The only conceivable reason this movie is not in any hall of fame is because there is no award for Best Cheesy Sci Fi, or ...people just suck. Givin that, I am sure there IS an award somewhere. So do not deny yourself the futuristic bad news bears on skates. Why, afraid you may pull out those old hot pink wheeled roller-skates you know you have? Afraid you may try to save the world in a spray painted tank top? I know I am.","user":"sqwrll","rank":[27,35]},{"title":"One of my favorites when I was a kid!","rating":9,"date":"9 October 2003","review":"My dad had a strange habit of taping all 48 hours of the free HBO<br><br>weekends when I was a kid.  Fortunately for me, that's how I found<br><br>some of my favorite films!  When I'd stay home from school with<br><br>the flu, I'd sift through the tapes and watch whatever caught my<br><br>eye.  After I saw this one, it became my regular \"sick day\" film and<br><br>one I'd watch any time I was just hanging around on a rainy<br><br>afternoon.  I remember I loved it because it was about kids doing<br><br>something about their problems and making the situation better -<br><br>heck, they saved the world!  That's the kind of film every kid likes!","user":"pummykin","rank":[40,57]}]
