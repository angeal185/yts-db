This story centers around a the complexities of a relationship. A beautiful, and timely, reminder that in this crazy world we will all struggle but we can hang onto faith and love.<br><br>Parents should know that there are intense scenes and we do not think that the movie is suitable for kids under ten, or kids who can't talk through serious topics with you afterward.<br><br>We have a small group discussion guide for this posted on our website. Down The Hobbit Hole Blog dot com. We also have a full parent review up and Bible study questions for it.<br><br>We were really impressed with this movie and left better for having watched it!","user":"downthehobbitholeblog","rank":[38,58]}]
