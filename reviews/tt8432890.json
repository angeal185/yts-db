[{"title":"Heartwarming","rating":10,"date":"5 February 2019","review":"Sam and Elvis is an inspiring story, clearly illustrating the true meaning of family. The story takes place in the south though it could take place anywhere throughout the United States.<br><br>Themes of foster care and adoption woven through the story will win your heart. As the story goes on you really begin to like the characters. The young woman is empowered by her newly found family to make tough decisions.<br><br>I really like the dogs at the end with the reference to animal shelters. Well done.","user":"mcnabbdlm","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Sam and Elvis tugs on the heartstrings while tackling relevant human topics","rating":10,"date":"23 July 2019","review":"I loved this film.
