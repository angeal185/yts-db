[{"title":"Nice sequences without a full general idea","rating":7,"date":"2 October 2018","review":"I watched this film the other day in the movie theater mainly out of interest in the theme; 8 bored teenagers passingen through summer with sex and mischief. And others I've heared of watched it mainly because of the sensation and explicit scenes, also to be found in the book this film was based on. The film sure delivers this situation, but nothing more. A general idea and direction misses a bit.\nThe film is divided in 4 main parts that focus each time on one of the 8 teenagers. It takes the 4 parts to fully reconstruct the thruth behind the summer of their lives. But at the end, knowing the whole story didn't gave a real feeling of satisfaction. So the film doesn't really succeed in digging deeper that the sensation it delivers.\nNevertheless the film still amuses you enough to finish it with pleasure thanks to some amuseable scenes.","user":"timvandenbranden96","rank":[23,32]},{"title":"Very entertaining movie","rating":8,"date":"30 September 2019","review":"I enjoyed watching the movie. Nice to see a movie that does not follow the cliches or take itself to seriously. I can't believe I never heard of this movie before. Way better then the over hyped \"De Premier\" movie.<br><br>The movie starts great, loses momentum after 1/4, but picks up halfway to the end.\nThe scenes were well done, but the way they combine was a bit messy, that is my only complaint.<br><br>Very good acting, the 8 kids were played very convincingly.<br><br>Overall great and entertaining movie, not the best, but a breath of fresh air in times were lots of mediocre movies come out all the time.","user":"pieterluxman","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"A Wonderful Young Ensemble Cast are Cut Adrift in This Messy Vice-produced Drama","rating":6,"date":"6 October 2018","review":"Rene Eller's adaptation of a shocking novel by Elvis Peeters has all the hallmarks of its Vice co-producers sub-Mondo, faux docudrama approach. This makes for a queasy mix of wrong-headed moralising and vapid sensationalism that seems cribbed from REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. <br><br>The film has a slightly Rashomon-structure, as four of the film's gang of privileged delinquents tell their differing versions of events. The latter version is from the ringleader Thomas (played with real sleazy noxiousness by Aime Claeys), and pulls in the film's most difficult narrative strand, namely that of the perverted mayor's sex scandal. This whole section is problematically rendered, as the film seems to hint at the idea that child-sex scandals may not be about the exploitation of innocents. There is a damaging disconnect in the film between what is being shown, the way it is being shown and the wider context within which these things could be said to operate. None of this would have really been so much of an issue if Eller didn't so devotedly follow the Vice handbook and attempt to blur boundaries between factual and fictional forms of narrative address. <br><br>What is undeniable is that Eller has been able to extract strong performances from his young cast, made up mainly of non-professionals. It is a shame then, that the material to which their great efforts have been put to the service of, is so trivially worked out. A little less fake meta-textuality and this may have been something more like Stephen Frears' BLOODY KIDS (1980).","user":"Marc_Horrickan","rank":[11,23]}]
