[{"title":"It's a good 'flick', not as highlighted by most of the critics!","rating":8,"date":"13 July 2018","review":"Tone, Script &amp; Story: Story revolves around hockey player Sandeep, how he enters national team, gets injured, even gets out and then makes a comeback, this time as a captain.<br><br>I liked the motivation that got him going for the first time (woman), it was terrible to see it going away for the next time, but this time it came in the name of country. This time the captain won on dual grounds. If it's shown how he is a captain, a little bit of team game could have been shown. I still liked the thin story line based on fastest drag-flicks.<br><br>Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: What came to my mind was Sandeep Singh himself was a consultant. Despite that it appears 'unees bees' when it comes to reality.<br><br>Music: Music was average. Acting: I liked acting from all leads and some of them were a real treat.<br><br>Final Verdict: It's a good 'flick', not as highlighted by most of the critics! A biography you must not miss!","user":"muvi-fan-73","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"Must watch","rating":10,"date":"14 October 2018","review":"Well made movie.
