[{"title":"Simply awful","rating":2,"date":"27 November 2015","review":"Have you ever watched a film that it seems longer than it actually is? Have you ever felt that the ending is so near but it turns out that you're nowhere near the half of it? This is the case with this one.<br><br>To start off, the story is nothing exciting or original but just the opposite - it's boring and predictable. The dialogues are bad and the way they are delivered makes them even terrible. It appears the director and the writer ran out of ideas and decided to fill the script with screaming and curse words which makes the film feel dull. The characters have no depth or development as the story progresses. No character stands out, none of them is really likable or memorable.<br><br>The acting is very poor. There are some scenes that are meant to be dramatic but because of bad acting they look funny. The actors make strange facial expressions which doesn't suite the situations their characters are in. The main actor has the same expression throughout the whole film as if he's constantly wondering what is going on. All actors are overacting and trying too hard.<br><br>The music used is calm and ambient but it's inappropriate for this kind of story (after all, it's about people trapped in a limo underwater). The visual pleasure is also ruined by the shaking camera even at times when it should be still.<br><br>A film that is not interesting enough to hold attention well. It has many flaws that make it unwatchable.","user":"khan_rado","rank":[45,51]},{"title":"Just let it drown","rating":3,"date":"29 November 2015","review":"Submerged is part about incessant screaming by the stereotypical rich kids and part obscure noir narrative. It's ambitiously fueled by back and forth timelines as well as a shot in the dark for thriller genre, all of which are below standard. The lack of focus, inconsistent acting and bad characterization make it a very suffocating experience to endure.<br><br>Story opens up pretty interestingly with a reinforced car slowly drowning. It would've been better to stick with this core plot, instead it tries to be pretentiously clever with all sort of gangster subplots and highly unmemorable party junkie characters. The main lead has a couple of good scenes, although he still makes awkward expressions here and there. The rest of cast is even more imbalanced and as the pace shifts too many times, the plot ends up muddled and cumbersome.<br><br>Acting is poor all around, mostly because the script only consists of expected blaming and yelling. Not that the characters have any shred of spark in the first place, these people are like 90210 rejects with brasher attitude. To make matter worst, one third of the movie is dedicated to build these personalities without any effective result. Never mind likable, audience probably wouldn't recognize them mid-way through the movie and wouldn't care less about their situation.<br><br>Granted, it has some success with the thriller aspect of being confined in small space, albeit briefly. Then it falls like a rock in river with shady crime drama. There's a good ten minutes of standoff with people showing up literally behind each other while pointing gun. As if the random materialization isn't bad enough, the characters even engage in melee showdown while the camera insanely spins around them while they are making stupid faces.<br><br>Submerged has one decent idea, which it intentionally ruins with so many awful presentation fiasco. This is an allegory of strapping a cinder-block to oneself and jumping off the bridge.","user":"quincytheodore","rank":[16,19]},{"title":"Some people are in the wrong jobs!","rating":1,"date":"28 November 2015","review":"I agree with the viewer Radomir, this movie is SIMPLY AWFUL no clue what the other viewers was watching saying \"it is a good thriller\", his brain must be wired wrong or he works for the people behind this cinematic crap; it seriously belongs to the trash can, an insult without an inch of common sense. Everything Radomir said is true, the acting is bad, the the story lacks and the action are of the dumbest i ever seen. I feel sorry for Tim Daly and Mario Van Peebles who i deem superior to such commercial garbage,and i watched this movie for, but as usual the attractive people instead of talented get in the front. The only good actor playing the main lead brother is Cody Christian who is currently working on Teen Wolf and Pretty Little Liars, and he was killed off!SHOCKER!Im not gonna resume all the movie but in brief only the parts and characters that really got on my nerves. Now i gotta say that actor from Chicago PD Samuel C Hung who plays Brandon in this movie was he worst disappointment, he just cannot play the crazy, his acting was ll over the map, overdone it, i just wanna yell\" go back to Intelligence sit behind the computer and keep your mouth shut\" ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL! The worst part was to watch the death of 5 people just to save the rich spoiled girl, after watching the leading actor,throughout the movie just sitting in the driving seat of a limo with a wound in his leg daydreaming and look around doing practically nothing,he suddenly gets creative to save the rich brat, he could have done that earlier saving everyone or at least try! All i wanted to do is to rip both characters apart! Then the two s****rs \"driving in the sunset\" at the end with her papa' blessings?? Please do no waste 99 min of you life on this sh**, i have been regretting that ever since.SERIOUSLY WRITERS?? Please You need a change of career!","user":"larkinbelle-180-887713","rank":[19,27]}]
