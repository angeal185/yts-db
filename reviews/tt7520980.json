[{"title":"I signed up to IMDB just to warn you!","rating":1,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"Well. I liked Rocky and this made Kickboxer look like 9/10. Nothing redeemed this film. I could have overlooked the poor acting and dialogue if the fight scenes were any good - but the Power Rangers fight scenes were better.<br><br>The IMDB Reviews are becoming ridiculous. 10/10 Posted by Elvis maybe.","user":"grahamdrysdale-31049","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Absolute Junk!","rating":1,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"Horrible acting! Horrible romance! No fighting till the last ten minutes. Only in 2.0 Stereo? Its 2019 ffs. Looks like it was a movie made in the backyard on someone's phone. Complete shet","user":"chadhunter-59180","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Wanted it to be okay","rating":2,"date":"4 November 2019","review":"Wow! I don't even know what to say about this one. I think it must've been a personal passion piece for someone. Almost no action, even cut out and eluded to action on a number of occasions. Kinda had the setup for a Rocky-esque take but fell really short. Acting was on par with a telanovela and had that feel but not even as much relationship development. Very poor writing.\nFar and away the worst movie I've watched all the way through out of boredom in a long time.\nImpressively bad.\nKudos on finding the bald discount Edward Norton looking guy, though.","user":"livebigpenguin","rank":[1,1]}]
