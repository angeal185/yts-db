[{"title":"Funny and agreeable screwball farce well shot in Miami by the great filmmaker Fernando Trueba","rating":7,"date":"22 February 2015","review":"A very pleasant romantic comedy plenty of humor , emotion , fun scenes and mayhem . Oscarized director Fernando Trueba , also writes the interesting and bemusing script along with prestigious screenwriter/director as well as brother David Trueba .This bewildering farce deals with a young gallerist (Antonio Banderas , he gives entertaining performance , though he fights to surmount by overacting) is in love with two sisters at the same time . As a fabulously wealthy divorcée (Melanie Griffith) to a mobster (Danny Aiello) and her sister , an intelligent , sensible woman (Daryl Hanna) , then Art falls in love with the younger one . In order to solve the problem he decides to invent his own twin-brother called Dart . Two many women , so little time. <br><br>Earthy as well screwball comedy with romantic elements , antics , amusements , contrivances , twists and turns ; including engaging performances , adequate set design and being delightfully filmed . ¨Two much¨ results to be other of the innumerable stories to deal with romantic loves , being developed in mirth , lively and vital style . An enjoyable story in which a rogue con swindles abstract pictures selling to deceased people and discovers the opposite sex on the way by means of two attractive sisters , both of whom utterly different ; it is plenty of twisted moments , moving feelings and fun finale . It is a light , wistful romantic comedy , easy to watch , and easier to love . ¨Two much\" is Trueba's return to top form, with an intelligent and enticing script written by Fernando and his brother David Trueba adapted from a Donald Westlake novel ; screen-writers use amusing situations to give us a good movie in a high sense and intimate sensitivity and that kept me entertained for the almost two hours of duration . It is well set and is as marvelously filmed as it is written and acted . This is one of those rare gems that does not stray from its purpose - to be a celebration of love and romance and humorous tale of a young controlled by his wishes . The film is light and never somber , no small accomplishment from Fernando Trueba and his team . Filmed in his usual formal and luxurious style , without leaving a trace the joyful themes , in terms of nice developing and narrative excitement . Fine acting by Antonio Banderas as Art Dodge , a roguish Miami art dealer and his twin brother Dart , as he pretends to be his own brother in order to pursue his new fiancée . Sympathetic acting by Melanie Griffith as Betty Kerner who thinks he'll make a virile third husband . In the film, Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith leave each other at the wedding altar for other people . However, in real life, the two actors fell in love during filming of this movie in 1995 and married a year later and soon became parents to their daughter Stella. Very good support cast formed by prestigious veterans such as Austin Pendleton , Allan Rich , Vincent Schiavelli , Phil Leeds , Sid Raymond and special mention to the great Elli Wallach who recently passed away . Furthermore , some known Spanish secondaries such as Gabino Diego and Santiago Segura . Colorful and glimmer cinematography in Panavision by Jose Luis Alcaine , one of the best Spanish cameramen , including gorgeous exteriors filmed on location in Miami . Jolly as well as lively musical score by Michael Camilo in Cuban style . <br><br>This simple , attractive and delightful motion picture was well directed by Oscar-winning director Fernando Trueba , as the flick is entertaining and well worth your time . His first success was Ópera Prima (1980) following the style of the \"Madrid comedy\". Trueba had major success with Sé Infiel y No mires Quién (1985) also known as : Be Wanton and Tread No Shame , starting a longer collaboration with the producer Andrés Vicente Gómez . He went on directing numerous successes such as Coarse salt , Year of Enlightment , Milagro de Candeal , Niña De Tus Ojos or The Girl of Your Dreams , Calle 54 , Embrujo De Shanghai , Chico and Rita and recently : The Artist and the Model. The multi-award winner in Spain Fernando Trueba was President of the Spanish Academy of Motion Picture Arts and he received the 1994 Oscar for Best Foreign Film to Belle Epoque (1992)and when accepting his Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, director (Fernando Trueba) said: \"I would like to believe in God in order to thank him for this prize, but I only believe in (Billy Wilder), so... Thank you, Mr. Wilder!\". Wilder himself reportedly phoned Trueba a few days later for acknowledgment and told him: \"Hello Fernando, I'm God\" . And this ¨Two much¨ , it was a big success in Spain and a considerable flop in the US .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Pure Westlake: Comedy of Depression","rating":9,"date":"30 January 2006","review":"A great adaptation of one of Donald Westlake's sad-sack comedies, in this case about Antonio Banderas, an unsuccessful art gallery owner who ekes out his income by a variation on the Bible Salesman scam. He winds up engaged to a funny, screeching Melanie Griffith, in lust with her sister -- and Melanie's gangster ex-husband is after him.<br><br>This won't be to everyone's taste: Westlake's humor is a lot like Tim Burton's and it's a shame Burton has never tried his hand at one of Westlake's novels. None of the screen adaptations of his works have served him well, although the hard-to-find HOT STUFF, from his own script works well.<br><br>But this is about as good as it gets, with a perfect supporting cast, including Eli Wallach, Darryl Hanna, Danny Aiello and the woman who can make you laugh while she's having a nervous breakdown: Joan Cusack. Give this a try. And if you know Tim Burton, suggest he try a Dortmunder novel or two.","user":"boblipton","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Funny movie with supporting cast as main attraction","rating":7,"date":"14 July 2002","review":"This movie has enough funny moments with some outstanding performances of Joan Cusack and (even though in a very small role) Vincent Schiavelli as Sommelier, watch and see what I mean, I fell of my chair with the few scenes with him. For me 7 out of 10.","user":"jzwetsloot","rank":[9,11]}]
