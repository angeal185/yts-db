[{"title":"Loved this movie definitely worth watching","rating":8,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"A good movie with many intense moments, a great plot, and stellar acting. The only downside to this movie is that it is not an original movie-it is one of hundreds of apocalyptic zombie films.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[48,50]},{"title":"Pretty Good","rating":7,"date":"18 December 2013","review":"Let me start off by saying I haven't read the book yet, so I have no idea how they compare. However, this was a pretty good movie overall. Many zombie movies are merely mindless gore and violence disguised within some fragile thing that doesn't even deserve to be called a plot. However, World War Z has a much better plot than most other zombie movies. One thing I noticed right away is that this movie actually made me jump in surprise several times. It's very suspenseful, and truly worthy of being called a \"zombie horror movie,\" as opposed to the plethora of predictable, unsuspenseful zombie movies that have come out of Hollywood. Brad Pitt does a great job in his role, although I felt his character lacked definition in many ways. It would be nice if they had \"fleshed out\" the characters a bit more. <br><br>Overall, this movie is definitely worth the watch if you have a couple hours to spare. Not the best movie ever made, but a pretty good one.","user":"mwp-036","rank":[36,42]},{"title":"More sinister than 7 years ago","rating":10,"date":"10 March 2020","review":"Considering what is happening in the world today, this film takes on a different meaning for me, all the more so because both in the book and in the original version of the script the epidemic has its origin in China\nnot to mention the North Korean thread, which is becoming particularly ominous.","user":"dombspace","rank":[15,16]}]
