[{"title":"Realistic","rating":8,"date":"6 May 2017","review":"Emotionally complex. A great, realistic portrayal of the challenges of a troubled family life and of love and friendship. People make mistakes, and mistakes have to be forgiven, is what this movie seems to say. This movie will have you laughing, crying, suspicious, angry and happy until the very end. It didn't really seem to me that the girls actually made a pact. That would be my main complaint about the plot. They did talk about losing their virginity, but didn't really make any plans. Other than that, a really good movie.","user":"bikelvrgirl","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Very good girls and very good movie","rating":8,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"First off, if you read the description and expected this movie to not be cliche then that is your own fault. Obviously there have been movies made before with the same content as this one, but I think the actresses in this one made it their own unique movie. I've never been a fan of Dakota Fanning until this movie, actually. I think it was very cute and a good testament to how much a good friendship can withstand. I'd watch again.","user":"sarahcarolsams","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"never abandon your friend for anyone else","rating":7,"date":"24 June 2014","review":"Just watched it today, and It was a nice film that involved great acting. It could've been a lot better, but I just watched it because of Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Olsen. They are a young and talented. I've seen many films that do the \"let's lose our virginity\" topic. Those others films were kinda comedic in a way but this one is kind of realistic and you feel as if a person would actually do something for their own benefit. That's the real world, trust is very hard to find and the purpose of this movie is to show young teens that losing your virginity just to get over with it might not turn out the way you want it to. It's better to have patience and wait for the right person instead of grabbing anyone nearby . Clark gregg was in the movie playing a doctor and father of Dakota F. character. She see's something she shouldn't have and she also has a broken relationship with her parents. Overall this movie is good but had potential to be great so give it a go. :)","user":"Haider-kazmee","rank":[25,35]}]
