A bit Long Good Friday meets Dynasty and more or less credible plot if you ignore New Girl Jess is totally unfazed by seeing people murdered in front of her on her first day. Jess may as well be wearing a t-shirt that says I have An Agenda You Will Find Out About Later in A Twist. Acting is good enough, for this kind of film. Then other plot elements get thrown in like a team of vaping teenagers designed it based on the last Netflix they saw. I can see it is low budget, made with a lot of people mucking in and there is nothing wrong with that. Ropey effects and saving money by filming in the lobbies of office buildings or whatever is fine. But the story just goes off the rails. Law enforcement of any kind is completely absent in this reality, despite suicide vests and heaps of bodies. A Hacker is not what he seems, but is in fact still a Hacker, so why would the people he works for need him to pretend to be something else to do what he does. Why doesn't his real employer just let him do the thing they cleverly get the gangster to force him to do? There is no reason for him to intersect with gangster family. It just made no sense at all. Why does the gangster have to turn out to be not who we think he is sexuality wise, how does that add to the story? His relationship with Jess, not the one she pretends she has but the actual one (confised, you should be...) doesn't need to connect in the way it does for her motivation to be what it is. It's just a weird twist serving nothing but its own twistiness. It's 6th formers trying to be too clever.<br><br>I won't spoil the end, I will leave that to the screenwriter, but Nicholas Brendon shows up at the 11th hour for the 5 minutes he is in it, totally justifying his place as 4th on the billing.","user":"Mark-457","rank":[2,3]}]
