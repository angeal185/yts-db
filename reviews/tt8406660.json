[{"title":"My review is scarier than the movie","rating":12,"date":"12 January 2020","review":"Best movie ever, The entire cast deserve awards. The director is a genius.\nMy account is brand new so there's no reason to doubt my review.","user":"movieman-25353","rank":[35,47]},{"title":"Tedious and far too long","rating":4,"date":"12 January 2020","review":"This really isn't a good movie.<br><br>Right from the start the majority of characters are totally unbelievable and the acting below par. To be fair to the cast, many of them don't have much experience, so it is down to the director to guide and get the most out of them - which they clearly didn't.<br><br>The story isn't that good to begin with and being stretched to 1h 46m makes it something of a trial to stay awake through. I was very relieved when the end credits finally appeared.<br><br>There is no sense of atmosphere or drama to bring the viewer in to the world of the characters. It is like watching endless slides of someone's boring holiday snaps.<br><br>You'll get more tension and fear from watching a washing machine on spin cycle.","user":"mjsreg","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Nay","rating":3,"date":"12 January 2020","review":"While it's not the worst film there is, it's still below average.<br><br>The excecution is quite flawed and feels rather cheap, from the direction to the weapon FX. But a couple of gory melee effects were not bad.<br><br>The Story is simple and didn't make too much sense.\nThe script is poor, some of the actors did alright with what was given, some did not.<br><br>I've watched worse, but there is certainly no need to spend time on this one.","user":"LoremIpsum321","rank":[15,19]}]
