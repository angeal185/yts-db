[{"title":"So Wrong, it's Just Plain RIGHT","rating":17,"date":"17 May 2001","review":"One day someone said, \"I'd like to make a movie featuring a bottle of hooch that makes people melt into multi-colored ooze.  I think I'll also add \"sub-plots\" about insane homeless vets, murder, necrophilia, gang-rape, castration, and police brutality.  Oh, and it's a COMEDY.\"<br><br>Anyone who blasts the movie probably had no idea what they were getting into.  Yeah, the story - if you want to call it that - is flimsy at best, but the film is punctuated by some inventive effects, some nice camera work, and a hysterical mostly-improvised Doorman character played by James Lorinz.<br><br>Summed up, if you like your movies dispicable, reprehensible, obnoxious, offensive, crude, and downright nasty, pick this one up.  You won't be disappointed.","user":"RevRuin","rank":[45,47]},{"title":"A movie taken out of context...","rating":7,"date":"17 May 2000","review":"Yes, I actually thought this was better than some recent horror/comedies I've seen.  Certainly superior to Urban Legend or Scream.  I'm positively stunned by the fact that people would see the cover for this movie, read the title and synopsis, watch it, and then complain that this flick is offensive.  For crying out loud, what do you expect from a film whose promotional literature shows a melted transient's head in a toilet bowl? Casablanca?  Anyone dumb enough to see this movie and be taken aback by its admittedly sordid contents has exactly what they have coming to them.","user":"xtonybueno","rank":[83,95]},{"title":"Hypnotic! Dripping in class, and really very well done","rating":14,"date":"14 December 2001","review":"If you've ever seen the cover for this movie, either sitting on a shelf in some video store or found it hidden in the bargain bin underneath the likes of 'What Lies Beneath' or Titanic' and you've simply thought, no way will i ever let this gross looking booger grace my v.c.r, friends let me just say, you'll be missing out on the treat of a lifetime.<br><br>It's strange when you discover movies and to what degree they affect you, for me it was writing down every line of dialogue that i found amusing and memorable, and from the first scene to the last, every line is a gem, the camerawork is fluid and precise, who knew that years later the director James(Jim)Muro would later lend his steadicam talents to such high brow fare as Strange Days, Heat and even more so Point Break, will he ever consider taking another shot in the directors chair?<br><br>As for the acting, spot on, these guys were total unkowns to me, apart from R.L. Ryan who turned up in stuff like The Toxic Avenger and Eat and Run, but everyone involved infront of the camera as well as behind really took the bull by the proverbials, and this is the legacy that they have left us.<br><br>Also if you like me like watching out for Producer's or Directors turning up in they're own films, watch out for writer/producer Roy Frumkes as the poor unfortunate buisnessman who gets himself covered in Viper Gue and then proceeds to melt.<br><br>If you ever wanted to see a movie where the cop beats up on a susicious person and then proceeds to throw up on them, or a gang of junkyard bums playing catch with a severed penis, say no more, pay the money for the movie in that bargain bin, because a bargain you are going to get, in every sense of they way","user":"jamesbourke50","rank":[35,40]}]
