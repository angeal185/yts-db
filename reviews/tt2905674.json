[{"title":"Just a massive load of ...","rating":1,"date":"29 January 2015","review":"Horrible acting, even worse animation. A high school crew would have made a better movie. A movie about dinosaurs getting lose in a prison. The dinosaurs were worse animated than Sponge bob. Lighting effects were non-existent. Come on, it's 2014 and you couldn't find a decent graphics artist. Every special effect was like a 15 year old game on the lowest settings. Just please no one watch this movie. Not worth a single second, let be 90 minutes. It was 90 minutes of straight torture. I'm just gonna type nonsense for the last few lines, because there's nothing more to say about this movie. It could be said in one line.. Just do not watch it and please don't let this director or producer make any more movies.","user":"mainoslaatikkoni","rank":[59,71]},{"title":"So bad it can't make it into the \"So Bad It's Actually Good\" category","rating":1,"date":"18 February 2015","review":"It is just wrong. CGI is cheap, monsters/blood/explosions don't connect to the set, to the lights; editing is awkward, sometimes a kill is full frontal, gory details and all, and sometimes it happens off-screen; story is as thin as you probably guessed, lines vary from utilitarian to abscond, with maybe an attempt at making it into genre sub-culture but unconvincingly so.<br><br>And light/camera work is terrible: if you where willing to actually see the faces, the expressions of the people at work in front of you during one of those \"let me explain myself\" scene, you are out of luck one time out of two - which is, in these times of all-digital processing, kind of a shame.<br><br>And it is full of mistakes, big and small, that you'll surely find a list of on this fine website if only people can be coerced to report on them.<br><br>I hope the people who worked that film had fun, where getting paid and all that, and legitimately didn't hold too much hopes for the success of that thing.<br><br>As much as I enjoyed Attack the Block, Pacific Rim or Independence Day or other stuff that people should obviously watch without taking it the least bit seriously, well, we are seriously into Anaconda III or various alligator/saurian Terribly Bad CGI siblings territory here; this is definitely no Snakes On A Plane.","user":"joaophilippe-mb-monteiro","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Poor CGI","rating":2,"date":"30 January 2015","review":"Typical end of the world movie that uses dinosaurs, mainly the raptors. Where as in Jurassic Park they were scary and menacing with top notch effects, here they are cartoonish to the point you can't take them seriously. Hence, this leads to a lack of any suspense thru out the movie.<br><br>When you witness the first kill by a raptor within the first 5 minutes of the movie, you see how cartoonish the whole movie will be. Even the blood is cartoonish. I felt like I was watching something like Song of the South which mixed in live actors with animated characters/background. This was the opposite, live actors/background with animated raptors. I know this is a low budget, but if you can't get it right, then don't do it.<br><br>Most of the actors fulfill various stereotypes and the performances are not worth writing about. Though it was nice seeing veteran actors Ray Wise and Vernon Wells try to make something out of this comedy.","user":"jamdifo","rank":[16,22]}]
