[{"title":"Traumatic, Surreal, Bizarre Masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"I'll start this off with a warning. If you're a mainstream horror fan, you will not like this. It is not The Conjuring, it does not have jump scares, it is a slow movie. It's not scary in the way that most horror films are scary. It doesn't frighten you. It felt traumatic. This is an artsy movie for sure. If you don't like that, don't see it.<br><br>Florence Pugh is absolutely phenomenal. She provides the heart for the film and is what keeps the audience emotionally invensted in such a disturbing film. It's one of the greatest horror performances that I have ever seen.<br><br>The cinematography is stunningly gorgeous. I've never seen a film look so gory and grotesque and yet absolutely beatiful at the same time. It's some of the best cinematography that I've seen in years. The art direction is also phenomenal in providing us with a floral, candy colored, nightmare world.<br><br>And Ari Aster's screenplay and direction is what makes this so special and separates it from other horror pieces. It's slow, methodical, eerie. But the characters are psychological and deep. The dialogue is real and colorful. The plot is surreal and disturbing. He let's the scares crawl at you as opposed to jump at you. He allows you to see what will happen, process it, feel the shock of what's about to happen, and then still shock you even more when it happens.<br><br>This film will be divisive. I have no doubt that many people here will hate this. However, while this is a challenging film, it's also a great film. Halfway through a character says something along the lines of \"That was so messed up, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.\" I suggest that audiences take this advice.<br><br>PSA, this movie is extremely violent, bloody, and gory. It's pretty horrifying and it could have stuff that is triggering.","user":"Icecreambenjaminelliott","rank":[1,2]},{"title":"Slow, Overly Long, and Predictable","rating":3,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"When I first saw the trailer, I immediately thought of The Wicker Man. I pushed that aside because I wanted to see the movie without unfair comparisons in mind.<br><br>I thought the precredit scenes set up an interesting scenario and dealt with the relationship issues in a complex way.<br><br>Once we get into the heart of the movie, everything goes down hill...very, very, very slowly. Without giving anything away, everything you expect to happen in this movie does. There are no real surprises and....yeah, The Wickerman.<br><br>I love slow movies, and I dont mind long running lengths. But, there was just no reason for this movie to be 2 hours and 30 minutes. I get that the director loves to watch women sob, but we don't really need all of that.<br><br>I was also disappointed in how the main characters were handled. I hoped they would be given some depth, but they ended up becoming cliche carictures.<br><br>There will be people who find the film full of wonderful, shocking surprises. Those people have probably not delved into horror (or folk horror) in any substantial way. Its all been done before, so why not save your time and money?","user":"mysticzine","rank":[1,2]},{"title":"Long meandering story that doesnt deliver","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2019","review":"Not sure what this is supposed to be. Its definitely not a horror movie. Its not even that scary, has a few unsettling moments but thats it. Its just weird and doesnt really have any dramatic arc or raising the tension. Basically the whole movie is a few strangers saying WTF? constantly and everyone else telling them \" 'ts ok ! guys\"\nAlso besides that, its revolves around a traumatized, annoying and totally without self respect girl that slowly starts benefiting from this weird place. Because of course, we cannot have a film these days without it being a \"personal journey\" of some sorts. Writers trying to be smart and \"deep\".\nYeah nothing beats a bizzare and crazy rituals to make you sane.<br><br>If youre expecting horror and monsters or supernatural, keep going. Its just a weird film with no real ending, resolution, interesting character or events. Albeit with nice filmography and quite good actors it has no real dramatic structure or captivating story.","user":"sumtim3s00n","rank":[612,994]}]
