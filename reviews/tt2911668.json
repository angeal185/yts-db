[{"title":"Not bad for boring evening but with a terrible ending","rating":7,"date":"10 December 2015","review":"Greetings from Lithuania.<br><br>\"Beyond the Reach\" (2014) is nice little flick for some boring evening. It has nothing special, nothing original, nothing really great yet it is an enjoyable thriller, but with a bad ending, very bad ending. <br><br>Michael Douglas was the first and only reason why i saw this flick in the first place. He does not disappoint, but sadly there is almost absolutely nothing to do in here for THIS caliber actor. Jeremy Irvine is quite good in here, but the role doesn't requires much except for physical suffering. <br><br>Overall, \"Beyond the Reach\" was nice little flick. I enjoyed for what it was, but the ending was terrible. That wouldn't happen in real life not in a million years. Who wrote THAT bad ending?","user":"851222","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"Old-school-young versus the new-technology-old","rating":7,"date":"12 October 2014","review":"Occasionally we all get needy. So Ben, a young hunting guide, may perhaps be forgiven for taking a large bribe from an arrogant, ridiculously wealthy and fearless client. The two descend into the Mojave Desert wilderness in order to hunt bighorn out of season. There are many red flags to this, yet Ben's girlfriend just left for college and he is left considering if solitude and poverty are in his future. Deep into the desert it is not long before an incident occurs that sets Ben and Madec, a C.E.O. with a sport utility vehicle that costs over half a million dollars, at odds with each other. It is the old-school-young versus the new-technology-old in a delicious thriller. Michael Douglas, starring as Madec, returns to his stock and trade as a depraved and greedy man who lets no one get in the way of himself and his obsessions. Douglas gives a fine performance, yet he can't carry the film on his own. It is far-fetched, shallow and disjointed at times. The film is, however, compelling and fulfilling in its story and the possibilities it presents. It gives truth to Melville's saying that \"an utterly fearless companion is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\" Seen at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.","user":"Raven-1969","rank":[61,83]},{"title":"Good High Drama in the Desert","rating":6,"date":"19 June 2015","review":"Ultra wealthy businessman , Madec (Michael Douglas), needs a new trophy, a long horned sheep. He hires Ben (Jeremy Irvine) as a tracker to hunt in the Mojave Desert. He thinks he spots a long horned sheep and fires, and he and Ben see that Madec has killed Charlie (Martin Palmer) who lived and roamed in the desert. Madec makes a deal with Ben to cover this up. The way he does this is quite clever. Ben agrees then changes his mind. Madec makes Ben take off his clothes to walk the desert hoping Ben will die. <br><br>As Ben goes off into the hot burning desert (Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!) Madec tracks him in his $500,000 SUV, his rifle, and with binoculars as he needs to see Ben die; and we keep hoping Ben will find something to get out of this predicament. <br><br>The rest of the movie shows Ben struggling to get away from Madec and we do see some surprises so it's not as boring as one might suspect. <br><br>The acting is good all around.<br><br>The ending isn't what I expected, but it'll do. (5/10)<br><br>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff only.","user":"bob-rutzel-239-525430","rank":[16,19]}]
