[{"title":"Why on earth has this got such high ratings","rating":1,"date":"18 November 2017","review":"Why on earth this has a good score rating I will never no, it was so painful to watch, 90 minutes you will never get back again. There is very little story line, with acting that's I would class as a B movie rating, if you are glutton for punishment then watch it, otherwise give it a wide berth and watch something else, watching paint dry would be more entertaining than this.","user":"pig-sick","rank":[32,42]},{"title":"Good concept - bad execution","rating":2,"date":"27 November 2017","review":"This movie has potential - some great scenes of down and out people in the American South - very gritty and well done. <br><br>But alas the whole production didn't pull together, photography was to shaky and closed in. The cop with a tortured past has been done so many times and needs to be downplayed, all those flashbacks are boring. <br><br>Very little research into the mind of serial killers, their trophy gathering, symbols and so on. Wanna be True Detective but fails as its overplayed and comes across as slightly misogynistic in some violent and crude scenes.","user":"tarquin-65274","rank":[12,18]},{"title":"Great idea but hard to watch","rating":3,"date":"8 December 2017","review":"This film has a great idea: following a dollar bill as it changes hands, through a cast of mostly dysfunctional gritty characters, through a tale of murder, alcohol, sex, redneck racism, and drugs in Louisiana. What's not to like? <br><br>Only a few things:<br><br>1. The script<br><br>2. The acting<br><br>3. Wiggle-cam (not enough to induce nausea, but definitely enough to be annoying, intrusive, and an affectation). <br><br>This is one of those films where it's hard to tell what's worse, the acting or the script. <br><br>I think it's a tie. <br><br>The cinematography is well crafted at times, if you can see through the wiggle-cam, but not enough to redeem the rest. <br><br>I sat through the whole thing, but it was difficult.","user":"arthurw421","rank":[10,16]}]
