[{"title":"Take notice","rating":1,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"Please, be aware that this is nothing but nonsense overhyped by either employed shills or the people involved in the production themselves. Don't bother.","user":"pauliecorleone-72628","rank":[22,29]},{"title":"Click-bait","rating":4,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"Another atrocious film that baits you with an inflated rating score only to laugh at yourself for falling for it. Weak script with weaker acting and direction. This is a PBS after-school special...at best.","user":"livinglifing","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"Rating Sins","rating":2,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"When this review was being written the rating was 8.1., which is downright ridiculous. The rating was definitely artificially boosted by the people who were involved in the making of this film.<br><br>The rating this movie now has, has no relation to the film. The story was dull, monotonous and full of lame stereotype remarks. The acting was below average, characters couldn't put any good performance because of their lack of skills and for the low grade script which was riddled with terrible cliches.<br><br>It would be unwise to waste time by watching this film. There are lot of ways to waste time, but unquestionably this movie is not one of them.\nNOT RECOMMENDED,","user":"niaz_islam","rank":[9,11]}]
