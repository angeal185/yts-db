[{"title":"A fairy tale, pure and simple","rating":8,"date":"25 November 2018","review":"In 1984 I saw this movie called Neverending Story. Goofy puppets, the simple story of good vs evil and the added bonus of a child reading the tale and getting caught up in it. I thought it was different than other movies that I was watching at the time and only later I found out it wasn't an American film, but a German one. I loved that movie and in the same positive sense, Die Kleine Hexe is just as goofy and simple and perfect for the telling of a fairy (or in this case, witch) tale.<br><br>The characters are a relatively young witch and her raven familiar breaking tradition from the old and nasty witches that are her seniors. Good vs bad witches, magic done just for fun, talking animatronic animals, what else do you need? Not a perfect film by any means, but a fun and entertaining children's story. I liked it.","user":"siderite","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Excellent movie, excellent acting","rating":8,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"If you don't know this, the writer of the book is famous in Germany /Europe. The book of the little witch is famous in Europe and may be also in the US.\nHowever, this movie -a Swiss German production - is great, I really enjoyed it and Karoline Herfurth is close to brilliant in the role of the little witch and Swiss Mike Schaerer is really excellent in directing the film. The settings are enchanting, CGI is very good but not perfect and if you look at Otfried Preu√üler's message at the end of the movie, I found it is not only for kids.\nEnjoyable movie for the whole family.","user":"mabuse786","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Enchanting family movie","rating":8,"date":"13 November 2018","review":"Old world charm in this magical story of what it means to be good and evil always lose.
