[{"title":"Touching movie","rating":10,"date":"30 March 2018","review":"I can't believe how much I was affected by this movie. I rarely if ever cry watching a movie, and this one brought tears to my eyes. Watching Burt Reynolds examine his life made me think of my own. The mistakes I've made. The joys I've experienced. And how much I regretably just let pass me by. This is possibly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.","user":"jmoore-37639","rank":[68,71]},{"title":"Pleasantly surprised, emotionally touched","rating":9,"date":"30 March 2018","review":"Quite honestly I was prepared to dislike this movie. I couldn't pin down exactly why but was I very wrong. I was extremely touched with this thought provoking look at celebrity and age. I have not seen any actor portray their aging with such honesty in their later movies. Reynolds was fabulous and still as blunt and straight forward in his approach to the part as he has before in most of his movies. Ariel Winter, whose character I detested at the beginning, did an excellent job as Reynolds escort at a film festival in Nashville. His life story was a learning experience for her and a teaching lesson on how growing older comes with trials, tribulations, and regrets which she could learn from as she goes on with her own life. Wonderful acting by both, and a must see movie. Simply put, I think it's the best work Reynolds has ever done.","user":"jakeh","rank":[41,42]},{"title":"Heart warming story of life","rating":9,"date":"28 March 2018","review":"I watched the movie with my elderly parents and all 3 of us really enjoyed this movie. It is a role only Burt Reynolds could do. Good acting. It was heart warming and had good comedy to it. Reflection of a life time with a very entertaining way of telling the story.","user":"markccorcoran","rank":[46,48]}]
