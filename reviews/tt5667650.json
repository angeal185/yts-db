[{"title":"Binge watch?","rating":2,"date":"28 March 2019","review":"The one other review here is ridiculous. The person sez this is a movie they thought they's \"binge watch.\" You binge watch a series not a single movie.<br><br>Fake review.<br><br>The film is pure boring schmaltz. Adrienne Barbeau cannot act. And Corbin Benson will always be The Dentist.","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[15,28]},{"title":"Poor film","rating":2,"date":"27 May 2019","review":"Camera man, directing, sound capture, acting are poor. Fake rating, think twice before you watch. Story line is weak as well.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Beautiful","rating":8,"date":"28 March 2019","review":"I really liked this film. I think there are a lot of films out there that kind of brush over pain and struggle. They are like \"oh this person had bad things happen to them and bam now they are fine\". This film allows the characters to hurt and be real! I liked that it's not super Hollywood it's a real indie drama. The cinematography was also stunning! Makes me want to take a drive up the coast.","user":"merrijamison-461-645297","rank":[10,20]}]
