[{"title":"A very simple review","rating":9,"date":"9 December 2012","review":"There's no point rehashing what many of the other reviews say. I will tell you the one thing that matters: I've only ever cried over 3 movies, 1st when ET died (I was like 8), 2nd at the end of Ice Castles (again, I think I was 8 -- bad year), and finally at the end of this movie. I cried for 30 minutes. Then my wife wanted to watch the ending again because she missed something and I cried again. I don't know why this movie touched me so deeply but it did. You feel for the characters, you fear for what happens next. When the screen goes blank at the end, you fear for what will become of them. This was a powerful film and I highly recommend it.","user":"sjbriggs-1","rank":[93,110]},{"title":"Strong film","rating":9,"date":"30 December 2011","review":"I wouldn't want to say a lot about the story. Perfect Sense is a film you have to see, taste, smell, listen. It's not a Contagion - like movie, it's not a zombie one either, but it could definitely be a post - apocalyptic reality check.<br><br>We could, but we wouldn't want to imagine something like that happening, yet again \"what if\". How strong is the human heart and mind and how could we adapt in such a massive change? This film might suggest a hint.<br><br>Ewan McGregor plays a chef that somehow gets involved with Eva Green, a scientist. Then, all that matters is how these two characters cope with an epidemic that bursts, depriving people their senses.<br><br>I found this film quite enlightening, the performances intense, the music appropriate and, last but not least, the photography/ filming magnificent. Great work from the director David Mackenzie. The end was mind blowing, for me.<br><br>Keep an open mind, look at the big picture and it'll be worth your time.","user":"synevy","rank":[148,185]},{"title":"Poor title for such a profound movie","rating":9,"date":"2 January 2019","review":"I had seen this a few years ago but decided to watch it again after seeing Birdbox. There is a dystopian heaviness that hangs over each of those movies. This one is not exactly a thriller. It is a gut wrenching sci-fi love story. It is also a lyrical commentary on humanity. The music is lush, narration is poetic. The plot is nightmarish with a jarring edge of realism. It is not especially fast paced so those who want crossbows and zombie blood will not like it. This is the \"thinking man's\" end of the world type flick.","user":"luann-lewis","rank":[15,16]}]
