[{"title":"Better than I expected","rating":7,"date":"14 September 2016","review":"Well I must admit to expecting not a lot from this movie however it turned out to be pretty good overall. A couple of small niggles here and there but what movie doesn't have them? <br><br>On with the review! Okay so the movie starts off as pretty much standard stuff, nothing really being given away and it ticks along at quite a sedate pace right up to the actual landmine makes it's appearance. Then the movie immediately grabbed my interest and kept it right up to the very well performed ending.<br><br>The movie does a great job of keeping the viewers on their toes due in most part to the changing pace, location and fully committed characters.<br><br>**Possible spoiler alert here** I think the only real disappointment was that one of the main characters disappears from the movie and never returns throughout. Not unexplained just a little too convenient<br><br>The final scene of the movie makes the whole thing worth watching regardless of how you felt about the rest of it.<br><br>Personally I found it enjoyable","user":"itayla","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Improbable but carried of with aplomb...","rating":8,"date":"12 November 2015","review":"I read all the reviews on here and thought, yeah, another stitch-up job where all the friends on production get together and post fake reviews. But I gave it a shot anyway and, guess what, this delivers and my assumption about fake reviews were blown out of the water. The movie maker, Levan Bakhla, is obviously inspired by the other great movie maker Michael Haneke and it reminded me of Funny Games, one of my favourite movies. Yes, the story can be improbable at times but that doesn't detract from the suspenseful way the director carries you along. It's not your usual revenge movie where the baddie gets his comeuppance, but it comes pretty close to it...with interest. I was totally held by the whole thing, especially in the last thirty minutes.Sterling Knight does a good acting job as Chris and is quite scary. Its ending will have you discussing with friends the outcome. All I can say is, well done, Levan Bakhla. You sure know how to direct a good movie.","user":"patbradley435","rank":[36,58]},{"title":"balancing out the crew 10 star reviews","rating":3,"date":"16 November 2015","review":"Wasn't sure if this one was good or bad cos some of the reviews hid the fact they were crew blowing smoke up our a.rses, so I gave this a watch and it was soon dreadfully apparent it was a stitch up amateur garbage film trying to trick people into watching it.<br><br>Just because you CAN complete a feature length film with lights camera and sound doesn't mean you SHOULD do it. You have to have something to say and this movie had nothing to say. Just some kids who's parents bought them a couple of canon 5Ds, editing software and a drone for Christmas.<br><br>The key is to have a good idea and the idea for this movie is tenuously slight, and that slight idea is stretch so thin it collapses. It didn't have to. with good writing, direction and acting it could have been something, maybe, maybe those things could have made a tense story out of this but we end up with an annoying insulting waste of time. More media clutter to get in the way of anything really insightful or entertaining.","user":"Rob-O-Cop","rank":[51,97]}]
