[{"title":"An effective thriller.","rating":7,"date":"1 April 2007","review":"Wilderness is an effective and brutal thriller/horror movie. The premise is straight forward- a group of juvenile offenders and their keeper out on a camping trip are picked off one by one by a mysterious and ruthless killer with a crossbow a pack of attack dogs and a skill for booby traps. It is brutal, violent, fast moving and visceral. It is quite well made- the tension and pace never drops, which is essential for this kind of movie and there is a gritty, unremitting feel to the movie which works in its favour. The deaths are unpleasant and violent and the characters aren't likable keeping it somewhat unpredictable as to what is going to happen, who is going to die and so on. Wilderness doesn't hold back in terms of the violence and nastiness but still keeps, for the most part a gritty realistic vibe and it works.<br><br>The movie shows you don't necessarily need likable characters but only believable ones to make a movie work. The more likable characters are only more likable by comparison i.e. they are only cowardly or selfish as opposed to being sadistic and cruel. The one character that seems like they may actually be competent and a decent human being is out of the picture comparatively early on. This comes across as lot more credible than those movies which contain groups of supposedly hardened criminals or delinquents who prove to be suitably heroic and noble and band together when it comes to the crunch. The characters here aren't over the top nasty either- they are full of petty meanness and posturing, selfishness and banality without being irredeemably evil as you would probably expect such kids to be in real life. The acting, mostly by fairly unknown young British actors is pretty good and low key- the Brits are generally better at this sort of thing. This gives the film its grittier edge and helps make it a little bit less predictable than it could be. Okay, the designated hero is obvious from the get-go and it isn't too unexpected when most of the unsavoury cast is wiped out but it isn't cloyingly obvious all the way through that things will happened the way you would predict in accordance with movie conventions.<br><br>The movie is not without flaws. The plot isn't always particularly believable or fresh. It seems strange that there is on one prison guard with this group of about ten juvenile offenders out on a supposedly deserted island and the killer seems almost too effective is dispatching his prey although to be fair it works for the movie in terms of the scariness of the villain and some explanation is provided for his skill in this regard. Toward the end when the hunter and his motivation is revealed he is far less effective a bad guy, his motivation and presence slightly contrived (Though still plausible) and he suddenly seems to become a lot less competent in order for him to be defeated. It might have been better if the makers had left the killer a mysterious motiveless figure. There are a few times when the movie does seem to go a bit too far with its nastiness, the flip side of the movie slack of restraint. The way in which some of the gorier death scenes, such as the first dog killing, are lingered on is a bit too much and toward the end some of the character's abhorrent behaviour comes across as a bit much also (Okay we already knew these guys were scum, can we get on with it).<br><br>On the whole a slick, well made and exciting movie which is both helped and hampered, but mostly helped, by it's willingness to be mean spirited and harsh.","user":"Skutter-2","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Welcome to the Wildnerness; we got fun & games!","rating":8,"date":"20 March 2006","review":"Call us uncivilized savages if you must, but who honestly doesn't enjoy raw and barbaric adventure-movies in which the blood and violence literally bursts from the screen? In case you were thrilled by movies like \"Battle Royale\", \"Blood Camp Thatcher\" or even the more classic milestone \"The Most Dangerous Game\", you simply have to see \"Wilderness\"; a brand new British survival-horror effort directed by Michael \"Deathwatch\" Basset. After the suicide of a fellow inmate, a troop of juvenile delinquents  for whom all hope for rehabilitation was given up long time ago  are sent to a prison island for a severe lesson in elementary life-values. On the island, however, a mad-raving psychopath lies in wait for them and even the innocent guards and some random girls become defenseless targets. Trained and equipped like an experienced hunter, the killer annihilates nearly the whole gang by using deadly booby-traps and ravenous dogs. As you can derive from this brief plot description, originality isn't \"Wilderness\" biggest trump and the script doesn't even bother to keep the killer's identity secret for a long time. But seriously, who cares about aspects like these when a film is so adrenalin rushing and blood-soaked? The \"hunting humans\"-premise is mixed with the textbook 80's slasher plot of a revenge-seeking killer, but you aren't given a chance to grumble about the banality, as there is gore and excitement everywhere! The island itself is a captivating location, resulting in masterfully choreographed sequences and some utterly imaginative booby-traps. Unlike in his previous film \"Deathwatch\", Michael J. Basset definitely doesn't cut back on the blood &amp; gore here, and we're gladdened with close-up shotgun action, amputated body parts, chopped of heads and loads of aggressive dog-action! The character drawings are very well processed and Basset fully uses the nihilistic and totally lackadaisical nature of youthful criminals. These young social outcasts don't care about anyone but themselves and pretty soon there are sub plots involving betrayal, jealousy and cowardly behavior. The sound &amp; visual effects are terrific and Peter Robertson clearly has a talented eye for versatile camera-work. Following films like \"Dog Soldiers\", \"28 Days Later\" and \"The Descent\", this \"Wilderness\" is yet another piece of evidence that the British horror industry is working on a remarkable revival nowadays. Highly recommended!","user":"Coventry","rank":[62,93]},{"title":"Had a movie, but lost it!","rating":3,"date":"26 July 2007","review":"I started watching this film, and did what I was suppose to, develop a like or dislike for characters. The story appeared to begin with the bully's, and the bullied. The final twist was predictable, but the characters didn't develop the way they were suppose to. In the end there was one character I wanted to root for, but then they killed him. The line between good and evil was no existent, and the film didn't have the 'all is well in the end' ending. The movie was about justice, but the film served none! It had a lot of potential, and usually, when I watch a movie from the UK Im not disappointed, but this movie left me wanting to re shoot the film myself. Which says, that it was interesting enough to spend time on, but wasn't shot properly, and without that bond that exists between the goer, and a character. To bad it was released in this state! Could have been fantastic!","user":"causeiwantto2001","rank":[8,9]}]
