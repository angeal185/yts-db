In what universe could anyone not love this movie?","user":"stevojaxon","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"Watch this movie!!!","rating":9,"date":"18 October 2019","review":"I loved this movie. I was so lucky to get to see this at Tallgrass Film Festival in Wichita, Kansas. This movie is wonderful. Funny, sweet, sad, endearing and a little bit crazy. Three disabled sorta friends going to a brothel to lose their virginity with none other than the incredible Gabourey Sidibe hired to be their driver. I cannot recommend enough.","user":"saesau","rank":[21,34]},{"title":"Unexpectedly Fabulous","rating":9,"date":"26 January 2020","review":"A buddy movie about 3 differently-abled young men who go on a road trip. It's hysterically funny, moving with great character development, and the actors are pitch perfect.","user":"tankycmg","rank":[19,33]}]
