[{"title":"A movie lover's movie","rating":7,"date":"7 June 2015","review":"Well, it's actually a TV series but I watched the whole thing in one sitting. My jaw dropped. This is not a film for the casual viewer. It is bewildering, full of unattractive people, many of of them with facial ticks, mental problems or just a plain ugliness. The themes are rich and deep, exploring so many aspects of human nature one loses count. The acting by seemingly first timers is first rate. It's reviewed mostly as a comedy but it's not laugh out loud kind of funny. Instead it's a satire on human nature, making one gulp with the truth of the telling. Take heed, don't watch this is you don't like squirming a little bit when faced with the naked truth. But if you're willing to invest yourself in this film, your time will not be for naught. It's not life changing but does make you think and most of all, feel.","user":"jimparrett","rank":[51,59]},{"title":"The laughter and tears of human existence","rating":10,"date":"29 June 2015","review":"What a wonderful experience this was. I confess that I never thought that Mr.Dumont would be able to overlay his unique cinematic vision with humour but he has succeeded and I laughed out loud on many occasions. Yet even amongst what at times is a \"slapstick\" level of humour Dumont's humanity still forms the foundations of this film. To those familiar with Mr Dumont's earlier films the themes in Quinquin are consistent with his previous films – racial and economic tension that results in violence, good and evil and moral responsibility, Christianity, Islam and Pantheism, right wing politics, the media etc and a setting in the Northern France coastal and rural communities that will also be familiar from his earlier films. <br><br>At times \"Quinquin\" almost feels self referential from Mr Dumont's earlier work. Thus we have the tracking shots in country lanes from \"La Vie De Jesus\", the unconventional ( to say the least!) detective from \"L'Humanite\", the farming community from \"Flanders\", the religious conflicts from \"Hadewijch\" the pervasive presence of a possible evil force/the Devil from \"Hors Satan\" and quietly disturbing and unsettling moments of orifices, death and nakedness when we all lie exposed and ready to return to the soil. <br><br>The bizarre but oddly lovable Commandant der Weyden is incompetent but highly proactive compared with Pharaon de Winter's impassivity in \"L'Humanite\". Both detectives appear to be overwhelmed by the sadness of the horror of what they have witnessed. Both need the warmth of physical contact. In L'Humanite Pharaon hugs the killer as if to take away his guilt and in \"Quinquin\" der Weyden allows himself to hug his Lieutenant. Both need to feel the warm flesh of animals, Pharaon with the sow at litter and der Weyden with the horses. Both love/desire an unobtainable woman. <br><br>Again Mr Dumont makes use of disabled people in his cast but he refuses to be a hypocrite and treat these people with sickly sentimentality instead allowing them to appear as distinct individuals. With a large cast of unusual characters it feels to me as if Mr Dumont is asking society \"what is normal?\" We see the character Dany Lebleu spinning around until he falls to the ground ( an idea generated by the actor himself Jason Cirot – so much for exploitation!) but there are many scenes where this movement is mirrored by the supposedly more able- bodied. Mr Dumont questions our prejudices. Is the tantrum of the disabled child at the seaside café any more disruptive than the firecrackers that Quinquin and his gang regularly throw? Many people in a Dumont film have odd physical or character traits but these are accepted not exploited. Thus Quinquin has a hearing aid but this is never remarked upon and forms no part of the narrative. To Mr Dumont different is normal and normal is different.<br><br>The role that animals play in Mr Dumont's films are significant. We are all beasts, all part of nature despite our arrogance, despite our attempts to create a religious basis for our existence outside of nature but we are all \"La bet'humaine\". Surely it is not coincidence that most of the victims end up inside an animal? Ultimately there is no \"killer\" in this murder mystery. Mr Dumont refuses to blame the individual for the deaths in the film. There are motives such as infidelity, depriving someone of their inheritance, racism and so on but Mr Dumont seems to put the real cause of the acts within the context of an evil that overtakes people and causes their actions. The final beautiful scene of Dany looking skywards suggests to me that the possession has left him and the camera tracks away as the evil moves whispering across the fields in search of another victim to overwhelm. <br><br>Quinquin himself is our eyes. He shows the way that the violence of the past, the bunkers, grenades and bullets from the second world war, will overtake the young. Could Quinquin and Eve be the precursors of the tragic Freddy and Marie from \"La Vie de Jesus\"? There is an inevitability about the way that social corruption that will ensnare them and destroy the optimism of their love. The common flash-point for violence in both films is the jealousy towards people of African origin who are, as Quinquin says, \"trying to steal our women\". The humour comes in part from the very familiar Police detective duo tropes of speeding cars and helicopters, guns ( in this film fired aimlessly apart from a self inflicted death) and excited running across the beach/field to doggedly continue the pursuit but to what specific end we never know. Somehow Mr Dumont manages to strike a perfect balance between poignancy and the ridiculous, thus we have a scene where the overwhelmed der Weyden leaves a church only to be greeted by Lte Charpentier in full stunt mode screeching around the corner towards him with his car on two wheels. <br><br>Wonderful, surprising moments occur. Does \"Spiderman\" actually stick to the wall and climb it in the same way that Pharaon appears to levitate in \"L'Humanite\"? Or when Quinquin and his group turn up at the siege with faces inexplicably painted like Imps in a painting by Bosch. Somehow managing to be beautiful, funny, ridiculous and serious all at once, the film contains just about all of the major themes from love, death, relationships, politics, religion and good and evil. Mr Dumont is a unique genius who, like the handful of other true masters, has created his own cinema.","user":"kboote","rank":[27,31]},{"title":"LI'L QUINQUIN is such an eccentric anomaly, defies a uniform cinematic narrative but also a wayward manipulator","rating":7,"date":"1 July 2015","review":"Hailed by CAHIERS DU CINÉMA as the No.1 film of the year innately has a double-edged effect on any film, since this prestige not only auspiciously attracts attention from art-house frequenters, but spontaneously elicits higher expectation as well, so that fewer can break the jinx, either is Dumont's 200-minute rural tale, distributed as a four-episode mini-series originally, now arrives the theatrical version for a binge-watch.<br><br>Actually it is only my second Dumont entry after FLANDERS (2006, 5/10), years before I grow the habit of writing reviews, so I cannot recall why that film had failed to encourage me to watch more of his works. Through these years, my first response towards each Dumont's film perpetually includes some resistance, maybe it is the grimness of the nature of his subject matters, and hopefully the situation can ameliorate after this one.<br><br>LI'L QUINQUIN is the pet name of a schoolboy (Delhaye), who starts his vacation in a small seaside town, where his family runs a farm. Back to conduct an entire non-professional cast (after his collaboration with Juliette Binoche in CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915, 2013), one unique characteristic of the film is its cast, everyone possesses their singularity in their miens or gestures, sometimes even idiosyncratic (for example, the two priests who operate the funeral ceremony, amateurishly laugh up their sleeves during the procession as if it is a reel for outtake), sometimes it feels tedious (one must endure the God-awful singing of CAUSE I KNEW not once but twice, to the extent it has successfully stuck in one's mind) but there is truly self-revealing honesty one finds charming, each character very core to its region, his identity and never try to overact apart from what they are asked to do. <br><br>Delhaye is a harelipped blond, mischievous, feisty, and boredom propels him to perambulate on his bicycle cross the picturesque terrain with his gang, and his petit amie Eve (Caron). Then a string of murders occur in some rather weird executions - dismembered bodies found inside dead cows, to the theory that a mad cow turns into carnivore and eats human bodies. While victims' number is growing, the two detectives, Captain Van der Weyden (Pruvost) and his partner Lieut. Carpentier (Jore), barely register any wisdom in solving the mystery or saving the potential suspects from being slaughtered apart from their passive routine investigation, and if you expect a thrilling whodunit, forget it, the ending can be overwhelming frustrating. <br><br>Characteristic antics again hog the main stage, Captain's uncontrollable face-tic and eyes-blinking has the ever protruding presence to achieve the curve from being bizarre, to annoying, to benumbing and finally becoming habitual thanks to the length. Carpentier erratically shows off his 2-wheels driving stunt apart from his usual bull-in-a-china-shop skill. <br><br>Dumont slyly tricks audience into the police procedural, and first-time viewers will naively think a last-minute revelation will culminate the film in a big bang! Time is ticking, after numerous detours, an overlong parade ceremony, an interlude dedicated to a tragedy of a black immigrant cannot be more topic now and among others. When the fifth victim surfaces, one's patience is running out of steam. After hinting the potential culprit, the film ends abruptly and leaves audience mumbling WTF! <br><br>The film fully embraces its idiotic characters without any tongue-in-cheek references, and in fact it more excels in as an ethnographic comedy with some sublime cinematography. But its length is the main drawback for a one-time activity, Dumont's dedication towards the rural territory earns him indulgence to make LI'L QUINQUIN such an eccentric anomaly, defies a uniform cinematic narrative but also a wayward manipulator, one should respect his effort albeit it never reach the maturity which can be sweepingly cherished by an international range of spectators.","user":"lasttimeisaw","rank":[11,19]}]
