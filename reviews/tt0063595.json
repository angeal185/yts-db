[{"title":"We are the hell-cats nobody likes!","rating":10,"date":"10 January 2001","review":"The theme tune of this classic was appropriated by the Cramps (who also did a version of Faster Pussycat Kill Kill) - although I like the originals better.<br><br>This film comes under the \"so bad it's good\" category - odd, half-mumbled dialogue (apparently they were trying to get a mainstream rating so the actors had to fumble the swearing) and only a minimum of nudity. The actresses were bikers first and actresses second - and I think it shows. They can all ride bikes at least. The two leads - Betty (Queenie) and Pat (Whitey) are great anyway. The concept of the \"stud-line\" is very amusing - and everyone at least seems to be enjoying themselves. Check out Queenie's leopard skin waistcoat and silver go-go boots. I got this film on DVD under the Something Weird label in the Virgin Mega Store New York (Times Square) - there were loads of copies in the cult section - This film is due for a massive revival. The DVD version has commentary from Herschell Gordon Lewis, as well as the groovy trailer, and a weird short film about biker gangs, where a straight-as-they-come narrator hilariously attempts to use hep dialogue \"these cats are really cool..\" etc and the biker member gives a long incoherently rambling narrative about what it means to be in the gang. Recommended!","user":"bakerjp","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"A classic","rating":7,"date":"3 November 2002","review":"Classic she-exploitation.  What can I say about a film where girls lick blood off each other and kiss as initiation rites into a biker cult?  Men are beaten, dragged behind bikes, f*#$ed, and decapitated.  Good acting from a few of the leads.  Terrible script with no story provides opportunities for humor and visceral violence.  No nudity.<br><br>Not as gory as other Lewis films, but more fun than most.","user":"funkyfry","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Legendary biker babes flick!","rating":10,"date":"30 April 2000","review":"No one has commented on this? It's a classic! I love it! Betty Connell is Queen, leader of the Man-Eaters, a female biker gang with a lust for violence and sex! Sounds good, doesn't it?<br><br>This was my first H.G. Lewis movie I had ever seen and to tell you the truth, it's not as controversial as it sounds. There's scenes leading up to sex that doesn't happen, the violence is mediocre compared to what Lewis did in \"Gruesome Twosome\", \"Blood Feast\", and \"The Wizard of Gore\"! There's a great decapitation scene, mutilation by chain, a beaten girl with a bloody nosering with a note attached, and a fight between the Man-Eaters and a male biker gang that results in bloody chain whipping and lots of gutpunches! Great stuff! The dialogue is priceless (\"Man-Eaters is right! Half our dues are spent cleaning the sheets around here!\"; \"We treat men like pieces of meat. It's about as romantic as buying a hunk of bologna.\") and would sound great as sound effects on your computer! The music is either lifted from \"Gruesome Twosome\" or original stuff that would make a great soundtrack CD! So go check out \"She-Devils On Wheels\", it's a whole lot of fun!","user":"Casey-52","rank":[8,10]}]
