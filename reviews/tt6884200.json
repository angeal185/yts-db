[{"title":"Need More Jake","rating":4,"date":"12 September 2018","review":"Good subject, but just didn't learn much or feel much of a connection to the issue and especially to Jake who maybe occupied five minutes of an 89 minute movie. Seemed to be more about the parents personal issues so maybe should have been titled \"The Parents of Jake\". Seems many other 5 star &amp; lower viewer's comments had similar thoughts.","user":"westsideschl","rank":[39,47]},{"title":"if you enjoy arguing","rating":3,"date":"31 May 2018","review":"Greetings again from the darkness. Hot societal topics often become fodder for new movies, and this usually results in a slew of similar stories - some good, others not so good. Currently, discussions of gender identity is second only to Trump-bashing in terms of media attention, and so we can expect Hollywood to rush-to-production in order to capitalize. This latest from director Silas Howard had a timing advantage as it was adapted by writer Daniel Pearle from his own play. <br><br>The titular Jake is a 4 year old (his 5th birthday party plays a role) who enjoys fairy tales and dressing like a princess. His stay-at-home mom (Claire Danes as Alex Wheeler) and psychologist father (Jim Parsons as Greg Wheeler) are aware of Jake's preferences, but as with most things in their marriage, what minimal conversation occurs is of the over-the-top arguing type. The \"issue\" is painfully and awkwardly brought to the forefront as the parenting couple subject themselves to the Private Pre-School application process.<br><br>The challenges of parenthood, including judgmental friends and relatives, and the competitive nature of comparisons, are beyond obvious in most every scene of Act 1. Even Alex's (probably not coincidental that her name is gender-neutral) mother (Ann Dowd) is passive-aggressive in her judgments of Alex quitting her job as a lawyer to stay home with her son. Octavia Spencer co-stars as Jake's teacher and counselor to the Wheelers during the application process, and even her role has a twist designed to elicit more judgment and discrimination. <br><br>There is really nothing convincing throughout the film. It's barely Lifetime Channel material, with a simplified emphasis on the difficulties of raising a non-conforming child. The incessant arguing amongst parents, family members, and friends makes each successive scene more annoying than the previous. The film should have been entitled \"Parents Like Jake's\" because Jake has almost no screen time, while Ms. Danes flashes her \"Carrie cry-face\" (for \"Homeland\" fans) incessantly. <br><br>Certainly the topic of gender identity and non-conformity is worthy of discussion and analysis, as it has entered mainstream conscience in less than one generation. Anxiety and confusion exists, and even well-meaning conversation can take a wrong turn quickly. We just need - and deserve - better guidance than this film provides.","user":"ferguson-6","rank":[55,73]},{"title":"it's really about the adults","rating":8,"date":"13 June 2018","review":"Claire Danes and Jim Parsons give some impassioned performances in this tale about the parents, teachers and other adults in the orbit of a 4 year-old who exhibits some indication of gender non-conformity which morphs into something slightly more violent after some bullying and attempts to set boundaries. Octavia Spencer, Priyanka Chopra and Ann Dowd comprise the strong supporting cast. Everyone is trying to do their best in a sensitive situation. That's where the tension builds.<br><br>This movie isn't so much about clear-cut solutions, but more about how painful it is to feel the burden of doing what's considered right... and everyone has a different idea of exactly what that is. Plus each character has stresses which complicates their perceptions.<br><br>Ultimately, being nurturing, supportive and patient seems to be the bow tied on this brief interlude. But, I'd say, this movie is less about concrete answers and more about the situation, capped with some gut-wrenching dramatic presentation.","user":"chicagovesuvi","rank":[37,55]}]
