[{"title":"Hard to watch, booze, sex, and drugs in 1984.","rating":2,"date":"2 February 2019","review":"My wife and I started watching this at home on DVD from our public library. After 11 minutes she said \"I'm not really enjoying this\" so we switched to a lightweight rom-com.<br><br>The next day I finished watching it myself. Many of the \"reviews\" here are unfair, the movie actually has a lot of positive things to offer. The problem is, the movie is about mostly despicable people exhibiting despicable behavior in 1984. Lots of drugs, sex, and booze. Instead of focusing on college studies. But apparently it is a fairly faithful telling of the writer/director's own experiences.<br><br>The movie has no value if there is no redemption and it appears there is. Angie is a Chinese American who grew up in a bad neighborhood, apparently experienced some sex abuse growing up, had been raped by local young men, and her father didn't have the ability to tell her he loved her. As a result of all those factors she was a hardened young lady who found it difficult to form relationships. When her college money ran dry she hit upon the idea to sneak into the chemistry lab and synthesize MDMA, the drug ecstasy.<br><br>Is the movie worth viewing? Not for those who like a rather clean, sanitary story. While this will not be a favorite of mine, and I would never want to rewatch it, I am glad I was able to see it once. It shows a slice of life that I am otherwise unfamiliar with.","user":"TxMike","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Cry Fest, and not in a good way.","rating":3,"date":"17 September 2018","review":"Ok, I managed to watch the whole movie, I was in a party mood so I started laying a bottom with some beers before going out. So I tought, WTF, it's a dope movie with 80's music, parties and all, even a true story also...<br><br>Of course I knew I was in for a low budget movie, written, directed and produced by Angie herself. But the first half was bearable, sometimes funny even, but the second half OMG. The girls started crying, mumbling and crying some more till the end of the movie. And that's where I knew the writer wasn't honest: or she covered things up in her own life and only shows the regret (the legal issues of cooking &amp; selling drugs, murder, embezzling,... aren't even touched), or she exaggerated her own youth but didn't have the money to pay for those consequences in terms of a solid script, with of course the necessary settings, additional actors,... I dont know, but when this movie hits the point of crisis, it stays there till the end.<br><br>I see people from the crew are talking about the 80's feel &amp; setting. Except for a few songs, I never had an 80's vibe. And the sets, as cheap as possible, as less as background possible. A club is one long sofa with people sitting next to each other haha.<br><br>And for someone who took and selled XTC, she knows not very much about the product. Nobody takes some pills and starts dancing right away, first you have to get through that nauseating feeling for half an hour and only then (if you are not sticked to your chair high on serotonine) the party's on for 2 hours.<br><br>I find it kind of a pity this movie spiraled down that hard in the second half. 'Cause despite the low budget I tought the first 40 min. seemed promising, but she couldn't keep it up.\nMy advice: don't watch it.","user":"webwizardbe","rank":[13,24]},{"title":"Truth, Trials and Errors","rating":9,"date":"31 August 2017","review":"Angie Wang is a warrior in life and made a daring artistic contribution sharing parts of her college year life trying to cope with family and money issues and achieve academic, romantic, economic and human success.<br><br>Angie X, played perfectly by Annie Q, is a romanticized version of an angry, conflicted but smart, sexy and resourceful youth that comes to a college where her first generation immigration and social class makes her adaptation more adventurous.<br><br>The casting choices, camera work, wardrobe and sets to match the 80s feel all seem right and we are able to do what director Wang, asked us the the start of her Montreal World Film Festival first screening: immerse ourselves in the movie and be transported. <br><br>After an hour and a half in the theatre, that felt much longer in terms of content, but also timeless and not wanting the movie to end and leave these likable characters and their quirky lives.<br><br>The only personal choices I felt could have been better are the over-expression of anger which I later learned are Angie's character traits and constant reaction based on her past and way to deal with pressure, as well as some occasional superfluous flashbacks that did not always work to enhance the scenes and character development. Everything else about this independent film written, directed and produced by Angie Wang with a great deal of passion and perseverance is pristine and palpable.<br><br>Angie is contrasted by her two best friends, a Chinese American boy classmate and an \"All American\" rich girl roommate and their respective families. They have different views and values but lots of love, attention and affection for Angie. She also has her own distant parents and brother, especially her father figure. We see her dysfunctional family through flashbacks and she also decides to be a big sister to an even more dysfunctional crack addict family.<br><br>Angie becomes a drug-dealer of a then legal party drug for rich kids \"White\" kids (MDNA/Ecstasy) - and becomes a master chemist like Walter White - which affects lives around here in different ways. In parallel, and paradoxically, she also tries to rescue a \"Black\" little sister affected by lower class street drugs, both legal (alcohol and cigarettes) and illegal (crack).<br><br>Angies tries to find respect and pleasure in school and social settings with her grades, her drugs and romantic interests. A particular sex scene is quite alluring and seems natural, beautiful, beneficial.<br><br>The ending which follows a particular dramatic denouement is sad and hopeful, open and soft-spoken. It lets the viewer know that life is not perfect, but life goes on. The best advice, story and point of view comes from her father Michael, played with gusto by Ron Yuan.<br><br>This film is a well worth addictive addition to the drug dealer movie for the low, middle and upper class, college student and parents alike.<br><br>Bravo Angie! Looking forward to a following project from this fine first time filmmaker.<br><br>USA - 2017 - 94 mins - MONTREAL WORLD FILM FESTIVAL - English","user":"christian94","rank":[20,41]}]
