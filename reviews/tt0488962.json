[{"title":"exactly what a teen slasher film should be ...","rating":8,"date":"23 July 2007","review":"Let me explain the 8 of 10 rating . I'm rating this as a teen slasher film and it does that very well. The virgin , the goof ball guy , the insensitive jock and our hero / heroine the slightly off guy and girl who are still California beautiful. The violence gets a little bit of cheese to it --- AS IT SHOULD in a teen slasher. There's a bit of nudity and some table dancing, two rape scenes and gore aplenty. Lets face it slasher films are not for those who are sensitive or for those moods where one might be looking for anything remotely like intellectual stimulation. <br><br>The acting was good at points bad at others ... par for the course on this genre. Overall it was what I expect and a bit more.","user":"squireson2002","rank":[31,35]},{"title":"Most fun I've had with a werewolf film since Dog Soldiers.","rating":7,"date":"17 May 2007","review":"He's hairy crude and he's a big bad wolf, and he'll be your monster for the duration of this movie. <br><br>Plots barely worth going over for this its your typical 'group of friends go to a cabin to spend a wild weekend blah blah...'<br><br>It's been done so many times but if you go into this film with the sole aim of being entertained, you'll easily get your moneys worth. Even though it's not got an original bone in its hairy body you'll laugh so much you'll forgive it that.<br><br>Its got a wicked sense of humour with lots of tits'n'ass and blood'n'gore a plenty, and a very retro 80s feel.<br><br>\"Lets go to the cabin, and get in a little beastiality\" a furtastic 7/10 from me. Would be awesome if the people involved came back quick with more comic/horror gold.","user":"theNomadz","rank":[42,51]},{"title":"Just When You Thought Beastiality Couldn't Be Fun!","rating":7,"date":"22 May 2007","review":"At best I was expecting a campy B movie with a little T &amp; A and well, Big Bad Wolf delivered in spades. Derek Cowley steals the key to his step-dad's cabin in an effort to impress the local cool kids and get a little party action on. Derek's friend Sam, a leather wearing tomboy on a motorcycle, on whom he has a not-so-secret crush, is talked into going along. On their way to the cabin the teenagers meet a local who warns them to stay away from the cabin but of course the warning is unheeded. It doesn't take long before animal passions are running wild and I don't just mean the sex crazed teenagers.<br><br>Once the initial action and gore is over, something unusual for a direct to video movie happened... an interesting and engaging story broke out about Derek's abusive step-dad, Mitchell, the effect on his mother, his relationship with Sam and the truth about his father's death. A visit from Uncle Charley leads Sam into a situation that jeopardizes her relationship with Derek while uncovering the truth about Mitchell and putting all their lives in danger. Don't get me wrong, you won't see this picture mentioned at the Oscars, but the acting and direction are competently done and the special effects are really fantastic. Even more amazing when you learn what a short time-span they had to put everything together and learn their roles. Just because some of you will want to know... the girls are cute and all but one have real breasts.<br><br>I would recommend this highly to fans of campy horror like Feast, Slither and Shaun of the Dead. Don't expect to be scared or particularly grossed out (unless you have a weak stomach) but do expect to be entertained.","user":"McQualude","rank":[28,34]}]
