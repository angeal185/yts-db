[{"title":"Unbelievable! Are We Record breakers?","rating":1,"date":"17 November 2018","review":"For watching this film to the end, we must be.\nThis is the worst Robin Hood film ever. In fact one of the worst films of all time. The plot, the script, the acting, the action. All rubbish. Only redeeming feature was that Marion was at least wearing something suitable for the forest, it made a change but believe me, that is the only thing I'll take from this film.\nTotal buttocks!\n6.4/10?

He should have stuck to the cinematography, as whoever he appointed that role was as bad as Winters writing and directing.
