[{"title":"Bland Horror, nothing new.............","rating":4,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"I watched this because Josh Stewart has starred in many well done little indie thrillers. This is not one of them. There just isn't anything here that is original, very scary, or hasn't been done a dozen times before and better. There are a few jump scares, but this movie is both tame and lame. Overall it's just dull. You know it's not a good sign when you're watching a horror film and you're thinking \"wow that's a really nice house, I like the dark molding , but the furnishings look a bit cheap\". When the set decoration is more interesting then anything the actors are doing or saying on screen, you know you're watching a stinker. Not worth even watching once. I'm only giving it even the 4 stars because I feel sorry for Josh. He deserves better.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[33,39]},{"title":"What a mess.","rating":3,"date":"3 February 2019","review":"Inconsistent characters, a boring and cliche storyline, predictable scares, and plot holes galore. She loses her baby, and she magically can't have anymore kids; this is what the doctor says, and the husband is thoroughly based on logic and science, yet he never asks why she can't have kids, she just can't have any kids. A sister that picks up a present on her way to their new house, yet somehow still manages to get the present there long before she arrives. None of this makes any sense. It's a garbage film with no actual rhyme or reason within. The only reason I gave it a three is because the actors did a decent job with the crappy script.","user":"bladexz95","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"A Watchable Horror","rating":6,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"Okay, so this isn't perfect by any means but I managed to watch it to the end and I even managed to bring myself to give it a 6/10 rating.\nA pregnant couple move into a faculty house when the husband gets a job in the area as a math teacher. When they get there they find a gift has already arrived for them; a fertility box which can't be opened - until the wife opens it... Anyway, at the husband's new school he meets the head of the department, an enigmatic, blind guy who has other, more paranormal interests outside of academia.\nThe drawbacks of this film to me were that it was predictable (which is okay if it's filmed and directed well - and this wasn't too bad) and the other thing is the husband...he's a bit 2 dimensional and doesn't display enough emotion or good, realistic reactions to the events that transpire (not the actor's fault. It's the fault of the director).\nThe pros of this film are that, although it's a painted by numbers horror, the characters and acting are good and the there were enough interesting and quite well-done moments of horror throughout to sustain my interest which has become extremely fussy these days (being 50 years old).\nOverall: Not bad! A bit flat in places but a half decent offering. It's more of a 5 but I gave it 6 because I got to end without feeling too much frustration.","user":"michaelant555","rank":[17,24]}]
