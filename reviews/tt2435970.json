[{"title":"Another wasted 90 minutes","rating":1,"date":"11 September 2019","review":"I'd like to meet the people giving these movies high marks and praises, I'd like to punish them by making them watch this god awful movie over and over. I'll give it this one positive remark, it's a definite cure for insomnia.\nNOTHING happens but 3 or 4 people in a house talking. The scariest \"special effects\" are a marble and a can of dog food falling to the floor. OOOooooo","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Fake reviews. Piece of crap movie!","rating":1,"date":"31 October 2019","review":"Fake reviews. Waste of time. Go buy a can of paint instead and watch it dry. Better action there. Poor acting by all actors.","user":"dcostaedgar","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Honestly...","rating":3,"date":"10 September 2019","review":"Honestly...All 10 stars reviews are obviously fake...IMDB members of 1 day ...\nSadly but it has became a norm ...\nThe film itself is beyond salvage...3 stars for somewhat artistic camera work...\nCan't recommend it at all ...","user":"tchitouniaram","rank":[7,11]}]
