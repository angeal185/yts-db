[{"title":"Bad hair overshadows the lame story","rating":4,"date":"16 June 2018","review":"Main character's bad hair distracted me through the entire movie which wasn't hard since the acting was poor and the story itself was same overplayed thing seem a million times.","user":"yollya","rank":[32,36]},{"title":"Worst acting ever","rating":2,"date":"26 August 2019","review":"The acting in this film is just HORRIBLE. Plus hair/makeup/wardrobe budget must have been non-existent. Thora's bad hair was a distraction the entire film. It's obvious the two lead characters would NEVER be together in real life. I only watched this because the two lead actors were in some of my favorite films from my teens. What a disappointment","user":"amyvsings","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"I used to LOVE Thora Birch","rating":1,"date":"12 September 2018","review":"Wow is the acting wooden as hell in this!!! Thora Birch is in one of my fav movies....Now and then, Ghost world...to name but a few. But she is AWFUL in this, emotionless, monotone, and so wooden and stilted. Each scene is overly long with boring dialogue. It would look out of date if it was filmed in the early 2000's. and the stock background music is so overwhelmingly abused in every single scene it makes my ears bleed, i actually dont think there is a single scene in this movie that doesnt have background music! its so unnecessary and cheapens the film even more than the writing and acting does, and thats saying something. There is no chemistry between Birch and Klein...none whatsoever. Birch acts like she doesnt even want the paycheck from this movie...","user":"cleo_specter","rank":[8,9]}]
