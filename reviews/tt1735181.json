[{"title":"Surprisingly Good for a TV Movie","rating":6,"date":"7 September 2014","review":"In Greeley County, Colorado, the former Sheriff Ben Sloane (Scott Patterson) is an efficient tracker that lives in an isolated cabin in the middle of the woods. After rescuing a young woman that has been abducted, Ben meets Sheriff Darryl Carter (Aaron Pearl) tells to him that his estranged son Nick (Andrew Dunbar) is the prime suspect of killing his co-worker Raymond \"Ray\" Correlli. <br><br>Ben heads to Chicago to meet the unfriendly Detective Susan Kincaid (Polly Shannon) that does not help him. Soon Ben learns that Nick is married with Maggie (Emilie Ullerup) and has a baby son; he worked in the Stetski Brothers Constructor and studied architecture at college. Ben also meets Nick's friend Danny Smalls (Chad Krowchuk) that tells to him that his job was indicated by his professor Hoffman (Ted Whittall). Ben goes to the crime scene and finds that Nick did not kill Ray and the crime scene was modified and he suspects that the construction company is hiding something. Will Ben be capable to find tracks to prove the innocence of his son?<br><br>The beginning of \"Concrete Canyons\" is engaging and despite the typical clichés of Kincaid and Nick reactions and the corny conclusion, it is enjoyable. The plot gets too complicated with a mafia scheme and is easily resolved in the end but the performances in general are good. I saw this movie with low expectation and I find it surprisingly good for a TV movie. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Caçada ao Assassino\" (\"Hunting Down the Killer\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Watchable little TV movie","rating":6,"date":"20 March 2012","review":"When ex-sheriff and expert tracker Ben Sloan learns his estranged son is wanted for murder he travels to the concrete canyons of Chicago to help. He wins the grudging support of detective Susan Kincaid, meets his son's wife and child and pursues the evidence to find the true killers.<br><br>It's the kind of low budget production where no cliché is left unturned but everyone delivers a decent performance. It seems a little underwritten towards the end and never delivers the physical edge that is hinted at but maybe they had to tone it down for midweek afternoon consumption and lost their way a little bit. <br><br>Overall, a watch-able little TV movie. Indeed, if they wanted to run a few more stories with Scott Patterson and Polly Shannon as the ex-sheriff and detective respectively I'd probably watch them.","user":"huwdj","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"An appealing cast and enjoyable movie","rating":7,"date":"10 August 2012","review":"Today I enjoyed watching Concrete Canyons again and was pleased by the slower place and gentle feeling the whole thing has. I've seen this a few times and though it is not a nail biter it's a pretty good way to spend a few relaxing hours.<br><br>The score by Stu Goldberg added to that atmosphere with music that is understated with good melodies and pulls all the right strings. He creates pleasant musical support that stays in the background where it belongs and adds just enough tension when in the right places without overshadowing the on-screen action.<br><br>Like another review above stated, the similarities between Ben Sloane and Jesse Stone were there, the last names even rhyme, and there are other similarities. They are both good looking large men, with gentle understated strength who show a conscience and quietly and unassumingly do what they need to do, and they both have considerable appeal.<br><br>Polly Shannon is attractive in a Irish elf-like way and is a good foil for Scott Patterson; her character is sceptical and questioning, but not unwilling to learn and change her views once she researches his background and learns of his many successes. All in all, not bad character development for a low budget movie.<br><br>Another reviewer was more harsh about the clichés but it was easy for me to overlook them and just enjoy the film for what if offered, hopefully more people will feel the same way. It was good that they resisted the obligatory fall/spring romance cliché' between Sloane and Kincaid that most would have added just for sex appeal. They instead, concentrated on the theme of a family in a crisis trying to find help, hope and redemption and I felt it was the right thing to do. <br><br>I would gladly watch any sequels that they might make and be happy to see what happens with the characters.","user":"calgarywino","rank":[7,8]}]
