[{"title":"'Disabilities' and Possibilities","rating":8,"date":"1 April 2008","review":"The title and cover of this DVD suggest a film that is more fluff than substance. But don't be fooled by these clues. BLIND DATING is a well-written (Christopher Theo), well-directed (James Keach - brother of Stacy Keach and husband of Jane Seymour) story about the coping of the visually impaired, the quirks of Italian and Indian families, brotherhood, and the gamut of finding the right partner in a world of essential blind dating! One of the reasons the movie works so well is the ability of actor Chris Pine to make us believe he is blind and convey the positive manner in which people with impairments 'view' those around them.<br><br>Danny (Chris Pine) was born prematurely and as a result is blind, and as he grows toward age 21 he feels he is unattractive to women. His family is warm, loving and Italian and supportive - especially his brother Larry (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who runs a Limo service and is constantly trying to find Danny his first physical encounter, be that with hookers, girls from the office or neighborhood, or just referrals - each of whom is a disaster when it comes to dealing with a date who is blind! Danny discovers an operation that implants a camera-like contraption in his brain that will allow him the possibility to see again, even if the images are simply black and white and indistinct. In the office of ophthalmologist Dr. Perkins (Stephen Tobolowsky) is a young girl Leeza (Anjali Ray) who is Indian and whose parents have arranged a wedding with a man she does not love. And yes, in time Danny and Leeza are attracted to each other in what appears to be a doomed relationship - for family reasons. Danny has his operation and is able to see some images, but the implant fails and Danny once again is without sight - but far from being without hope, as both his and Leeza's families undergo changes of heart.<br><br>There is a sense of love that emanates from the screen, due in part to the script, the direction, and to the acting. Chris Pine is exceptionally fine in a challenging role, finding the balance between courage, comedy, and tenderness that make his character believable and lovable, and never once making a move that breaks his image as a sightless person. The entire cast is fine, including a hilarious Jane Seymour as Dr. Evans, Chris' therapist with a penchant for disrobing in front of her sightless patient! But the aspect of the film that sets it apart from many is the presentation of everyday type prejudices that can be every bit as hampering as a physical impairments! This is a warmhearted, very human comedy with many messages.

It was fairly well acted and, more importantly, it had heart.<br><br>What I'm confused about is the cover to the film, it looks like a teenage movie with hot girls and bad jokes, but it's everything but. Chris Pine's portrait of a blind guy seems very real to me, and I really felt for him throughout the whole movie. The story is somewhat obvious, and not that inventive, but it has a point, and even though it's sometimes a little cliché it's still very decent and enjoyable. (After all IT IS a comedy/drama, there just has to bee some parts we all know.)<br><br>Everybody are just human, after all. It doesn't matter if you are visually impaired, what skin color you have or what your heritage is. Watch this flick if you want to feel a little better.","user":"ievolver","rank":[42,51]},{"title":"It's fun...could have been better","rating":5,"date":"2 April 2007","review":"I just saw this movie at the AFI Dallas Film Festival. You can tell from the movie poster that the movie is intended to be taken light heartedly and be fun. Which I thought it was.<br><br>The main character, Danny, is blind and a virgin. He is not looking only for sex but for a relationship and something that has meaning. His brother does not understand this and sets Danny up on a slew of bad dates; ranging from the overly emotional to the very promiscuous. Danny finally meets someone on his own, Leeza, who works at his eye doctor's office. Leeza is Indian and engaged but still goes out with Danny. She falls for him but chooses her fiancée over him for cultural reasons. Danny and Leeza are separated and go through some ups and downs but ultimately they end up together.<br><br>I enjoyed this movie. It was funny and I thought Chris Pine (Danny) did a very good job. But I think this movie could have been more than it was. The two main characters obviously have stresses in their lives which I feel could have been explored more. But instead the movie focuses on the pranks that get pulled on Danny and the various nut-jobs his brother sets him up with. Personally I would have liked to see Danny and Leeza's relationship become deep and really feel their connection over the sometimes crude humor. I would have liked to see more of Leeza struggling with the cultural differences rather than a few teary eyes when she is at dinner with her family. Being of Indian descent I felt some of her insecurity, but I think had she been more developed more everyone could have really felt it. Chris Pine is lovable, kind, and clever as he gets back at his brother and takes his life into his own hands.<br><br>Overall, its a fun watch. Don't go in expecting anything profound, but expect a few crude jokes and take the movie for what it is. A comedy about a cute blind guy going on dates.","user":"FreeLancer06","rank":[31,40]}]
