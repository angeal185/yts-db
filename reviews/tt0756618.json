[{"title":"A Must See Film!","rating":10,"date":"11 December 2007","review":"I had the privilege of viewing ARC, and the first thing that came to mind was that the trailer did not do this movie justice. When I originally saw the small clip, I knew it looked like a gripping film that I wanted to see. However, I was only a few minutes in to the feature when I suddenly realized that I was in for a real treat! Written and directed by the ingenious Robert Ethan Gunnerson, ARC takes place in the town of Los Angeles, and focuses in on it's more sordid side as a former police officer turned drug addict searches for a missing boy in hopes to redeem his character before his 30th birthday. Using a variety of color schemes throughout the film, Robert not only lures you in visually, but he uses the effects to add a depth to the film that I don't think could have been achieved otherwise.<br><br>Now while the cinematography is what originally lured me in to the film, it was the character driven story lines and superb acting that kept me on the edge of my seat. I found it rather interesting that more than once, I felt like I was invading these character's lives. A sort of, fly on the wall, if you will. Robert Ethan Gunnerson did an amazing job of bringing his characters to life, and I look forward to his future projects. He definitely has a bright future ahead of him in the entertainment industry.<br><br>Taking the starring role, Peter Facinelli (The Big Kahuna, Scorpion King, Fastlane) delivered a first rate performance the former police officer turned drug addict, Paris Pritchert. Called upon more than once to deliver a raw and emotion filled performance, Facinelli not only embraced his role with a passion, but executed it with flawless precision. It was truly one of his most memorable roles to date, and I think that only further opened my eyes to the still untapped talent he possess. He is truly a master of his craft.<br><br>To all of those who have had the privilege of seeing the film, consider your self blessed. For those who have not yet had the pleasure, I can only hope that Robert will release this film to DVD or make it available for download on iTunes because in my opinion, it truly is a MUST SEE work of art.","user":"Steelcitybelle","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Remarkable and Emotional","rating":9,"date":"20 February 2007","review":"A friend of mine recommended Rob Gunnerson's ARC to me a while ago. He had seen it at a festival and was raving about what a powerful piece of film-making it is. I recently had the pleasure of catching it at the Hollywood Film Festival and my expectations were surpassed by leaps and bounds.<br><br>ARC is packaged deceptively. It's opening is stylish, hip, disaffected and edgy. It's a world of drug dealers, smut hustlers and hookers, beautifully expressed in black and white with bursts of isolated color. What's brilliant about this film, however, is that about a third of the way through, it rips the unwritten contract between filmmaker and audience in half. The film abruptly shifts from edgy and disaffected to vulnerable and human.<br><br>It's in this jarring break that I truly connected with Gunnerson's main characters: a drug dealer and a prostitute. Regardless of what they do for a living or what they've made of their lives, what's at their core is made so identifiable by the filmmakers that it was impossible not to see myself in their shoes. <br><br>Which is scary as hell considering the world they're in. <br><br>Once he's cast his spell and has your gut, Gunnerson, takes characters and audience deep into one of the darker worlds I've seen on screen in quite some time. I could hear the audience around me squirm as the film edged towards a climax that is at once cruel, touching, and very, very powerful.<br><br>My hat's off to the entire cast (Peter Facinelli must be seen to be believed) for giving this indie film performances that can only be described as art.<br><br>The director and D.P.'s collaboration should also be celebrated. The film and its look feels so tailor-made for it's DV format that frankly, it doesn't feel like DVÂ… it just feels distinctly THIS FILM. <br><br>Clearly talented, Gunnerson has achieved the alchemy all directors strive for, which is creating, out of nothing, a powerful, unique and emotional experience that stays with you. I hope he makes more soon.","user":"gilmanst7","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Stylish, edgy, drugs n' crime story - but Great!","rating":9,"date":"10 August 2006","review":"I caught 'Arc' at the Indie Gathering Film Festival, and was very impressed. I must say, I'm not at all a fan of hip drug movies, but the depth of the story and superb acting won me over quickly. This film had an emotional truth to it that makes movies like 'Spun' pale in comparison. It is a gripping tale of redemption, without heavy-handed morality.<br><br>Artistically, it is beautiful. The daytime world is black-and-white with selective spots of color, but the film, in a strange and disturbing way, comes to full color and life at night... much like the world of these shady characters.<br><br>'Arc' is the ideal of what true independent film should be. Artistic, powerful, and solid, even with limited resources. I'm sure we will be hearing more about it.","user":"webmail-24","rank":[10,15]}]
