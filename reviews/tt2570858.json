[{"title":"Fascinating depiction of relationship inter dependencies.","rating":8,"date":"29 April 2015","review":"Peter Strickland is a film maker who likes to do things differently – his last feature 'Berberian Sound Studio' will mean you will never look at a vegetable the same way again. Here he takes on the theme of a sadomasochistic, lesbian relationship to examine how we all depend on each other and the inter dependencies that can occur to make relationships work. At the heart are two lovers Cynthia and Evelyn who seem to be in a very one sided relationship – one being mistress and one being badly used servant.<br><br>They are also both entomologists and give talks on moths and butterflies – the title 'The Duke of Burgundy' is an actual butterfly orange and brown in colour and found in Europe and mostly Southern Britain. The moths also act as a metaphor in the case of being 'drawn to a flame' scenario; but also the many butterflies pinned and mounted that occur throughout the film reflect the love/abuse relationship in that the very beauty that attracts some people cause them to act in cruel way to the object of desire.<br><br>This is not 'Fifty Shades of Grey' the sex is all tastefully done off screen. It is also exceptionally beautifully filmed – in Hungary as it turns out. The attention to style and miniscule details is almost obsessive and worth every effort in terms of rewards for the viewer. It is though about relationships and what we will do for each other – even if it goes against our own particular grain. This is a film for those who appreciate art-house but like it to have one foot in realism (at least) and as such is one I both enjoyed and can easily recommend.","user":"t-dooley-69-386916","rank":[51,61]},{"title":"Intoxicating brew of dark, atmospheric erotica","rating":7,"date":"11 July 2015","review":"\"The Duke Of Burgundy\" was a fictional pub in the classic Ealing comedy Passport To Pimlico (1949). It also happens to be the name of a certain species of butterfly found only in England. Far from a film about a friendly neighbourhood pub, or an educational chat with David Attenborough, the 2014 incarnation of The Duke Of Burgundy is encased within a potent atmosphere of unease, sexual tension, twisted eroticism and dark humour. Much like viewing a case of mounted butterflies, we watch the action unfold. Visuals are more important than words. This is a truly cinematic experience that demands its audience closely observe everything before its eyes. The butterfly metaphor may be overused - having been exploited in The Collector (1965) and in The Smiths lyric \"You can pin and mount me like a butterfly\" - however, it is revisited to great effect in this film.<br><br>The film observes the daily routine of Cynthia (Sidse Babett Knudsen) and Evelyn (Chiara D'Anna). Much like insects pinned down and encased under glass, we observe them trapped in a provocative routine that starts with punishment and pleasure and ends with a crumbling emotional facade. As Cynthia yearns for a more conventional relationship, Evelyn's obsession with erotic role-playing threatens to push the two apart.<br><br>The Duke of Burgundy is a unique voyeuristic experience courtesy of Peter Strickland, the award winning writer and director of Berberian Sound Studio and Katalin Varga. Much like Berberian Sound Studio, he returns us to the European cult movies of the 1970's. It's refreshing to note that while many recent directors seem to be emulating the crowd-pleasing visuals of The Wachowskis, Lynch, Tarantino or Snyder, Strickland is enthralled with Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Jess Franco and Sergio Martino - with a pinch of Bergman. To a certain degree, Strickland's themes and visuals may also owe a debt to lesser known Euro-cult gems like Baby Yaga and Daughters of Darkness.<br><br>Anyone who's familiar with The Duke of Burgundy's cinematic lineage knows how essential a good soundtrack is. Many of the original giallo and Euro-sleaze films where soundtracked by the likes of Ennio Morricone, Bruno Nicolai and Goblin. The Duke of Burgundy benefits greatly from a soundtrack by Cat's Eyes, an alternative pop duo featuring vocalist Faris Badwan - of English indie rock band The Horrors - and Italian-Canadian soprano, composer and multi-instrumentalist Rachel Zeffira (sounding rather like Lynch favourite Julie Cruise). Having played their first ever gig in St. Peter's Basilica at the Vatican, during an afternoon mass \"attended by seven high-ranking cardinals\", the duo are the perfect choice to compliment Strickland's retro Italo-thriller imagery. The opening credit sequence is an especially good mix of sound and image recalling the era perfectly.<br><br>If the overtly commercial eroticism of Fifty Shades of Grey leaves you cold, then head down to The Duke of Burgundy and drink in its intoxicating brew of dark, atmospheric erotica.","user":"cameron_straughan","rank":[28,33]},{"title":"A beautiful film, but one lacking in substance","rating":6,"date":"14 June 2016","review":"Peter Strickland's follow-up to BERBERIAN SOUND STUDIO is an equally arty mood piece, although a film with even less plot (if that's even possible). Instead, the narrative structure focuses on building up characters and relationships and a very specific atmosphere, without worrying too much about story lines or character arcs.<br><br>As with BERBERIAN, it's a film I'm in two minds about. On a physical level, it's very well made indeed and often beautifully shot. I particularly loved the '70s-themed opening credits which are quite breathtaking. As you'd expect from Strickland, the attention to detail in terms of sound is also quite wonderful; this is a film that has clearly been carefully edited, which must have been a painstaking process.<br><br>What I didn't enjoy so much was the foot-dragging pace, or the lack of either resolution or explanation. In short, THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY explores the relationship between a pair of lesbian lovers, where one is the dominant mistress and the other a submissive servant. Interest arises from a twist where it gradually turns out that the submissive girl is very much the one in control. I liked that aspect of it, and the two actresses are very convincing in their parts.<br><br>But what's the overall result? This is a nice film to watch and enjoy purely on an artistic level. But it seems there's little to keep you coming back. This certainly isn't an exploitation piece, as any questionable material is kept off-screen and there isn't even any nudity. It's restrained, chilly, beautiful, sure, and I enjoyed the entomological background, but once I'd spent nearly two hours with this movie I was eager to go on to find something with more substance.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[21,24]}]
