[{"title":"Average in almost every area.","rating":5,"date":"1 April 2019","review":"Twenty minutes in I thought we were in for a slick, stylish, twisted thriller, sadly by the end of the movie, all I kept thinking was what if, it felt like a mass of wasted opportunities.<br><br>The couple, were rather poor I thought, I'm a huge fan of Aaron Paul, but he was very bad in this, partly due to the shocking script he was having to deal with.<br><br>On the plus side, the location was stunning, and as always the smouldering Riccardo Scamarcio is terrific, perhaps the only saving grace in what is essentially a poor movie.<br><br>The premise is good, sadly the execution, and simplicity are poor. 5/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[22,27]},{"title":"Seriously painful to watch.","rating":2,"date":"16 February 2019","review":"Very disappointed to see Aaron in this movie, had higher hopes for him. As for Emily - zero acting skills. Very slow and painful to watch- miraculously managed to seat through it. The only thing to see here is the beautiful scenery of Italy.","user":"emmavalieva","rank":[38,50]},{"title":"Welcome to Bad Writing","rating":6,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"Although Aaron Paul has mainly been disappointing after Breaking Bad, and Emily Ratajkowski is not what I would call a good actress, their performances were not the main issue that left me disappointed with Welcome Home.<br><br>Indeed, Aaron, and to a lesser extent Emily, were more than satisfactory, but as my title states, the writing and directing were atrocious.\nThey took too much time trying to build tension which never materializes and forgot to actually write an interesting script.<br><br>Not recommended unless you really like Emily Ratajkowski and want to get a \"closer\" look.","user":"Athanatos173","rank":[43,61]}]
