[{"title":"Why the hate?","rating":8,"date":"21 June 2013","review":"Not sure why the low scores because this is a delightful and funny movie. Maybe it is because it is a cast mostly of middle-aged and elderly. Or maybe it is because western social attitudes about older people not being as interesting as those under 30. Or people are made uncomfortable by the thought of old people \"doing it\". \"Old\" people aren't supposed to be silly, irreverent, sex obsessed or pranksters? Well, from the elderly I know in real life, they definitely can be. It's really only illness and infirmity that puts a stop to it, if you were silly, irreverent, sex obsessed or a prankster when you were younger. Perhaps not even then. (I visit and occasionally have lunch out with a lady in her 70's who likes to scope out and then point out good looking young men to me. Not because she is trying to fix me up, but according to her, because she likes looking at good looking men!)<br><br>I don't think this would have been funny if this was about teenagers or twenty-somethings because it has been done to death. Using the older generation gives a tired old genre, a fresh new twist. It is filmed as if it were a documentary, and the unseen camera holder is mentioned a couple of times. But, unlike another review, I did not care for the beginning and almost stopped watching because of that Tyler Perry \"filming a play for a movie\" feel. Luckily, that changed after just a couple of minutes.<br><br>There are also some nice cameos, including a hilarious Christopher Walken impression by Kevin Pollak. While it isn't an Oscar contender, it is definitely an entertaining film worth the watch.<br><br>And I want that red \"bikini\".","user":"Planet-38","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"Its not that bad, made me laugh","rating":8,"date":"24 August 2013","review":"I gave it an 8 because it had such a low rating. I would rate it a 6 to be honest. Basically the story line is about a documentary made about old people, and the life they live. I think they made the old people the way we would like ourselves to be when we reach (if we reach hehe) that age. Nobody wants to grow old physically and in spirit as well, that's just no fun and so the movie is fun and portrays the elders as little horny children. In my experience its not so far from the truth. I like talking to old people and some are really cool or young at heart like those in the movie which is why it made me laugh. In my opinion anyone that gave this movie a 1-3 doesn't like old people or the fun way they were portrayed, or is old in spirit and cannot see people older than himself with a younger spirit. Geezers is very worthy to watch and i highly recommend it to people with a sense of humor especially self humor.","user":"hemedr","rank":[10,18]},{"title":"The worst","rating":1,"date":"15 June 2013","review":"The film begins interestingly - as a documentary. But after 10 minutes the disaster begins.The Worst! Flee from this film. The jokes and the story are terrible. Very bad acting. And using poor cameos of Tim Allen, Kevin Pollak, Sam Raimi, Randy Couture among others. A total waste of time and money. Run away from this movie. Someone should go to jail for making a movie this bad. \"3 Geezers\" is painful: Simmons tags along doing his best Tim Allen impersonation, which is topped when Tim Allen himself shows up solely so the senior citizens can defecate in his bushes. It's not clear whether \"3 Geezers!\" is trying to celebrate people of advanced age or mock them, but it doesn't really matter. Either way, this is one terrible movie.","user":"rd2-713-786627","rank":[13,25]}]
