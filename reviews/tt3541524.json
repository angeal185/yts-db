[{"title":"Crazy stupid plotline","rating":3,"date":"20 November 2019","review":"Just amazed how stupid the girl is.... Bad effects, bad acting, just not believable at all. Aaron is a good action actor but this was really a big lost of time...","user":"champetudo","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"Cringe to the max","rating":2,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"Aaron Eckhart is great to watch, but he couldn't save this one from major cringe factors. The two female internet reporters are so clich√©d and every single line they uttered made me cringe to the max. They really added nothing to the plot, nor did the entire media narrative element of this story. What's the takeaway? The media are terrible? Or great? Or all women reporters are...? I honestly don't know what the point of it all was. Even the big bad network anchor-another disappointing female character-made me roll my eyes every second she was onscreen because she and everything around her were just so unbelievable. I suspect the executive producers had a hand in injecting some female characters in what might have otherwise been an entertaining action flick; they ruined it. Aaron Eckhart is the one who got the short end of the stick on this. I hope he got paid well.","user":"gordean","rank":[57,75]},{"title":"Who wrote this garbage","rating":3,"date":"20 November 2019","review":"The guy at the start was a terminator, he runs about 5km then with bones cracking , bout 40 punches , jumping off first story building he still goes on to take out another 2 cops and runs another 5km.
