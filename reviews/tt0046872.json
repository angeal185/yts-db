[{"title":"An obscure spy movie","rating":4,"date":"4 April 2003","review":"I wasn't aware that this movie existed until Channel 5 screened it one afternoon recently, so I set the video and taped it and was pleased I did.<br><br>Robin Hood actor Richard Greene is an agent whose brother is murdered on the Spanish-French border and he goes out there to look for the killers. While in the process, he meets a woman played by singer Anouk Aimee and she helps him and, not surprisingly, they fall in love with each other.  They come across a smuggling ring and it seems they killed his brother.<br><br>\nThis movie is beautifully shot in colour, despite the low budget.  This surprised me.<br><br>The scenes that were shot on location in Dover were very impressive.  This gave you an idea what life was like in the 1950's<br><br>I rather enjoyed this movie and is worth watching if you get the chance, as it is rather obscure.<br><br>Rating: 3 stars out of 5.","user":"chris_gaskin123","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"Contraband Spain","rating":7,"date":"8 April 2020","review":"A slow-moving but engaging adventure story with Richard Greene as an FBI agent on the trail of a gang dealing in smuggling and counterfeit currency, responsible for the murder of his brother, and finding romance with a chanteuse, Anouk Aimee. The unusual backgrounds and colour photography, as well as avoidance in casting the usual suspects as villains, help mark this co-feature out from similar British crime films of the time. Not so the convention of the hero having to be an American and Richard Greene's accent fluctuates with every other line. In every other respect though Greene, who was to start his long-running stint as Robin Hood shortly after finishing this picture, makes an admirable hero, having something of the easy-going charm of Roger Moore.","user":"wilvram","rank":[0,0]}]
