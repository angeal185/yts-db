[{"title":"The book was better...lol","rating":6,"date":"6 March 2005","review":"In the sequel to 1995's 'Get Shorty,' John Travolta is all swagger and one-liners, reprising his role as shylock/movie producer Chili Palmer. This time around, Chili abandons the fickle film industry for the ever-so-stable world of music, in an effort to discover the next big pop sensation and thus save the beautiful Edie's (Uma Thurman) ailing indie record label. When Chili takes a promising young singer (Christina Milian) under his wing, however, he finds himself in hot water with a wannabe gangsta/mogul (Vince Vaughn), a gay bodyguard (The Rock), and a slew of Russian mobsters. With a bounty on his head and time running out, Chili realizes there's only one way to come out on top: 'Be Cool.' <br><br>This was a comedy. And with comedy you allow for the nonsense. The nonsense makes us laugh. However, the comedy in this movie was clichéd. There was a white guy acting black, a gay aspiring actor, shady record producers and homicidal rappers. Of course John Travolta danced with Uma Thurman. Count the movies John Travolta doesn't dance in. And to boot, Cedric the Entertainer was not funny. It hurts me. The first introduction audiences had to Chili Palmer was unique. But in the sequel, we already knew Chili's cool as ice, no nonsense approach to project management. The only thing we had to look forward to was the immense supporting cast, most of whom were incredibly disappointing. I'm not going to say it was totally unfunny. I laughed. But also, I cried. I cried. It's strictly a numbers game. Put 75 people in the cast and someone is bound to make you laugh. As for the completely insulting product placements, note to Hollywood producers, AUDIENCE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW.<br><br>I feel bad now. Then again I don't. I've often said that sequels are never as good as the first. The Godfather II's are the exception, not the rule.","user":"UrbanFilmCritic","rank":[79,111]},{"title":"Get Lost","rating":4,"date":"6 March 2005","review":"Back in 1995, Barry Sonnenfeld directed a movie that ended up on many  critics best of lists by the time the year's recaps were being printed  in entertainment publications. The movie was Get Shorty and it gave  lead star John Travolta his second big hit in as many years after Pulp  Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzi's lenses. Based on a  novel by Elmore Leonard, the film focused on wise guy Chili Palmer  (Travolta) and his attempts to break into the movie business.  I, for one, was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp  dialogue of the original. So much so, that when I heard there was going  to be a sequel, I seemed to forgo my usual shivering that occurs when a  studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later.  The sequel, also based on a novel by Leonard, is this time directed by  F. Gary Gray who's Italian Job in 2003 was one of the years highest  grossing films. Couple that with the cast now expanding to include Uma  Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Cedric the Entertainer, The Rock, Vince Vaughn  and James Woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in  the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990's.  This time round we pick up as Chili (Travolta) is leaving the movie  business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for  participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film.  Thanks in small part to his friend, Tommy Athens (Woods) and the  misfortune of his death, Chili decides to look into the lucrative and  dangerous music industry.  This first leads to the famous Viper club where Chili meets singing  sensation Linda Moon (Christina Milian) who as lead of an upstart trio,  can belt out tunes like Whitney Houston (that is, the Whitney before  Bobby Brown started bringing home the small packages of sugar).  Linda is under contract with Raji (Vaughn) who, with his overly  apparent gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm (The Rock), plan to ensure Linda  fulfills the final five years of her contract even if that means  putting Chili on ice.  So with Linda's future in the balance, Chili weaves an interesting web  which will include a record producer (Thurman), a gangsta sound mixer  (Cedric), the Russian mob, the police, Aerosmith's lead singer Steven  Tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing. Woo-Wheee! That sounds  exciting. So why wasn't it? Be Cool tries too hard to, well, be cool.  But the result is a film that unlike the original, has no heart and no  soul. Be Cool feels instead like it was directed by a Saturday Night  Live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that don't string  together over a whole movie. Take for example the scene where Travolta  and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction, as  Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background. The scene is forced  and should have ended up on the cutting room floor. Instead, it is  coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the  story forwards with any real thrust. The Aerosmith concert, and The  Rock's trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual  moments that don't amount to much of a movie when put together.  But those aren't the only issues with the sequel - which could probably  be renamed Product Placement with the amount of 2-Ways and Diet Pepsi's  that seem to stare at you more intensely than Chili's serious look. The  story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has  just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing.  Whether it is the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy that has a  movie poster of Sylvester Stallone's Rhinestone on the wall, no  characters is above offering us anything we haven't seen many times  before and in much better films.  With the magic all but gone from the first film, we end up with an  inferior product that is the second film in the past six months  (Ocean's 13 being the other) that cram a bunch of stars onto a marquee  only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open  audition.  Be Cool was a major disappointment. I so wanted it to be the Get Shorty  of the new millennium and I ended up with a film where the outtakes  must have been a gas, but experience left me with a stinker.","user":"gregsrants","rank":[97,145]},{"title":"Get Shorty deserves better","rating":2,"date":"5 March 2005","review":"Get Shorty was an excellent film. It was funny and had the perfect balance of highly comical acting and a serious plot. Be Cool is like some cheap knock-off trying to pass for a sequel. John Travolta as Chili Palmer seems to have forgotten that he was ever in the mob. He plays it like he's a bored movie exec, rather than a bored movie exec who used to be a Shylock. Uma Thurman, great in nearly every role she's ever played, comes off as strained and confusing. Is she supposed to be ditzy or clever? The chemistry between her and Travolta is strained and uncomfortable. Other than that, just add every movie cliché you can think of. A well-educated rap producer by Cedric the Entertainer, an inept gangster wannabe in Andre 3000, the girl with heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in Christina Milian, a gimmicky black dude wannabe in Vince Vaughn, and a stupid celebrity cameo by Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock, who invents his own new cliché as a gay Samoan bodyguard actor wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is the plot: IT MAKES NO SENSE. Get Shorty was clever with Chili playing one group against another and coming out on top. But this film tries that with about a million different characters. And even Chili doesn't seem to know what's going on. Fans of Get Shorty be warned: this is a very different, very worse movie.","user":"tegucigalpa17","rank":[133,207]}]
