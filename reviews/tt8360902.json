[{"title":"How Much Further Can They Go?","rating":3,"date":"23 August 2018","review":"Ok, when it comes to SyFy channel entertainment, we all lower our expectations and raise our tolerance of complete nonsense. Let me put this simply; if you managed to sit though 2-Headed Shark Attack, 3-Headed Shark Attack, etc., you'll be able to get through this one as well. If you have to watch this, my suggestion is to start with a stiff drink and some Gorilla Glue #4. At least you'll be laughing at it.<br><br>The gimmick, and the spoiler on this one, is that the shark has two heads up front and two on each side which it uses as legs. Yes, it walks on land using four of its faces to chase its victims.<br><br>My favorite scene had the shark chasing two of our \"stars\" up onto the beach. A \"hero\" up on a lighthouse gallery catwalk shoots and kills one of the front shark heads. The other front head bites off the dead shark head and tosses it about 50 yards and smashes the shooter up on the catwalk. 'Nuff said.<br><br>Can it get any more ridiculous than this? Not really, but don't for one moment think they won't try.","user":"Calaboss","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Six times the shark carnage","rating":3,"date":"28 August 2018","review":"Have made no secret in the past of intensely disliking, and even outright hating a lot, a vast majority of The Asylum's and SyFy's (near-universally maligned for good reason) output, though there is curiosity as to whether they are capable of making something good and something compulsive about their output's badness. Admittedly, both The Asylum and SyFy do have a small group of watchable films and the occasional (big emphasis on that word) above average one, unfortunately outweighed by the lacklustre at best and often dreadful films they churn out.<br><br>Before anybody gets defensive, am well aware that films like '6-Headed Shark Attack' are not ones to be taken seriously. Have seen my fair share of low-budget shark films, and any other kind of low-budget creature film, and will admit to finding some guilty fun in some of them (i.e. the first two 'Sharknado' films). There are far worse shark films than '6-Headed Shark Attack' and it is actually the least bad of the '...Headed Shark Attack' films. <br><br>Sadly '6-Headed Shark Attack' is just too borderline amateurish to accept as a guilty pleasure, where nearly everything is just poor quality that it's insulting and there is nowhere near enough fun, intentional or unintentional, moments. Generally the series has gotten marginally better with each film but it still feels like the series has worn thin and gone too far. Was not expecting anything intelligent here, am well versed now to know that it is not that kind of film, but it does feel like it was made by somebody who didn't know how to give a film brains, so much so that it'll make the viewer feel dumb and that is not a nice sensation to feel watching a film. It also looked like not a lot of heart went into it either.<br><br>'6-Headed Shark Attack' does have a couple of redeeming qualities, which the other '...Headed Shark Attack' films didn't, 5 did have one but just the one. The opening scene was actually pretty entertaining, something that put the viewer in the mood for some very dumb but guilty pleasure fun. <br><br>Megan Oberholzer and Thandi Sebe agreed do come off serviceably considering what was given to them. They at least try and don't look like they're trying too hard.<br><br>Unfortunately, it rapidly fell downhill, where ridiculousness and cheapness amongst other things were taken to extremes. <br><br>Visually, '6-Headed Shark Attack' is absolutely no improvement on the previous '...Headed Shark Attack' films and is yet another low-budget shark attack film that looks cheap and like it was made with no budget, heart or enthusiasm. Any nice scenery that the movie has is difficult to appreciate when the movie is shot in such a drab way and when it's edited so amateurishly that bacon-slicer-like editing looks more refined. Worst of all in this regard are the effects, as it was made on low-budget it would have been forgiven a little if it was not great, but when the effects for the shark look as if no effort was given in making them without looking so goofy and unfinished-looking that is hard to ignore.<br><br>The opening scene apart, so is the shark's lack of presence or personality, it's not menacing, it's not scary and it's not fun, it's not even strong enough to bring any unintentional humour or goofiness, that's how bland it is. The music is very generic and adds very little, it's not always appropriate either and quite a lot of it is actually pretty annoying.<br><br>Writing ranges between incredibly bad to appalling. Any comedy is incredibly forced and is so cheesy it is enough to make the eyes roll in disbelief, while the more serious moments are very awkwardly written and as trite as anybody can possibly go. Regarding the shark attacks, some are rushed, others are badly drawn out. They lack any kind of suspense and the over-silliness to the point of intelligence-insulting stupidity, terrible shark effects, bad editing and even more gratuitous gore further cheapen them. <br><br>To describe the story as weak is being too insulting to the word weak, it is a very lethargically paced and thin as ice story with lots of padding that is either badly written or serves no point at all to the movie, other than attempts at novelty value, which falls flat on its face because it all feels so tired. It is not fun, it is not scary and it is not thrilling or suspenseful, it's just nothing but tired stupidity.<br><br>As for the characters, that they're tired cliches isn't so much a problem, the problem is that they are either obnoxious with them constantly doing stupid things, so bland that it makes zombies seem more animated or both. Some of them are superfluous to the story or come and go out of nowhere constantly. The direction is as flat as a pancake, and the acting is amateur hour awful from the rest of the cast. The film may not unforgivably waste dependable seasoned actors (because there aren't really any), like '3-Headed Shark Attack' did with Danny Trejo, but that doesn't stop the painful mix of blandness and histrionics. <br><br>In summary, apart from one entertaining scene and two serviceable performances, even when taking it for what it was meant to be, this was very lame. 3/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Wow","rating":1,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"Wtf that was so bad I not sure why I even watched it","user":"paulmarteen","rank":[3,3]}]
