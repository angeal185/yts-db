[{"title":"Atmospheric gem of a time long past.","rating":10,"date":"21 April 2006","review":"I have been obsessed with this movie for quite some time. It's setting in Venice Beach and the Santa Monica Pier in the early 1960's, captures an eerie, desolate, seediness that is disappearing faster than mold in the sunlight as our urban landscape becomes more homogeneous and bland. I love so many details of this movie such as the jazz combo in the Blue Grotto, the name \"Blue Grotto\", the carousel, the apartment over the carousel looking out over the water, the tacky carnival atmosphere, the beatnik bongo players on the beach, the mysterious incredible Cameron as the sea witch in flowing black veils, the strange, haunting score, Captian Murdock's home filled with oddities from his travels, the gloomy lighting and crumbling buildings with beautiful baroque detailing and a low, howling wind whistling though the canals. It all melds together in to a gem of a movie that I never get tired of watching. As for the acting, I found Dennis Hopper to be quite convincing and appealing as a nice lonely boy, so refreshingly different from his later roles. The result is a movie that is mysterious, haunting and beautiful which captures the sublime essence of a magical dream falling into decay.","user":"mandall","rank":[70,76]},{"title":"intriguing offbeat oddity","rating":6,"date":"9 October 2005","review":"Released one year prior to the atmospheric, surreal horror classic \"Carnival of Souls,\" \"Night Tide\" is a similarly bizarre film that radiates an odd effect. Johnny (a young Dennis Hopper) falls in love with Mora (Linda Lawson), a sideshow performer who might also be a mermaid with a penchant for murdering her lovers. The performances are adequate and realistic, with Hopper conveying a proper balance of lovestruck awe and confusion; Lawson is fittingly remote and enigmatic. Writer-director Curtis Harrington builds a fair amount of suspense and limits the action to several effective dream sequences, thereby retaining a surreal mood. Not as wild as Jack Hill's \"Spider Baby,\" nor as subtly brilliant as \"Carnival of Souls,\" \"Night Tide\" is a diverting in-between that's worth a look.","user":"Jonny_Numb","rank":[24,25]},{"title":"A Literary and Occult Classic If One Scratches the Surface","rating":7,"date":"12 May 2009","review":"This film excels both as a good narrative (though it borrows heavily from \"Cat People\"), but also on a deeper, symbolic level. While Dennis Hopper had small roles before this, \"Night Tide\" casts him as a lead, and he fares well. Reviewer Rick McGrath says, \"Hopper's acting in Night Tide is, I think, ultimately suspect. It's fun to see him so young, so cute in his tight navy suit, but he plays Johnny Drake as a bumbling, nervous, fidgety, slightly stupid loner ... so much so he often seems dislocated from the action and his co-stars.\" I don't know that I agree. Surely he comes across as nervous and shy at times, but bumbling? Clearly his character was designed to be young and inexperienced -- this is necessary for the scene in which he confronts Captain Murdock (Gavin Muir) in his home and is told tales of the Sirens and is shown a dismembered Arab hand. A hardened sailor wouldn't be so spongelike for forbidden knowledge.<br><br>McGrath refers to this film as \"a psychosexual tale of freudian camp and hilarity\". I think it's deeper than that. Yes, there's more sexuality than is presented on screen, but I don't accept the absurd premises of McGrath, who goes so far as to say one scene involving a dock is \"phallic\". No way. Is the film campy and hilarious? To a point, sure. It's the early 1960s and the budget is low. But the writer and director, Curtis Harrington, seems to have a vision and executes it with finesse. The opening scene clues us in that Harrington is a man who cares about visuals, and we are reminded of this again alter on when we see Mora close up in the sideshow mermaid tank. He frames shots to reveal not just an object, but an emotion.<br><br>The casual viewer may overlook the literary and occult themes present in this short film, but I think the flower that is \"Night Tide\" cannot fully bloom without this understanding. As revealed in the closing credits, the film takes its name from a verse in Edgar Allan Poe's \"Annabel Lee\":<br><br>\"And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side Of my darling - my darling - my life and my bride, In the sepulchre there by the sea, In her tomb by the sounding sea.\"<br><br>The poem highlight's Poe's love of a woman so strong it stretches beyond death, and also happens to be the last complete poem he ever wrote, in essence his \"last words\". The macabre nature of the poem underscores the hidden darkness of \"Night Tide\" that may not be apparent to all viewers.<br><br>Captain Murdock is a man with a rich sense of literature and philology. He is clearly familiar with Greek legends, as he relates the tale of the Sirens briefly to Drake. Presumably he is also the one who named Mora after finding her on a Greek island (assuming her origin is truthful). The name \"Mora\" is likely a variation of the Greek name \"Moira\", one of the Fates of legend. Her name translates roughly to \"fate\", \"destiny\" or \"doom\", a fitting moniker for a woman who is the death of her lovers. Murdock also paraphrases a notable line from Shakespeare's Hamlet:<br><br>\"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"<br><br>As an aside, it is worth noting that Harrington named his main character \"Drake\", a male duck, which may be symbolic of Johnny's being torn between land and sea, as ducks are comfortable equally with both. This is clear from his career as a Navy man who spends his time on the ocean, but seems more at home on the shore. And, of course, it parallels his love of Mora, the creature of the sea, with the relative safety of the land where she is unable to lure him to a watery grave. <br><br>Most viewers will miss the occult connection, as it is not made overtly clear in the film. The only sign we have to go off of is Murdock's address in Venice, 777 Saabek Lane. \"777\" may be familiar to Biblical scholars as one of the numbers of perfection -- 7, the number of God himself, combined with 3, the unity of the trinity. It is alluded by this address that Murdock is a man of knowledge and power, both mysterious and esoteric. But also, this is a number associated with Aleister Crowley, the famed English occultist. This is no mere coincidence, as Crowley has a connection to this film.<br><br>His connection comes through the woman who plays the \"water witch\" that speaks the odd language, Marjorie Elizabeth Cameron (1922-1995). Cameron was the wife of rocket scientist Jack Parsons, a friend of Alesiter Crowley who was hand-chosen to lead California's Agape Lodge in 1942. Parsons, incidentally, was also a magick partner with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Cameron came to be involved with \"Night Tide\" as she had partied with co-star Dennis Hopper in the 1950s, and worked with Curtis Harrington and Kenneth Anger in 1954's \"Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome\" -- Anger was another Crowley devotee, who also knew Manson Family member Bobby Beausoleil. He later associated with Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey. To say that Cameron, Hopper and Harrington had connections to Crowley and the occult would be a mere truism, and that occult symbolism figures into \"Night Tide\" should not be considered a stretch.<br><br>(Review considered too long by IMDb... see Killer Reviews for complete write-up.)","user":"gavin6942","rank":[48,53]}]
