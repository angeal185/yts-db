[{"title":"A slow burner that doesn't deserve all the hate","rating":2,"date":"2 November 2018","review":"While movies like Hereditary and It Follows get praise for being slow eerie movies, this movie takes it to an international level by creating a creepy story around an Irish urban legend, which is terrifyingly realistic.<br><br>The Celtic setting of the movie creates an unbelievably uncomfortable atmosphere which transcends in the incredible soundtrack. The directing is over average, but I do agree it's nothing less than cheesy at some points. But the clever 70's style of certain shots does the job of bringing us back into this eerie world.<br><br>The acting is also very good, especially for an indie. It's hard to know who you can trust and it's great to see a main actress that doesn't sound or look like the dumb little damsel in distress.<br><br>Overall, it's a movie that comes very close to being a classic, maybe only taken back from the fact that it lacks true novelty and, without being predictable, doesn't bring anything new to the table. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves slow burners with a spiritual background that doesn't try too hard to be its own thing and just lets things flow, making for a realistic, downright creepy story.","user":"Louis_Bacon","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"Don't Leave Home: Mysterious, brooding, fascinating, bit crap","rating":4,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"Don't Leave Home is a US made feature horror set in Ireland on a 400yr old estate.<br><br>It tells the story of an artist who is commisioned to make a piece for a disgraced priest. She must travel from the US to Ireland, live with them while making the artwork and remain for the auction.<br><br>But in traditional horror form things don't go to plan and before she knows it she is subject to weird supernatural activities.<br><br>The movie is very atmospheric and throughout I was both fascinated and bored to tears. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but the slow plodding pace didn't seem to be offering anything or suggesting it was going anywhere.<br><br>When the finale comes, it delivers but leaves you with far too many questions and therefore when the credits rolled I felt rather unsatisfied.<br><br>Don't Leave Home certainly has some good ideas and a solid concept, but an additional 15-30 minutes to pad it out and fully explain just what in the blue hell was going on would have been appreciated.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Very atmospheric<br><br>Some good ideas<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Very slow paced<br><br>Too much left to the imagination<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>Heaven is a marsh<br><br>Never trust a priest (In movies or real life)","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Better than described.","rating":7,"date":"24 April 2019","review":"After reading other reviews I was ready for a slow burn, atmospheric, movie set in Ireland. While the pace was slow, it never stalled. There are no jump scares. This is a thinking persons movie. I enjoyed it very much. The ending was perfect. If you want something grizzly and fast paced, there are plenty of those out there. This movie required a little thought and patience. The plot stayed true and maintained credibility.","user":"caleb1868","rank":[5,5]}]
