The film dwells a bit on a sub plot that has Kelly saving an Indian maiden's life as well as playing wet nurse to a tenderfoot who seeks to win the trapper's friendship and respect. There is a fine battle scene between the soldiers and the Indians, one of the best of its type and is the film's high point. John Russell, Ray Danton and Claude Akins are among the cast names that contribute greatly to fine story. Andra Martin is striking as the Arapahoe girl and a point of contention between Kelly and the Sioux warriors. Edd Byrnes is okay as Kelly's young helper. Outstanding camera work and music score make this forgotten western one of the genre's best pictures.","user":"NewEnglandPat","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Rest in Peace \"Clint\" Norman Eugene Walker","rating":10,"date":"4 July 2018","review":"Lived: May 30, 1927 - May 21, 2018 (age 90) Height: 6' 6\" \nMy favorite cowboy hero growing up in the '50s.
