[{"title":"Wonderful!","rating":5,"date":"5 February 2004","review":"I loved this movie.It wasn't depressing in the least.Neil Simon has written many brilliant and funny plays,this being one of them(and The Out of Towner's,also with Lemmon).Jack plays a man who gets fired from his job after working there half his life.Anne plays his wife who gets another job while Jack has a breakdown and they struggle to go on with the everyday life and calamities that face them.I laughed at so many of the lines.I laughed when Jack Lemmon was yelling at the New Yorkers out of his balcony after his house had been robbed,i laughed when he was banging back on the wall at his neighbours,when he and Anne had to climb all the stairs because the elevator is broken,the look on their faces is painful but funny! Jack could play a miserable on-the-verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown man,and make you really laugh aswell. Also features a young Sylvester Stallone before his Rocky days. I love it and its one of those films i can watch over and over.","user":"cougar78","rank":[33,34]},{"title":"Terrific comedy drama","rating":21,"date":"21 March 2002","review":"I must confess I have a bias for films of the seventies. Most of my all time favourite films were made in that decade and this is one of them.<br><br>Jack Lemmon is a New York middle executive who is retrenched. We watch as he slides into depression. Their is some fine humour in this film, which, incidentally was not well received critically, but it is really the underlying drama that makes this such a great film. It is an intensely personal film for me and, apart from some overacting, there is little I can criticise. It is an incisive and briskly paced comedy drama which I never tire of viewing.<br><br>By the way, watch out for cameos by pre-fame Sylvester Stallone and F. Murray Abraham.","user":"hayden-8","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"A Hearty Approval of a Wonderful Film","rating":23,"date":"23 September 1999","review":"Being a Jack Lemmon fan, I can't help but be biased when it comes to watching his films.  But I have to say, even by Lemmon's standards, \"Prisoner\" is one of his finest performances.  He displays a broad range of emotion as Mel Edison, a corporate exec who falls victim to the unemployment crisis of the seventies.  Anne Bancroft is nicely cast as his wife, Edna--it's almost hard to believe watching this film that this is the same woman who played in \"G.I. Jane\" as a crooked senator.  And, although another viewer here frowned upon the casting of Gene Saks' as Mel's brother Harry, I always enjoy seeing the director in front of the camera (Saks directed another of my faves, \"The Odd Couple\").  The direction is pretty tight, and the interludes between acts include humorous voice-overs from a fictional radio announcer (you'll have to listen closely to catch some of the jokes).  Look for Sylvester Stallone in a cameo appearance.  I heartily recommend this film to all Jack Lemmon fans, as well as to those who enjoy a good comedy that's not all slapstick and guffaws.","user":"Colby","rank":[14,15]}]
