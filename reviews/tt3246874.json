[{"title":"10/10","rating":10,"date":"14 September 2019","review":"One of those movies you cry on. It's like lump is stuck on your throat. Very emotional, very sad movie with beautiful end. A very special movie, you will not forget for a long time. Deserve more than 10, and yes, it's worth watching.","user":"babllin","rank":[33,35]},{"title":"Way better than expected.","rating":9,"date":"10 September 2019","review":"With a rating just above a 6 I was hesitant, the short description was terrible, and some of the reviews were \"harsh\". Now I know what an internet troll is. What a wonderful film about a story that absolutely needed to be told. I didn't get the beginning until the end, as I didn't research the story ahead of time. All the characters were solid, relatable and well acted. Knocked off one star because of some scenes that I am sure Frank wanted included but didn't add anything to the story. Just Wow, what a great/sad/uplifting/film. Best I've seen in years.","user":"heavypicklesandketchup","rank":[40,43]},{"title":"Inspirationonal, truly amazing","rating":9,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"This story warmed my heart.
