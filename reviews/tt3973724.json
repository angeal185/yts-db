[{"title":"Interesting characters at an interesting time for the game","rating":9,"date":"2 October 2018","review":"The look at Go historically and in Asia introduces you to the game well, and shows you the cultural heights the game can reach, something which helps lend importance to the documentary's main narrative: the tournament to decide America's first professional Go players.<br><br>Personally, I enjoyed the way the film followed the three American players, which was certainly not flattering, but showed them as very human and with their own philosophies and worries in life. And these are the top players in America, devoted to what was (until the events depicted in the documentary) a wholly amateur pursuit in their country -- certainly some interesting characters.","user":"mamins-16499","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"GO See It!","rating":10,"date":"12 March 2018","review":"Beautifully shot and edited, the film offers viewers a peek into the unique and highly specialized world of go. At the same time, the story is relatable to anyone who has something they are truly passionate about. The documentary's subjects are portrayed with great humor, poignancy, and warmth.","user":"sallydewind","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"First movie of its kind; trailblazer for the Go community","rating":10,"date":"15 March 2018","review":"Just finished. truly a groundbreaking thing to happen for the go community, the making of this movie. im sure it will start changing how people see this game.<br><br>I play online Go and real Go all the time, and I think the idea of professional american players will help Go a long way to inspiring others to follow in their footsteps. Also, that cameo from a certain legendary player was amazing.<br><br>This is truly a film that was a long time coming, and one that took so much effort and love to make that even a non-Go player will be able to appreciate it! I strongly urge you all to watch this movie now!","user":"Ksaraf23","rank":[4,6]}]
