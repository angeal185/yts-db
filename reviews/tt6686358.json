[{"title":"Boring","rating":2,"date":"24 February 2019","review":"I am a huge Takishi Miike fan and thus it pains me to write this review. This movie concerns a scientific mystery which ensues after a criminal investigation is started. The music is atmospheric and the filming is frankly top notch. However, the story unfolds slowly and deliberately. While the slow pace of the story is meant to emphasize the dramatic effect, the end result is the exact opposite. Add all these factors together and the result is that this movie is a sure cure for insomnia. Miike is one of the most inventive directors today, and his career is checkered matter with hits and misses. He has had more hits, but this movie is a definite miss.","user":"kaljic","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Hypnotic","rating":2,"date":"28 December 2018","review":"This film inherits the old mistakes of Japanese movies: it is flat and straightforward, and there is no rhythm at all. There are only a few gimmicks. In the long and dull film, there is no continuous excitement, so that the audience only wants to sleep.","user":"ParisImpressionH-Y-","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"When science led the investigation.","rating":4,"date":"5 November 2018","review":"This oddly titled murder mystery is about a detective who calls upon the services of a scientist to solve a murder. Eventually it is solved using the theories of French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace hence the title.<br><br>I thought the film required too much attention to be engaging. There is far too much science fiction pretending to be realism in the film. Realism is police work, profiling and forensics not bizarre future predictions and science hypothesizes that would not spend a second in a courtroom.","user":"cornishrexrasta","rank":[8,18]}]
