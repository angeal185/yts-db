[{"title":"A feel good movie","rating":8,"date":"4 March 2013","review":"Bitch Hug is a funny drama, or a sad comedy, depending on how you see it. The film is about friendship between 2 girls, Kristin, a dizzy blond girl, and Andrea, a young and introverted brunette. To escape the embarrassment of having missed her plane to New York, Kristin asks Andrea to stay at her place, and tries to write articles about her trip to the Big Apple, as if she was really there. Surprisingly this trick works fine, probably because everyone knows and can imagine himself in New York, without having actually been there! Anyway, still hiding in the attic of Andrea's house, Kristin starts to become intrigued by this young solitary girl. Is Andrea seriously depressive and turning away from people, or just very independent? As Kristin uncover some of her secrets, she also becomes more bound to her and questioning herself on what she really is. <br><br>The link between the two has of course its up and down, and is clearly on the edge of intimate affection and love. More is suggested than obviously explained. A lot can be debated on the psychology of every character in this film, and not just the 2 main one. <br><br>I think there is more life, love and fun in this little Swedish film, than in many long and annoying big budget productions. I had a good time watching it and can give it a big fat 8/10.","user":"tux-12","rank":[19,24]}]
