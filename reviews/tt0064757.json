[{"title":"Great Bond film","rating":14,"date":"14 March 2008","review":"\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" is a sadly under-appreciated Bond film which is stylishly-directed and features an outstanding score, like most of these early Bond films. Other than a silly self-referential line in the teaser and some sappy romantic montages, \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" is a thrilling adventure which sees Bond traveling to the Swiss Alps to encounter villains and partake in dangerous action sequences.<br><br>It sounds like a Bond film, alright, but this is actually quite different from the formulaic films one would later expect from the series, and the sort of film Bond was gravitating towards with \"Thunderball\" and \"You Only Live Twice\". It certainly delivers on the promise of sexual innuendo and lots of provocatively dressed women, but it's a different sort of Bond in that it seems to be more straight-faced and harsh, culminating in what is probably the saddest Bond ending. It's also probably the closest to Fleming's version of Bond outside of \"Casino Royale\", although \"The Living Daylights\" was also somewhat similar to the literary Bond. As a Fleming fan it is nice to see the Bond series take after the books. <br><br>Lazenby, who has been frequently criticized and is many people's least favorite Bond, actually does a decent job of the role. He's nowhere near as good as Connery, of course, but I thought that other than the scenes where he tried to seriously emote, he carried the film with his charisma and physical presence. I strongly believe he should have continued in the role. Lazenby fits the content of the film, which is certainly far more down to Earth than many other Bond films, and focuses heavily on hand-to-hand combat in the action scenes, which is somewhat refreshing after the overblown (entertaining, but seriously outrageous) action scenes in \"You Only Live Twice\". This is a genuinely good script, with a solid plot, good dialogue, and good characterization. <br><br>It's not just a throwaway action flick, it's an excellent espionage thriller with a strong dramatic core, and as fun as things like \"Goldfinger\" certainly are, it's nice to see one of these movies treat women as more than mere sex objects, and it's interesting to see a Bond girl paired with a Bond who reacts as a human would and not a cartoon character. Diana Rigg is probably my favorite Bond girl. She gives a strong performance and is helped by an excellent script which gives her a fair amount to do. <br><br>By staying closer to the source material, \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" dramatically improves on its two predecessors and features some of the best locations in the series, although I admit my familiarity with the majority of the Swiss shooting locations gives me a nostalgic view of things. \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" is a strong contender for the title of best Bond film. <br><br>9/10","user":"ametaphysicalshark","rank":[118,141]},{"title":"Not a Bad Deal at All.","rating":8,"date":"27 September 2001","review":"To understand the controversy behind `On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' one must understand the events so impacting the spy genre by the time of its production in 1969.  After the back to back tremendous successes of `Goldfinger' and `From Russia With Love,' every hack producer and distributor rushed to make spy movies.  There were serious ones (`The Spy That Came in From the Cold,' `The Ipcress File'), satirical ones (`Our Man Flint,' `The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,' `Get Smart' ), and incredibly silly ones (`The Silencers,' `Last of the Secret Agents,' `Casino Royale').  `Casino Royale' was especially damaging, since it was (VERY LOOSELY) based on a Fleming novel, and used the character of James Bond, 007.  In fact, in `Casino Royale,' nearly EVERYBODY played `James Bond'.  `If we don't know what we are doing, how will the enemy,' was the explanation `James Bond' (David Niven) gave to explain why MI6 was calling all its agents `James Bond'.  To protect their franchise, the producers of the `real' James Bond movies emphasized in their promotion `Sean Connery IS James Bond.'   In a demonstration of  `gratitude,' Connery up and quit the series, leaving `On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' which was shortly to go into production, without a `Bond.'  <br><br>Arguably the most ambitious and difficult to shoot of ALL the Bond films (at least to that time), it's a miracle ANYTHING works in OHMSS. Much of the time it works VERY well, though the shaky underpinnings of the first hour frequently threaten to undo it.  There is so much choppy editing and dubbed dialogue, one begins to suspect he is watching a foreign film. The second hour plus works much better, all the more surprising since it was shot first. One reason may be that the film went WAY over both shooting schedule and budget, and there was enough made up `bad' press to put a great deal of pressure on the producers, first time director, Peter Hunt and star, George Lazenby.  In the middle of it all, Lazenby's publicist announced that Lazenby was not going to do another Bond (Lazenby is credible when he says that announcement was not his idea. One suspects, from the bonus material, that Cubby Broccoli planted that story to discredit Lazenby, should the film fail). Add to all this the films' tacked-on, unhappy ending (planned to be the prologue for `Diamonds are Forever'), which plays completely against the humor of earlier moments, and it's a wonder the film was NOT a dismal failure.  Quite the contrary, OHMSS is one of the BEST of the Bond films, filled with nonstop action, outstanding stunts, incredible sound, the best score (along with `Goldfinger') and a credible enough romance to lend it genuine poignancy.  Lazenby overcame many tremendous handicaps: having to replace one of the best known and popular actors in the world; he was 28, younger than  Connery when he made `Dr. No'; he was completely inexperienced as an actor  (OHMSS was Lazenby's FIRST movie, not just his first starring role); his accent (thick Australian outback) and the INCREDIBLE physical demands (Lazenby did many of his own stunts).  Considering all this, Lazenby is downright remarkable.  Certainly, in my opinion he is better than either the snooty Timothy Dalton or the lightweight Roger Moore were in ANY of their outings as Bond.. The bonus feature on the DVD concludes with strong evidence that Lazenby became a scapegoat, despite the eventual financial success of OHMSS. Lazenby, refreshingly displays no bitterness that his career nearly ended as soon as it began.  He's had a reasonably busy career playing character roles and we have OHMSS. Not a bad deal at all.","user":"Bob-45","rank":[152,191]},{"title":"The most moving film in any Bond picture...","rating":9,"date":"7 September 2003","review":"Like \"From Russia With Love,\" \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" is filled with mysterious characters and realistic action Blofeld's plot involves germ warfare and his stronghold this time is a converted Swiss allergy clinic The film is loaded with actionski chases, bobsled chases, car chases, helicopter attacks, fights in the surf, fights in the hotel, fights in the office Peter Hunt succeeded in distracting the audience from noticing that a new Bond was on duty <br><br>The new Bond pauses to take a finger of caviar... Dom Perignon'57 and five-star Hennessey brandy are his mouthwashes of choice... He discovers that he lived with his aunt in Pett Buttom, and his family motto is 'The World Is Not Enough.' He impersonates a genealogist to gain entrance to Piz Gloria... He wants to take the head of SPECTRE to Augsburg (West Germany) to verify certain records regarding his claim to a title... He spurns a Mafioso one million gold dowry; uses telescopic sight from a sniper's rifle to spot a beautiful young woman on the beach; wipes away a Contessa's tears; drives his Aston Martin wearing a hat and smoking a cigarette, and turns to the viewer saying in perfect seriousness, \"This never happened to the other fella.\"<br><br>The sixth Bond film takes place all over Europe with a united nations of glamorous babes called 'angels of death,' where 007 finally meets his female match, falls in love, and gets married The motion picture is an emotional story that reveals more of the world of 007<br><br>It starts with Bond, ready to resign from the Secret Service for being taking off Operation Bedlam... With John Barry's best music, Bond reminds us of a whole bunch of familiar faces... He begins to look over his mementos which include Honey's knife belt from 'Dr. No,' and the strangler watch from 'From Russia with Love.' The sequences from all the previous Bond films reinforced the idea that this new Bond is still a member of the same team, a man who answers to a crusty retired Admiral, and still is engaged in sexy banter with a loving secretary...<br><br>It is Draco's daughter though, the ravishing Tracy (Diana Rigg), who adds a bit of class to the role of the Bond girl, and makes the film quiet interesting... Tracy is the troubled woman who steals Bond's heart... She is a spoiled woman wandering fully clothed into the sea... She is dangerous with her red Ford Cougar, a broken bottle, and at the baccarat table...<br><br>Gabriele Ferzetti is one of the most sympathetic Mafia dons ever to charm the screen Draco likes the fact that Bond is interested in his daughter, and he's determined to help her find the right husband <br><br>Telly Savalas' Blofeld does reveal sides to his character previously unseen: the class snobberywhich M remarks upon, and the vanity which Tracy flatters to force him off his guard, and his irritation with one of his skiers who ends up in a tree... Posing as a world-famous allergist, this bald arch-villain would only give up his deadly scheme throughout the world if offered a complete pardon for past crimes and a title...<br><br>Irma Bunt was perfectly portrayed by German actress Ilse Steppat, who, unfortunately died soon after the film's release She is Blofeld's second-in-command, who keeps the Count's attractive 'patients' under control...<br><br>Angela Scoular (Ruby) becomes Bond's first conquest when she writes her room number in lipstick on 007's inner thigh<br><br>Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) hands her boss a request for two weeks leave rather than Bond's dictated resignation... Her act results at once funny, moving and warm: 'What would I do without you?' ask both Bond and M separately once she's settled their contretemps...<br><br>\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" features Barry's exquisite song, \"We Have All the Time in the World,\" which is sung with real emotion by Louis Armstrong...","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[84,104]}]
