[{"title":"Go and see it - in a cinema","rating":8,"date":"13 December 2000","review":"I really enjoyed this film, and was shocked to see all the negative comments about it on IMDB.  Yes it's long, yes it's a fantasy rather than true-to-life, yes it's spectacular rather than deep drama. But what the hell, it's also (like the book) a hilarious send-up of Englishness as seen by a Frenchman.  The millions of cameo roles (actually I'm HOPELESS at recognising faces, so identified none of them) camp it all up splendidly.  This film is one of those, like the Ealing comedies or the Carry-On films, that define the British Myth.<br><br>OK, so it won't work on TV, unless you have a widescreen TV and can shut yourself away from all distractions for several hours. But I just dare anyone to be bored by the film in a cinema. They don't make them like that any more, because these days films are \"made for TV\" . . .","user":"george-102","rank":[37,44]},{"title":"A spectacle in every sense of the world!","rating":8,"date":"2 January 2002","review":"Mike Todd's version of Jules Verne tale offers a refined English comedy, giant-screen travel landscapes, dazzling brilliant color, famous actors in small roles... as Phileas Fogg and his comical valet made the tour of the world beginning in England, going to Europe, the Middle East, India, and Asia... <br><br>It begins in (1872) Victorian London as the wealthy, supremely confident Phileas Fogg sets out a wager that he can traverse the globe in precisely eighty days... The other club members at the Reform Club think Fogg is a fool, and challenge his claim and wager £20,000 that he is wrong...<br><br>The snags begin almost immediately, as the true gentleman misses a train and has to travel by balloon... The wild journey takes Fogg and his new servant into a series of incredible adventures in every land they pass through... <br><br>David Niven plays the true impassive Englishman Phileas Fogg... A polished man of the world, who makes no superfluous gestures, and is never seen to be moved or agitated... A puzzling personage, who believes in progress, science, and intellectual deduction... An eccentric quiet gentleman who talks very little and lives by a precise schedule of tea, whist games, fish and chips... He lives alone in a big house, and a single domestic sufficed to serve him...<br><br>Mexican screen legend Cantinflas known as the comic genius of the Spanish-speaking world, plays Passepartout, the most faithful of domestics...<br><br>Passepartout is a multi-skilled honest Frenchman with a pleasant oval face, slender and slight, soft-mannered and serviceable... <br><br>Robert Newton plays Mr. Fix, the mysterious detective who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber... He is a slight-built personage, with a nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he is incessantly twitching... <br><br>Shirley MacLaine plays the charming young Indian princess, Aouda, who was married against her will at age seven... She speaks English with great purity... <br><br>One of the main interests of the film is the various cameos played by stars of the time who give minute but exquisite characterizations:<br><br><ul><li>Finlay Currie, Mr. Fogg's usual partner at whist...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Robert Morley, one of the directors of the Bank of England...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>John Gielgud, the dismissed servant who relates that his master wears two watches, and every available surface in his house is covered with so many clocks...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Trevor Howard, the club's member who rejects the news that the English gentleman has robbed the Bank of England... </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Charles Boyer, the educated travel agent who proposes to the couple to travel with a hot-air balloon...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Martine Carol, the offended lady who slaps the new butler just for saying: 'Mademoiselle!'</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Fernandel, the French coachman who was not so content with the tip...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Gilbert Roland, the Arab who offers his ship to Marseilles just on one condition...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Cesar Romero, the henchman who sadistically insists Passepartout must fight a bull even if he doesn't know how...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Ronald Colman, the Railway Official who announces (No more railway!) all passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad... </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Cedric Hardwicke, the officer who finds happily a means of conveyance : to cross the deep jungle on an elephant! </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Charles Coburn, the Steamship Company clerk who makes the observation that the 'Carnatic' had sailed the evening before...and he doesn't expect any vessel to Yokohama one week from now...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Peter Lorre, the smiling Japanese steward who informs Passepartout that being broke without money in Yokohama... is catastrophic! </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Glynis Johns, the sporting lady who bets with her companion on Fogg's outcome... </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>George Raft, the suspicious mob who chases everyone who stands near his glamorous woman... </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Marlene Dietrich, the Barbary Coast saloon hostess who looks for a way to be free... </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Frank Sinatra, the honky-tonk pianist...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Red Skelton, the drunken with great appetite...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>John Carradine, the insolent colonel hit by an arrow... </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Buster Keaton, the American train conductor who announces some delay...</li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Andy Devine, the first mate who refuses 'Henrietta' to be burn... </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>Victor McLaglen, the helmsman who is ordered ('Full steam!') to feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted... </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>John Mills, the sleepy carriage driver at the delicate moment...</li></ul><br><br>The other scenes that were actually outrageous and delightful are:<br><br>Passepartout scooping some snow off an alp to chill a bottle of champagne; his funny and graceful way of bullfighting; his burlesque dance with a troupe of Spanish dancers; his venture to ride an ostrich through a back-lot Hong Kong; his anxiety when he is captured by savage Sioux; his courage when he is almost burned to death with an Indian widow; his fault when he clears the 'human' pyramid; his ignorance when he breaks Hindus religious beliefs and his absurdity when he constantly tries to hit on anything in skirts...<br><br>With terrific music, this Academy Award winner for Best Picture of 1956 is nice for the family to watch...","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[43,54]},{"title":"The greatest supporting cast in the history of film","rating":8,"date":"28 September 2005","review":"Michael Todd's screen adaptation of Jules Verne's classic novel is a masterpiece.<br><br>Beautifully shot in over 100 different locations around the world, it is one of the few novels which actually benefits from big screen treatment. No longer do we have to imagine these fine exotic places in our minds, they are presented here in full cinematic and Technicolour brilliance.<br><br>The great David Niven plays the quintessential English gentleman to the hilt as Philias Fogg, the well to do bachelor who after calmly announcing that it was possible, accepts a £20,000 wager from his fellow Reform Club members to travel round the world in 80 days.<br><br>In tow on this mammoth voyage are newly appointed man servant Passepartout played by Mexican entertainer Cantinflas, a rather miscast Shirley MacLaine as Aouda a recently rescued Indian Princess and the lovable and ever watchable Robert Newton as Mr. Fix the detective who is convinced Fogg is a master criminal who left Britain having just robbed the Bank of England. <br><br>Yet what adds flavour to an already wonderful story and fascinating movie, is that no matter what corner of the globe our intrepid Fogg appears, he is helped, hindered, slowed down, befriended and attacked by a myriad of world renowned movie stars. Never before or since has a film boasted so many top named stars in cameo appearances.<br><br>Robert Morley, Ronald Squire, Finlay Currie, Basil Sydney, Noel Coward, John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, Harcourt Williams, Martine Carol, Fernandel, Charles Boyer, Evelyn Keyes, Gilbert Roland, Cesar Romero, Alan Mowbray, Cedric Hardwicke, Melville Cooper, Reginald Denny, Ronald Colman, Charles Coburn, Peter Lorre, George Raft, Red Skelton, Marlene Dietrich, John Carradine, Frank Sinatra, Buster Keaton, Tim McCoy, Joe E. Brown, Andy Devine, Edmund Lowe, Victor McLaglen, Jack Oakie, Beatrice Lillie, John Mills, Glynis Johns and Hermione Gingold all come along for this bizarre journey. <br><br>Now thats what I call a cast list.<br><br>Niven is as always a joy to watch as the seemingly unstoppable and resourceful Fogg, so much so that the film can be forgiven its epic length. <br><br>However, I do feel as though a good half an hour could have been trimmed had Todd decided to tone down some of Cantinflas' over long routines. We know what a fantastic and talented performer he was, there was no real need to hammer the point home with a nigh on 15 minute bull fight sequence, Japanese circus tricks and stunt horse riding. <br><br>However despite this one criticism, the film is legend, the story is legend and was fully deserving of the five Oscar's it was awarded, including Best Picture of 1956.<br><br>In fact I feel certain that if Philias Fogg had a film like this on DVD, he would have much preferred to stay at home and watch it. I know I certainly would.","user":"Scaramouche2004","rank":[39,49]}]
