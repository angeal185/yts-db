[{"title":"I'll See You In C-U-B-A","rating":5,"date":"14 March 2007","review":"According to the Citadel Film series book on Sean Connery, Sean violated a rule that both he and Charlton Heston normally follow, never take an assignment on an unfinished script. The cameras were rolling on the players before the final script was done and the results clearly show it.<br><br>Cuba as a film certainly had potential, but it's not realized in this story. Sean Connery plays a British mercenary who is going to go to work for the tottering Batista regime. He's being hired on the strength of good work he did in Malaya where the British did successfully quell a Communist insurgency in the Fifties. <br><br>Connery's got a lot of reservations when he sees the quality of the troops that Batista has. But that's not what's totally occupying his mind. He's found an old flame in Brooke Adams who is married to wealthy Cuban cigar factory owner Chris Sarandon.<br><br>As a film Cuba veers back and forth between an action adventure, a political tract, and a romance novel, never really settling in any one category. Best performance in the film is that of Jack Weston who plays the archetypal ugly American.<br><br>It's a sad film Cuba, because it had the potential to be a whole lot better.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Lester reveals a likable if none too demanding talent for adventure and love...","rating":7,"date":"8 February 2004","review":"Richard Nester's 'Cuba' is set in the 1950's just in the Civil war against Batista's government... <br><br>Sean Connery stars as a free British counter-terrorist whom Batista's associates hope will help them beat Castro's revolutionaries...<br><br>Connery quickly figures out, almost as soon as he landed in the exotic and dangerous island, that the revolution will succeed and replace one elite with another... He gets much more interest in following an old sweetheart, and when the two see each other, memories of his first love affair come flooding back...<br><br>Connery begins to remember when he was once deeply and ridiculously in love with her... The 'woman in red' that passed before his eyes in Havana's airport terminal was the most exotic, breath-stopping creature he had ever known... Now she is Alexandra Pulido (Brooke Adams), a highly ambitious woman who runs a cigar factory while her husband flirts with other women...<br><br>Chris Sarandon is the profligate son of one of Cuba's wealthiest men, and the charming playboy in the romantic triangle who knows everything about Havana, 'every casino, every table, and every bed in it!' <br><br>Martin Balsam is the general in the corrupt Batista regime, who intends to ask Castro to 'get rid of the Communists.'<br><br>Hector Elizondo is the junior officer who realizes late in life why few were sorry about the fall of Batista... <br><br>Jack Weston is the fat American businessman impressed by the cigar factory... <br><br>Lonette McKee is the ardent lover who rejects all the ways of behavior in Cuba... <br><br>Danny De la Paz is the very bad brother with a handgun license...<br><br>Alejandro Rey is a money-grubbing menace who puts his personal ambition over public safety... <br><br>Denholm Elliott is the soldier of fortune who buys an old airplane so quickly... <br><br>Walter Gotell is the unfeeling father who is quite separate from the businesses run by his daughter in law... <br><br>In 'Cuba', Richard Lester reveals a likable if none too demanding talent for adventure and love... His film lacks the detailed exposition of the many twists and turns of Michael Curtiz's 'Casablanca.' There is no club so well organized in his movie, no open arena of conspiracy, counterspies, secret plans, black market transactions, no true democrat with women, and no traditional woman enclosed by two rivals...","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"Workmanlike thriller with a touch of individual Lester charm","rating":7,"date":"14 May 2003","review":"An enjoyable thriller, which although filmed in Spain, manages to capture the atmosphere and lunacy of the last days of Batista's dictatorship perfectly. Probably a contractual purposes project on the behalf of director Lester, he manages to inject just enough of his own idiosyncratic style to lift this adventure flick out of the run of the mill. Connery is totally convincing in his role as Brit counter-insurgency advisor/mercenary. Brook Adams is stunning. Good anglo-american supporting cast. Plot begins to lose its impetus about a reel before the end, and at a running time of nearly two hours, is overlong. But well worth renting the video. Socialists will not find its political interpetation of events offensive, but may be puzzled or angered by the soundtrack over the final titles - as a victorious Fidel approaches the podium, chants of 'Fidel! Fidel!' are over dubbed with a Nuremberg chorus of 'Sieg Heil!'. Discuss.","user":"steve-raybould","rank":[14,18]}]
