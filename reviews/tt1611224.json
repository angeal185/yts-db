[{"title":"Solid all around flick with fantastic action","rating":8,"date":"10 June 2012","review":"Just got back from an advanced screening that was the (according to the director) first screening seen by people outside of the cast/crew of the movie. Overall I was very impressed, having never read the book I did not really know what to expect. Acting was good, nothing Oscar worthy but no poor performances. Everyone did their job well, especially Benjamin Walker and Dominic Cooper. They both excelled in their roles as Lincoln and Henry respectively. Plot flowed well and was easy to follow, and the action was absolutely fantastic. It was over the top, fast paced, bloody, and very well done. If you don't mind seeing vampires getting hacked, slashed, and bashed to death in a wide variety of ways, you'll enjoy this movie.","user":"bd101ttlb","rank":[233,337]},{"title":"Surprisingly good, great CGI","rating":7,"date":"25 October 2012","review":"Supposedly, the beginnings of Vampires in America and a story about Honest Abe (Benjamin Walker) as he hunts them down before becoming our 16th president. <br><br>I had no idea who Benjamin Walker is. Anyone? Yes, I suspected, but had never heard the truth that Abraham Lincoln was a Vampire Hunter..until now. And, now you will too, if you watch this movie. I can hear you asking, \"is it all true\" Well, of course, it is. Hollywood wouldn't make up something if it weren't true now, would they? And, yes, they are finally admitting the truth about Edgar Allen Poe being a detective who wrote poems on his stake-outs. But, on to Abe..as a Vampire Hunter.<br><br>But first, before you turn away from this one, let me tell you of 2-scenes that are worth your time. The first one is a battle between Abe and Vampire Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) on horses in a horse stampede. Yes, that's right. In a horse stampede. The way this was done was nothing short of fantastic and you will ask yourself \" how in the world did they do this?\" The second one is near the end on a burning bridge the train is crossing. Unbelievable how they did this. Again, you will ask yourself \"how in the world did they do this?\" They took CGI to a new level. You will be talking about these two scenes for a long time. Kudos, kudos and kudos again. <br><br>The entire production, photography, dialogues were all first rate as were the actors within. The music was spot on especially with the train near the end chug-chugging in time with the beat. Excellent.<br><br>Yes, there is some gore as Abe settles in to become the Vampire Hunter we know and love, and his weapon of choice is an Axe. Hey, he was a rail-splitter at one time. Keep up.<br><br>Abe is befriended by Henry (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him how to kill Vampires. But, waitHenry has a secret.<br><br>The main villain Vampire is Adam played by Rufus Sewell and he is always good. And, we learn how the battle for Gettysburg was really won. Yes, the North won but now you will learn how they did it. Never before told.<br><br>One more thing: finally, someone decided on a Mary Todd Lincoln (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is easy on the eyes. Good choice. And, yes, Benjamin Walker makes a good Lincoln especially with the beard later on in the movie. <br><br>It's true, I didn't want to see this movie much less do a review on it. A friend I won't name (Russ) recommended it and thanks to him I discovered the truth and it set me free. Now, I know all. Will you? (7/10)<br><br>Violence: Throughout Sex: No. Gore: Yes, there is some. Nudity: Yes, quick shot of a dead woman with a breast exposed. Language: Only two f-bombs were heard. Otherwise no language at all.

How wrong I was! This is a popcorn movie of the best sort. Ridiculously over the top but in a very entertaining way.<br><br>The action doesn't stop from the get go and there's a narrative that runs through the whole movie that keeps you interested.<br><br>The SFX are impressive too.<br><br>Performances are good, particularly Rufus Sewell who plays a very good villain. \"Rufus Sewell\" that's got to be a made up name. It's too cool to be a real name.<br><br>One of the better vampire films in recent years.","user":"leejpalmer-517-732268","rank":[45,64]}]
