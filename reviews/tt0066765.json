[{"title":"supremely silly skits","rating":2,"date":"2 March 2004","review":"Monty Python used this collection of sketches from their first and second TV series (re-packaged and staged again) to break into the American market.  A gamble, but a successful one.  <br><br>All the greats are here  Parrot Sketch, Dirty Fork, Hell's Grannies, Fresh Fruit Self Defence, Marriage Guidance  and more besides.  The animated links, specially created for the movie, are funny and well put-together: and new versions of Killer Cars and the story of the Spot are excellent.  In many cases the film versions of the sketches outshine those in the TV series and are more memorable, particularly those which first appeared in series 1.<br><br>This is a very good introduction to the team and a strong reminder of their early work for the BBC.","user":"didi-5","rank":[26,26]},{"title":"Yes, some are quite silly, but they know they are! Superb animations!","rating":21,"date":"21 September 2004","review":"Do we really have to grade this among the other Pythons films, as best, worst or anything? Personally I don't feel like to. It's surely not my best, but its got some fine characteristics. It's pure early Pythons.<br><br>Actually it's no film, it's a non-stop trip of absurd humour, featuring shorts, lots of animations, silly commentary, politically incorrect, 100% English jokes, some of which are REALLY silly - the difference here is that we have a commentary within the film which blames of the film which really has taken a wrong turn and has become quite silly. Self parody, originality and sarcasm. And embarrassment, of course!<br><br>About the animations: Python animations (made by the masterman Terry Gilliam) are awesome. No insult here, I really enjoyed the film, even the silliest bits, but the animations are so good that they're the best in this one, as far as I am concerned. So the animations are mixed and edited within managing to create a genuine Python style. <br><br>Those not familiar with Pythons, I recommend to start over with LIFE OF BRYAN or HOLY GRAIL. Actually its quite 'difficult' humour but give it a try if you like something different!","user":"KGB-Greece-Patras","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Pure Python Madness","rating":9,"date":"27 June 2003","review":"\"And Now For Something Completely Different\" is a showcase of the kind of comedy that defines Monty Python's Flying Circus.  The BBC comedy classic has a huge following worldwide, owing to its unique use of surreal humor. This movie is a collection of some of the Pythons' best from their first two seasons, including classics like \"The Lumberjack Song\" and \"The Dead Parrot Sketch.\"  One of the best factors of \"Monty Python\" was the eye-catching animations of Terry Gilliam.  This movie is rich with his art, which includes the wacky B-movie spoof \"The Killer Cars.\"  This is a movie all Python fans should see, and one Python neophytes should use as an introduction.","user":"EmperorNortonII","rank":[23,26]}]
