[{"title":"Awkward, cringeworthy, but very funny!","rating":7,"date":"6 September 2018","review":"I went to see this movie at the cinema with my uncle and the opening scene caught us off guard completely but it set the tone for the whole film. It has some really brilliant laughs and nothing is taken too serious. <br><br>A welcome escape from everyday life just like going to a festival or similar. A few scenes made me laugh harder than I have to any comedy in the last couple of years. The use of shock tactics and in your face awkwardness (similar to the Inbetweeners) is tactful and yet in abundance. <br><br>This movie is what it says it is, a good old solid British comedy.","user":"chris_robbo_23","rank":[22,29]},{"title":"Haters just calm down ... And grow up !!","rating":8,"date":"26 August 2018","review":"Wasn't expecting a masterpiece just 90 mins of laughs , got that on the most part , it's crude , rude , non pc , immature at times , but don't believe FlashCallahans 'review, there were many laugh out loud moments and groans in the cinema showing I went to . Just enjoy , yes it is like watching the third Inbetweeners movie , but if it ain't broke why fix it .","user":"timbmorris276","rank":[25,36]},{"title":"HILARIOUS!!!!DONT LISTEN TO THE HATE!!!","rating":8,"date":"26 August 2018","review":"Does what it says on the tin .
