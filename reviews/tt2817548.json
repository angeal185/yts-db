[{"title":"well done","rating":10,"date":"22 September 2016","review":"Once a week my friends and I get together and watch films. I was looking on Amazon some independent films to watch, and I generally don't enjoy horror/slasher films but decided to give this one a try. <br><br>This movie is scary, riveting and has many surprises. I rented it and have watched it 3 times. If you are looking for an entertaining well-made horror film, I highly recommend this thriller. The characters are well defined and the plot has unusual turns that hold your attention. The ending is well plotted and very unexpected. <br><br>I enjoyed discussing the movie with friends after we watched it. We all had various opinions and each of us saw and focused on different scenarios unfold. We all really enjoyed it.","user":"kellieharperhay","rank":[5,16]}]
