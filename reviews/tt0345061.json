[{"title":"Warmth in a Cold World","rating":19,"date":"19 September 2004","review":"'Code 46' is the most beautiful film I've seen in quite some time. It's funny how something entirely new is produced when the properties of film noir and futuristic sci-fi are married. Like 'Until the End of the World,' 'Strange Days,' and 'Gattaca,' three films which 'Code 46' potently recalls, this is above all else a mood piece, wherein character and plot are secondary to the drifty, elegiac flow of the film.<br><br>The action is underplayed, and the performances have an earthy tone; Tim Robbins recalls William Hurt in 'Until the End of the World' and Bill Murray in 'Lost in Translation,' in that his perpetual jet lag has cultivated an easy, weary charm. The movie is set, one gathers, in the future (or an \"alternative present,\" to paraphrase another reviewer). Like the best futuristic films, it's set on the same planet Earth, but the planet's simply been restructured; the old occupants have left and the new ones have moved in. No longer are there countries, only cities, only business destinations.<br><br>Pleasure is not a goal, but a side effect. The locations photographed are, as in 'Alphaville,' as in 'Sans Soleil,' not manipulated or artificial, but they are photographed in a new way. Contemporary cities look futuristic, commercial, busy, cold, with pools of dark glass and beads of light from skyscraper windows. For me, this kind of imagery is the among the most romantic and evocative. Cold, impersonal environments like these simultaneously forbid and necessitate human warmth. Intimacy becomes something to escape into.<br><br>Michael Winterbottom and his screen-writing partner Frank Cottrell Boyce have done great work before, and inevitably, a lot of viewers and critics are dismissing 'Code 46' as a number of things, including listless and convoluted, but I think that's symptomatic of approaching this film with the wrong expectations. Far beyond simply being a trivial footnote in what will hopefully be a career of formidable longevity, I think 'Code 46' is perhaps Winterbottom's best work yet, the movie I intuited Winterbottom had dormant in him. The movie has a sort of purging effect, like Wenders' 'Until the End of the World,' and as with that film, my immediate environment felt different to me, changed, upon exiting the theater.","user":"MichaelCarmichaelsCar","rank":[144,177]},{"title":"The plot is almost secondary for such a great deal of the film and you can't really get a feel for what it is actually about.","rating":10,"date":"14 March 2004","review":"I had the pleasure and the privilege of attending a screening of this film recently. It had been unveiled in an incomplete state at the Venice film festival and in a more complete state at the Rotterdam festival last year. It has since been re-edited and was played for the first time to close the Birmingham Screen Festival ahead of its worldwide release later in the year (probably August/September).<br><br>It is the newest collaboration between British director and writer team, Michael Winterbottom and Frank Cottrell Boyce. It stars Tim Robbins and upcoming British actress Samantha Morton (Minority Report, In America, Morvern Callar).<br><br>It is set in a near future where a worldwide law (Code 46) makes the marriage of two people with genetic similarities illegal. The idea is that many cloned embryos are produced by IVF and so there are a number of genetically identical people in the world. So the potential is there for you to meet someone who is genetically related to you, so everyone must be screened before they marry. Any births resulting from Code 46 liaisons are terminated.<br><br>The plot is almost secondary for such a great deal of the film and you can't really get a feel for what it is actually about until very close to the end, and that is what made it so refreshing for me. It was more about the feel of the places, the emotions of the two characters (Robbins and Morton) and their developing relationship. You really don't know much about this futuristic society that people are now living in, or why it came to be like that. It reminded me of Hitchcock in that he would have a plot feature that was necessary for the whole story to take place, but it was almost secondary to the story itself (Hitch called it 'the macguffin'). An example of this is the stolen diamonds in North By Northwest.<br><br>In those respects it reminded me of Lost In Translation in that it was more about some subconcious feeling you got from the film, the characters and the whole atmosphere than about plot points. It makes it confusing and you wonder whether you'll get to the end without knowing anything, but when the end comes you've found yourself having actually picked up lots of information unwittingly. And more importantly, you really feel for and love the two characters. And I really loved the fact that while the film doesn't end on a low point, it isn't the happy ending you might expect (and indeed hope) of the two characters.<br><br>The obvious references are similar films like Blade Runner and Brave New World, but while it is a futuristic setting its not doused in sci-fi overtones. It looks fresh and stylish and is the result of shooting partly on film and partly on DV and utilising numerous digital effects. The very low budget of the film also meant that they couldn't build any large sets, so instead the film is made entirely on location (Shanghai, middle east and Westminster tube station in London).<br><br>We were treated to a Q&amp;A with one of the actors and with the producer who gave a great deal of insight into the film, and I for one left the cinema feeling very lucky to have seen it.<br><br>When its in cinemas later in the year I recommend you go and see it. I know for a certainty that a lot of people won't like it because it lacks those obvious plot points from the outset, but instead it doesn't take you by the hand to its conclusion.<br><br>One of my new favourite films I'm sure.","user":"aw-20","rank":[105,133]},{"title":"Innovative and subtle","rating":8,"date":"25 August 2005","review":"Code 46: Innovative and subtle In Code 46 Michael Winterbottom continues to confound and mystify audiences in this bizarre sci-fi romance set in the not too distant future. What's most commendable about the film is its social critique, which is a subtle yet poignant criticism of the so-called freedoms of a free market capitalist society. As with 9 Songs this is a film with an acerbic social commentary reflective possibly of Winterbottoms Marxist or anti-establishment leanings.<br><br>Code 46 is set in a world in which nation states have been replaced by a central administration known as the 'Sphinx'. As with Gattaca or Clockwork Orange this film is based on a timeless paranoia of big government and its impact on social liberties. Other compelling analogies suggest this is a reference to the curtailing of personal freedoms in the 'War against Terror', whilst others recall the strong resonance between Code 46 and the indifference of the west to the plight of refugees. Nevertheless this author felt that the central premise of Code 46 was something other than this. The film essentially deals with the paradoxical nature of freedom and choice. The fictitious society in which it is set is not, as some people have called it, a 'post-apocalyptic' one, rather a parallel or distant version of our own reality in which the rampant commodification of human genes has created the necessity to impinge upon some basic and intrinsic individual freedoms. Code 46 was a savage onslaught against the ideological premise of economic rationalism and the cult of individualism so endemic in contemporary society. In an age where democracy and freedom have been substituted for free markets, consumer choice and rampant materialism Winterbottom throws it back in our faces and asks: is this what you really want? The parallels between this and his other work 9 Songs (which incidentally was made after 46) is unmistakable. Yet Code 46 is a far more exceptional film in that it carries a more readily accessible didactic about modern life. Even so 9 Songs and 46 are unrepentantly abstract, contrived and provocative, both in terms of the moving picture medium and also its dissident social commentary; though the latter is often underrepresented in critical assessments of Winterbottom's work. Equally, he is a brazen romanticist whose work is unapologetically sentimental and yet so cynical, 'edgy' and aloof at the same time (i.e. the recurring duality of innocence versus guilt, gratification versus selflessness etc.).<br><br>Code 46 is a sensitive and beautifully subtle film, but it suffered (in part) from some callous editing which served to undermined its overall constitution. First and foremost the length of the film should be shortened by a good ten to twenty minutes (the DVD release has in fact reduced it by almost 5 minutes). Novelty turns to boredom as the plot begins to loiter unnecessarily towards the latter stages. Nevertheless this 'placidity' is perhaps what fans of Winterbottom have come to expect and appreciate about his style of narration. And whilst there is an understated, refreshing quality about the slowness, its far too *unconventional* for the pallet of most moviegoers. One other aspect the director will have to reconsider in future ventures is the dialogue (and this applies to both 46 and 9 songs). Fans may find the language 'real', 'unobtrusive' and 'unpretentious', but others will find it annoying and difficult to follow (those who have seen 9 Songs will most likely understand the nature of this criticism). There is an almost satirical naivet√© about the way people express themselves (though in all fairness it's not the director that should be blamed for this but the scriptwriter). This author found the dialogue frigid and unrealistic and it was perhaps this intolerance that ultimately fissured into a general detachment from the story and its characters.<br><br>But despite this, there is a distinct possibility- based on his current works- that Michael Winterbottom will be remembered as one of the most innovative filmmakers of our time. It remains to be seen if this bold prediction materialises.","user":"evilspaceman","rank":[8,8]}]
