[{"title":"surprisingly funny!","rating":8,"date":"14 June 2018","review":"I went into this with low expectations. Honestly, an entire film about adults playing the game of tag?<br><br>I was pleasantly surprised how funny this film was! I haven't laughed this hard in a LONG time! It is a fast paced comedy that wears its R rating proudly - it is rude, crude and funny!!<br><br>This film is all about excellent acting, great direction and wonderful editing. The plot is paper thin but I was never bored..<br><br>Don't let the plot dissuade you from seeing this. I actually laughed so hard I missed a lot of the jokes! will probably buy this on bluray so I can catch up with what I missed.<br><br>Enjoy. 8/10","user":"fritzlang","rank":[271,357]},{"title":"Vastly Underrated IMO","rating":9,"date":"16 June 2018","review":"Folks should learn to totally ignore the critics these days. Too much political correctness has made them completely misleading and just plain wrong a lot. <br><br>I haven't laughed in tears for much of a movie in a long time. Based on a true story this was outrageous and funny. It is not for kids and is pretty dirty language but so well done. Enjoy!","user":"bnemec-929-478125","rank":[280,400]},{"title":"A very funny and heartfelt reminder to live life to the fullest","rating":9,"date":"8 February 2019","review":"This movie really pulls you in and makes you think about making the best of every day you're alive before it's too late. There is comedy and weirdness and outrageousness and the reminder that you need to live life to the fullest each and every day. At the end of the movie it's very likely you'll appreciate what you have. This movie totally made me forget of all the social BS that's going on in the world and my life and made me think about the things I have to be grateful for.","user":"jd_bugman","rank":[19,23]}]
