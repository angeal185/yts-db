[{"title":"The voices are unbearable","rating":2,"date":"25 August 2019","review":"If you want to watch 3 plastic British women around 30 yrs old running around California with THE most obnoxious voices still trying to act like they are 16, this movie is for you. If you want ANY substance or scare or even 2 seconds without high pitch squeeling voices that cause a migraine after 15 minutes this is NOT for you","user":"andrewmcl83-170-764416","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"Annoying!!!","rating":2,"date":"22 August 2019","review":"Honestly, after 5 minutes I was actually rooting for any murderer that might show up. Possibly the most irritating performances in a horror movie I've ever seen. \"Yeah baaaaabe\"<br><br>I gave it 2 stars for the LA scenery. Didn't get past 20 minutes before wanting to rip my own ears off and stuff them in my eyes","user":"midnightz_13","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"A Scare-free Slog","rating":2,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"I see lots of good reviews for #FollowMe that I don't understand at all. This isn't a horror, or a slasher, or a thriller. It's a bad drama full of unlikeable characters. Three shallow, vapid, and gorgeous British women take a trip to California. Things don't go great, they fight amongst themselves, and then they all get murdered. No tension or scares until the last ten minutes, and by that point you're so sick of the characters you kind of root for the anonymous, unexplained killer. 2/10; it gets one point for the attractiveness of the cast.","user":"longview-77631","rank":[9,9]}]
