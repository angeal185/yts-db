[{"title":"Great acting is enough","rating":7,"date":"31 May 2004","review":"This is a very well acted movie that deals with a sudden loss in a family in a better way than I would expect. The movie avoids the usual clichés and through some very strong performances shows us how it could really be. The dead person is the daughter of Ben (Dustin Hoffman) and Jojo (Susan Sarandon), her fiancé named Joe (Jake Gyllenhaal) is now living with them. The girl was murdered, simply because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now Ben and Joe go into business together and the all try to live on in their own ways. Joe befriends a girl named Bertie Knox (Ellen Pompeo) who also has lost someone.<br><br>Like I said the subject is handled in a very good way. May be the movie makes some easy choices, especially near the end, but the acting is so good and real here that the movie is easily forgiven. Gyllenhaal plays the same kind of part as he did in 'Donnie Darko' and 'The Good Girl', not the most happy one. He has the best single scene, although overall veterans Hoffman and Sarandon are as good as he is. The best thing though is Ellen Pompeo. Her character has a certain sweetness and nice way of dealing with things and Pompeo finds the perfect note for playing this part. See it for the acting and you will find a lot more.","user":"rbverhoef","rank":[41,46]},{"title":"An underrated masterpiece.","rating":8,"date":"15 January 2006","review":"\"Moonlight Mile\" is one of the most beautiful films ever to be made. Highlighted by phenomenal performances by Hoffman, Sarandon and Hunter, the film is truly inspiring, despite some overly-sentimental moments.<br><br>Brad Silberling has created an amazing piece of film. The story starts out quite shakily, but manages to quickly find its feet and, thus, saves itself from being another overly-indulgent, kitchy movie. Some might battle with \"Moonlight Mile\"'s pace, as the film takes its time in developing its characters. However, the film is character-driven and these developments are fundamental to the film's progression.<br><br>Holly Hunter's performance is Oscar worthy, even though her role is quite small. Judi Dench won an Oscar for her 8 minute performance in \"Shakespeare in love\" and I see no reason why Hunter should not have been nominated. Amongst a cast of film legends, Jake Gyllenhaal holds his ground. It is obvious that he has had less experience in the acting field, but his performance is still great. Gyllenhaal's climatic monologue near the end of the film will give you goosebumps. It is the best part of the film and in my opinion one of the best scenes in cinema history.<br><br>In a film about one of the most life-changing, traumatic experiences one can endure, subtlety rules. Little things drive the film and the characters in the film begin to appreciate the smaller things in life. And that's what makes the film so beautiful and so real. The subtlety of the comedy and romance is what makes the drama that much more bearable - which brings us back to the films central theme: coming to terms with loss and trying to move on from it. These beautiful little moments are what make the film.<br><br>One might have mistaken \"Moonlight Mile\" for a Cameron Crowe film as music plays a vital part. The film's music is as evocative as the action on screen and the film's epic moments are emphasised by the films perfectly fitted music.<br><br>This film has been overlooked and underrated, and should have received more credit. Silberling has crafted an outstanding piece of cinema, which is rich with emotion and evocatively inspiring. Some cynics may find the film too sentimental and will claim they predicted the entire movie, but if one is able to ignore the odd mushy moment (there's one or two), \"Moonlight Mile\" is a cinematic triumph. Treat yourself to this amazing film!","user":"us3","rank":[51,60]},{"title":"Fantastic film with even more fantastic acting!!!","rating":10,"date":"3 June 2005","review":"This film is perfect if your looking for a good cry but with some humorous bits too, in fact this films got everything you want in a drama, joy, sadness, hope, fear the lot. OK this movie is not for everyone some people are bound to find it really boring and a bit of a drag so if you into all action and full of energy kind of films then I would advise you not to even consider this but to all the people who are into dramas or Jake Gyllenhaal then I would recommend this movie 100%. The acting is truly amazing, they are all really believable as the roles they are playing. Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon as the parents of their murdered daughter, Ben and Jo Jo, clinging on to her fiancée as they feel he is a big part of her and don't want to see him leave them too, while Jake Gyllenhaal as the part of Joe the nearly son-and -law to Ben and Jo,Jo, who tries to be perfect for them and be everything he wants them to be despite what he wants..which he really doesn't even know..he's confused..doesn't know what he wants to do in life. As he said, \"I want to figure out what I want to do\". <br><br>This film is truly beautiful and shows deep emotion that isn't in any way corny.A film that I think is very underrated.To be honest I saw it for Jake Gyllenhaal but after seeing it it is now one of my favourite Jake films.<br><br>I loved it!","user":"luce_857","rank":[25,28]}]
