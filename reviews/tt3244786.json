However, I thought that all the actors, especially that of the lead, performed their characters very well, and it was interesting to see the struggles of his early life. Andrea did not achieve real success until his late 30's, which is unusual in the music industry. A must for all his fans.","user":"leslie-ellis","rank":[9,11]}]
