[{"title":"30 random characters thrown together does not a good movie make","rating":2,"date":"23 October 2014","review":"This movie really isn't worth writing about but after seeing that most other reviewers praise it to the sky I felt it was my duty. It seems like a lot of those people are either part of, friends with or related to someone in the movie.<br><br>Now that could be a coincidence and they could be completely objective on the matter I'm sure but here's my guaranteed objective 2 cents on the movie that's called \"Bubblegum and Broken Fingers\":<br><br>It's utter crap.<br><br>It's just a big bunch of random terrible characters thrown together to tell a almost semi-coherent story.<br><br>Here are some of the \"colorful\" characters you'll see in this movie: <br><br>1 African-American drug smuggler, 1 Italian-American drug smuggler, 2 German tourist pedophiles, 1 kidnapped German girl named Heidi (of course), 1 mute with a thirst for blood, 1 lesbian godmother gangstress with 2 bikini babes on her payroll, 1 Asian-American detective, 1 doctor and his horny Latina assistant, 1 Benny Anderson from ABBA lookalike surgeon, etc.<br><br>If mixing those characters up sounds like fun, it's not. Really not. Played like a straight thriller, which of course doesn't work with the level of bad acting and ludicrous characters. <br><br>And I didn't even mention that there's a 4 minute choke-sex scene with techno-music and accompanying boxing match bell-ring sounds to point out when it's time for round 2.<br><br>It's not even laughably bad. It's just bad. Real bad.","user":"Seth_Rogue_One","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Bubblegum & Broken Fingers","rating":5,"date":"5 October 2011","review":"It was shot well, looked really good. Good DPs, but two of them for an indie film? Strange. Liked the title. Didn't really buy the special effects. Sometimes the sound quality bothered me. Some of the cuts took me out of it. Didn't buy that the actors were really familiar with using guns. Didn't believe German pedophile thing. Too many characters with too many things going on with all of them. Unnecessary characters, unnecessary locations. Too many story lines. Scattered plot. Confusing. Run time too long and did not hold my attention. The story lines did not comes together well toward the end. I wouldn't go see it again, but they get kudos for making a good- looking feature.","user":"broadysavvy","rank":[14,29]},{"title":"Bubblegum and Brokenfingers","rating":6,"date":"6 October 2011","review":"This film was full of action and suspense that kept me glued to my seat at all times and wondering what was going to happen next. This film by Sean Jackson is one that would appeal to a wide variety of ages, and to both males and females. All of the female characters that were in this movie seemed to have strong believable characters. The desert scenes gave a nice twist to how the characters were becoming deeper into the plot of the film. I liked how the music and sound effects were used in the film to pull in intense lead in's to what was coming up in the next scenes. I really liked the ending with the suspense of who and how the end of the film was going to turn out. This is a film that I would be telling my family and friends to go and see for sure.","user":"sillygirl1717","rank":[5,27]}]
