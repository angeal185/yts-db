[{"title":"manifesto","rating":1,"date":"1 January 2020","review":"The main impression - this live action version is only a multicultural manifesto, using as pretext only, the original Disney animation. I am not a fan of the live action versions because each of them is far by the poetry of the original. In this case, the sacrifices for a multicultural manifesto are too many and too much. And this is an obvious sin. In my case, for the lost of the beautiful - spices song of the Siamese cats. The virtues - the beautiful opening, F. Murray Abraham, Rose as the expected Lady and, sure, Yvette Nicole Brown performance.","user":"Kirpianuscus","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"Should be titled Lady And The Tramp \"politically correct\" version","rating":3,"date":"28 December 2019","review":"Why did you mess with a classic Disney and turn it into politically correct garbage?","user":"apopkaflowerchild-221-269056","rank":[57,71]},{"title":"About what you'd probably expect","rating":6,"date":"12 November 2019","review":"Once again Disney's live action remake of a classic animated movie hits the \"well alright\" mark. This definitely isn't an awful movie. The opening is actually pretty lovely, and overall the movie has a lot of nice aesthetic to it throughout. The few songs are honestly fine. Not really cringy or anything, they don't waste time on these really. The CGI of the dogs is kind of hit or miss. Some scenes it's actually pretty believable and looks great, others it can be a bit wonky. But the movie also lacks what visual luster an animated film brings, not to mention that this version is a bit longer than the animated, so the movie ends up feeling a bit laggy and drawn out. A few chuckle worthy moments, and it does pick up a bit near the end, but overall a very meh, good for playing in the background during casual night, movie. Remember this is a straight-to-video release, and you won't really face much disappointment.","user":"djones0305","rank":[77,98]}]
