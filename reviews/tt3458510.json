[{"title":"BAD!","rating":1,"date":"24 April 2018","review":"Am I the only one who is sitting here thinking about the girl who got raped and how it got completely dismissed/ silenced? Not exactly a good portrayal for people who are unfortunate enough to experience such a horrible attack. Obviously its OK in America to just rape people and get away with it- This should not be normalized in any way.","user":"xxnat_babexx","rank":[53,69]},{"title":"What did i just watch?","rating":1,"date":"20 April 2018","review":"I'm not even sure what I actually experienced in that movie to be honest. I went in blind, and i left blind. <br><br>Nothing happens in this movie, literally nothing. I can't even spoil it for you. I just. I don't even know what to say. I've never even written a review before.This is the worst movie i've ever seen. <br><br>Why was there a Harry Potter sex joke that didn't even make any sense? that's the only thing that i remember from that movie literally nothing else stood out. They also made a tampon joke, do i need to mark this review as containing spoilers now?","user":"althekool1","rank":[86,116]},{"title":"2 points for Lucy","rating":2,"date":"21 April 2018","review":"Lucy Hale was the only thing worth 2 stars. The movie was stupid and I couldn't go past 5 min. You can clearly tell it was written by people who don't smoke due to the fact in the first scene Lucy practically threw away more than half a blunt.","user":"rhiannonf-82170","rank":[46,61]}]
