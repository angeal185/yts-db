[{"title":"A Film for Every Man, Women, Boy, & Girl","rating":7,"date":"19 February 2018","review":"Barri Chase put together a real winner with this family movie. The kids in this movie done a remarkable job conveying the story through emotion and great conscience. I love the Native American people and have always felt their view on life and our mother Earth is one that should be held in high respect and high esteem. This movie helps relay that very message and brings together a culmination of mixed cultures to help show we are all truly one race. Every Man, Women, Boy, &amp; Girl will enjoy this story. Great work!!! &amp; Thank You!!! - to everyone involved in its creation : )","user":"deltablues-06321","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Don't bother","rating":1,"date":"24 June 2018","review":"Having seen the high IMDB rating, I thought I'd enjoy this movie. What a load of rubbish. Terrible acting, production values are low, which is understandable. However no heart to this movie, shallow and pathetic. Don't waste your time.","user":"brushwood-113-428982","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Lovely film","rating":7,"date":"9 February 2019","review":"Beautiful film. There is excellent cinematography and a great score. A quiet and reflective film that asks us to think about our relationship with the earth and each other.","user":"sixdabomb","rank":[0,0]}]
