[{"title":"Solidly entertaining directorial debut from Robert Carlyle","rating":7,"date":"17 June 2015","review":"This crime-comedy is lead actor Robert Carlyle's directorial debut. In it he plays the title character who is a late middle-aged barber living a life of humiliations who accidentally kills his boss after an argument, leading to a chain reaction of ever worsening events.<br><br>Typified by distinctive on-location shooting in the east end of Glasgow, this is a pretty good effort all round. It benefits from some effective comic acting by its cast, aside from Carlyle himself the two other standouts are Ray Winstone as a cockney cop displeased to be stationed north of the border and, best of all, working under heavy make-up Emma Thompson is very convincing as Carlyle's elderly Glaswegian mother; as per usual she puts in fine work here and nails her character pretty firmly. The plot-line isn't really massively interesting to be fair and, instead, the film works as a character-driven comedy. Fortunately, the characters are, for the most part, well-drawn and the comedy is often pretty funny. Things are ultimately rounded off with a finale that is perhaps a little predictable once the basic set-up is established but for this it can be forgiven. All-in-all, while it doesn't exactly break the mould, this film is still a pretty solid bit of fun.","user":"Red-Barracuda","rank":[30,43]},{"title":"Hugely enjoyable, uniquely Glasgow","rating":8,"date":"2 August 2015","review":"Greatly enjoyed this film. The weakest element is probably the story which is on the improbable end of the spectrum but, as long as you forgive the absurdity of the plot and just go with the flow, it's a thoroughly enjoyable 90 minutes. They could also possibly have done with a little more explanation of the back-story rather than jumping straight in - some might find it all a little complicated especially in the first half hour. The comedy is uniquely Glasgow and the language typically (and authentically!) blue. Visually it's all nicely shot with some of the more off-beat Glasgow landmarks featuring prominently. The acting is great with, as others have noted, standout performances by both Emma Thomson &amp; Ray Winstone. I can't help thinking that Robert Carlyle as Director got better performances out of his other leads than he did out of Robert Carlyle (Actor) - perhaps the double responsibility of first time director and lead actor was a little too much to pull off. Not that his performance was bad, just a little lacking in finesse in places.<br><br>Minor criticisms apart, this is a very enjoyable movie and well worth watching.","user":"kenny-154-609018","rank":[28,43]},{"title":"Aye","rating":7,"date":"7 February 2016","review":"This is a funny noir comedy, well made with an excellent cast. I really like Carlyle so I could not be completely impartial.<br><br>It is a film that gives you some laughs, but it does not let you to yell to miracle. I don't see it as a cult movie (like could be \"The Full Monty\" to me) as I have read here in the comments. It needed something more.<br><br>The actors and the dialogue are the masters here, but also the scenery, the photograph is taken care of. It is well packaged but the plot is not very thorough, it might have been better use the element of surprise and a few more dialog jokes would not hurt at all too. It is not very exciting and it feel like a little flat.<br><br>In any case, the movie has managed to put a smile on my face from beginning to end giving me a few very good laugh.<br><br>A good debut for Carlyle as a director with some space for improvement.<br><br>It should be 7/10 to me.","user":"eryui","rank":[15,22]}]
