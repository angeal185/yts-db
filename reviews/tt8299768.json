[{"title":"Casting was outstanding...","rating":6,"date":"21 March 2020","review":"...and everyone fit their role and played their part perfectly, especially the sisters and June Squibb, who is always a joy to watch.<br><br>The directing was good, but the writing/screenplay could've been better, and had plot and technical issues. The pacing was a little slow and the 90 min runtime felt like 2 hours. The singing fishermen and obnoxious score were very annoying imo. However, the cinematography and sets were great. I know the critics liked this film, and its Fargo theme, but it's not my cup of storytelling tea. It's 6/10 all going to the cast.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[31,38]},{"title":"Better than very good","rating":9,"date":"27 March 2020","review":"This is a story from the POV of the woman. All the women. Excellent sense of place and realistic portrayal of intrigue, power, protection, and betrayal. I enjoyed every minute and would recommend.","user":"epperhud","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Good acting ...... that's it. Completely senseless","rating":5,"date":"6 April 2020","review":"Not sure what just happened ...... started off well and had high hopes but it literally fell off a cliff with the body! The rest of the movie was just a cluster of nonsense with an even more nonsensical ending. Have it 5 star for the first 30 mins &amp; zero for the remainder","user":"lapaulmac","rank":[8,9]}]
