[{"title":"Another mediocre Robin Williams vehicle","rating":5,"date":"7 July 2007","review":"Robin Williams is certainly a very gifted comedian. It would be a sin to classify him as untalented. But somebody needs to send this guy some decent scripts. I think the problem is people feel that all you need to do is cast Robin as the lead, and viola! You've got yourself a hilarious comic romp! Weak writing is weak writing. End of story. The film is not without laughs. I certainly did laugh several times, but as you would expect, most of the good jokes are given away in the trailer. Altogether, \"License to Wed\" is a predictable romantic comedy filled with lots of sitcom-level humor. It's worth checking out on cable. Like I said, there are some laughs, and watching the gorgeous Mandy Moore certainly doesn't hurt either. But this is one of those comedies you'll probably forget soon after you've seen it.","user":"guyfromjerzee","rank":[46,66]},{"title":"Solid C Film","rating":5,"date":"6 July 2007","review":"License to Wed is exactly what I expected it to be when watching the previews. An overall average movie, nothing mind blowing, but also not impossible to watch.<br><br>The movie is a little cliché at points and most of it you have seen before in whatever romantic comedy you decide to think of, but there are a few additions to this movie that made it enjoyable for me.<br><br>As a huge fan of the TV show \"The Office\", I went to the theater the other night hoping that the movie would keep me as entertained as the small screen gem does. If this is what you are hoping for, sorry, its a bit of a let down. However, the simple appearance of a couple of \"Office\" stars is enjoyable.<br><br>The only real beef that I have with the movie overall is Robin Williams' sexed up priest character. I can understand what they were trying to do (humor from sex dialogue), but the conversations seemed uncomfortable to me. A priest becoming sexual isn't that far fetched in this day and age, but really, when your movie makes it look like a priest is hitting on a woman in his marriage counseling class in front of her soon to be husband, just rubs me the wrong way.<br><br>License to Wed is neither terrible nor wonderful. My recommendation would be to watch it if you really don't care what you watch and just need a popcorn movie to relax. No huge laughs but no huge let downs either.","user":"hairysweatysmelly","rank":[58,85]},{"title":"Not so much","rating":2,"date":"4 July 2007","review":"This movie was a bit of a bore. I walked in rather neutral with my expectations, and after the first 10 minutes realized that this ball of cheese was not for me. I sat through it all, for the sake of the company I was with.<br><br>Mandy Moore and John Krasinski are cute, but very flat characters. There is little or no character development in this film. Robin Williams as Reverend Frank tries to save the show with his humorous antics, but was unfortunately cliché in his attempts. The little boy, Josh Flitter, does an excellent job as the annoyingly forthright \"minister in training\", as do the other children playing minor roles, but the overall attempt was bland.<br><br>The movie neither humorously avoids morals, nor does it end with moral enlightenment. The \"lesson\" in the end is weak and predictable.<br><br>If you're looking for something heartwarming, inspiring, or thought-provoking, turn elsewhere. If you'd like a few cheap laughs with a weak storyline, this could be your film.<br><br>I rate it a 2 out of 10.","user":"recontramil","rank":[110,171]}]
