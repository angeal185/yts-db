[{"title":"Worth the watch","rating":7,"date":"19 January 2019","review":"Visually stunning and although it was a slow burn, it was worth it in the end. My only complaints and reason for less than10 stars is because the character development just wasn't there and John Reyes Meyer was terrible in this movie!! I'm normally a fan (somewhat) but in this film he acted as though he was filming his first movie out of drama school, absolutely terrible acting, the way he spoke drove me crazy! It was like he was reading lines he had just read for the first time 10 mins before! He had NO emotion or understanding of the meaning behind the words/lines. It really distracted and annoyed me throughout the film. Other than that it was fine. The 2 main female roles were AMAZING! Especially the elder lady.","user":"mstaffordca","rank":[23,29]},{"title":"Yikes.","rating":2,"date":"2 March 2019","review":"I almost feel guilty reviewing this film, since presumably someone involved with it probably really cared about the project, but oh my god is it bad. Usually a period drama like this is reliably solid - the worst it can be is stodgy and a bit dull; but this one was a screaming dumpster fire from its bodice-ripping opening credits. It should, however, get an award for most criminal waste of Vanessa Redgrave. Joelly Richardson is also an excellent actress, and one can only imagine the two must have been rolling their eyes at each other on the set over the god-awful, scenery-chewing performance of Jonathan Rhys Meyers. It's Razzie-worthy, actually - maybe he'll get a nomination. And what the hell was going on with that accent? It was supposed to be American, but was so over-the-top nasally and shouty it was like his lines were being read by an air horn. Good god man, get a dialect coach. In short, this movie is unwatchable.","user":"korereviews","rank":[27,35]},{"title":"Avant-garde vs Just Strange - Hard To Tell","rating":2,"date":"15 July 2019","review":"I have old-fashioned ideas about movies. I want (1) a story that interests, (2) characters that engage me, and (3) good writing with wit. That said, I must say that this film is, simply, stilted and entirely dull. Why would anyone suffer themselves to endure the bewildering collection of disjointed dialogue. Misses, entirely the story-ideal of beginning, middle, and, end.","user":"mikeh-54044","rank":[11,13]}]
