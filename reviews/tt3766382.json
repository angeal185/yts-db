[{"title":"Mike Tyson!!","rating":8,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"I get that these are youtubers and probably why they got this movie and that its boy humor, and people will hate on this as I wanted to. But I was curious to watch because of Tyson and honestly once i got past all of that I laughed through the whole thing......maybe it was the weed. I was surprised Tyson could act too! I thought it was well done and high quality for a little youtube movie","user":"carlosjoveljr","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"I love it","rating":10,"date":"6 November 2018","review":"I watched this movie as soon as it came it out and I think the boys did incredible! I expected it to be goofy and it was exactly that. I'm so incredibly proud of these boys! (If you haven't seen it go watch it now!)
