[{"title":"Was I suprized? YES I was...","rating":8,"date":"8 June 2018","review":"First of all, I really really regretted downloading the musical, I was seriously sure I was going to dislike it when I realized it was based on a horror movie from 1984. BUT I had nothing better to do so I thinked 'what the hell, lets watch the first 15 minutes atleast'\nI dident leave my chair before the show was finished, and not because I fall asleep either.\nIt was truly a nice musical, the music was nice most of the time, the dialog between the music was somewath clever. The caracters fits exelent to the actors and its clear that they have played the show multiple times and really have good chemistry on stage.\nThe interaction between the actors and the musicans/audience reminds you on the fact that this is \"all live audience\".\nIMDB call it a musical, I would call it \"musical, comedy, horror, action and drama\", in that order :)\nIm REALLY REALLY happy I watched this musical, there are no reasons not to watch it.\nMy only problem is that I now really need to find \"The Toxic Avenger\" from 1984 and wath that one too, hope I get suprized there too.","user":"SpecialWeirdo101","rank":[9,14]},{"title":"Very average musical","rating":5,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"If you don't watch it you wont miss anything. Average of general musicals nothing special.\nPlease stop writing same type of stories again again again. Every american written story has same spine. Stop using spines be creative please.","user":"emperor_of_moon","rank":[0,4]}]
