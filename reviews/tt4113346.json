[{"title":"Beyond truly terrible","rating":1,"date":"4 December 2018","review":"This movie was shot in just 14 days, and it shows. Stiff acting, no chemistry, no suspense, and no redemption for the film. If you're hoping to see Peru, you're out of luck as it was shot in Hawaii. Looking forward to a bit of history? Try elsewhere, as there's virtually none of it here other than the most general of details. The final credits were the most enjoyable part of this flick.","user":"seldom74-513-9792","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"My Review Of \"City Of Gold\"","rating":6,"date":"16 December 2018","review":"The story begins with almost experimental indie fervere, and raises an eyebrow of interest from the start. The acting is blended, some moments read smoothly while others come off contrived or over-stated. Still, Locke maintains control enough to create an interesting enough story, and the scenes are rich with melodrama and theatrics. There isn'tmuch originality present but the almost graphic novel style of story telling adds a better quality to \"City Of Gold.<br><br>The special effects are mixed bag choices, cheap CGI and some practical choices create enough thrills to help get the film to action adventure lecels. Budget restrains are obvious and Locke's film pushes the limit with effectiveness. Still all things considered the action and effects scenes work. The real winner is the locations and cinematography. Overall \"City Of Gold\" is an okay film, just don't go in with blockbuster expectations.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"Worst stinker ever!","rating":1,"date":"4 August 2019","review":"All the cast and crews have written the good reviews for this piece of trash.\nOne of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.\nThe writing sucks, the acting sucks, the directing sucks.\nDo you get the idea that this entire ting sucks?\nIt's more painful to watch this movie than dig my eyes out with a rusty fork.","user":"psxexperten","rank":[5,6]}]
