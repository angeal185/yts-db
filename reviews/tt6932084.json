[{"title":"Even worse than the film it is linked to and that means quite something","rating":2,"date":"9 April 2018","review":"\"The Boss Baby and Tim's Treasure Hunt Through Time\" is an American animated short film from 2017 and a little spin-off from \"The Boss Baby\" one of the most successful animated films from last year. And there they got it wrong as I personally cannot agree with all the awards recognition it received at all and this does not only include the Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature that would have been far more deserving for a handful other animated films. But I guess they just love Baldwin right now because of his Trump connection. Anyway, this should not be the subject here. As for these 3.5 minutes, yep a very long title for a very short film, I think it is a failure pretty much from start to finish. The level of animation is a bad joke to be honest and if they apparently don't even have the ressources to make it look fine visually for 200 seconds, then maybe this should never have been made. The narration is tolerable, but that's the only positive thing here. The story is also fairly bad. This will never get you into the spirit of a pirate movie. And most of all, 75% of the time it feels as if there is no connection to The Boss Baby at all. This could be fine for me as like I said I am not a fan of TBB at all, but from a general perspective, it just makes hardly any sense. And besides, it also would have been fine if it had worked as a standalone film because then it would not have needed said connection, but it certainly doesn't. Pretty much the exact opposite. This one's a mess from start to finish and I am certainly glad it was this short. Highly not recommended.","user":"Horst_In_Translation","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Nothing new","rating":2,"date":"30 May 2019","review":"This is just a re-edit of Tim's imaginings from the movie with some voiceover from Wizzy (the toy that sounds like Patrick Stewart imitating a drunk Gandalf).

The kids sure seemed to like it a lot, played it like ten times for them.","user":"gregberne11","rank":[0,0]}]
