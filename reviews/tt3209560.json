[{"title":"More FAKE reviews...","rating":12,"date":"12 November 2019","review":"It's pathetic how all these reviews giving it 9's and 10's are from accounts that have literally never reviewed or rated any other film. What's that tell you?? Low budget garbage. Period.","user":"ToBeloved","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Amateurish","rating":2,"date":"10 November 2019","review":"If you are used to watching proper movies you might not want to bother with this.","user":"acowdontmakeham","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"Boring Boring Boring","rating":2,"date":"11 November 2019","review":"I didn't make it to the end as it's a very boring and repetitive film.
