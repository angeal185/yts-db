[{"title":"Wonder, what kind of audiences this movie was intended for","rating":1,"date":"31 October 2016","review":"Seen at the Viennale 2016: maybe this movie should be a joke and nothing else, who knows? But for a joke it is not short enough. As a comedy not entertaining enough. Shall I take it seriously? In the 1960's and 70's a lot of movies have been produced that equaled freedom of sexuality with feminism and female emancipation. Somehow this movie could be seen as dialog with this gone era. A girl attracts a man until he gives in and couples with her finally. But after they finish - as a feminist independent action? - the girl leaves the man and goes for the next one. Anyway, this movie is: boring. Especially the last never ending sexual intercourse.","user":"qeter","rank":[9,32]},{"title":"A depraved movie","rating":5,"date":"25 February 2020","review":"The movie is technically not bad, but it's simply obscene, seemingly for its own sake, because it doesn't really have any kind of deeper message or even a developing story on top of that. It's pretty much a soft porn film mixed with a romantic drama and some mild comedic elements, revolving around a sexually aggressive and promiscuous woman with no morals pursuing an equally promiscuous man who is trying to suppress his own base urges. And everyone has sex with everyone. If that sounds like your cup of tea, you might enjoy it. I just found it disgusting.","user":"mstr_bond","rank":[0,3]}]
