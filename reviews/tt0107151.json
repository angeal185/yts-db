[{"title":"I never expected the tears . . .","rating":21,"date":"21 March 1999","review":"I never expected the tears. I never expected the emotion. I was swept away by the epic story and came crashing to earth when the troops took over. All this despite the fact that I do and did know who Isabelle Allende is and I was aware of the history of coups in S. America. I loved the people with the notable and chilly brilliant exception from Jeremy Irons (Can we ever really love his incredible characters?)<br><br>Another underrated movie that seeks much and delivers well although at times with a bit too much telegraphing (the bathing scene with the young Blanca for example.)<br><br>It was a three hankie movie in the end, A great three hankie movie.<br><br>metro_alma@earthlink.net","user":"moyaroo","rank":[27,37]},{"title":"The greatest representation of life in Chile at that time!","rating":24,"date":"24 July 2004","review":"This is the story Esteban, a man who gain land and fortune through hard work. He only wishes for a loving family that have what he did not when he was a child. His conservative ways adds to that struggle and creates conflict with his family. This conflict grows when one of his low-class workers falls in love with his daughter. The military coup of 1973 to bring communism down in Chile is shown. <br><br>This film represents what it is to live in Chile. I have never seen any film that tells the culture and the people of the southern South-America better. Most people makes the mistake to think that people in Chile and Argentina are not white. The whole cast represents EXACTLY what chileans look like and the difference between the higher and lower class. You can learn a lot from this film. <br><br>This movie is 110% recommended. It may have some differences with the book but it is respectful to it. Excellent camera and direction work at a spectacular location.","user":"dreamsound2","rank":[41,59]},{"title":"a great injustice to Allende's novel","rating":3,"date":"17 February 2008","review":"We all know a movie never does complete justice to the book, but this is exceptional. Important characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were essentially mushed into the same character, most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely downplayed, making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one I got to know in the book. In the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people, which in turn was a key element in the life of the family. In the movie she was no more than some special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third-, by the way, is the son and thus comes after Segundo-second-) and its connections to that between Esteban and his grandson from Pancha Garc√≠a (not son, who he also did recognize) is chopped in half and its importance downplayed.<br><br>One of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of: this is called \"The House of the Spirits.\" Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the \"big house on the corner,\" a line stated so many times in the novel. The house in fundamental to the story, but the movie unjustly relegates it to a mere backdrop.<br><br>If I hadn't read the book before, I would have never guessed that such a sappy, shallow movie could be based on such a rich and entertaining novel.","user":"ebstevenson227","rank":[18,24]}]
