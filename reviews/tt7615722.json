[{"title":"Pretty Horrible","rating":1,"date":"16 July 2019","review":"I wanted to watch this movie because it looked horrible. I guess I was right.","user":"hilarylang","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"Cute Story - Technically Curious","rating":4,"date":"17 September 2019","review":"The animation is distracting. When the main charters are talking there are angles that show way too much detail of teeth and interior mouth (unnatural) while a waterfall looks like a quick draft or mock-up that was never rendered in full detail. The walking is odd too - the feet never seem to touch what the are supposed to be walking on.<br><br>The Elvis cover song at the end is the worst version I've ever heard. While the background music is somewhat supportive of the action it was lacking a Hawaiian-like vibe.<br><br>The story is wonderfully free from consumerism and modern tech.<br><br>It's a fun story, good for kids and adults who like the cartoon and animation genre. Don't look too deep, enjoy the story's location and folklore references.","user":"jonniesantos","rank":[1,2]}]
