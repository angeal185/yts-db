[{"title":"Seriously?","rating":8,"date":"14 December 2018","review":"A homeschooled Christian pizza delivery girl, a resourceful girl scout, a couple of bratty IT girls, and two park rangers who know their stuff - are all brought together over the course of one long night when they fall prey to sinister figures lurking in the woods.<br><br>The film was made on a microbudget and there are some problems (as they are with any movie, big budget or small), but frankly you can tell that from the trailer and lack of name actors. From where I sit the money was spent well enough.<br><br>The 3.8 rating is absolutely absurd. We could debate the acting, but overall I think everyone did a good job in their respective roles. Breanna Engle especially shines as our unexpected hero, but Kate Kenney, Hiram Ortiz and the others all held their own. No one is overacting or wooden.<br><br>The writing is strong. Smart dialogue, and unlike most horror movies today it actually has three acts and solid character development. There is a lot going on in the movie but it all ties together in the end. I also found a lot of the imagery striking, especially the use of shadows in certain scenes. Best of all nothing was too dark to see which is often the case with these movies.<br><br>The pace in the first half hour or so could be a little uneven. I watched it with some friends who had to be pulled back in -which they were once the stuff hits the fan. We could also debate character decisions. That being said, when you're 10 miles away from your cars in the woods, running is not always the best option. Especially with bear traps lying around and injuries.<br><br>And yeah, it was clearly not made for a lot of money. But anyone rating this movie a 1 or 2 out of 10 is being a little ridiculous. I really liked this movie, but even if we're being objective - there is a lot to like here.","user":"durrellistheman","rank":[13,18]},{"title":"Boring enough to cause violence!","rating":1,"date":"10 October 2018","review":"Don't waste your time...annoying cast, looks like it cost seven cents to film, and omg why is it sooooo the f boring?
