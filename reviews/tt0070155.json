[{"title":"A deep film about poverty, ambition, ego, and community","rating":10,"date":"29 May 2004","review":"Though the low budget of this film is obvious, it is an amazing story, nonetheless so because it's based on a true one! It's also sometimes quite beautifully filmed.<br><br>What seems like it will be a simple country-boy-makes-good-in-the-city fairytale turns into a darker story of ego, searing poverty, class warfare, and a lust for fame. At first we're drawn to the Ivan, then gradually repulsed.<br><br>The compelling plot is built on a fantastic set of characters that weave a chillingly accurate portrayal of Jamaica in the late 60's -- a tapestry of desperately poor but infinitely resilient people.<br><br>To those IMDb reviewers who thought the story immoral - would you say the same thing about Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Scarface, or Cagney's Public Enemy? This movie examines the effect of despair, desperation, and ambition. It's not a fairytale -- grow up.","user":"joehopfield","rank":[39,39]},{"title":"THE reggae movie!","rating":1,"date":"1 November 2000","review":"I had heard about this film long before I ever saw it. I had heard that it was banned in it's home country of Jamaica due to it's possibility of inciting youths to \"hooliganism\". I had also heard it had great music and so I picked up the movie soundtrack on LP and enjoyed every song on it. It took video for me to finally see this movie years later and I enjoyed it very much. The movie puts you right in the middle of unfamiliar territory from the start, a busload of Jamaican country people coming into town, with their heavy accents, this is one of the few English movies to have been given english subtitles. From this setting you are taken into the life and ambitions of Ivan Martin, a man willing to stop at nothing to achieve success as a reggae star. He makes it, but there is a high cost. Great music, great performances, including a rare look at Prince Buster DJing a party. If you are a reggae fan, particularly early ska, rocksteady and pre-Bob Marley, this is a movie for you.","user":"Schlockmeister","rank":[19,19]},{"title":"Cult viewing","rating":4,"date":"4 August 2002","review":"Ivan is a country boy in Jamaica who comes to see his Grandmother and `make it big' by recording a record.  However when he finds himself exploited by a record producer he turns to drug running to make money.  When he kills a cop who is in on the trade he goes on the run and finds fame as an outlaw standing up against `the man'.<br><br>I first saw this in a cinema in 1995 and it was fully subtitled, I watched it again last night and it had no subtitles.  It was slightly hard to follow some of the very thick dialogue so I suggest if you have the choice that you go for the subtitles unless patwa is a very familiar dialect to you.<br><br>The plot takes swipes at the exploitative music business but also the nature of celebrity and the problems of drugs.  However at it's heart it's a reggae gangster movie that is gritty and enjoyable.  The story is involving but really it's the detail of the setting that carries the film.  The camera allows a great sense of place and really captures the mood and place well, using crowd shots and wandering shots to music.  Really the best scenes are all natural as music plays in the fore ground.<br><br>The music is one of the strongest aspects to the film  where the gangster element is sprawling and relaxed, the music allows us to accept this whole chilled out vibe as just part of the film.  The cast also helps greatly by being very realistic without much effort, not trying to make the accent easier is a brave move if you want to sell the film!  Cliff is easily believable and very watchable, likewise almost all the cast are great  many not being actors.<br><br>Overall the plot may wander in the way only a Jamaican can! But the music and the vibe more than make this a cult film that is well worth watching whether with subtitles or not!","user":"bob the moo","rank":[21,23]}]
