[{"title":"Good for a few laughs","rating":6,"date":"21 January 2019","review":"Looks like low budget. OK story but no surprises. It's comedy, so you don't expect serious acting, but even so, acting is only fair.<br><br>There were some laughs although not anything that breaks you up.<br><br>Nevertheless, I don't see why so many bottom votes (1 star) or for that matter top votes (10 star). I've seen far, far worse. The director had enough sense not to run anything into the ground.","user":"Jackbv123","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Sweet and simple","rating":7,"date":"10 March 2019","review":"There's not much to write about this movie. Very simple story with a predictable ending. Each character has a charm to keep you entertained and the pace moving.<br><br>A sweet story of a successful author discovering an element within himself when a forgotten encounter comes back to interrupt his otherwise perfect life.<br><br>By the way - the authors house is a must see!","user":"cekadah","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Lots of Fun! Entertaining comedy!!","rating":10,"date":"23 January 2019","review":"This movie is really fun! Great cast and there are a lot of laughs. Tom Everett Scott is really great and all of the actors work well together to make the movie really enjoyable. Watched with my family. Entertaining for all of us. Some really funny bits and nice to watch a comedy that isn't overtly raunchy. I recommend it.","user":"charlesroberta","rank":[10,15]}]
