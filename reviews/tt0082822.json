[{"title":"Very funny movie","rating":8,"date":"3 September 2006","review":"Okay, it's far from fantastic and it's very unlikely that most people will ever see this movie, but for me it's one of my favorite silly movies from the 1980s.<br><br>Kaplan, Karras, and Klein were all hilarious in this - especially Kaplan. I was a WELCOME BACK, KOTTER fan and I enjoyed him in that, but I think this movie was a far better showcase of what he could deliver as a comedic actor.<br><br>I showed this movie to a friend recently and throughout it he kept saying how dumb it was, yet he was laughing a lot as he watched it. Yes, parts of it are \"dumb\" or downright silly, but this movie is a LOT of fun to watch.<br><br>Bud Gott","user":"budg212","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"A Terrific Side-splitting Comedy","rating":2,"date":"2 June 1999","review":"Three guys in therapy, each with a different mental disorder, have their car ruined when they drive into a pot\"HOLE\".  They feel the city should buy them a new car, since it was the city's pothole that ruined their car, and they won't take no for an answer.  They devise a plan to steal a mortar cannon, get it aboard a boat and threaten to blow a hole in the mayor's house if he doesn't buy them a new car.  Klein is absolutely fabulous as a schizophrenic with personalities ranging from an elegant actress to a mob boss named Rocky.","user":"PatWells","rank":[8,10]}]
