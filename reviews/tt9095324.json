[{"title":"In-depth view of the biggest band of the last 20 years","rating":10,"date":"15 November 2018","review":"Since Whitecross is a close friend to Coldplay, he has been able to catch some crucial moments in the band's career. This documentary will make you laugh, cry, believe and most of important of all - understand why the band has grown to a larger-than-life-band.\nWhat still comes to mind in the end of the day is how four ordinary guys from Great Britain has been able to create magic in over 20 years with just four \"simple\" ingredients: friendship, happiness, talent and love.","user":"jakoblarsson41","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"A beautiful portrait","rating":9,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"A head full of dreams is a truely beautiful portrait of a band that to the public eye has never been through any real trying times in terms of potential break ups. The look into those darker times are when this documentary really shines because we simply didn't know the depths of how troubled the band was. Whilst things never truely get too upsetting for the band bar a sad death just as parachutes was releasing and the entire ghost stories album it still feels as if this is a stunning revelation a true testament to the editing. A huge help in this is that it is filled to the brim with footage dating back to Coldplay's origins easily the best footage in the entire film.<br><br>The cinematography of the performance pieces is nothing short of mesmerising at times and it all comes together as a burst of colour dripping with the bands philosophy of believing in love.<br><br>The final portions are a tiny bit rushed but you get the feeling it was worth it for those more in depth looks at the difficulties the band faced in the early days. All in all I highly recommend even for non Coldplay fans this has the ability to shine a new light on the bands talent.","user":"jefflarflar","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Reiterates why they're my favorite!!","rating":10,"date":"17 November 2018","review":"Watching this reignited my l‚ù§ve for them as does seeing them live...listening to them...etc! One of my favorite things about seeing them live is you feel how close they are as a group and they make you feel part of it. This confirms the comradery they have that you feel at their shows. Thank you Mat!","user":"pcnrmny","rank":[9,10]}]
