[{"title":"Not too bad actually","rating":6,"date":"8 November 2004","review":"Actually, after seeing the rating on Halloween 6, I have to admit that I was a bit scared to see this movie, not because it's a horror story, but because it just had a low rating. But still I wanted to complete the Halloween series and when I rented this movie, I was really surprised that I liked it as much as I did. I think the rating is a bit harsh, this story brought us back into the story with Jamie, even though a warning in advance, she does get killed off with this sequel, I liked how they continued the story with one of the original characters, Tommy Doyle. It was cool to see him grown up and how the events of 1978 effected him. Honestly I don't know why this movie has a lower rating than Halloween 5, but I guess to each his own, but I really do think this story carries itself a lot better.<br><br>Michael Myers, his niece Jamie Lloyd, and the mysterious Man in Black have all been in hiding for six years. It is revealed that the Man in Black is the leader of a Druid-like cult, and the Man in Black kidnapped Jamie and had her impregnated. The baby is born on Halloween Eve and is carried away by the Man in Black. Later that night, a nurse helps Jamie and her baby escape. Michael Myers, in pursuit of Jamie and her newborn, kills the nurse. Jamie, meanwhile, steals the truck and flees to a dark and empty bus station where she calls in to a radio show that happens to be doing a broadcast about the Haddonfield murders. Jamie gets on the air, begging for help and warning of Michael's imminent return. Beaten and exhausted, she makes her way inside of an old barn where Michael is waiting for her. He kills Jamie, only to find that Jamie does not have the baby. Meanwhile, Tommy Doyle has his eye on a family who's moved into the old Myers house across the street from the boarding house where he lives. The boarding house is run by a mysterious old woman named Minnie. Tommy has been obsessed with finding the truth behind the murderous motives of Michael Myers. After hearing Jamie begging for help on a local radio show, Tommy finds her baby at the bus station and takes him into hiding. The people living in the Myers house are relatives of the Strode family, and among the current residents are Kara Strode and her son Danny. The plot takes a turn when the Man in Black finally reveals himself as Dr. Wynn from the original Halloween. Wynn has been experimenting with pure evil, does he think this is a good idea? Happy Halloween.<br><br>Granted, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is very different than the other Halloween stories, but I think this was a good pick up. Plus you have to admit that Jamie's death is very effective and scary. The whole cult thing was a bit much, but still I think it was a good scare factor to add into the story. The acting is better I think and the writing was a little more accurate. Plus unlike Halloween 5, Michael actually scared me again, thank God, I was getting a little frightened that he was loosing his touch and his butcher knife. So I do recommend this movie if you're looking to complete the series or if you're just looking for a good scare.<br><br>6/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[62,84]},{"title":"This should have been the final film in the Halloween series.","rating":8,"date":"16 June 2004","review":"Halloween 666 (1995) The producer's cut review!<br><br>Halloween 666 starts of with a recap of the horrific ending to Part five. If you thought the last chapter was dark, this one will really blow your mind. A mysterious \"Man in Black\" has raided the Haddonfield Police Department freeing Micheal Myers. In the process poor Jamie Lloyd was abducted by strange cultists. What they want with her? Who knows, but let's just say her long suffering will end soon. Doctor Loomis is back spending the rest of his twilight years trying to stop Michael Myers from killing any more innocents (good luck). A friend of Loomis, Doctor Wynn comes back after a four sequel hiatus to help the good doctor. Another old face from part one guest stars as well.<br><br>This dark and dreary sequel was dismantled during the post production editing. For some reason the distributors felt that the final product wasn't worth the average horror film watcher's time. So they decide to dumb it down. Then after having the film sit on the shelf for several months it laid an egg at the box office. No matter what they did to the film, they made it worse. They should have left well enough alone. Hey, the film company knows better than the filmmakers now....don't they?<br><br>Producer's Cut :Highly recommended <br><br>Released version: Not recommended","user":"Captain_Couth","rank":[51,79]},{"title":"Not as bad as people make out.","rating":6,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"By this stage the franchise had really gotten tired, the previous few had been very poor, almost an insult to the fabulous original.<br><br>Of the first six films I would place this third overall, after one and two. It doesn't deserve its reputation as a bad film, because it isn't bad, nor is it great.<br><br>On the plus side, it has some scary moments, Michael's character is well used. The acting in general is rather good, it's quite slick, in a nineties way. On the debit side, the story is a little far fetched, and I didn't particularly like the cult element, it's like they tried to rewrite the show's past. It's a bit silly I guess, but....<br><br>At least it has Paul Rudd and the wonderful Donald Pleasance.<br><br>Not that bad. 6/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[15,20]}]
