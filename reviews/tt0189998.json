[{"title":"Who Is The Real Monster?","rating":11,"date":"11 May 2001","review":"F.W. Murnau's \"Nosferatu\" has always been one of my favorite horror movies, mainly because it's one of the few that really seems to take itself seriously.  Often, even the best horror films, classics like \"Psycho\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\", include moments of leavening humor.  Even \"The Exorcist\" had Father Karras' film discussions with Detective Kinderman. Not \"Nosferatu\".  This is a film that spends every moment of its running time shuddering along with the audience in fright and disgust at its beastly vampire and the plague he visits upon the innocent people of Bremen.  E. Elias Merhige's intensely imaginative \"Shadow of the Vampire\" offers an intriguing explanation of the film's creepy hold.<br><br>It's 1921, and Murnau (John Malkovich), a kinky martinet obsessed with creating films as authentic as breathing, drags his crew to a moldering castle in Czechoslovakia for the filming of his vampire epic.  There, the surprised crew meets Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), the actor playing the vampire, who, to say the least, has taken method to a new height.  He is, in fact, a real vampire, who has made a bargain with Murnau.  He will appear in the film, giving the director the realistic horror experience he so desires, if he is permitted to drink the blood of the leading lady in the final scene.  Murnau grows increasingly obsessed with feeding his muse while Schreck settles for feeding himself, the body count mounting inexorably as Murnau struggles to finish his masterpiece while his leading man is finishing off the crew.<br><br>Steven Katz' script could likely have gotten by on its strikingly original premise alone, but fortunately, he turned what could have just been a corking black comedy into a surprisingly deep meditation on the dark power of the movies and the sacrifices one is willing to make, of oneself and others, in order to create art.  Schreck is seen as a dessicated shambles, the ultimate embodiment of an actor past his sell-by date still clinging to his past glory, who, in a remarkable scene, talks about the sadness of reading \"Dracula\" and seeing how thoroughly his special hell has been misinterpreted and popularized.  Of Of course, all the crew can say to this is, \"What an actor.\"  To them, Schreck is just another old hambone who can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality.<br><br>In one of the film's most poignant sequences, Schreck, who earlier expressed his yearning to once again see the light of the sun, watches film footage of a sunrise through a projector, staring right into the lens so the celluloid sunlight can wash over his face.  It's a beautiful visualization of the powerful hold movies exert; everyone can remember memorable experiences that we've had through the motion picture camera, things we've done and places we've been to that we could not have gotten to any other way.  Just because these experiences were only on film does not make them any less real to us.<br><br>\nMurnau, meanwhile, begins to emerge as the film's true monster, willing to do whatever it takes to see his vision fulfilled, sacrificing his crew, his cast, and his own humanity in the name of achieving immortality through art. Directors are often compared to God, and \"Shadow of the Vampire\" is one of the most effective variations on that theme that I have come across. Murnau, you see, is one of the old gods, and like those archaic deities, he demands blood.<br><br>Merhige helms this material marvelously, conveying a sense of menace and impending doom that make this a genuine horror film in addition to a clever meditation on the form.  The film, for its low budget, has the feel of a true epic, with its castle looming up over the black hills, mossy brown-and-green cinematography, and heavy, ominous music.  The supporting cast does a uniformly fine job, particularly Udo Kier, who invests \"Nosferatu\"'s producer, Albin Grau, with unspoken secrets that exist only behind his haunting eyes.<br><br>This film, however, is really a showcase for Malkovich and Dafoe, who deliver two knockout performances.  Malkovich is the perfect control-freak director, calm and cajoling one moment, barking angry orders the next. He's even willing to shout down a bloodsucking beast if it will get him what he wants for his film.  Dafoe, buried under a ton of makeup, projects a real character through his fangs and hissing, making Schreck pitiable, powerful, and frightening all at once.  Dafoe received a much deserved Oscar nomination for his work here, and if Malkovich had been nominated as well, you would have heard no complaints from me.<br><br>\"Shadow of the Vampire\" gets a bit muddled in its final act, when Murnau finally confronts the vampire with his most powerful weapon.  However, the final moments are so powerful, the last shot so chilling when you consider its implications, that the script's imperfections are subordinated by the power of the film's message.  \"Shadow of the Vampire\" is a provocative picture that explores the depths to which creative people will sink, the cost in lives and their own soul they are willing to pay, just for a taste of immortality.  One must beware.  The taste is a lasting one.  And sometimes bitter.","user":"uglykidmatt","rank":[108,118]},{"title":"Great Performances in a Good Movie","rating":7,"date":"29 April 2001","review":"The premise of \"Shadow of a Vampire\" is simple, what if Max Schreck was really a vampire posing as an actor playing a vampire in the Murnau's masterpiece, \"Nosferatu?\" Well, the result is both slightly scary and pretty funny. Director E. Elias Merhige and writer Steven Katz create a fairly creepy mood, and inhabit the picture with some real interesting characters.<br><br>John Malkovich plays famous silent film director F.W. Murnau. This is perhaps the funniest performance of the bunch, especially when he is giving audible instructions to the \"actors\" while the camera is rolling. Then, there is Willem Dafoe who plays Max Schreck/ the vampire. It is incredibly fun to watch an almost unrecognizable Dafoe play this oddball, Max Schreck. Unfortunately for Murnau, Schreck starts doing what vampires tend to do... bite people. The original photographer dies along with a few others at the mouth of Schreck. After seeing this movie, it is quite easy to see why Dafoe was nominated for best supporting actor at the Oscars. His performance is worth the price of admission.<br><br>This is a film which is hard to classify, sense it is a fictional account of an actual film with real people. Yet this horror-comedy does have its moments of wonderful macabre humor along with great performances to help make it an enjoyable movie. A 7 out of 10. I highly recommend watching this as part of a double feature. First, watch Murnau's original 1922 masterpiece, \"Nosferatu\", then watch \"Shadow of a Vampire.\" You will appreciate \"Shadow of a Vampire\" a lot more (or maybe vice versa).","user":"buckleym-1","rank":[56,60]},{"title":"I Smell the Blood of a Wunderkind","rating":9,"date":"5 March 2001","review":"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that completely and maybe consciously defies categorization, and \"Shadow of the Vampire\" is a great example.  It is at once a black comedy, a horror movie with a unique setting, and a biting sendup of the art and business of moviemaking.  And the fact is that it wears each of these hats quite well, although not necessarily at the same time.<br><br>The movie asks us to imagine:  What if Max Schreck, the mysterious guy who gave what is still considered one of the best vampire performances ever, did so well because, well, he really was a vampire?  The skulking creature, we are to imagine, was finagled into performing in \"Nosferatu\" for legendary cinema pioneer F.W. Murnau.  The story then follows as the crew makes the movie dealing with all sorts of difficulties, not the least of which is the star's habit of snacking on cameramen.<br><br>Among the film's many virtues is its portrayal of filmmaking in what was really its dawn as a form of art and commerce.  People like me, who have trouble with silent movies may gain an additional appreciation for the work and craft that went in to them, and realize that while they may seem hokey and stylized to us now, they had a beauty and substance that was all their own, and still is.<br><br>John Malkovich turns in a great performance as the visionary Murnau (who, while tortured, must be a genius because he always gets it in one take). It is a characteristic Malkovich role, a rationalist given to bouts of fury, and it is as much fun to see him discourse pretentiously on the science and art of the moving image as it is to see him pitch a fit (\"Albon, a NATIVE has wandered into my FRAME!\").<br><br>The core of this movie, however, and deservedly so, is Willem Dafoe's unforgettable portrayal of Schreck.  This is not your slick-talking Anne-Rice undead-Vogue kinda vampire.  Schreck is the next thing up from a rat, squatting in filth and clicking his claws, and Dafoe is able to inspire laughter as well as fear, and even pathos.  He makes us imagine what a rotten existence it must be, to have eternal life alone in a rotting ruin and a withered body.  He and Malkovich have some great scenes together, including a sick, hilarious moment when Schreck and Murnau try to hammer out who on the crew may or may not be snacked upon (the cinematographer is necessary, it seems, but the script girl is negotiable).<br><br>The movie functions best as a sendup of moviemaking, as the harried Murnau must deal with temperamental actors, unfriendly locals, blood-sucking undead, and other hazards of the movie trade.  At one point, Murnau must leave to calm the investors, a scene I really wish had been included. Some of the best moments are those of the age-old creature of the night attempting to take direction and find his \"motivation.\"  Everyone is afraid of Schreck, but admire the dedication that keeps him in character all the time (he's a Method actor, explains Murnau, he studied with Stanislavsky). The movie makes its point rather neatly, that filmmakers, and by extension filmmaking itself, have a way of sucking the life and blood out of you. Anyone who has ever had to shoot a movie on location will attest to this.<br><br>If I have a complaint about the movie, it is only that after its extreme cleverness, it settles for a somewhat straightforward horror-style denouement.  Myself, I would have thought the vampire would end up moving to Berlin and getting an agent, a swimming pool, and a meeting with Ovitz. Still, the movie clearly makes its point: an auteur driven by a mania for artistic perfection can be more of a monster than something that just lives in a cave and drinks blood from your neck.","user":"pc_dean","rank":[86,97]}]
