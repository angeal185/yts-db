[{"title":"typical teen horror","rating":4,"date":"7 February 2017","review":"This horror is based on the actual axe murders that took place in 1912 and were never solved. So it all looked promising but in stead of becoming a slasher flick this turns into a paranormal flick.<br><br>Is it that bad, well, it all moves away from the actual story and not having any gore or bloody moments this flick fails to deliver. Before the horror comes in it's all about teens and their love problems and once in the house having a tour it all takes too long before things go wrong. half way the flick they do enter the house again, at night and then it all starts, but it was a bit too late.<br><br>The last minutes do deliver the goods but still it's clearly made to have teens watching it. The axe killing people is all done off-camera. The possession entering the visitors is done with, sigh, black eye lenses. Nothing looks scary and the voice being deformed by processors in editing is another big failure. <br><br>Of course teens watching this will love the way it was done. But for a real buff it's all to low to really stick in your mind. <br><br>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5","user":"trashgang","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"Surely not the greatest.","rating":4,"date":"2 December 2017","review":"This is a straight forward horror movie that you've seen many, many times before, with all the standard moves, scares, characters and ending. <br><br>It brings nothing new, delivers on very few levels, doesn't get you too involved, annoys at times but at least it is not over stretched. A haunted house film like all others, with familiar ghosts and typical reactions leading to the most common finale. <br><br>It's down to everyone's personal opinion, I just sat there, watched it and that was all. Didn't do much for me. So watch it at your own peril. <br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"A fresh new horror story","rating":7,"date":"4 February 2017","review":"At first sight of the trailer, one might think that this is another clichè horror film. That's what I had thought, until I actually saw it. The clichè of exploring a haunted house and finding something that surprises the characters, but this is actually justified with the great story development. <br><br>When the characters: Caleb, Dennis and Jess, are introduced we quickly relate to them and are drawn in with their appealing and realistic personalities. Each of their story is developed nicely throughout the entire film, which is something I don't frequently see and am glad this film did.<br><br>The actors portraying these characters do a solid job. Every piece of acting feels real and convincing. And aside from them every other secondary character, is played greatly as well.<br><br>The script itself goes at a great pace for the first two-thirds of the film. We are immersed into a compelling dark atmosphere of suspense. Slowly the story takes a turn for the intriguing as it starts to develop nicely.<br><br>My only problem with the film was the final thirds of the film. The movie builds a great deal of suspense, but when the final act comes it is short lived and falls flat. It could have been better if it was stretched out a little more and got to see a more intense climax. <br><br>As for the scares, it has its moments. One jump-scare was very predictable, but when we get to see the movie starting to take momentum, some moments are jaw dropping, leaving the viewers shaking and kinda nervous. <br><br>The movie is never boring and it keeps you glued to the screen. Much of this is joined by great cinematographic shots, which I gotta give it to Tony Valenzuela, he has an amazing artistic point of view. <br><br>Although I was slightly disappointed with the films climax, I strongly suggest giving this movie a watch. It has a breath taking story, very atmospheric and appealing. Plus the characters strong background story is very interesting.","user":"bearfaceproductions","rank":[16,29]}]
