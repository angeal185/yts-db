[{"title":"I thought it was a very cute and charming movie","rating":20,"date":"20 September 2003","review":"I really cant believe some of the bad reviews of this movie that I have just been reading on here!  The movie is EXACTLY what it promises to be; cute, charming, and yes, a little bit fluffy!!  However, it does not take itself too seriously and that makes its flaws forgiveable.  I thought it was very entertaining and refreshing, come on people, LIGHTEN UP!!","user":"Keri-7","rank":[86,106]},{"title":"Lightweight Escapism (not that that's a bad thing)","rating":8,"date":"1 April 2003","review":"If you want silly, fun stuff, this is the movie to see.  Mike Myers was grand... nice to see him in a small movie. Gwyneth Paltrow predictably good indeed and Candice Bergen perfectly cast as the \"big-haired mentor\".<br><br>It was relaxing to enjoy a lightweight comedy/romance with NO BIG MESSAGE, just smiles and a large number of giggles. I gave it 8 of 10.","user":"JacquiQ","rank":[69,95]},{"title":"Uneven comedy-drama has sweet and funny moments amongst the silliness...","rating":5,"date":"13 March 2006","review":"Pleasant if unremarkable fluff has Gwyneth Paltrow pulling a Mira Sorvino, playing a hick-town cashier in Nevada who is inspired by a celebrity airline hostess and takes to the skies. Middling comedy-romance about flight attendants has Paltrow in unusually silly spirits; her role isn't realistic, of course, but it's a lot of fun watching her go through the ropes, gaining self-confidence and making friends. Her sweet relationship with Mark Ruffalo never gets in the way of the comedy and provides a nice capper at the end. Film begins skittishly, though it, too, gains confidence and composure despite 'scene-stealing' hams in the supporting cast and an abundance of what appears to be costume designs from the 1970s (yet the film takes place in the present day). Not a big success, but a minor enjoyment. ** from ****","user":"moonspinner55","rank":[15,21]}]
