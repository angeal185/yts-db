[{"title":"Mediocre","rating":3,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"Overlong, repetitive, pedantic, prosaic, superficial.<br><br>2 millennia ago Plato determined that the best medium for his theories would have been the literary dialogue form. Nowadays, video directors like Martone, think that it's a good idea to make a 2 hours movie with 20 minutes of bodies doing hippie things plus 20 minutes of people arguing with each other about their views (which obviously represent the writers' irrelevant perspectives on the world).\nWhat about having images, sounds, the editing or the flow of events as your tools to communicate something? Nah... Martone likes to be direct on such overly important topics: let's just have the actors tell everything as if we were on a talk show (or the radio..)..<br><br>The only redeeming factors are - unsurprisingly and depressingly - the photography (guess what? one of the most iconic and beautiful tourist destinations..) and the natural beauty of the young actors.","user":"Ladiloque","rank":[4,11]},{"title":"Sensless boring","rating":1,"date":"2 December 2019","review":"Very, very boring and stupid.
