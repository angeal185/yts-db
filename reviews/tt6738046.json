[{"title":"Good Enough","rating":6,"date":"13 September 2018","review":"If you have watched the anime with the same title, then there won't be many surprises here. The story fallows the same story of the anime movie, taking off some parts only here and there, but the main story and meaning are the same. However, they did an excellent job when it comes to bringing the magic elements to life, without making a fantasy movie. The fantasy elements were handled for what they were: an insight to the girl's mind. She had created that myth because of the guilt she felt about seperating her parents and she had manifested it into a musical later on, a play that explained everything to everyone. For the acting part, all the actors were good and brought out the exact emotions that were needed for the story.","user":"pennyelenabooks","rank":[2,2]}]
