[{"title":"Genuine Review Here","rating":6,"date":"16 October 2019","review":"A serial killer who uses a drone to spy on women before killing them is being chased by the cops and ends up dying. His spirit enters the drone which then takes on a life of its own - like Chucky. The drone ends up in the home of a young couple who begin to notice strange things beginning to happen in the house.<br><br>It's a cheesy, comical B movie but, the acting is fine, it doesn't take itself seriously, the characters are likable and believable, and the story doesn't hang about. I enjoyed it.<br><br>6/10 from me.","user":"michaelant555","rank":[13,18]},{"title":"surprisingly watchable","rating":6,"date":"15 October 2019","review":"Apart from the predictable and far fetched storyline and the cheesy acting, I actually enjoyed this movie and I rated it a 6 based on its comedic value and its general feel, i think some will love it and others will hate it but overall it wasn't too bad at all!","user":"rewireslavedave","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"WTF was that","rating":1,"date":"25 October 2019","review":"Jeez, did your 7 year old son write and direct this pile of trash, I'd rather watch static","user":"wjclaverty","rank":[8,12]}]
