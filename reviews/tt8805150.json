[{"title":"Why...?","rating":2,"date":"23 August 2018","review":"No one expects good shark movies this time of year on syfy channel in prep for the latest Sharknado event, so no one should be disappointed. But yet I am. This movie was neither consistently laughably awful, nor at all good. Sharks are apparently foiled (at least for a time) by rubber and wood rafts, but take out the folks on a good-sized boat within just a minute or two.<br><br>The girls take out a couple of sharks in the most ridiculous ways possible (pulling a large rock onto one's head, setting one on fire with about a quart of gasoline, etc.), which do contribute to the entertainment value. However, the movie takes it self seemingly seriously whilst this is all going on. It's like they had the resources to actually make a halfway decent film, but they chose to just ride the fence of camp and legitimate film and chose not to commit to either. <br><br>The one thing that could have barely saved it would have been a shark jumping out and eating the last survivor as she was recording her video log of the recent events. She had it coming at least as much as the rest of the characters. Embarrassingly bad for all participants - I hope they continue to find work despite this very forgettable film.","user":"Tyypo","rank":[35,37]},{"title":"What a waste of time","rating":1,"date":"30 September 2018","review":"Bad acting \nBad story \nBad graphics \nAnd I just wasted a perfectly good star on it","user":"yessbye","rank":[29,32]},{"title":"Terrible.","rating":1,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"I forced myself to watch this since I love shark movies.
