The lead actress overacts facially all the time. Also a super weak story line that has been done to death and is really dull. You can guess the end from about 2 minutes in, or by just reading the synopsis. YAWN. Don't waste your time.","user":"rainbowbecki","rank":[19,24]},{"title":"Absolutely awful...","rating":1,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"This movie was unbearable. Horrible acting, horrible plot- even the set seemed fake to me. Just awful. Save yourself the time and do not watch!","user":"ashleymorrell","rank":[13,17]}]
