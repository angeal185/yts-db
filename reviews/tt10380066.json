This has won the worst film to date. Poor script. Even worse acting. I will admit that the clown was the best actor.<br><br>The plot if you can call it that. A group of teenagers get lost, or take a rest stop or something in a desert. (I can't even remember how they got there or why) but at least they have phone reception as they are following one guys Instagram posts I assume and they find a fun house.<br><br>Every horror trope in the book. Every clich√©. Anti climax. And abrupt ending.","user":"carljlow","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Terrible, Just Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2 October 2019","review":"This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. It is one of the worst ever. I can't think of any redeeming qualities. The story is terrible and doesn't make any sense. It relies on plot devices and choices no one would make. It isn't scarry. It isn't suspenseful or funny. The characters are one dimensional and the acting is horrible. The effects are bad.<br><br>I kept watching it because I thought it might become so bad it was good, ut it never did. It is just terrible.","user":"timothygartin","rank":[13,14]}]
