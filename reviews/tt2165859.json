[{"title":"The plot is as lost as the characters","rating":5,"date":"25 September 2013","review":"In Fear is a tale of a young couple on their way to a festival, whom detour, at the request of the male half, to a remote idyllic hotel.<br><br>Things go horribly wrong.<br><br>Tension and paranoia builds nicely in the opening third of the movie. Our couple get lost in a network of country lanes, supposedly leading to the hotel, which turn out to be a maze. As dusk approaches, confusion and anxiety turn to fear and dread ...<br><br>This is about as much as I can divulge without spoiling anything, however, the plot from this point onwards goes from irritating to ridiculous. Painful-to-view clich√©s and \"they'd never do that\" type gaffs litter the movie until the end which, when it comes, leaves you wondering if the writer got stuck for an ending.<br><br>When it's tense, it works well but too much in this film went awry for me. I saw it at the FrightFest film festival and did speak to a lot of fans who loved it, but not I.<br><br>I could be wrong, so it's perhaps worth checking out, if you like a claustrophobic, low-budget vibe in your horror but if not, I'd tread with caution.","user":"mungflesh","rank":[70,87]},{"title":"Excellent Score Only Saving Grace in Otherwise Formulaic Genre Fare","rating":4,"date":"10 March 2014","review":"Bored and looking for something to watch, I was browsing through lists of the best horror movies of 2013. The more and more \"In Fear\" appeared in them, the more my interest was piqued.<br><br>Well let's just say the anticipation of watching it was much more exciting than the actual process of watching it. All we have with \"In Fear\" is a poorly scripted, annoyingly repetitive horror movie that is carried along by a phenomenal score that is way better than it has any right to be. The sounds mesh with the images so well that there were moments that I still felt nervous, even though I knew what was going to happen, courtesy of the by-the-numbers script.<br><br>Tom and Lucy are two people that just met two weeks prior. On their way to a music festival in a nearby town, Tom decides to surprise Lucy by taking her to a hotel for a night...a rather questionable move for people that have just met. Thankfully, Lucy seems to be fine with it.<br><br>But there are some red flags from the outset: For one, the only way to get to the hotel is to follow a truck, whose owner they never see. Even more alarming? He points to a locked gate, insinuating that is where they should go next, before suddenly leaving them alone. I don't know about you, but that would be enough for me to get the hell out of there and never return, but Tom and Lucy, stupid horror characters that they are, do as they're instructed.<br><br>From here, we get thirty minutes of them driving around in circles, inexplicably continuing to follow the same signs to the motel even after learning it only takes them back to where they started. Somehow, these scenes manage to be creepy, at least at first, if for no other reason than the aforementioned score. Of course, once minute twenty rolls around of the same old thing, it starts to lose its luster. Then once Max arrives, things go from bad to worse, both for the characters, and for the viewer, leading to an abomination of an ending.<br><br>\"In Fear\" is certainly a competent example of independent filmmaking, at least from a visual standpoint, and I guess it deserves some points for that. It's well shot, well acted, well lit, and despite a few confusing cuts, pretty well edited. Unfortunately, the one thing it's missing, besides a shred of believability, is a halfway decent script. These characters are ones you've seen in dozens, if not hundreds, of horror movies before, in that they are clearly only reacting to the needs of the script; they do not act like normal people attempting to get out of a desperate situation, but rather. Put any real person in this situation, and it would be a five minute movie with no scares and no real action.<br><br>Come to think of it, I've essentially summed up \"In Fear\", only it somehow needs 85 minutes to do that.","user":"LostintheDarknessofNight","rank":[36,47]},{"title":"Car in the Woods","rating":5,"date":"3 December 2013","review":"The reactions at the Frightfest in London where this was playing were ranging from \"liked\" to \"totally hated it\". There weren't too many people who were completely taken aback by the story (if you can call it that). Two people in a car and \"absolute fear\". Or something like that. It has its fair share of moments and I wouldn't say it's a waste of time to watch. But I'm pretty sure many people will get fed up with the characters and the twists.<br><br>There should've been a little more work on the script and there might have been better dialog and better overall options. The shooting style is optimal for low budget and it did suit the movie. But it didn't elevate it enough to make it something that will stand out. \"Them\" and a few other horror gems have done terror in a far better way. With characters the viewer is actually rooting for","user":"kosmasp","rank":[24,35]}]
