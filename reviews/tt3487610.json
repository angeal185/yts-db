[{"title":"Poor, cheap and lazy \"Halloween\" imitation. Don't bother..","rating":2,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"After 20 minutes I used the fastforward button many times. \"Malenvolence 3: Killer\" is boring with an incompetent cast, bad editing and has no surprises or thrills to offer. I'm a huge fan of the horror slasher genre but this film gives the genre a bad name. God only knows why Adrienne Barbeau (The Fog) is in it. Lucky for her, she only has very limited screen time. The killer looks like Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead) and isn't scary. Neither is this film, just a waste of time. The entire cast must have voted if you look at the current rating of an 8 (!!??).<br><br>I Liked 'Bereavement\" which is supposed to be the second Malevolence but this is just awful. Skip it, even if you're a devoted horror fan.","user":"homecoming8","rank":[21,28]},{"title":"Big disappointment","rating":2,"date":"13 October 2018","review":"Bad budget, home made camera, bad acting, bad execution and terrible ending. The film had a good idea and i been waiting for this film for years. I enoyed the last two. I wanted to see Martin reunite with his mom. I was unsure why Martin's mom didn't go with the agent at the end to confront Martin. I would have had the mom knock out the agent and the film ends with her protecting her long lost son. I expected more. I thought Mena was ending this series. Looks to be another sequel. The actor who plays Martin looks like a young Norman Reedus.","user":"jokeritt","rank":[20,31]},{"title":"I'm a campy horror movie fan, but...","rating":2,"date":"28 October 2018","review":"Bad, just bad.
