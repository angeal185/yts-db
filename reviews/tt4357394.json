[{"title":"I really enjoyed it!","rating":8,"date":"4 July 2018","review":"I don't agree with the negative reviews. Strong lead, quirky plot, good visuals, interesting scenario, exciting tension. It was similar to other films within the AI genre, but different enough to be unpredictable. I'd definitely recommend it. Watch it thinking it is going to be bad, and I think you'll really enjoy it!","user":"felixjackson","rank":[91,119]},{"title":"Why the hate? i really enjoyed this","rating":8,"date":"30 June 2018","review":"I thought Tau was a pretty cool film and i dont really understand some of the bad reviews. The story and acting were good. It wasnt full of action though so if your looking for action its not a film for you, but i was hooked dieing to know what was going to happen. Not bad for a netflix film and maika monroe was awesome too!","user":"sunzzmike","rank":[222,305]},{"title":"I only review when needed.","rating":10,"date":"30 June 2018","review":"So, TAU popped up as the new netflix movie this month! I read the short plotline and was intrigued. But just to be sure I came in here to take a peek at other reviews. On the front page was a review that gave the movie 2/10, clearly someone not happy with TAU. So I forgot about the movie for about two hours, «dont need a bad booooooring movie in my life right now»<br><br>But TAU wouldn't let go. So I came back in here to see if anyone actually liked the movie, loandbehold someone did! <br><br>Just finished 10 minutes ago, and for me this is a true sci-fi GEM. Maybe my interest in AI colors my liking of the movie, but I really enjoyed it! Okay, the first 30 minutes or so feels like SAW and maybe CUBE, but then the magic begins. <br><br>So, if you are like me coming in here to check reviews before deciding to click PLAY, just ffs ducking do it.","user":"ErikSziraki","rank":[262,376]}]
