[{"title":"very inspiring documentary for any wrestling fan or just anyone with a crazy dream they have been following since childhood","rating":9,"date":"17 April 2012","review":"I'm surprised nobody else has reviewed this yet. I have been a wrestling fan since the late 90's growing up in the golden \"Attitude Era\" of wrestling so I very fondly recall most of the events they talk about in this documentary. Edge is one of those wrestlers that weather you loved him or hated him he was great at what he did both as a tag team and single wrestler a face and a heel.<br><br>I found this documentary quite inspiring. To see someone who clearly has loved wrestling since a very young child and to his dream become a reality and go far beyond what he even dreamt blew my mind. Especially the fact he did it along side his best friend since childhood Christian.<br><br>This movie comes very very highly recommended from a long time fan of wrestling. Adam Copeland seems like one of the nicest celebrities you could ever meet. I can see now why all the wrestlers they interview have so much respect and admiration for him. I can definitely say I thought I knew Edge but turns out I didn't know Jack","user":"ransomsks","rank":[2,2]}]
