Now I really didn't think too much while watching this. This is supposed to be fun. And for the budget they had, this is pretty decent. Suspense is high, effects are pretty good (again always considering the budget restrains), script seems decent and acting is ok too.<br><br>If you fancy this kind of movies, you will have fun. It's a bit of a throwback to a time when the 80s ruled, when you had stock characters, puns around almost every corner and many other things. Nothing special overall, but a fun little movie that will work for some more than for others","user":"kosmasp","rank":[24,29]},{"title":"Like a student film","rating":5,"date":"10 April 2019","review":"So much potential. I love the idea but it was not executed well. I think it needed a more experienced director / producer team. I do think there's potential with these guys though.","user":"GeniusJessie","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"low budget","rating":5,"date":"9 April 2019","review":"Low budget.\nso-so acting.\nso-so picture.\nnot recommended.\nvery fast forward ...","user":"surfisfun","rank":[11,18]}]
