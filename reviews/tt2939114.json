Dives into the pot business with twists, turns that keeps you engaged from beginning to the end. Superb acting. Well written and directed.","user":"satoriman","rank":[1,8]},{"title":"Gritty and Real","rating":10,"date":"17 February 2018","review":"First saw this film at the Portland Film Festival and then rented it to watch with my family and friends. We enjoy independent films with realistic characters and storylines. Dark Harvest stays true to form as pre-legalization marijuana thriller.\nEnough twists and turns in the plot to keep it interesting and the cinematography adds an uneasiness to the backdrop of the characters' predicaments.\nGreat acting from the writer/director, anti-hero James Hudson, Cheech Martin, A.C. Peterson and Tygh Runyan.\nInteresting note about Cheech (my parents talked of his comedic-weed-character film days with Chong) -- in this film he plays it serious as a successful dealer who wants to become a legal grower.","user":"ColleenFarris","rank":[1,9]}]
