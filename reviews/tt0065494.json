[{"title":"After Godard takes film to zero...","rating":12,"date":"12 October 1999","review":"After taking film to \"zero\" with -Le Gai Savoir-, Godard and the Dziga Vertov Group put out several Maoist/Marxist films, including this one.  The main idea of British Sounds is exactly the soundtrack; the images are primarily still, with minimal camera movement:  mostly tracks and pans.<br><br>British Sounds is didactic and academic, but not without artistic merit, particularly the use of red and the jump-cutting fists that punch through the British flag repeatedly.  The film has six parts, including the famous ten-minute track through an auto assembly line and a four-minute shot of a woman's nude torso; it is also filled with speech, whether it's a text from Engels read aloud or a newscaster talking about the necessities of burning women and children.  A real agit-prop film, but, as Godard said about the later -Vladimir and Rosa-, also \"a time piece.\"","user":"patrick-97","rank":[34,35]}]
