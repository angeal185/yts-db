Not all that predictable. In fact my husband and I made a bet over something we thought would take place. Now he owes me a back massage. *wink","user":"D-nise","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"A predictable romance","rating":6,"date":"11 August 2017","review":"This movie isn't anything to do with that Love series set in the Wild West with Christian themes. Instead this is about a law school graduate who inherits a ranch she has not seen before. She goes back and falls in love with the place and the foreman who has a bit of a troubled past. Michaela MacManus is quite beautiful as the lead. Diego Morada who has played Jesus in the recent Roma Downey biblical movies plays the foreman. There is a predictable romance. Lindsay Wagner of Bionic Woman plays the foreman's adoptive mother. The countryside looks bucolic. Some light drama involving a bad man from the guys past and some Romeo &amp; Juliet style history regarding her family ensues.<br><br>An okay watch.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[8,10]}]
