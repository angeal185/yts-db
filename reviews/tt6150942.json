[{"title":"Honest and heartfelt","rating":9,"date":"12 February 2018","review":"Becks is the most authentic romantic drama to come around in some time. It tells the story of a musician, played by Lena Hall, who moves home to the midwest after a breakup. Love is the center role in this film, portrayed as realistically as ever. The performances are fantastic all-around, with Lena Hall in a star-making role, fitting in several musical performances that are to die for. This film is a truthful realization of the connections we form and the bonds we break, and I would highly recommend this film to those who appreciate an honest and heartfelt story of love.","user":"davepalante","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Beautiful","rating":10,"date":"13 June 2018","review":"A film with a huge heart. I cried several times ... reinvention is never easy, and anyone can relate to the things these characters struggle with as they reevaluate their lives and experience their authentic selves for the first time.","user":"acompton-58309","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Inspiring movie","rating":8,"date":"20 February 2018","review":"As a lover of cinema, I watch any film I can. I often find them all excellent concerning what I absorb and learn from the people responsible for making them, but the movies that move the floor for me are the best and make the experience of watching stories one of the most beautiful and positive in life. Becks is one of those films, an incredible true story about a young musician struggling with heartbreak and being a gay. Overall, a relatable story for all of those going through rough paths, artists, musicians, and people living life to the fullest. The cast is a fantastic power force in the story, led by the talented Lena Hall and Mena Suvari from one of my favorite films ever, American Beauty. Becks is a must watch if you are into indie films with a fantastic script and performances that will leave you breathless throughout the whole movie. Recommended if you want to be inspired!\nIt's hard to find a film nowadays that stays in your mind for weeks after you watch it. Becks is one of those movies. The story, the fantastic true story about a young musician who deals with heartbreak and abandoning her career as a response to this unfortunate event. I think most of you who have a dream and a purpose in life will find this movie inspiring, relatable, and worth your time!","user":"alexthesundancekid","rank":[4,5]}]
