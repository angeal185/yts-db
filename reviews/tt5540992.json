Our government is making so many mistakes, trying effortlessly to justify them by social media, TV channels or any kind of press release that they have direct interest to influence peoples opinions. I was touched at the end of the movie when they presented the actual facts.<br><br>I was delighted by the actors performances. I kindly recommend you to watch this masterpiece, hoping you'll understand what real journalism is all about: searching and publishing the truth!","user":"sabinblaj","rank":[74,96]},{"title":"Very worthwhile story - execution could have been better","rating":7,"date":"18 September 2018","review":"Despite the A list cast and very worthy subject matter this movie about the WMD deception feels a little amateurish. There are pros and cons of the way the issues are stated clearly in more or less in sequence. The pros are you get it. The points aren't lost or mumbled so as to be missed. And there is not jigsaw puzzle narrative. That is good. Unlike Spotlight which was a bit confusing. The cons are it feels like a lecture / documentary. \nThe best point is it puts together and illuminates the sequence of events and the WMD deception from it's early stages to the invasion and the consequences. The most eye opening thing is that these journalists were on to the deception from such an early stage and the main stream press refused to let the public know.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[33,42]},{"title":"Movie is well done, although we all knew this back then.","rating":10,"date":"15 August 2018","review":"We all knew we were being fed a load of bull when the decision was made to pad the pockets of war profiteers in Iraq.
