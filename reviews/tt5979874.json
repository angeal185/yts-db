[{"title":"Weird fractured story, like they couldn't decide what to add and what to remove","rating":6,"date":"20 January 2018","review":"The animation was fine, the Japanisms in full force. Protect, regain your honor and dignity, die in the name of God or against one, etc, but what annoyed the hell out of me was the sloppiness of the script. One moment an old guy says they have traveled for 20 years and can't take the trip back, the other the ship is taking a one minute jump and it's back where it started. One moment a guy is basically court marshaled, and people are telling him he's insane and asks for too much, the other he is commanding landing forces. There is an alien species that landed on Earth right before Godzilla messed everything up which has no real purpose. There is a scene where they land back on Earth and there is a guy in the leaves, and that's the only scene where we see any people on the planet. There is a conspiracy theory that gets announced, then never mentioned again. <br><br>And the characters. They have names and they do things, but you don't know why. There is no character development at all. Who is the shy girl? Why are people referring to her like I should know her. Is this an episode of something? No, it's a part of a trilogy, but it's the first part!<br><br>It's just... weird. I can't imagine going through the effort of drawing all of this on the basis of a stupid script. Who does that? I can only consider this a failure, because it is clearly not what was intended to be.","user":"siderite","rank":[33,42]},{"title":"This could had gone better","rating":3,"date":"19 January 2018","review":"I was excited for the release of this film hitting Netflix and the introduction of Godzilla into Anime culture, as I can imagine many of you were, but sadly, I was disappointed. Okay first thing first, as many have pointed out in other reviews, the story/writing is less than desirable. For instance, the plot hole that others have pointed out, but also the findings of Godzilla's weaknesses/tactics is just plain random. I feel the writers just put that in to move the story forward without caring how one person(our MC), without the aid of research/facts, just wrote random things and everyone blindly follows it. I mean seriously this is the same guy that just threatened to destroy the human race in the very beginning and somehow he turns out to be the hero of everybody. \nThe characters are bland, generic, and uninteresting. Our MC here is set to mindless revenge that it consumes him throughout the entire film. Seriously, every line the MC will say with include \"Kill Godzilla\" in some way or another. From the very beginning I found him annoying and it just makes you cheer for Godzilla to kill his a**. The other characters aren't much better, they feel like extra/filling characters instead of being supportive characters. I guess when you have a film dedicated to revenge that everything else just becomes extra then focusing on anything else is unnecessary. As many have pointed out, this movie is heavily dialogue driven with very little Godzilla show time until the very end. That wouldn't have been a problem since it would set everything up for the second film, but regretfully the entire dialogue is filled with futuristic equipment talk that should had been short and should had actually focus on a real plot, God preaching from a character that has no presence whatsoever, and REVENGE! REVENGE!! from the MC. Overall, this could had been better with a more impactful story and characters that don't blend into the background.","user":"sanbene","rank":[26,36]},{"title":"A very underwhelming entry.","rating":5,"date":"18 January 2018","review":"I know that this is the first entry in a series, but the entire thing seemed dull and underwhelming. The story seemed so rush to get to the end that none of the characters were developed enough for you to care about them. The main character Haruo was very one-note, displaying anger but nothing else. No attempt was made to flesh him out or give him any more depth than that. The plot about his parents being killed as the reason for him wanting revenge against Godzilla was nothing new. The angry human who wants to avenge a fallen loved one has been done in other kaiju films before (Godzilla x Megaguirus, Gamera 3), but those previous films conveyed it much better; here it seemed like a half hearted after thought. For having a title Planet of the Monsters, there were hardly any monsters, Godzilla doesn't show up until the end. Everything up until the climactic battle seems like run of the mill checkmarks just to get to that point. For it being an animated film, they had so much potential to be creative without the constraints that a live action film would pose, how they came up with such a wooden, lifeless story is kind of a shock. If their goal is to make a series then they should've put more time and energy into making the first entry more entertaining, as it stands, when it's over you're left not really caring enough to want to see any more of the story.","user":"inkdcub","rank":[36,53]}]
