[{"title":"Amazing directorial debut from Ryan Gosling, but not for everyone.","rating":8,"date":"8 April 2015","review":"Most famous actors rely heavily on the production team during their directorial debuts and aren't very involved in the directing process. Last year, Angelina Jolie truly proved this with her movie Unbroken (actually her second film as a director though). A high budget WW2 film that Jolie clearly didn't put much effort into. It feels like the whole idea was just given to her when she called her agent and stated that she would like to direct a new movie. It is also not uncommon to see actors casting themselves in their directorial debuts, such as Zach Braff in Garden State. Lost River, is the weirdest directorial debut you'll ever see from an actor.<br><br>I've always liked Ryan Gosling. He picks his movies carefully and works great with \"different\" directors like Nicolas Winding Refn and Derek Cianfrance. Lost River is probably the strangest film in recent years. It is hard to explain what it is about so I'm not going to talk about that in this review.<br><br>The movie is very similar to most David Lynch films, especially Mulholland Drive. Therefore, one of the best things about Lost River is actually the cinematography, it helps to create the mysterious experience. I'm a very big fan of thrillers which don't explain everything to the viewer, but I know most people aren't. And that's why many will dislike this movie for what it is. With that being said, if you hate to re-watch films and want simple story lines, Lost River is not what you should be watching.<br><br>I really appreciate all the effort Ryan Gosling has put into this movie. It is risky to make a film like Lost River these days, and I'm glad Gosling was willing to take that risk to show his trademark. It is notable that he actually made the movie himself and didn't rely on the producers. Fans of David Lynch, Nicolas Winding Refn and David Cronenberg will surely have a good time with Lost River. I'm looking forward to Gosling's next feature, and can't wait to re-watch this film.","user":"LouisGur","rank":[168,219]},{"title":"Each scene is like a painting","rating":10,"date":"20 June 2015","review":"I really wasn't sure about this to start with, but I rented it, so I stuck with it to get my Â£3.99 worth. I am so glad I did. The pace is slow to begin with, and it's hard to like any of the characters in the beginning. But as it unfolds you become intrigued by the relationships the characters have, and you see a part of yourself in each of them, even if their plight is so different from ones own. The thing I found so amazing about it was that every single shot was so well considered- the composition and colour. It is reminiscent of David Lynch in places, showing the darkness of human nature in such a beautifully shot way. It really was like a moving painting. This film should not be compared to other films of this genre. The film making was very mature and considered, and I truly view this as a work of art. I liked how in parts, the acting was very raw, like watching a documentary rather than a 'movie'. And I am not sure what it has left me with- Sometimes when I watch a film, I want to know more about the characters and what becomes of them when the credits roll. I didn't want to know more. I was content with having seen the journey they made and where we left them. I was very cynical, 'a Hollywood star steps behind the camera' - we have heard it before. But if this was his debut film as a director, then I think there are amazing things to follow and he should stay behind the camera.","user":"emilyart","rank":[37,46]},{"title":"Surprisingly good","rating":7,"date":"22 November 2015","review":"Beware, this movie is quite dark and disturbing. It has a certain Terry Gilliam feel about it, although it goes deeper and touches the dark bottom of your soul. It is beautifully shot, has a constant subtle tension and very good music. Although the story is rather predictable it reminded me of the greatest epic tales of mankind.<br><br>Very rich and creative debut. Good actors and superb camera work, settings and effects.<br><br>The movie feels like a true nightmare sometimes, don't be fooled, though - it is not a classical horror movie or thriller. It is more like a dark dream put onto celluloid. You see lots of blood and some violence, still it will not work for typical fans of guts and gore movies.<br><br>Real cinema.","user":"derbo73","rank":[28,34]}]
