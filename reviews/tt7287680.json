[{"title":"Weep for the art of cinema","rating":1,"date":"18 July 2019","review":"This \"thing\" is such a sorry crapfest. While watching it I reflected upon all the sins I ever committed and reasoned that this movie was God's punishment for them. My seat was my own personal hell.<br><br>Repent. The end is near.","user":"stevenacheson","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"A world where deviants and humans can live together","rating":1,"date":"18 July 2019","review":"After blowing the budget on big names like Eric Roberts, Mindy Robinson, and Bill Oberst Jr. they had little left for set design so opted for plastic sheeting and cardboard, most likely stolen from folks who live in the streets. Make-up consisted of a medium point sharpie found in a waste can. Deviants, which are low powered X-men, are considered the bad guys in a world run by Dominion, Eric Roberts the bad guy. The whole film is deviants vs. Eric Robert's deviants. It included laughable acting, dry dialogue, and ridiculous choreography. Cool long sleeve red coat. Great for desert wear.<br><br>Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"A boring film that made me stopped watching.","rating":1,"date":"29 August 2019","review":"The Immortal Wars: Resurgence is one of the films which I stopped watching in the middle. The film is so nonsense and the contents are always the same. It's all about the seek for revenge and take down the cooperation thing. And also the characters are like XMen's.<br><br>What I don't like the most is the actress in the leading role. The way she does fighting scenes is so unbearable. I think that's the main reason why I stopped watching this film. If they chose the other actress, the film might be better.<br><br>So, to say it in one word, it's a total boring film for me. Watching it was a huge waste of time. It was a great decision for me to stop watching.","user":"silvermistvio","rank":[6,9]}]
