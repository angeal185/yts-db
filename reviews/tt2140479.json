[{"title":"Excellent","rating":10,"date":"25 February 2017","review":"This is a wonderful movie. A lot more of an action flick than title suggests. Was a pleasant surprise as plot unfolded. Ben Affleck is perfect for this part. Well written script and good acting by all. Nice use of flashbacks for character development. Many twists and turns and a bit of a surprise ending. Watch it! You won't be disappointed.","user":"baburgener-13160","rank":[118,136]},{"title":"John Wick meets Good Will Hunting","rating":8,"date":"13 October 2016","review":"It's as if John Wick is the savant janitor from Good Will Hunting, and surprisingly, it worked.<br><br>What should you expect? It has flashes of John Wick action, but it most certainly isn't an all out action movie, however, it also isn't primarily a drama focusing on his autistic/accounting side of things; I felt they did a really good job of combining both elements into a movie that swings back and forth between the two.<br><br>I thought the acting was great all around; I found the plot solid and enjoyable. <br><br>Here is the bottom line: Yes, this movie is worth your money to see in the theater. <br><br>p.s. I'll be the first to admit I have no idea how autism really affects people and how accurate it is or is not portrayed in this movie; I saw this movie as nothing more than what it is: a fictional story to entertain.","user":"allstarrunner","rank":[361,435]},{"title":"Surprisingly good.","rating":7,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"Wow.......<br><br>It is always pleasant to go into a movie with no expectations, and this one delivered in spades.<br><br>Any story starts with... well a great story, and this is it, although somewhat predictable it's more a comforting predictable, a good guy wins story with enough great twists in it to keep the interest.<br><br>The cast here lifts the game, who knew Affleck had this in him, and supported by the ever sweet Kendrick (all be it with a kick-ass moment), and throw in favorites like Simmons (Terminator Genisys) and Addai-Robinson (Shooter), all playing their respective parts well.<br><br>The scene with Affleck's and Kendrick's characters having lunch showed great subtly in writing, directing and acting. A lot of dry and subtle humor throughout.<br><br>No overdone CGI either, just good clean action, regularly punctuating the plot, with the clean cinematography only adding to clinical nature of our lead character.<br><br>For the run-of-the-mill action flick, you shouldn't pass this one up.","user":"cazmor","rank":[30,33]}]
