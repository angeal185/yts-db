[{"title":"6ft man vs 5ft wooden fence. Fence wins.","rating":1,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"22 minutes in this happens and it sets the tone perfectly. Please allow me to elaborate, a 6ft man has the heart-stopping moment of a stuggle when climbing over a feeble, wooden fence that he can look over without standing on his tippy-toes. I actually caught myself waving my hand at the screen and ranting \"What are you doing\"?! And that's the LEAST ridiculous things that happens in this film.<br><br>Now, I'm not going to complain about the rest of the story or the acting or the blah blah blah.<br><br>I'm just saying that it's pretty naff and from now on, I need to find a hobby for my Friday evenings as films like this make me question my very existence.","user":"donttouchmeprimate","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"You don't play by our rules","rating":4,"date":"5 September 2018","review":"A couple and a third wheel play a game called \"Odds are\" which is like \"Truth or Dare\" without the \"Truth\" part. After a day of dares, they top off the evening with one final dare...knock on a stranger's door and get invited in. Kelly (Alejandra Morin) does this and does not return. It appears she is held captive against her will as the film moves into a home break-in film where the homeowner (Ron Eldard) is the bad guy. And then the twist and we are told this was based on actual events so we might like it. <br><br>Other than Kelly, the characters were rather boring. Nice twist, but not worth sitting through the entire film. <br><br>No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Hideous","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"This has to be the most stupid movie I've ever seen. I was really looking forward to watching this and was HIGHLY disappointed!!!! I hope that the people these events actually happened to had much better sense than the characters.. (COMMON SENSE) ..... Geesh, what a let down","user":"brownmalisha","rank":[10,13]}]
