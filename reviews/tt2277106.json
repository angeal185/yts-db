[{"title":"Wow. Pause. Breath.","rating":9,"date":"1 September 2015","review":"Wow. Pause. Breath. Exhale gratitude. Inhale inspiration,<br><br>I watch loads, movies or docs, trying never to dip below 7.0 IMDb rating, plus a review that connects with me. I fail sometimes. But not with this. <br><br>This documentary blew me away. <br><br>This documentary elegantly and in eloquent honesty tells two intertwined stories of how humanity is saved, as a whole and also as one single mother-son relationship, both just in time, with not a minute to spare.<br><br>Well done! <br><br>Oh, and thanks Stanislav, by the way!!","user":"SaintNicolas","rank":[23,27]},{"title":"I have never seen anything like this before. Combining narrative and documentary filmmaking for a true and incredible powerful film!","rating":10,"date":"13 November 2014","review":"1983. The world holds its breath as the two superpowers United States and Russia are arming themselves against each other with thousands of nuclear missiles. <br><br>On September 26, Russian radars intercept five nuclear missiles on their way to Russia. Stanislav Petrov is commander-in-chief. The decision that would start World War III rests on his shoulders. Should Russia fire nuclear missiles at the United States in defense? <br><br>Today, the world still exists, but Petrov himself is a ruined man. A man who, in his own words, is not a hero and who went against all protocol, relying on his own instinct instead of the computers. <br><br>'The Man Who Saved the World' is a true pearl. Simply heartbreaking. An epic Cold War thriller that sends shivers down your spine, while also being an extremely gripping story about a man who actually saved the world, but lost his job, his wife and his dignity. A truly wonderful and very fascinating film. I have never seen anything like this before. It combines narrative and documentary filmmaking for a true and incredible powerful film!","user":"pa-78","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"Thank you Stansilav","rating":10,"date":"5 August 2015","review":"I had to watch almost to the end of the film before I really understood that I had been watching the actual private moments of a man who saved my life. Thank you Stansilav for saving me, for being afraid for me and for all of us, and for saving our beautiful Earth, and saving everyone I love, and everyone I will ever love, and everyone they will ever love, and everyone they will ever love.... Thank you to all of people who made this film for telling this story in the way you did. I don't have a single criticism about the film itself. It's so amazing to watch Stansilav on his journey to America (who is an amazing person and doesn't even know it), and to watch the recreations of that night. You've made a timeless classic. And Stanislav, especially I thank your mother for somehow raising you to be so incredibly stubborn in your self-righteousness! My love to you both. The lord works in mysterious ways.","user":"peoplepower-588-227356","rank":[28,35]}]
