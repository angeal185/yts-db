[{"title":"The only time I smiled was when I got up to leave","rating":1,"date":"22 May 2017","review":"Animations have evolved into highly entertaining movies for both kids and adults. This movie was the opposite of that. I'm still trying to figure out how this made it to the big screen. The lack of dialogue made it painful to watch all the while ripping off ideas from great movies such as Shawshank Redemption and The Castle. <br><br>The only time I smiled was when I got up to leave.","user":"jeffersonadams01-205-770572","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Worst 2016 animation","rating":1,"date":"23 July 2017","review":"There are no spoilers here as this cartoon doesn't really have a plot. This is a 2016 animation but I swear they have used a 3d game engine from the early 2000's to make this, I actually feel embarrassed for the makers of this. I have seen games with better in play graphics than this rubbish. Best to avoid this.","user":"tonyflintjackson","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Puppy prison...","rating":6,"date":"14 May 2017","review":"When I sat down to watch \"Ozzy\" with the family, I was expecting this to be a family-oriented and suitable animated movie, however it turned out that it had some fairly more mature storyline to it, because it dealt with some topics that seemed a bit too heavy and appalling for a young audience whom might not fully understand the concept of it.<br><br>While it was intended for a more grown-up audience, it turned out that the storyline in \"Ozzy\" actually was quite good, and it was entertaining. You just have to get past that this is not really an animated movie intended for the youngest of audiences.<br><br>The animation in \"Ozzy\" was good, and it did have a good feel to it. A good amount of variation in the characters, and the characters did have depth and different personalities.<br><br>An animated movie needs a good ensemble of voice actors and actresses to it, and the ones in \"Ozzy\" were doing fair jobs with their given roles. Now, I can't really say that they had some outstanding names on the cast list. And while the English dubbed version had Will Sasso and Rob Schneider on the list, they didn't really stand out from the other talents. In fact, I didn't even recognize Rob Schneider's voice as being his.<br><br>The dialogue in \"Ozzy\" was actually quite good, but again, do keep in mind that this is for an audience that is not the youngest of viewers.<br><br>All in all, \"Ozzy\" was an entertaining animated movie, although it hardly had the potential to be a classic. And I actually doubt that I will be returning to watch it a second time around, as it just didn't have that quality to it.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[2,2]}]
