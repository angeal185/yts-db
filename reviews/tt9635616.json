[{"title":"Not a bad movie. Not great either","rating":5,"date":"24 November 2019","review":"Not a bad movie. Not great either. As a climber myself I took into consideration that in those days the gear was nowhere near as advanced and strong as the gear these days. Though on a couple of thigs I was laughing as the way the gear failure was portrayed was laughable. A good excuse for a bit of Kung Fu type gymnastics and action to be thrown in. The acting was wooden and we didn't really care about any particular character because they all blended into a mess of \"Try your best to keep up\". I think I fell asleep for 20 minutes but didn't miss anything when I rewound it. I give it a 5 because the action scenes were well done (though unbelievable). If it was a Hollywood film I'd give it 3 or 4.","user":"darrengabbe","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Disappointing movie","rating":1,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"You wasted 1 hour of screen time talking about love and romance, I never felt any kind of connection of the characters because there was no build up. So when they died, I felt nothing, even the love scenes were so cringy to watch. Jackie Chan was also a rip off, putting him in the movie trailer, but he only appeared less than 3 minutes is a cheap con to make people go watch it. I'd recommend watching Everest 2015 instead... now that's a realistic movie done well.","user":"q-05229","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Absolutely Boring and silly","rating":1,"date":"4 January 2020","review":"Over 2 Hours of my life that I will not get back, waste of my movie ticket money and fuel to get there!!!.<br><br>By far the most boring movie on Earth that I have ever watched. Did they really have to keep going up and down the mountain so many times and killing so many innocent lives in the process... Cheaply made.\nI booked this movie because I saw Jackie Chans name on it and he only appears there for 2 minutes at the end...he should really think about his reputation before putting his name onto a silly movie like this.<br><br>Really really disappointed!!!","user":"natalienaidoo-90186","rank":[5,7]}]
