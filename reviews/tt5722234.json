[{"title":"Inspiring!!!!!!!","rating":9,"date":"7 September 2016","review":"Gosh our media are out of whack. Having read some of the critics reviews on Chasing Great, I went along expecting to see an doco of Richie's life without any great insights into his character. Luckily for me they were so wrong!! The reviews stating that Richie does not open up implies to me that either they really just don't get it; or lack the emotional intelligence to recognise the messages in this doco. Or they are just miserable beggars with nothing good to say about anything that's not quirky dark art house. Lucky for us, the NZ public seems to have a higher level of EQ than the average reviewer, and have fed this back via their social media channels which is overwhelmingly positive.<br><br>There has even been anecdotal evidence of the way this doco has inspired the young folk of New Zealand. This week MAGs first fifteen won the National Championship. MAGS.Interestingly, they had just taken a team trip to the doco. \" t was revealed, they (sic) had viewed the Chasing Great movie as a team on the Saturday and drew some inspiration from that Richie McCaw biopic. <br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this journey. I laughed and cried (even though Richie didn't). I felt inspired by his open and driven mindset to set goals of my own. I relived moments in sporting history - with sweaty hands over my eyes, my brain tricking me into believing that I didn't know the outcome. When the final World Cup was won and Richie's childhood haka played under this scene, it was a moment of pure magic for me, connecting this legend to the person he had become. This sent shivers down my spine.<br><br>If I could change one thing - if time had allowed I would have loved to have seen more of the mental side of Richie's preparation, with Ceri Evans. Overall, going again.......and probably again........and will add the DVD to the Santa list","user":"nicoleb-13416","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"A documentary for Richie McCaw fans and people seeking for a decent documentary","rating":6,"date":"3 September 2016","review":"UPDATE: This review is not meant to change opinions, and it is okay if you like the movie. I am not trying to offend people who like this film. If you have already watched the film, and enjoyed it, please ignore this review, as I am not trying to anger anybody. Thank you.<br><br>If you're a huge fan of the All Blacks, or you're a fan of Richie, you'll love this documentary to bits. The documentary is very inspiring, and tells us that you can be anything, even if you are just a small town country kid who lives in New Zealand. That is a good message to put out. However, as I'm not a Richie fan, or a rugby fan, I didn't seem to enjoy this documentary, so I was walking into the cinema with low expectations. So, I didn't exactly enjoy this because I wasn't a fan of Richie McCaw, nor was I a fan of documentaries. However, if you like documentaries and New Zealand Rugby, then this is perfect for you. You'll like this film if you know what you are getting into. If it looks like a good documentary, you'll like it. If it looks terrible, you won't. Simple as that. It's all really a matter of opinion, and I hope not to anger anybody that enjoys the movie. Hopefully you enjoy the movie more than I do.<br><br>Overall, my personal opinion is 5.9/10, however, I'd give it a 8.4/10. This review is not meant to be offensive, so I'm very sorry if I upset your day. It's perfectly fine if you like this movie.","user":"nzswanny","rank":[3,31]}]
