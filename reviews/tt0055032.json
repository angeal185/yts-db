[{"title":"art isn't about \"identification\"","rating":10,"date":"4 March 2005","review":"Why do so many people need to \"get into the characters\" \"care about the characters\" \"identify with the characters\", to enjoy or appreciate a great film? I think it's a type of selfishness, as shallow as the urge to reject an outcome one doesn't like. Examples: \"I know it's good; but the ending was too down\" (Lolita), or a woman I once heard criticize Unbearable Lightness of Being because one of the main characters is a womanizer who doesn't repent or have justice rendered to him. Ironically, in Jules and Jim, we see a woman who is a \"manizer\" whom some viewers are appalled or put off by). <br><br>Jules and Jim features three characters whose unrealism is beyond question - Truffaut himself might comment on how Catherine fascinated the other two, but I doubt very much he would claim any of the three to be \"realistic\". I think the whole thing is a fable, and therefore the three are more like archetypes. The beauty isn't really the story, but HOW the story unfolds, and, most importantly how it is told VISUALLY: the breeziness interrupted by dramatic outbursts (flames, jumping into the river, death by drowning), the exploration of love as a fleeing of tediousness and predictability, the hinting (yes there is a type of love between Jules and Jim, though not a homo erotic one) that friendship is always deeper than romantic love, the beautiful flowing and editing of sequences, for example: where all three go bicycling in the country. <br><br>The duty of film is to tell a story in moving images, to take advantage of the things that specifically make cinema different from drama or literature - moving the spectator about in space and time, which cannot be done in any other art form in quite the same way. But nothing about this movie is conventional, and people looking for \"resolution\", or a someone getting their comeuppances, or even a character learning more about himself must look elsewhere for gratification.","user":"willtato","rank":[108,148]},{"title":"No -- still not getting it.","rating":5,"date":"5 August 2002","review":"Whenever a commentator declares outright that a film is a complete waste of time and that nobody, BUT NOBODY, should ever watch it, I tend to peg that commentator as an opinionated ass. So I would never say that about a well-respected film like \"Jules and Jim.\" But quite honestly, I can't warm up to it. I've watched it on more than one occasion over the years, and it never fails to put me to sleep at both ends of my anatomy. I've just viewed a DVD edition in which a film scholar clearly explains his views on the fascination of \"Jules and Jim.\" But I still couldn't see why the relationship of these three tedious characters, discussed and analyzed in all its very tedious minutiae by those same characters and an off-screen narrator (also tedious), should interest me. It's certainly beloved by academic types (maybe for those very same characteristics?), and film critics eat it up like it has gravy on it. Like another commentator, I'm a bit puzzled by all the comments about its lyrical, lighthearted and idyllic qualities. I'm left with the impression of a rather dry, academic dissertation on the complexities of male-female relationships ca. 1961 (the 1910 setting seems to me immaterial to the script).<br><br>I can't help feeling that I'm missing something, and I'm not averse to French films, but they're usually older, pre-new-wave films, for example \"Forbidden Games,\" \"French Can-Can,\" or Pagnol's \"Fanny\" trilogy. I take it that the sentimentality of such films is one of the things new wave directors reacted against. If so, I can't jump on their bandwagon, try as I might. I've enjoyed some of Truffaut's work, but not this, I'm afraid.<br><br>To those who love and appreciate \"Jules and Jim\" -- have pleasure of it. I envy you for that, and maybe I'll try it again in a few years.","user":"Bobs-9","rank":[209,320]},{"title":"A breathless film about time.","rating":10,"date":"12 July 2001","review":"Time and revisionist critics have tried to tarnish the gleam of Truffaut's final masterpiece - citing its apparent misogyny and apoliticism; but for some of us, 'Jules et Jim' is the unforgettable film that opened the gates to both European film, and the great masters of American cinema like Hitchcock, Hawks and Ray.  <br><br>'Jules et Jim' is, along with 'Citizen Kane', THE vindication of the pleasures of cinematic form: the first half especially, in its rush of narrative registers and technical exuberance, is unparalleled in modern film.  This isn't mere trickery - the use of paintings, books, plays, dreams, conversations, documentary footage, etc., as well as the different ways of telling a story through film, all point to the movie's theme - how do you represent people and the world in art without destroying them?  Or is art the only to save people and life from extinction? <br><br>\nThe foregrounding of theatricality, acting, disguises, pseudonyms, games, works-within-the-work, all point to the high modernism in which the film is set, when the old certainties about identity and place were being destroyed by the Great War.  In fact the film could be considered Cubist in the way it uses film form to splice up and rearrange images, space, characters, viewpoints.  <br><br>Truffaut's film is a beautiful elegy about time: the historical time heading towards destruction in the shape of the Nazis, and the circular time of love, obsession and art.  These times struggle in the film's structure, history zipping past years in the framing, Parisian sections, and days stretching out interminably in the central rural rondelay. <br><br>\nFar from being misogynistic, the film places Catherine's speech about 'grains of sand' at its philosophical heart.  AND she's played by Jeanne Moreau, the most honest and human of all great actresses.","user":"the red duchess","rank":[81,120]}]
