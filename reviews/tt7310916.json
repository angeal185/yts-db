[{"title":"History for real","rating":10,"date":"5 November 2018","review":"I'm a white southern boy who witnessed firsthand the genius of John Leguizamo at Raleigh's Goodnight's comedy club. He told us that night he was testing the material for this special. What a truly funny and eye opening quasi lecture he presented. Incredibly entertaining, funny, and informative. Props to Leguizamo on another amazing performance. I highly recommend for anyone, especially some of the more ignorant white MAGA supporters out there (you know who you are)!","user":"barob-51973","rank":[48,60]},{"title":"A must-see","rating":9,"date":"6 November 2018","review":"Make no mistake, this is a class. It really is Latin History for Morons, and I was glad to be educated.\nJohn Leguizamo's dancemoves, impressions and speeches, spiced with the story of his family, really moved me, in between laughs.<br><br>I had to google stuff, I added books to my goodreads-list after this, a must-see and an exceptional show.","user":"mariellealien","rank":[41,51]},{"title":"Awesome delivery!","rating":10,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"I'm not quite sure why there are all these people saying this was \"awkward\". If you want a history lesson you can watch a history show or read a book. John provides an entertaining take on the history of Latin Americans. It's a mixture of comedy and dramatic interpretation.<br><br>In contrast to your standard punchline stand-up comedian shows on Netflix, this was a welcomed break from the norm. It's a one-man play and was quite entertaining. There's no doubt that it's artistic interpretation and in it he exposes the challenges he faces as a parent and his frustration/obsession with the maligned history Latin Americans have been given.<br><br>Yes, you can read Howard Zinn's classic book, and I highly recommend it. But if you prefer dramatic interpretation, this was an entertaining approach!","user":"mr-nick-oneill","rank":[13,15]}]
