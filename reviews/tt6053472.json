[{"title":"This spooky RV doesn't care if...","rating":3,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"You were on the OC or even if you were married to Charlie Sheen, it WANTS TO KILL YOU! <br><br>I'm not going to beat around any smelly bushes here. It's bad. It's REALLY bad. But, if you watch this as a comedy with a few beers, you'll have a great time. So give that a try.","user":"donttouchmeprimate","rank":[38,42]},{"title":"Find something else to do for 95mins","rating":2,"date":"1 February 2019","review":"I can't be bothered to waste any more time on this movie so I'll keep this brief, I've watched it and that was enough. Don't let the thought of Mischa Barton and Denise Richards tempt you into wasting 95mins of your life watching this ludicrous movie. A ridiculous plot and awful acting makes it a decidedly forgettable experience. Put the kettle on and find something else to watch!","user":"drflipenstein","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Just terrible","rating":1,"date":"2 February 2019","review":"Terrible wooden acting, how the hell did Denise Richards ever get cast in anything ? She's just awful in this. Mischa Barton tries her best with a terrible script and film but nothing can save this dire excuse for a horror.","user":"bertspanish","rank":[17,19]}]
