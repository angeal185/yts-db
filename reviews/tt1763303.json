[{"title":"As good as a high school rom-com gets","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2013","review":"I really liked The First Time. I don't feel the need to summarize what the movie is about, as the other reviews and the summary does that job, but I really enjoyed this movie. The writing for this movie really stood out to me, as the conversations felt so real between characters because of subtle little things that happen in most conversations in real life. That's a credit to the actors as well, but when you see the movie, especially the first time the main characters meet, you will understand what I mean.<br><br>It's a shame this film didn't get a bigger release in theaters because Dylan O'Brien and Britt Robertson are both terrific. They make the two characters blend so well together it's hard not to root for them to wind up together. The supporting cast does a great job as well, but this movie is all about Dave and Aubrey so there wasn't a large chunk of material for any of them.<br><br>The only thing I can suggest for this movie is don't go into it expecting to make you laugh hysterically. Don't get me wrong, it's a very funny movie, but it's more of the type that makes you smile, grin, or giggle. Can't go without mentioning the soundtrack either, its phenomenal and every song goes with its moment.<br><br>Overall, I highly recommend this movie. The only way I could see someone disliking the film is if they are not into rom-coms or high school movies, but if you are then why are you even watching it in the first place?<br><br>9/10","user":"thereisnothingleft","rank":[130,146]},{"title":"Proves that teen romances can be sweet and charming","rating":7,"date":"26 March 2013","review":"\"The First Time\" is not just about having sex for the first time, but falling in love for the first time, and also just being yourself in front of the object of your affection for the first time. Aubrey (Britt Robertson) has a boyfriend (we'll get to him later) and Dave (Dylan O'Brien) is infatuated with a girl who will probably never like him for who he really is – she's just too into herself for that to ever happen.<br><br>At the beginning of the film, Aubrey and Dave meet, they're teenagers who go to different high schools, and their first night together reveals a natural attraction and an easy chemistry that allows them to just open up and talk about whatever they feel like saying. It's a fairly simple film, dialogue-heavy and follows their relationship as all teen romance films do, but there's something about it which suggests it's a genre we haven't really seen before.<br><br>\"The First Time\" isn't a comedy – it's a romantic drama. But it's not heavy and involved like a drama, it's light and funny like a comedy – but in a sweet, charming and real way. The only obvious attempt at comedy is with Aubrey's boyfriend Ronny (James Frecheville). Ronny is one or two years older, this, obviously, makes him wiser, more attuned to the ways of the world, and anybody who isn't him, or who hasn't gone to college, will just never understand the devastations that corporations cause. He likes Aubrey because she's different, she doesn't act all corporation-y.<br><br>We like Aubrey because she really isn't all that different. When she's with Dave, she's honest in a way that Dave needs. We like Dave because he convinces himself not to do something stupid, and then proceeds to do something stupid. Just like we all do. And that is why \"The First Time\" isn't as cheesy as it easily could be. It's a mature film in its depiction of teenagers; it works for adults just as well it does for its teen audience.<br><br>Writer and director Jon Kasdan (son of famous filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan) does a good job writing the main characters. The dialogue is a little unnatural at times, and some parts of the story are more drawn out than they need to be, but it's fairly easy to forgive that. The acting is surprisingly good, providing the film with the sweetness and charm that it needs. \"The First Time\" is a light romantic drama; easy to watch and enjoy, especially for fans of teen romantic comedies of any age.","user":"napierslogs","rank":[60,71]},{"title":"Hodgeman to the rescue...lucky girl ..!!","rating":9,"date":"14 April 2013","review":"Just when rom-coms got all boring and oh-so-predictable and we decided to write them off of our Sunday evenings, Jon Kasdan presented this cute,funny movie- the first time. Thank you!<br><br>Beautiful (literally) characters,witty dialogues,good background score and decent acting make this a great option for the rom-com genre fans. The movie did not leave me feeling all mushy and longing for romance...but it was definitely a feel good ride..it actually lifted my spirits :)<br><br>Try not to miss it.You will like it,if not love..but it's hard to dislike such a \"from the heart\" love story. Do watch it..it's not a waste of time..pure entertainment.","user":"pratima347","rank":[62,74]}]
