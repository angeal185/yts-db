[{"title":"Prince of persia","rating":8,"date":"15 February 2020","review":"Having never played the game I didn't know much about what the plot was about but the games were big hits and popular enough to make a live action movie so I eventually gave it a watch and was very surprised, The story is very loyal to the games from what I seen in the games, Some nice action scenes and good effects, I didn't like the choice of actors but they did ok, As far as game to movies go it's probably one of the better ones, Even if it won't stand the test of time (No pun intended) I think maybe it could of been better if it wasn't made by Disney as they like to tone films down so much that if you're over the age of 11 it's not as enjoyable, But it could of been much worse so I can't complain too much, A good family film that is easy to watch even if you haven't played any of the games.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[37,38]},{"title":"The sands have spread fairly thin and it shows... but surprisingly in a good way","rating":7,"date":"28 May 2010","review":"The common view amongst \"professional\" reviews is that the movie is average. scoring below 50% from Rotten Tomatoes, and MetaCritic, and notably a 2 out of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. The average user ranking on MC puts it at 9 out of 10.<br><br>Most reviews range anywhere from 8 out of 10, to as low as 2 or 3 out of 10.<br><br>If there's one thing critics can agree on, its that the movie is clichéd, borrowing elements from plenty of epics based in the Middle East and fantasy alike, and that it's loads of fun.<br><br>The one thing no one can agree on is whether that's good or bad.<br><br>It should be pointed out that this film is produced by the same company/studio that brought us 'Pirates of the Caribbean', and it certainly shows.<br><br>With that said, I'll lead into my thoughts on the film. The first \"Pirates\" scored on average a 7.8 - 6.4 of 10, while the sequels averaged anywhere from 4.5 to 5.3. I'd say this movie is better than the sequels while not as good as the first. <br><br>So, I'd give it roughly a 7 out of 10.<br><br>The story is fun, for what it is. Which is a rough retelling of the video game \"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time\", while incorporating elements of the following two sequels, as well as incorporating stylistic elements from the following game and the first three of the original trilogy. Thats right! Based loosely on one game, borrowing elements from SIX more. The movie is stretched too thin, and it shows.<br><br>The movie feels like your prototypical \"sword and sandal\" action flick, borrowing heavily from films like \"The Thief of Baghdad\", and stories found in \"1001 Nights\". So think 'Arabian Nights', Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, Aladdin, all mixed with some Steve Reeves 'Hercules' and Robert E. Howard 'Conan' flash.<br><br>Is it as cheesy as that sounds? YES! Is it as awesome as that sounds? YES!<br><br>But it's still well edited, well acted, well scored (Harry Gregson-Williams never fails), and overall well done enough to merit an enjoyable experience.<br><br>The ONLY complaints I can think of are few, but here they are: A bit too much CGI, not on the stunts (not much CGI there surprisingly) but on things like demonic-esque snakes (you'll see). Too much random slow-motion. The sexual-tension seemed too forced (too many of those really slow \"they're about to kiss but don't\" moments). And whereas yes, the ending is supposed to have a \"Deus-Ex-Machina\" feel to it, in the game it is much more thorough and more explained, in the movie you're just expected to roll with it.<br><br>Other than that. A fun night at the movies! Grab your over-priced candy, soda, and popcorn (or do like me and sneak snacks in) and have fun with friends, family and loved ones, recapturing the fun escapism of your childhood with an epic but cliché action movie.<br><br>Hope you enjoyed my review... And I hope you enjoy the movie too!","user":"OrinAGN","rank":[284,370]},{"title":"It was entertaining and fun","rating":8,"date":"22 May 2010","review":"First of all when I read some of the reviews about this movie all my excitement was drained but I went to see it anyway. What do you now, the movie was great. It was fun, had a lot of action in it, the CGI was nice (excecpt few scenes in the beginning). I thought acting was nice Gyllenhaal (prince) and Arterton (Princess) did a good job in my opinion. As a fun of the game; the script wasn't entirely accurate just like most of the movies based on games but it didn't stray too far either. OK it was not the perfect movie but it was something that I would go and watch its sequel.<br><br>Overall I enjoyed myself and I believe if you go open minded you will enjoy yourself too.","user":"thefilmgourmet","rank":[235,337]}]
