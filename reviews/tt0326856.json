[{"title":"This movie is secretly brilliant","rating":10,"date":"7 February 2011","review":"The central image of this movie is a dog taking a crap. Knowing this, I can't imagine how anyone could judge Envy by the same criteria as a \"real\" movie. This movie is stupid and it knows it's stupid. It's fully aware of that fact, so don't bother using that as a critique. Accept the stupidity into your heart and let this film melt your brain with comedy. In many mainstream comedies, audiences have to wade through some cheesy or worn out plot to get to the funny stuff. But at the end of the day the stories these movies are telling aren't really any good, they're merely a labored suggestion of substance. Ultimately the reason we watch them is to see some funny performers doing funny things, not for the narrative. However good a movie like the 40-Year-Old Virgin maybe, Bergman it ain't! The story only really functions to support the comedy. So then why not make a joke out of the plot too? Why not make a comedy that is one long extended joke? Just enjoy the insanity of the brilliant cast and be thankful that Envy has the common decency to forgo the usual pretense of profundity and focus on poop jokes instead. <br><br>Now this next point may be a harder argument to make and may contradict my last point, but if you do look closely at the recurring gags and images in Envy, the dare-I-say motifs of the film, you might find that it is actually a very nasty spoof of our consumer culture. Plus, the main conflict of the film is that the characters have such a hard time reconciling their greed for material possessions and their moral obligations to other human beings. Jack Black's character even utters a line that I think many people actually live by: \"Nice things make life better.\" So perhaps Envy is secretly brilliant and is merely hiding behind a mask of utter stupidity. That would make it the inverse of most movies out there today (I'm thinking of Inception right now).","user":"eornad-1","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"What an odd film!","rating":8,"date":"30 April 2004","review":"I just saw this movie at a sneak preview and all I can say is...\"What did I just watch????\"  And I mean that in a good and bad way.<br><br>The plot is really simple.  Stiller and Black play friends/neighbors. Stiller is the focused, hardworker while Black is a dreamer.  Black invents this idea to create a spray that erases poo.  The idea becomes very popular, and Black becomes very rich.  The extravagant lifestyle that Black gains and the fact that he still tries to be best friends with Stiller causes Stiller to become crazy with envy.<br><br>As I said, the plot is simple.  Everything else is plain odd.  The direction is odd, with a weird rotating opening shot to out-of-nowhere sped up sequences.  The dialouge and the acting is very odd; odd in a rambling sort of way.  And the sound track is the oddest thing in the movie, from the weird \"Envy\" song that keeps on reappearing to the scene where you think you're going to hear a classic 80's song but suddenly it's in Japanese.<br><br>So, the true question is this...is odd funny?  That depends purely on the individual.  I was cracking up at the shear unwavering weirdness of the movie.  After the screening I heard people call it horribly unfunny and glad that it was free.  Strangely, I understood their point.  There are no jokes whatsoever, so if you aren't hooked by the uniqueness of it all, you will hate this movie.  Absolutely hate it.<br><br>This movie is destined to lose a lot of money at the box office and become a DVD cult classic.  If you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you see it.  If you don't, run away from this movie.  It'll only make you mad.","user":"shawn9210","rank":[53,80]},{"title":"NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE ARE SAYING!","rating":7,"date":"4 May 2004","review":"Any Levinson fan should check this film out. Sure its your typical stupid comedy, but thats exactly what its intended to be. Anyone who enjoyed Toys or Bandits will probably enjoy this film.<br><br>Sure its not the greatest, but I do believe it is worth watching. Even from a directing standpoint its a pretty decent film.<br><br>The two main characters, Jack Black (Nick Vanderpark) and Ben Stiller (Tim Dingman) play complete opposites. From the first moment of the film you begin to see the differences between their lives. I found all of these little differences entertaining to watch.<br><br>Don't believe the reviews or what others are saying....go see it for yourself and find out.<br><br>6.5 out of 10","user":"BigRed2001","rank":[10,12]}]
