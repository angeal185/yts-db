[{"title":"Hard to justify celebrating Aurora","rating":5,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"When it comes down to it, Aurora has very little trust for Maleficent her own godmother. People die, some close to her, and she goes on to receive her grand wedding. What kinda story is this?","user":"sanjaya-william","rank":[205,249]},{"title":"The curse of boredom","rating":5,"date":"31 December 2019","review":"The new conflict these days in movie making: good and sometimes even excellent visuals against a boring and bad script. The whole movie tastes like a stale beer: whereas the people responsible for the visuals and effects have developed high skills, most of today's writers should just quit their job and serve at dinners instead of torturing the audiences to a braindead level: uninteresting and overused storylines, cliché after cliché, one dimensional characters, boring dialogues, jokes that don't work etc. My rate is 5 but only because of the visuals and the actors, the story itself and therefore the movie is simply a boring one.","user":"Movie-Inspector","rank":[162,198]},{"title":"Everything is amazing except the script","rating":4,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"The writing is not good enough. The visual is amazing and so is the acting, but the script is really bad.","user":"shaym_levy","rank":[148,183]}]
