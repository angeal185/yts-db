Twilight! Oh, my... Twiiiiiiiiliaaaaaaaaaaght!","rating":5,"date":"26 November 2008","review":"That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would've just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I'm not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson's baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100,000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie.<br><br>Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn't expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn't aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he's immortal. But he doesn't have fangs, and he doesn't drink human blood.<br><br>So, my opinion about Twilight the movie... honestly, it's average, it's my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I'm a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn't take their \"love\" seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward's father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you're a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens.<br><br>5/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[293,431]},{"title":"Didn't Know Vampires Need Public Education!","rating":2,"date":"5 March 2020","review":"Not completely sure if this should be considered a parody for the vampire sub-genre or an adaptation of a couple of teens meet in public school one of them Edward who belongs to a vampire clan and the other is a human Bella who stays with her dad, they both develop an attraction towards each other.<br><br>Least to say about Twilight is this, it was excruciating!...a bad joke from the beginning to the end. The story is too lame and too shallow, which can be described as a clichéd teen romance that plays out in a complete opposite manner of any folklore or even a decent vampire adaption. The casting choices are weird, like they decided to combine all the ugly actors/actress in 1 movie! In my opinion, most people miss good looks with fame and propaganda, Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner are facially ugly! remove the fame and publicity then put them to work in any convenience store and people won't even look at them twice.<br><br>The acting was over all bad, the actors facial expression and eye movement so weird and bad as if they are smelling onions while shooting the whole movie! the makeup is a laughable disaster as if you are watching movies acted by clowns...clearly the director and the makeup department don't know the difference between having a pale skin and applying a clown makeup, not to mention the ugly wig of Taylor Lautner. The VFX is laughable with all the fake flying around, goes without mentioning the joke effect of vampires under sunlight, no fangs and human like bite marks! It's an over all disastrous movie and the fact that Twilight had some kind of success it can only prove how shallow the average audience mentality has become.","user":"Impartial-Critic","rank":[29,37]}]
