[{"title":"The effect it may have on audiences who may in fact like it","rating":7,"date":"27 December 2010","review":"The Trigger Effect is a movie I'm not proud to like, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't. It wasn't a fantastic thriller, but it shouldn't get the beating it's getting on IMDb, Netflix, and every other review site. The acting isn't phenomenal, the plot isn't much, but the events in the film keep you at least interesting and hoping for the best. In the long run, The Trigger Effect is not the worst thing to come out of movies ever.<br><br>Sometimes, I believe, when a movie is panned by critics and moviegoers, a film gets bad reviews by everyone whether they like it or not. I looked on the IMDb Bottom 100 before writing this review, and thought, there's got to be one person out there that likes some of these films. I scanned about twenty, and the twenty I picked had no review above two out of ten. My point; not everyone can hate a movie. It can't be so bad no one likes it. This is kind of how I feel with this film and the 1996 comedy Bio-Dome which I found to be an entertaining film. The only difference with The Trigger Effect is I could find someone who liked Bio-Dome. I have yet to find someone that (honestly) admits they like The Trigger Effect.<br><br>The film has no real plot. It takes place in Southern California where our two protagonists reside. Matt (Kyle MacLachlan) and Annie (Elizabeth Shue) return home from the movies to find their infant screaming with an ear ache. Matt calls a doctor who promises to have a prescription filled by morning. In the middle of the night, the neighbors wake to find a the town has blacked out. Matt arrives at the pharmacy to find out the doctor didn't call in the prescription, so he resorts to stealing the medicine for the baby.<br><br>Matt's brother Joe (Dermot Mulroney) arrives at the house to convince the couple to buy a gun for security since the blackout is causing very strange behavior amongst the town. When purchasing the gun, the four come to the consensus that they must take a trip to wife's parent's house. Soon enough, all hell breaks loose.<br><br>The film is no masterpiece, but it shouldn't get the beating it is taking on the web now. It's a very least intriguing. You want to know what happens to these innocent people. You want to follow them through this journey through hell. As most of these events occur, they trigger another thing to happen (obviously why the film's title is what it is). Clearly the person behind this idea wanted no light at the end of the tunnel. Just like the film Where the Heart Is or The Quiet, they wanted no light at the end of the tunnel.<br><br>Upon it's release, it grossed a mere $1,887,791, and ranked 12th at the Box Office. It came up very short compared to it's $8,000,000 budget. It went on to gross around $3,000,000 in it's entirety, and lead on to never being spoken about again. While I think in no means it should be praised, it should at least be recognized for doing the job it did. It didn't want to be bad, but then again no movie does. It just showed it's limitations on screen, and nothing more. It doesn't want to be anything more than it's budget allows. It's a good thing and a bad thing simultaneously.<br><br>Starring: Kyle MacLachlan, Elisabeth Shue, and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by: David Koepp.","user":"StevePulaski","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"At least its got an interesting concept (and a very fine female lead)...","rating":8,"date":"3 June 2009","review":"which is a lot more than you can say for most movies...<br><br>I caught this flick one night on television. One of my favourite things is when I stumble across some little movie on TV that I haven't seen before. This happened to me one night when I was just skipping channels, as you do. <br><br>What stopped me dead in my tracks was the sight of Elizabeth Shue. Now I freely admit that this woman just hypnotizes me. She's extremely appealing on several levels so I will often watch a movie that's an obvious turkey (The Saint, The Hollow Man) just because she is in it.<br><br>Elizabeth aside, the movie itself proved to have quite a diverting premise: the meltdown of society when some of the trappings are suddenly removed. There is a lot that could have been done with this, but the production was obviously not that well-financed, so the director smartly focused on the characters instead.<br><br>It really isn't as bad as many of the people here make it out to be. The three leads are interesting enough, there is a sub-plot in the form of a love triangle to keep things interesting and the concept is certainly relevant enough in today's times to hold one's attention.<br><br>Yes, OK, its not a classic but its not a complete disaster either. And I for one detest neat little endings tied up in a bow. <br><br>Ultimately, as with many films, its down to the circumstances in which it is viewed. If you're looking to be entertained for a couple of hours on a slow week night, you could do a lot worse.","user":"MarkCrozier","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Stop ruining good ideas!!","rating":4,"date":"10 September 1999","review":"Our society is so dependent on electricity so that when there is a blackout we despair. We find it hard to understand how people survived without the light switch, the TV, the refrigerator. The Trigger Effect is about such an occurence, but whereas our electricity usually comes back in a matter of hours, this movie's characters have to survive in the black for days. It is an interesting premise but it's horribly handled.<br><br>The characters we are shown are boring and two dimensional. An uneventful love triangle begins between the three leads which leads to nowhere. There are some interesting parts to the movie but it's let down by it's small budget. This movie demanded some cutting edge movie making, it fails to deliver. This could and should have been a much more (dare I say) violent picture. It's theme was that of man's devolution back into nature after it loses its use of technology. So we expect some nasty events to occur. It never happens. <br><br>A movie like this should have left the moviegoer with questions. How would you react in such a situation? Instead it only leaves us with a gaping mouth and a statement to the filmmakers. Stop ruining good ideas!!","user":"Budd-5","rank":[40,51]}]
