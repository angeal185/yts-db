[{"title":"Self-Indulgent and Shameful","rating":2,"date":"6 December 2018","review":"Major disappointment compared to the previous two. This movie is self-indulgent and deceptively and forcefully becomes a movie about how California Pinot Noir should be treated as seriously as Burgundy. I'd be fine with that if the movie was titled \"The Judgemnt of California Pinot.\" A shame that the title of \"Somm\" is used as subterfuge to promote California Pinot. Why not name the title, \"The Judgement of California Pinot?\" Then there'd be no \"Somm\" rug to pull over the viewer's eyes.","user":"mutexzero","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"I just paid for a commercial","rating":1,"date":"4 January 2019","review":"Shame on me. No lessons like we learned in I or II. Terrible narration! Point that out for sure. Let's all be telling bedtime stories with our 100 year old ports. \"Well Raj will be thrilled\"... Get out of here. Pass on this if you're not in the game.","user":"luckydsjs","rank":[1,1]}]
