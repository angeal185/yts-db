[{"title":"May I Stroke Them?","rating":7,"date":"21 February 2000","review":"Frankie Howard got few chances on film to showcase his comedic talents. Nightmare Park(AKA House of the Laughing Dead) is probably his best effort to do so on film.  Like Benny Hill, only not quite as blatant, Howard is walking innuendo.  We see through his eyes and speech an almost endless stream of one-liners, albeit rather tame by today's comparisons.  Howard is funny in the main role of a third-rate entertainer who loves himself that has been invited to a mysterious mansion in the English countryside.  The rest of the cast is comprised of the inhabitants of the house, a strange lot indeed with Ray Milland as the head of the family.  The story is whimsical, and utterly absurd, but through the efforts of Howard, Milland, et all, and the fairly atmospheric direction of Peter Sykes, the film comes off quite well as a somewhat gothic comedy.","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[14,18]},{"title":"A great little horror comedy gem.","rating":8,"date":"12 December 2008","review":"First off this is the only review I've ever posted for a film, so that must say something about how strongly I feel for this one in particular, it really is a good film and I assure you is most enjoyable, you will not regret watching it.<br><br>Secondly I would like to Pooh-Pooh The_Void from Beverley Hills, England's review (see above or below or wherever it is located) what utter tosh! this film is remarkable, a great cast, great atmosphere, engaging story of horror and in-family skulduggery, I don't know what film you were watching mate but to be honest you say that the jokes fell flat and blah, blah, blah but you then put your very own handle as \"The_Void from Beverley Hills, England\" is that supposed to be some sort of \"funny\" joke? Well, if that's the extent of your humour, no wonder you didn't enjoy this flick.<br><br>This is a very rare film and if you get the chance to catch it I'd seriously recommend it.","user":"Stink_Face","rank":[21,32]},{"title":"Fine showpiece for Frankie Howard","rating":8,"date":"10 May 1999","review":"This would be a fairly ordinary British seventies film but for its two main stars. This is a rare opportunity to see Frankie Howard in a starring role, and he does not disappoint. Ray Milland, too, is at his best, as a less camp (and in my view superior) version of Vincent Price. Direction is good, and tension and atmosphere are maintained well throughout the film. A must for Frankie Howard fans.","user":"smithers-5","rank":[15,23]}]
