[{"title":"That 10/10 rating is definitely from family probably.","rating":4,"date":"25 July 2019","review":"This movie had so much potential. I don't know if they ran out of money or what. Very creepy, but man they blew it!","user":"bgsmoove","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"My first review, and the first time i've ever felt compelled to tell people to walk away now!","rating":1,"date":"25 July 2019","review":"This is without doubt the worst horror movie I have ever seen. I watch horror movies, every day, and I always watch to the end in case I miss the point, however terrible the movie appears.<br><br>I regret watching to the end of this one. Zero redeeming features, zero story and horrible acting. Don't even waste another second of your life considering it!","user":"beccaboo-99800","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"Don't believe the hype","rating":3,"date":"25 July 2019","review":"You will fall asleep.<br><br>It is like somebody tried to make a horror movie but really didn't know how. There is barely any inkling of anything horror in this movie. It is mostly about a stoner who sleepwalks after a Ouija board session links him to a girl in a coma.<br><br>Nobody dies. No gore. There isn't a single real threat in the movie at all.<br><br>It's just two drunk guys and their girlfriends, one who sleepwalks, the other who is trying to figure out why, and a girl living above them in a coma.<br><br>The girls freak out at seeing the roommate sleepwalking because he talks in his sleep. That's the apex of the \"horror.\"<br><br>Why a cello is in the artwork I will never know. There is one scene with a cello laying on a couch and that's it. So much of this movie leaves you scratching your head. The writer attempted to be deep, but failed miserably. It is a mess.<br><br>\"Scary\" music was placed over scenes in an attempt to create tension, but even that failed. A lot of it was just out of place and there for no reason.<br><br>It took a lot for me to finish the movie. I read two great critic reviews (which must have been bought or the people involved knew them) and kept hoping the movie was going to flip into something amazing. I was wrong.<br><br>I typically won't call a movie boring, but I have no choice here.<br><br>You might call this movie a light thriller made for television for stoner teenagers. But horror, deep, and full of smart layers it is not.<br><br>Absolutely zero is explained as to why the Ouija caused the connection and sleepwalking, why the girl upstairs is in a coma, and where they are going in the end.<br><br>I gave it three stars because the first few minutes of the movie with the Ouija actually set up what could have been a decent movie, but then the rest of the movie happens.","user":"stephendlancaster","rank":[11,17]}]
