[{"title":"\"Hammer's fifth Frankenstein presents the Baron as a totally irredeemable character.\"","rating":31,"date":"31 March 2004","review":"In order to continue his experiments, the Baron blackmails a young couple into helping him abduct Dr Brandt (a brilliant brain surgeon gone mad) from the lunatic asylum so that he can operate on him, cure his sanity and transplant the brain into another body.  This he does by kidnapping and murdering Professor Richter and using the body to house Brandt's brain. This he does because he wants to learn Brandt's knowledge of brain transplants.  However, when Brandt wakes up he escapes and plots revenge against Frankenstein.<br><br>The fifth Hammer Frankenstein presents the Baron as a totally irredeemable character, a cold calculating psychopath who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, even if it means destroying the young couple in the process. Cushing plays with his usual conviction and is aided by a reliable supporting cast including Simon Ward (in his first film appearance), Veronica Carlson and Freddie Jones as the creature.  The direction of Terence Fisher is accomplished as is the lighting of Arthur Grant.","user":"jamesraeburn2003","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"Hammer's 5th Frankenstein film is proof positive of the fine work of Cushing/Fisher.","rating":23,"date":"23 October 1998","review":"Peter Cushing will always be THE final word on the role of Baron Frankenstein. Cunning, arrogant, relentless and above all else,charming. It could also be said that Terence Fisher is the final word on not only directing Hammer's Frankenstein series but Hammer films in general. This is not a new theory by any stretch regarding Fisher. His was the style by which all who played for Hammer's team would in some way emulate. It is no surprise, therefore, that FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED would be so good. Both actor and director had become pretty familiar with this material but rather than go through the motions something high above the expectation mark occurs. A good script certainly helps and indeed this time around there is. It is the relished performance of Peter Cushing and the carefully executed direction of Fisher which gives this film it's tasty Gothic flavor. Never seen a Hammer film? Here's your chance to sink your teeth into a good one.","user":"A.

The acting, lead by Peter Cushing, can't be any better; Simon Ward, Maxine Audley, and Freddie Jones deserve special comment in this regard. (There is little point in praising Cushing as Frankenstein; he plays it with such depth and understanding that the role is his and always will be!  I can't use any superlatives here that haven't already been used for Cushing's Baron.)  And for once, a Frankenstein movie really gets to the key point Mary Shelley is making  -  by leaving the monster out entirely!  Terence Fisher's direction doesn't miss a cue; with the conventionalization of the monster gone, Fisher can take the movie in new, unexpected directions, and does so with the steady hand of a master director.  An unqualified success for all involved!","user":"Andy Sandfoss","rank":[9,9]}]
