[{"title":"STRONG writing; STRONG acting; Daring in truth","rating":9,"date":"4 October 2013","review":"This movie was soooooo good it's not even funny. Without spoiling anything, I will say they dare to rip the band-aid off of uncomfortable truths that have been implicated/intimated in the majority of storytelling in films of the past. You get that here and there, but to have the band-aids off of so many layers of systematic problems throughout the entire film- from beginning to end surprisingly- was so different and refreshing. Heck, I didn't know that my spirit sort of needed it. To have these issues, these complications, these lows but also the highs portrayed so well by such strong actors made it so easy to get lost in the story and connecting on some level to each character-- even the really bad one. ;-) The production, in its rawness, was spectacular. The editing was purposeful. Very well done.<br><br>My goodness. This movie left me breathless and wanting absolutely nothing for I was truly full. A MUST GO SEE! The main criticism that I have for it is that it's not in more theaters. This is a movie that should be shared with a much broader audience. I hope it's picked up and put in more theaters so I can talk about it with more friends and family across the country! lol This could be a hit for sure!","user":"Ladie_K-393-582343","rank":[15,21]},{"title":"Best movie you never heard of.","rating":9,"date":"21 September 2018","review":"I'm surprised no one told me about this movie. It is very well written and acted. Takes a deeper look at the stereotypes usually found in this type of movie. Not predictable just good.","user":"threeceeproductions","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Hidden Gem","rating":9,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"I was just scrolling through the Pluto app, when I came across this beautifully written movie. Ambivalent at first, but being a poet myself, I felt compelled to watch. Was never quite into slam poetry, spoken word, but when you hear, see and feel it, it pulls you in like a slow wind. This movie is right up there with Love Jones, which is one of my all time favorites. When Curtis (Omari) spoke, you listened. Watching two people fall in love (even if it is just a movie) gives me hope there's someone out there who will truly get me.","user":"sddupree","rank":[0,0]}]
