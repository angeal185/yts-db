If you keep things the same you are damned by comparison to the 'classic' versions that have gone before. <br><br>This film fails on both levels. <br><br>Setting it in modern times makes you cringe with embarrassment. <br><br>Acting kids always have that smiley theatre trained over confident, precocious totally unreal 'fake' sound and look, which is pretty much standard for a group of kids, particularly in a musical. In this offering they actually reach a new level of annoyance. <br><br>But you can excuse the kids, because the adults are so so much worse. <br><br>Cameron Diaz cannot act - it was pitiful. <br><br>Do not waste your time watch this film, you will never get that 2 hours of your life back. You have been warned.","user":"comps-784-38265","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"13 September 2018","review":"Cheap, cheesy knock off of what was a great musical. Horrible acting and worse directing. Just goes to show Hollywood is running out of original ideas so they are destroying well done classics and taunting them with corny jokes are bad actors. Don't waste your time. Watch the original with Albert Finney and Carol Burnett. Better than any remake.","user":"sob-41694","rank":[14,18]}]
