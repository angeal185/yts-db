[{"title":"Rom-Com with a twist","rating":10,"date":"19 December 2019","review":"Fun new modern twist on a rom-com... quirky, sexy and enjoyable. Also filmed in Chicago!","user":"gambitstudios-1","rank":[14,18]},{"title":"Great characters, snappy dialogue, and a clever hook","rating":10,"date":"1 January 2020","review":"This endearing romantic comedy is a fantastic example of its genre - it just happens to be a love story with three leads, instead of the usual two. The dialogue is consistently strong, the characters are adorable (I love the friendship between Emily and Rosa!), and the pacing is great. Highly recommend!","user":"lhirshf","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Such a smart sexy twist on the rom-com","rating":10,"date":"28 December 2019","review":"I loved this movie-the sweetness, the humor, the diversity. And as a bisexual, it was so relatable. The dating scene montage remains my favorite. Would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to see queerness and polyamory in a refreshing light.","user":"annapulley-64128","rank":[11,14]}]
