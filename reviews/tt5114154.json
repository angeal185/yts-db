[{"title":"Love, Loss and Forgiveness","rating":9,"date":"27 July 2018","review":"This is a lovely, thoughtful movie about love, loss and forgiveness.<br><br>Beautifully filmed in a loving, slow paced way. It's a movie you just go into with no expectations and it finds a home within you. <br><br>Characterisations are well written and Sander Thomas is such a find as Jacob. Both Lee Pace and Carrie Coon are excellent in their respective roles.<br><br>I know that this is a movie I'll watch time and again. Subtle, soft and moving.","user":"crawfoc99-1","rank":[60,72]},{"title":"I will have you know,","rating":10,"date":"27 August 2018","review":"That I only cried about 6 times while watching this movie.<br><br>All jokes aside, (I did actually, cry though.) \nThis movie exceeded all of my expectations.\n100% recommend you watch this.<br><br>Btw, to anyone interested in watching this movie,\nPlease do ignore the negative reviews below.\nPeople tend to review a movie on how they wanted it to be, or how they wish it went, instead of reviewing the movie as it's own. <br><br>So, example, it's set as a drama/horror/romance movie, (in this case) and people are leaving bad reviews because they \"wished it was a horror movie\" and that they \"wasted their time\". Well, to this kind of people I wish to say: Maybe watch a movie that's only set as a horror movie, next time? OR, maybe go read other reviews before watching. Thanks.","user":"EmmaD33b","rank":[49,61]},{"title":"Beautiful heart warming story.","rating":9,"date":"25 July 2018","review":"This is certainly not a horror story, but very much a love story. I'm not usually into love stories but the ghostly element persuaded me to have a look, and I'm so glad that I did. It is beautifully filmed and produced, and the acting is great. The plot is quite original and has a simplistic appeal leading up to an unexpected twist at the end. Life goes on even after great tragedy, but still one can find beauty and love. Be prepared to shed a tear or two!","user":"profitbuz","rank":[51,65]}]
