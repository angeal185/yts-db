[{"title":"revenge isnt always the best but sometimes the sweetest","rating":7,"date":"13 August 2019","review":"When reading a short summary of ''teacher'' my first thought where, this must be like ''class of 1984'' or some real bully towards nerds + protective teacher= bloody revenge..... well it became some thing like that but not so much.<br><br>what i can say though is that the main actor does a good job on the screen, and that the plot had a good float and the score made it all pretty tense. also some of the bullying where rather maliscious and even though often used as a teenage drama topic it engaged me that much that i started talking to the screen and jolting at the takes.<br><br>its actually a good film thinks the grumpy old man, the only thing missing is the bloody revenge","user":"ops-52535","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Engaging film with great storyline and character development","rating":10,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"My wife and I watched this movie and found it to be a film that pulls you in with well developed characters and a strong storyline. Each of the leading actors delivered subtle, yet intense, performances with a strength that left us feeling invested in their character's fates. The build up throughout the film resulted in a very satisfying conclusion. This is definitely a movie I will be watching again.","user":"edwardgoldberg","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Loved the movie","rating":8,"date":"21 August 2019","review":"I watched Teacher for the second time today and loved it.
