[{"title":"Flesh against steel!","rating":7,"date":"30 September 2015","review":"Richard Davalos of \"East of Eden\" fame plays Rick Bowman, a punkish man who wrecks his car in a drag race. He's bailed out of jail by cunning businessman &amp; race promoter Grant Willard (Brian Donlevy, in his final feature film), and groomed for a career as a driver in a series of hairy and violent figure eight races. Among Ricks' competitors is the flamboyant Hawk Sidney (Sid Haig), who's not used to losing and doesn't take it well.<br><br>Clearly \"Pit Stop\" has become something of an underdog on the resume of low budget filmmaking legend Jack Hill. Admittedly, it's got a pretty thin, and formulaic, story. At least one plot development was patently predictable. Also, as played as a rather inexpressive Davalos, Bowman remains something of a cipher. The show really belongs to the colourful supporting players. Jack Hill regular Haig, in particular, appears to have the time of his life as the cocky veteran. Beverly Washburn of Hills' \"Spider Baby\" is cute as the racing junkie who ends up in Ricks' bed. Donlevy does a decent job as the man who really only cares about results. Several real life racing figures play themselves; George Washburn (Beverlys' brother), himself a stunt driver and racer, is effective as old pro Ed McLeod. Finally, \"Pit Stop\" features a lovely Ellen Burstyn (billed here as Ellen McRae), doing a very nice job as McLeods' wife Ellen.<br><br>\"Pit Stop\" benefits from believably intense action scenes and use of actual racing tracks. It's a thickly atmospheric, convincing, and ultimately very fun movie with a groovy blues soundtrack.<br><br>You sure come to dislike Rick by the end of the story, though.<br><br>Seven out of 10.","user":"Hey_Sweden","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"The most underrated Jack Hill movie! Tough and super cool.","rating":21,"date":"21 November 2002","review":"'The Winner' (aka 'Pit Stop') was made in the period between Jack Hill's wonderful horror cult classic 'Spider Baby' and his early 70s Pam Grier-led renaissance ('The Big Bird Cage', 'Coffy', Foxy Brown',etc.). While this movie very rarely gets mentioned it is one of Hill's very best, and is a tough and super cool car racing drama, much better than one would expect. Richard Davalos (best known for playing James Dean's brother in 'East Of Eden') plays Rick Bowman, a drag racing street punk who comes to the attention of car enthusiast Grant Willard (the final role for Brian Donlevy, fondly remembered as Professor Quatermass ). Willard bails him out of jail and offers him sponsorship as a race car driver. Bowman eventually accepts and becomes entranced by the tricky \"figure eight\" track Willard introduces him to. The king of the track is cocky and talented hot dogger Hawk Sidney (Hill regular Sid Haig in one of his most memorable and entertaining roles). Bowman and Sidney clash and Bowman sets his sights on knocking the latter of his perch while stealing his girl Jolene (Beverly Washburn who played Haig's demented sister in 'Spider Baby'). This is just the beginning for the ruthless Bowman who will let nobody stand in his way and will attempt to destroy any man, and seduce any woman who crosses his path. Pretty soon he has his eyes on Ellen McLeod ('The Exorcist's Ellen Burstyn ) the wife of champion racer Ed McLeod who he befriends. Will he betray his friends and colleagues on the eve of The Big Race, or will he finally discover he has a conscience? This is a taut and terrific drama with strong performances and exciting racing sequences that deserves to be better known. Highly recommended.","user":"Infofreak","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"50s iron bent every which way .....","rating":7,"date":"9 June 2017","review":"Pure and simple, \"Pit Stop\" is a car crash movie that happens to have a story attached to it. The figure eight track will quickly remind you of the dirt in your face racing that used to be. Richard Davalos plays sort of an anti-hero, taking advantage of situations that could work in his favor at the expense of others. Brian Donlevy really doesn't fit here, and acts as though he would rather be somewhere else. Meanwhile, Sid Haig steals the movie, and is definitely the most interesting character. Do not come into this with expectations beyond drive in fodder, and you will be pleasantly surprised. It moves along at a nice pace, and the race scenes are well done. If you enjoy car carnage , this is definitely one to seek out. - MERK","user":"merklekranz","rank":[5,5]}]
