[{"title":"Worth To Watch","rating":6,"date":"16 May 2017","review":"Although the movie was somehow childish and illogical but it really could make me watch till the end. First of all, it's a comedy family movie and particularly made for children and family, so we shouldn't be tough on it. I know that there were lots of exaggeration and illogical things there, but cool that's the nature of comedy if it's logical then what's the funny thing? the story was simple but clear and lovely. Everyone knows that it's impossible for USA president to have a low secure house, and it's also impossible to see US and Russia in peace together. At least it's an invitation to peace. When it comes to characterization it's kinda weak and raw except for the dog and the two children the others just look like sidekicks to help push the movie forward, no specific personalities can be found in them. The ending was somehow ridiculous when their own staff came out spies you know that's not possible at least 99% not possible. By the way, they could use very beautiful sceneries to make the film, I really liked that Russian accent that was cute. The comedy was OK it can make people laugh and reach its goal as a family comedy I don't know why it's not listed in comedy category too. After all its a movie that you should watch and enjoy. It completely worth to watch because at the end it won't give you the feeling that why did I even watch this? Hope to enjoy watching it.","user":"cassielPrice","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Only Watched because of Max","rating":5,"date":"22 January 2018","review":"I loved the original movie Max, so saw this on netflix and decided to watch.\nUnlike the original movie which had a good storyline ,which told of his coping after coming back from war suffering from PDSD &amp; the loss of his handler - this movie is just plain stupid.\nEven for a family movie it was boring, Max didn't get to do much in it either.\nI had hoped it might have continued with Max's story, none of the cast from the original are not in it either. The acting is awful , I only watched to the end as I said in the title because of Max, the 5 stars are for him.","user":"mystiquious","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Almost a waste of time","rating":4,"date":"15 July 2019","review":"I watched this sequel, following the very enjoyable first one, Max. What a contrast! While the first movie had very little cheesiness, a good supporting cast, a decent plot and plausibility, this sequel ran the total opposite. Basically, I sat through it because I like the dog. Quite a number of times, I was going to switch it off, because it was just too ridiculous. Full of stereotypes and bad acting I sure hope that if they decide to make a 3rd movie with this dog, they pattern it after the original and not this one, which I hope to forget. Very soon","user":"rich-320","rank":[3,3]}]
