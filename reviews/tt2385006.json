[{"title":"Jerusalem 3D is a gem","rating":9,"date":"5 February 2014","review":"Jerusalem succeeds in two major ways - firstly, it manages to present the religious heritage of the city with incredible sensitivity and respect. It could have taken the faux-moral high ground of concluding that religion, and not land, is the cause of all war - and thus saved face. Instead, it considers its audience and gives screen time to the three great religions fairly and equally, not taking any one side. It is able to connect the three to a common ancestry through the clever and subtle marriage of archaeological digs and visual effects.<br><br>Its second success is in capturing the sounds, sights and smells of the ancient city with startling realism. None of the thousands of people featured in its majestic shots appear to be looking at the camera, yet are too real to be extras. You feel the experience of being there in person, peering into ancient rituals and customs from a perspective few get to see.<br><br>As a viewer, you are left not with a shallow materialistic mantra of \"can't we all get along?\", but of a sense of curiosity and wonder, and a desire to explore and research what the film describes as the \"heart of the world\".","user":"espoeth","rank":[24,33]},{"title":"Jerusalem","rating":5,"date":"4 December 2015","review":"Watching this as a video on a television, as I did, probably meant it wasn't as impressive as it would have been in a theater, but it was beautifully photographed.<br><br>It presented a reasonably even-handed and, as far as I know, accurate portrayal of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim communities residing in Jerusalem. It was a decidedly superficial and elementary presentation. I'm not sure who the intended audience was, though the approach suggested it was aimed at school children or possibly as a tourism promotion.<br><br>There was no reference to any of the difficulties faced between the communities, at least until the conclusion when a vague mention was made of historical conflicts and a hope that seeing the commonalities and shared faith of Christians, Muslim and Jews might eventually be considered more important and valuable than the emphasis on differences.<br><br>Overall it was nicely done, but very superficial and lacking any depth. I doubt many people would come away motivated to work for peaceful coexistence, though maybe those who are open-minded will better understand that Jerusalem of all places ought to inspire peace rather than conflict between the three major Abrahamic religions.","user":"Suradit","rank":[11,16]},{"title":"A wondrous tour with breathtaking visual, and an identifiable beauty beyond restriction of one faith.","rating":8,"date":"4 December 2015","review":"Jerusalem is the kind of film usually displayed on shopping center to advertise the new flat or curved television set. It's an undeniable graphical masterpiece as every shot is done with such precise cinematography. Its frame, composition of scenery, the contrasting shadow and lighting, one can take a random screenshot and it would be an impressive work of photography.<br><br>The documentary takes audience through walks and lives of the holy city's citizens. It mainly tells the culture of three different major religions from perspectives of young women. They depict the city and its meaning to them, both personally and culturally while Benedict Cumberbatch narrates how the place came to be.<br><br>It's a grand view of many corners and landmarks, taken in such angle that it is simply immersive. The high rise scene is gorgeous, meanwhile the first person perspective, especially when the camera walks through gates of houses, mosques or churches, is intimately welcoming. Every shot is taken with purpose and they are never out of focus, it offers a steady pace throughout the entire visual marvel.<br><br>Granted, it doesn't cover much of the more bloody history, yet this is meant for a testament of human cultures and celebration of life. It's simply a marvelous display of excellent cinematography, regardless of one's faith.","user":"quincytheodore","rank":[5,8]}]
