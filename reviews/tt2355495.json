[{"title":"A heartwarming & feel good movie","rating":9,"date":"25 February 2014","review":"It was a very well written script with excellent acting by the lead pair. Evan Rachael was flawless in her portrayal with some great support by Scott. Its very different than your average Rom-com but does fall prey at some areas to the regular formula film making. Nevertheless a movie that's light &amp; frothy which will end up making you feel for the characters. Its a good choice for a refresher after a day's long work to just unwind. The cinematography and music were also working well with the script. The direction was top notch and it looked like the director knew what he wanted from his actors. I wouldn't really mind watching it again sometime. A surprise package indeed, go for it !!!","user":"soundaryaona","rank":[75,94]},{"title":"Sweet remake with a lovely Evan Rachel Wood","rating":8,"date":"19 April 2014","review":"As a German movie fan I am familiar with Til Schweiger's original 'Barfuss' (2005). But since I always try to keep an open mind I was intrigued to see this remake - and I wasn't disappointed.<br><br>'Barefoot' - as an americanized version - tells the story a little bit different and dips more into the romantic (comedy) genre. That's fine by me because a mere copy of Schweiger's film would be pretty redundant. Evan Rachel Wood plays beautifully and portrays an adorable innocence in her role as 'Daisy', the mental patient accompanying Scott Speedman's 'Jay' to his brothers wedding. Their unusual bond is sweet and the movie has more of a light romantic dramedy tone than the original. The colors are warm and the tempo is upbeat but slows down for some nicely done heart-to-heart scenes. I especially loved the setup of certain pivotal scene towards the end.<br><br>I can already hear all those serious movie 'critics' moaning about yet another unnecessary remake but that's just it - this remake is not unnecessary. It tells a similar story with a different tone, in a different light, with a different background - transitioning it to a lighter genre. It's not taking anything away from the original - I see it as more of a bonus and really liked it.","user":"tanjareen-1","rank":[45,56]},{"title":"Somewhat clunky but still heart-warming","rating":22,"date":"22 February 2014","review":"I watched this movie last night not knowing what to expect. I briefly read the premise and thought I'd take a chance and watch it. In a word, I was not disappointed. I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys just a good, simple, plain vanilla romantic movie. If you're not into that, then you wouldn't appreciate this movie.<br><br>The movie starts out kind of slow and slowly builds momentum. Granted, the acting is not the greatest I've seen, the story line is not fluid; it's broken up and has plot holes and just not developed very well. It's supposed to be a comedy, but didn't find it hilarious. It's more cute than funny.<br><br>However, and a big however, all things considered, I liked the movie. I found it heart-warming and love does conquer all after all. I didn't over analyze it or read too much into it. I just accepted it for what it is and enjoyed it over all.","user":"hiyaboyos","rank":[52,68]}]
