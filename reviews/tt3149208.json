[{"title":"A delicately told love story","rating":8,"date":"15 January 2020","review":"A lovely film about love, loss and the traumas of war. Well worth a watch - and not full of tortured animals as others have suggested - but more a considered look at life within an isolating rural community.","user":"charlotte_pegram","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Great indie","rating":10,"date":"20 January 2020","review":"A strong indie film with stand out performances and beautiful cinematography. Checked it out on Amazon Prime and it did't disappoint.","user":"james-46885","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Disgusting movie!","rating":1,"date":"25 August 2019","review":"Dead animals, pigs head, torture of chickens amidst PTSD. Don't let this garbage of a disgrace into your head! Save yourself and your time. My advice- skip this.","user":"lroyal-86661","rank":[1,5]}]
