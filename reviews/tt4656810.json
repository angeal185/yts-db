[{"title":"Vapid","rating":2,"date":"22 May 2018","review":"The average rating of 4.x on this movie is generous. The writing is as bad as the written movie summary. The acting is non-existent, as the roles require nothing in this area. The story line is vaporous and plot non-existent. <br><br>The only positive point of this movie is rather good CGI... but these days such can be cranked out of someone's home computer using Blender, and gets no stars from me in the light of everything else in the film. <br><br>It is reasonable to assume most viewers will find this an incredibly long 2 hours. This movie just drags on, more so than most movies we've seen of this kind. It's not just bad, it's slow and bad. <br><br>Rutger Hauer seems to have a knack for choosing the worst roles these days. He brings his usual stoic half-humor to the role, but even that can't raise this film above 2 stars for me. This is definitely a \"pass it by\" film, with the non-audience better off for choosing to do so.","user":"Snootz","rank":[26,34]},{"title":"This is Beyond merely Bad","rating":1,"date":"26 May 2018","review":"The other reviewers are too kind to this truly painful to watch extravaganza that drags on and on yet goes nowhere..The acting is like listening to fingernails on a chalkboard and the music score drones on neverendingly at levels that Almost drown out the dialogue...If I had to find anything in this movie to redeem it,one would struggle.. Even on fastforward this one is hard to stomach...You have been warned..","user":"skip-98756","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"Nice shot, horrible acting, horrible sound","rating":2,"date":"23 May 2018","review":"The shots are so nice, the plot has possibilities.\nBut the movie lacks direction, refinement, and certainly money. All the sound is post-synced. The music sounds like a compilation of classical music which starts at the beginning of the film, never is muted, and then the voiceovers are completely out of sync. Even Rutger Hauer has a foreign accent!<br><br>Horrible, had to stop after 25 minutes.","user":"johan-83-77031","rank":[10,13]}]
