[{"title":"Tutto bene!","rating":10,"date":"26 May 2018","review":"I have been a fan of Luciano Ligabue's music for many years now and I was keen to see this movie. Living in Thailand, as I do now, it was hard to get my hands on a copy! But it was well worth the effort.<br><br>It's a thoroughly engrossing movie. If you're a fan of action movies, this probably isn't for you. If, however, you're a fan of movies about people and their lives, the daily struggle to be true to yourself and your loved ones, to earn a living in an ever-changing modern world, you will enjoy this moive.<br><br>Superb performances from the cast, especially Stefano Accorsi, Kasia Smutniak, Walter Leonardi and Fausto Maria Sciarappa. It's beautifully shot, with gorgeous colour and lighting. The script is good. The music, of course, mostly taken from Ligabue's album Made in Italy, suits the mood of the movie wonderfully.<br><br>It's a superb movie, so do try to see it. You won't be disappointed!","user":"npvarley","rank":[8,13]},{"title":"Splendido!","rating":10,"date":"20 May 2018","review":"This movie is such an inspiration for all of us!
