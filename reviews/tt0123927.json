[{"title":"Saturday Night Fever spoofery","rating":3,"date":"4 February 2018","review":"THE FACE WITH TWO LEFT FEET is one of those extremely broad Italian comedies that just so happens to openly spoof SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, a big hit in Italy as well as around the world. Giuseppe Spezia plays a bumbling hotel cook with horn-rimmed glasses and a goofy attitude who falls in love with a disco-dancing girl. He discovers that when he removes his glasses he just so happens to be the spitting image of John Travolta, so he heads off to the dance floor to strut his moves. There's no more story to it than that, and this film as a whole is extremely cheesy. There are goofy slapstick scenes, camp stereotypes, Bee Gees rip-off music, and a lot of silliness from beginning to end. One for acquired tastes, then.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[1,1]}]
