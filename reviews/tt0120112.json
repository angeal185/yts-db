[{"title":"It's that good","rating":12,"date":"12 November 2003","review":"Movies that will never have an Oscar do not possess the following: 1. Extensive gripping plot of historical nature, or about a famous personality (read `The English patient,' `Braveheart,' `Titanic,' `Beautiful Mind') 2. Unreal or almost unreal plot twists (read `Lord of the Rings') 3. Clearly morally defined characters (read Billy Zane character in `Titanic;' Mel Gibson's character in any movie he is in). You either love them or hate them. 4. Long viewing time. 5. Sense of the plotline ending at the end of the movie (you pretty much can picture the life of Forrest Gump after the movie end, and you know what's going to happen to Rose from `Titanic', at least key things) The movie `She's so lovely' is a tale of  Eddie (Sean Penn), a drunk with a mental problem, and Maureen (Robin Wright Penn), a drunk with lots of other problems. They are in love, he goes to mental institution, she is pregnant, but marries another, Joey (Travolta is for once in a movie he really belongs in, and does a terrific job). Ten years later, Eddie comes out and comes back for Maureen. All of these characters are semi-crazy, semi-abusive, semi-kind, semi-dumb. How can you love someone who hit his wife then tells her he loves her? And how can you not love that same person for being a dad to 3 little girls, one of them not his own? How can you forgive a woman for divorcing her husband while he is sick, and then not sympathize with her when she paid for it by 10 years of being separated from the man she loves? And what to think of a man who comes to take a woman from a family she made without him because he clearly sees her love for him? Penn's performance is as always vulnerable and smart. Wright Penn is the most under-appreciated actress of our time; I still cannot forgive the aforementioned academy for not even nodding her way with her brilliant performance in `Forrest Gump.' These two actors can act with their eyes alone, seems fitting that they are together also in real life.<br><br>Having said all that, `She's so Lovely' is clearly not an Oscar material. It's too real. It's too good.","user":"beautiful_oblivion2001","rank":[31,39]},{"title":"Wanna See Sean Penn In A John Cassavetes Film? Here it is.","rating":10,"date":"20 January 2000","review":"Some of the people who \"review\" flicks here continually amaze me with their complete lack of film knowledge.<br><br>When I heard an interview with the always-extraordinary Sean Penn, in which he said he was upset that so few people had seen what he considers to be his best work: this film and the excellent \"At Close Range,\" I knew that I had to catch this.<br><br>Then, finding that it was based on an unproduced John Cassavetes script, I was all the more eager.<br><br>That final statement should scare off anyone who expected a happy, romantic Hollywood film, as they clearly haven't seen any of the late writer/director's stark, realistic films.  Cassavetes' work relied heavily on tortured, unlikable or unredeemable characters who can act their brains out te often portrayed by his wife/widow, Gena Rowlands].<br><br>We're talking serious fare, folks ~ required viewing such as \"Husbands,\" \"Woman Under The Influence,\" \"The Killing of a Chinese Bookie\" and \"Gloria\" [the brilliant Rowlands original, not the adequate Sharon Stone remake].<br><br>Now comes his former B-movie star &amp; son, Nick, who dusts off papa's script and enlists the type of actors who are eminently qualified to play a group of true undesirables: Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn, James Gandolfini, Harry Dean Stanton, Debi Mazar and the newly-retalented John Travolta, who appears in the last reel.<br><br>Even Mom [Rowlands, of course] gets a small but important role.<br><br>And the adorable Kelsey Mulrooney, playing Penn &amp; Penn's nine-year-old daughter is terrific without stooping to precociousness.<br><br>Is this a brutally honest film?  Yep.  Is it vulgar in nearly every way?  Of course.  Do the leading characters have any chance of redemption, moral or otherwise?  Not likely.<br><br>Do I care?<br><br>Let's just say that there's more passionate acting in \"She's So Lovely\" than was evident in nearly every other 1997 film.<br><br>And that's certainly good enough for me.<br><br>So there.","user":"Niro","rank":[35,48]},{"title":"An unsuccessfully delivered narrative with confused actors and a terrible mix of dark relationship drama and comic moments produces a roundly poor film","rating":25,"date":"25 October 2006","review":"Maureen is a bit strung out and pregnant from her low-life husband Eddie. Their lives are an unpredictable mix of actions that mostly involve drinking and scamming round on the fringe of society. When Eddie is \"away\" for a few days, Marueen falls in drinking with neighbour Kiefer, who tries to rape her but then just beats her. She explains this away to Eddie so as to keep him from going crazy at her or anyone else but when he does start to flip she calls the paramedics to take him into care for his own safety. However when he shoots one of them, Eddie is sentenced to a mental institution. When he comes out he finds that Maureen has divorced him and has moved onto a much more stable and reliable man in the form of Joey, with whom she has had more children.<br><br>Almost halfway in it becomes evident that this film isn't going to work out that well because, before the \"10 years later\" jump, the love between the two leads hasn't been established to a convincing degree. Given that the narrative is using this mutual attraction (despite all the negatives) as its lynchpin this is a bit of a problem. Other than establishing that both are unstable and using each other for meaning, the film doesn't do that much for all the time it takes up. The second half isn't that much better as Eddie comes out as a sort of watered down Rainman and disrupts Maureen's new relationship with Joey. The script then asks us to swallow that she still loves Eddie to the point where the mere news that he is released sees her flush the last ten years down the toilet.<br><br>I can sort of understand what the script was trying to do but it didn't manage to produce anything interest in the aggressive relationships that it paints in the gutter. The characters are where the main failing is. Maureen's character is poorly defined and Wright-Penn doesn't appear to understand what motivates her character and thus turns in a really mixed performance that pushes emotional buttons in each scene but is never consistent. Eddie is OK in the first half of the film as he just seems like a drunk unstable loser but in the second half he is unconvincingly soft. Likewise Penn is strong in the first half but he is unconvincing in the second. Their performances aren't helped by a weird mix of tones  at times a dark love story, at other times a cringingly awful \"comedy\" complete with \"jaunty\" music being played over a fight on the front lawn or that horrible scene at Joey's bar. Travolta is a bit better and Stanton is a reasonably nice addition in a small role.<br><br>Overall this is a shocking mess of a film that spirals downhill from the mid-point onwards. The first half shows potential but doesn't manage to pull off the formative stages of the central relationship and thus fails to set up the second half. However the second half isn't helped by poor development and a terrible mishmash of \"comic\" moments that simply feel crass and out of place  I suspect even if the first half had been a stormer, this second half would have been poor enough to drag it all under. Even the acting talent seems all at sea and unsure of where they stand or who they are. A load of rubbish with little or no value.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[18,24]}]
