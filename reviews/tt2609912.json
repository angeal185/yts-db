[{"title":"I laughed hard on SOME parts","rating":9,"date":"7 July 2013","review":"First let me correct one reviewer here that said half of the movie was spent showing clips of his shows around the world. Not True. I intentionally timed it because I read his review before I saw the movie. It was 7 minutes of a skit that made me laugh. Then it was approximately 6 minutes of showing clips of Kevin's shows from around the world. The rest of the movie was stand up comedy. Although I laughed really hard only on certain parts, the whole movie was entertaining to me and that was my goal: to be entertained. Kevin's brand of comedy can be silly at times, and there is nothing wrong with that, if it makes you laugh, and it did. I can't understand why half the viewers here (Since July 6, 2013) had unfavorable things to say about the movie. As I observed, the audience and the fans around the world are happy with what Mr. Hart does in his act.","user":"Lwills093","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Hilarious, and better than \"Laugh At My Pain\"","rating":8,"date":"3 July 2013","review":"Before I get into this \"Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain\" review, I feel like I should get into the history of Kevin Hart for a second...<br><br>Not counting his half-hour special on Comedy Central, \"I'm A Grown Little Man\" was Hart's first big stand-up special, back in 2009. And it was a CLASSIC. It's one of the few stand-up specials that you could go back and watch time and time again, and still laugh just as hard as the first time. It was never a theater release, so it's not BDBOS eligible, but if it was, it would have easily been a 5 out of 5.<br><br>\"Seriously Funny\" was his second stand-up special, in 2010. It's hard to top your first time out when you completely crush it like that, but he came damn close. Again, if it was eligible, it would have been a 4.5 out of 5.<br><br>Then came his first theater release, \"Laugh At My Pain\", which hit theaters last year. The movie covered his 2011 tour of the same name, in which he broke a record held by Eddie Murphy for ticket sales over a two-day period by an African-American comedian. (he cracked 1.1 millions in sales for the two-day live set at the Nokia Theater in L.A.)<br><br>Here's where it gets a little funky...\"Laugh At My Pain\" wasn't as good as his first two specials. And, by movie standards, it was short – it clocked in at just over an hour. They tried to fill in some extra time by throwing in a produced short at the end of it, featuring Hart and his friends, but it didn't do much to improve the overall flick. Don't get me wrong, it was still funny, but it fell short of the standards that we came to expect. It scored a 3 out of 5.<br><br>So now we get to \"Let Me Explain\", which covers his latest tour that hit Madison Square Garden. This is still shortan hour and a half, tops. But it's definitely better than \"Laugh At My Pain\", and had me cry-laughing at one pointit's pretty damn good. And there's a pretty touching moment at the end, where the idea of being one of the very few comics to headline at MSG both humbles him and gets him emotional. Pretty cool stuff.<br><br>\"Let Me Explain\" scores a 8 out of 10 on the BDBOS. Good job, Kevin.<br><br>(If you enjoyed this review, perhaps you'd consider checking out my humble little page... www.facebook.com/TheBDBOS.

I should have waited for this to show up on cable or the bootleg (just kidding about the bootleg). I paid money for a 75-minute stand-up comedy movie whose first 25 minutes feature no stand-up comedy whatsoever. Minus credits, that's ~45 minutes of jokes, several of which are only mildly funny, not his normally funny. The film opens with an unfunny party scene Hart shows clip after clip of his tours from around the world. Not ONE of these clips features Hart telling a single joke. Instead, it's him saying \"thank you (fill in the location)\" and just more clips of fans and Hart's entourage sleeping on a bus. It goes on so long that I almost walked out. I didn't need a Kevin Hart commercial to prove he was a big funny star. I knew this that's why I bought tickets to see his stand-up. I think Kevin Hart is hilarious; this just wasn't his best material. Hart used the N-word way too much for my taste, but that's the price you pay for a lot of black comedy. I guess they feel that appeals to their mostly urban crowd / audience.","user":"dangerousdivot","rank":[11,16]}]
