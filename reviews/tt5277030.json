[{"title":"Loved it.","rating":9,"date":"21 January 2020","review":"I didn't expect a whole lot from this movie but when a movie makes me laugh and keeps me invested start to finish that movie has done it's job.","user":"jimmywrangleswows","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Old John Cleese at it again","rating":9,"date":"2 September 2019","review":"It is a treat when John is on screen and so excellent seeing him back on the big screen playing himself, lol, an angry old guy that seems to never get what he wants despite his fortune! So much more than a cameo and he adds some weight, to an excellent film that I think will be loved by audiences anywhere in the world.<br><br>Special mention to the character Eli who was easily best of the rest and such a smart quick wit that led to plenty of good laughs.","user":"ObviousCapitan","rank":[10,30]},{"title":"Laughter, tears and love","rating":10,"date":"2 September 2019","review":"After the buzz of the premiere I went in with high hopes to the Margaret River screening at CinefestOz and it didn't dissapoint. Such a lovely film and it had me laughing and crying as Jake fought his way to find his true love. Angus is amazing as Jake, and his friend Cam was hilariously silly. Hope lots of people get a chance to see this and so happy it was made in south west WA!","user":"justjanewa","rank":[10,30]}]
