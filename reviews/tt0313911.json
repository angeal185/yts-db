[{"title":"Amusing film for teenagers with a starring interpreting a James Bond adolescent","rating":6,"date":"24 July 2005","review":"The film talks a shy adolescent (Frankie Muniz) who's submitted to jokes from his school fellows but he's really a CIA undercover agent . He's assigned by his chief (Keith David) for one dangerous mission , he then meets a teen girl (Hillary Duff) whose father (Martin Donovan) is a scientific working in nanotechnology industries for the nasties (Ian McShane and Arnold Vosloo) . The teen is helped by an attractive agent (Angie Harmon). <br><br>The plot is a little bit ridiculous , but we're in a spoof comedy and it is narrated in fast movement ; besides , abound the surprises , being very funny and bemusing . In the film there is suspense , comedy , emotion , action-packed , tongue-in-cheek and chases galore with impressive velocity pursuits . The screenplay is nicely developed as well as characters and the frenetic action united to excellent special effects that are varied of these too . From the beginning until the end the amusement and entertainment is continued . The humor moments are in charge of Frankie Muniz with his abundant botches and goofs that happen when he must confront perils and risks against the villains . It's a spoof of James Bond's films , even there's a flying artifact like in ¨Thunderball¨ , plus a role type ¨Q¨ , a weapons deliverer , who teaches the various gadgets which Cody Banks will subsequently use . Exciting final facing off between the protagonists and the baddies on the mountain headquarter is breathtaking and special mention to the habitual villain Arnold Vosloo (The mummy) , he is terrific. Colorful cinematography by Denis Crossan ; the exterior of the CIA headquarters was shot on location in the Academic Quadrangle at Simon Fraser University near Vancouver , this location is popular for films shot in this city . Atmospheric and lively musical score by John Powell . The motion picture was professionally directed by Harald Zwart (One Night at McCool's , Commando Hamilton , Pink Panther 2). Rating: Enjoyable and nice.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[23,26]},{"title":"Fun movie...","rating":7,"date":"14 March 2003","review":"What can I say...  It was a fun movie!<br><br>Went to see it with my 9 year old and we both enjoyed it a lot.  Kind of a bond for younger audiences.  Far fetched?  Sure... but then so is 007 no?<br><br>I especially liked the little humorous details here and there... like the page \"Would the driver of a silver Austin Martin please report to...\" inside the CIA building (James Bond's car), or Cody's cell phone that rings like Austin Powers video-phone.  Pay attention when watching it as the movie is filled with little details and one liners referring to other spy movies.<br><br>Was it worth the price of admission?  Sure!","user":"Lost_cow","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Cody Saves The World And Gets Grounded","rating":5,"date":"10 April 2009","review":"Taking advantage of a couple of hot teen television properties at the time, MGM fashioned this fantasy for kids about a typical teenage boy with one big secret. Agent Cody Banks is a CIA operative, part of a special program that trains kids for special missions. And in the title role Frankie Muniz gets to do them, providing he's not grounded.<br><br>The other hot property at the time was Hilary Duff who was in Disney's Lizzie McGuire series while Muniz was doing Malcolm In The Middle. She's Frankie's assignment, Duff is the daughter of a scientist who's gone missing and Frankie has to both protect her and find out what's going on.<br><br>It's something big all right, scientist Martin Donovan has invented some kind of artificial life that will eat anything carbon or silicon based. That could wreak a lot of havoc in the wrong hands. <br><br>Donovan is Duff's father, as for Muniz's parents they are unbelievably clueless, but that's part of the charm of these films. One who's not clueless is Muniz's immediate superior and handler Angie Harmon. She's got a great scene in the prep school where Muniz has been put to be close to Duff with some of the adolescent males there. <br><br>Agent Cody Banks with the star power of two current teen idols made a lot of money, so much so a sequel was made. Now if they had really wanted to do something different, they'd have made Duff the secret agent with Muniz her assignment.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[8,10]}]
