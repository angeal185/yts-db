[{"title":"just beautiful","rating":30,"date":"30 August 2019","review":"First, its special beauty has as source the status of hommage to William Shakespeare by Kenneth Branagh. If you do not ignore the great adaptations of the plays by Branagh, you understand why \"All Is True\" is a real special film. Second - for splendid photography . And for magnificent portrait of Anne Hathaway by Dame Judy Dench. And for the moments when the Shakespeare resemblance becomes almost...magic. And the music, off course. And the delicate use of themes.<br><br>Sins ? For me , it seems too...didactic. You know the life, you know the plays, you do not forget the verses. And you need a Shakespeare alive, of small gestures, not a package of explanations. I feel the meetings with the Earl of Southampton and Ben Jonson not real inspired used. Cliches, again and again, parts of lessons and something who you know deserves be better.<br><br>But, I admitt, I love it. For beauty, with so many faces and sources. And, off course, for \"sins\". And my old admiration for Kenneth Brannagh is more significant at the end of this film.","user":"Kirpianuscus","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Pensive, Poignant, Satisfying","rating":9,"date":"9 January 2019","review":"I appreciated this thoughtful film, and Branagh did a marvelous job helming it while also portraying Shakespeare. Another reviewer scoffed at the historical inaccuracy due to the real-life age difference between Branagh and Dench. This chronology was not distracting to me, because both actors gave convincing portrayals. Costumes and set design were outstanding. The gorgeous English countryside stood in as another character, of sorts. During the pre-release screening (USA), the director revealed a fascinating fact: several of the interior scenes were lit by candles, absent of any set lights. I was taken by Branagh's passionate and studied approach to Shakespeare, and this film is a fine example.","user":"Tail_End_Charlie","rank":[49,59]},{"title":"Beautiful, sad, patient... an almost perfect film.","rating":10,"date":"27 December 2018","review":"It has been years since a Kenneth Branagh film made me feel something in the way this does. His Hollywood success has also been accompanied by a change in directorial style and a change in his focus on storytelling ... but this film returns to what made him so great early on ... a passion for the subject material. The end result is a period film that feels actually of the period, while also fully modern. Every frame of film is like a historical painting. And the story and characters are fully expressed. Slow, patient, sad, and beautiful - this is a wonderful film with wonderful writing, acting and directing. The pacing and editing is deliberate. What some critics have considered to be slow or meandering I would call the story taking it's time and earning it's value. Highly recommended.","user":"roaming_charges_may_apply","rank":[82,104]}]
