[{"title":"Very interesting movie","rating":10,"date":"27 June 2017","review":"Who didn't see this movie yet, congrats, they can enjoy the first watch. The movie is breathtaking, after the second minute it is very interesting and it is difficult to pause or stop watching. Actors play very well. For this kind of movie I don't think, that better performance is necessary. I set 10, because of the emotions which I got during the watch and for intensive course of events.","user":"hausiusi-288-725893","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"Better than a modern James Bond","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2018","review":"It makes more sense, and has all the action. <br><br>--The only problem is that U can tell it has inaccurate translations, like so many asian movies.<br><br>acting is excellent, action is actually alit over the top, music is spot on, script is very good, ending is predictable, some original humor in it with a little car being a running gag throughout movie<br><br>Its got some originality in some parts, and some modern applicability with tech and on line gaming<br><br>A mystery ultra action fest that even a woman (who likes mysteries) may be able to enjoy.

It's a film targeted at youth like us and that's another reason why I enjoyed it very much. <br><br>The film's excellence is visible from the very first scene: it's the best part of the film in my opinion. As the film progresses, it turns out to be something extremely surprising. If you've seen the trailer you might be having great expectations from this film, and happily it's doesn't disappoint.<br><br>Ji Chang-wook fits in the lead role and does an excellent job. Same for the rest of the cast, especially his friends and the antagonists. <br><br>The visuals are breathtaking, and the action scenes are \"explosive\". The editing is decent and some dialogues are memorable. <br><br>FABRICATED CITY is an impressive action thriller which will be liked more by the youth than any other audience.","user":"Prashast_Singh","rank":[11,15]}]
