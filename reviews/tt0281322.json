[{"title":"Undisputed","rating":6,"date":"29 February 2020","review":"A solid prison drama with strong performances by Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames, but the film lacks in any form of human emotion or character study and just leaves a dark shell that isn't totally filled and makes you feel unsatisfied. But it's not to say it isn't well-crafted from it's director, Walter Hill. It also has one of the best boxing showdowns shown in a film since the original Rocky and Raging Bull.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[39,41]},{"title":"A Champ","rating":8,"date":"27 August 2002","review":"Director Walter Hill's \"Undisputed\" is a great guy's movie. It's a fight movie set in Sweetwater Prison in the Mohavje Desert, starring tough guys Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames. What distinguishes this guy's movie are a couple things: the expert and lean direction of Hill, the crisp and intelligent script by David Giler and Hill, and one of the best boxing fight scenes ever done in the movies.<br><br>Ving Rhames plays former undisputed Heavyweight Champion James \"Ice Man\" Chambers, convicted of rape and stripped of his title and sentenced to serve his time in Sweetwater. While there he learns that Monroe Hutchen (Wesley Snipes) is the \"undisputed\" champ at Sweetwater, and he has been undefeated champion for ten years. For the Ice Man, there can be only one champion, and that would be himself. It is predictable that the two will fight at the end, and this is arranged by mobster inmate Mendy Ripstein (a very good Peter Falk). What is not predicable is that Giler and Hill make both Ice Man and Monroe admirable and fascinating characters. You have to credit Rhames and Snipes. Rhames takes what could have been a Mike Tyson caricature, and transformed him into a complex and empathic character. His Ice Man is vicious, crude, arrogant, but also both smart and articulate. Credit Rhames on several occasions for scaring us with the ruthlessness of his Ice Man, and for also surprising us with his understanding of his stature in life as a Heavyweight champion. Ice Man is definitely the more showy character. Snipes underplays it right as Monroe, a great foil to the Ice Man. Snipes's Monroe is not afraid. Monroe knows that \"Any fighter can be beat on a given day...\", and the game is how long you stay on top and be the best. Monroe is matter of fact, and always in control-- the last time he wasn't got him in prison. Ice and Monroe are both convicts that operate by a code of honor, and that makes all the difference in the movie. It's all about standing your ground, and whoever wins, wins. \"Undisputed\" also is an homage to boxing and it's history, because ultimately it is about two men seeing who is better on that particular day. There is something pure and whole about that, which is both appreciated and respected.<br><br>The final boxing match is awesome. Snipes is an accomplished martial artist and he trained with Emmanuel Stewart. Snipes looks amazing as a boxer-- body movement and combinations. Rhames also looks very impressive and fearsome. It's a 15 minute fight in a 90 minute movie. Walter Hill is the Man.<br><br>\"Undisputed\" is a no nonsense boxing movie that entertains and makes us think. And that is not bad for a very unpretentious movie.","user":"jon.h.ochiai","rank":[43,54]},{"title":"A sharp and hard-hitting boxing drama.","rating":9,"date":"13 May 2003","review":"Seems like an eternity since director Walter Hill (\"48 HRS.\", \"Streets of Fire\", \"Southern Comfort\") made a really good movie and his latest offering \"Undisputed\" shows that Hill still has the skill to create a clever movie.<br><br>\"Undisputed\" is the second movie about boxing that Hill has done, the first being his feature debut \"Hard Times\" that starred Charles Bronson and the late James Coburn in the mid-seventies.<br><br>The tale takes place at an isolated Arizona maximum security prison where a former heavyweight boxing champ (Rhames) is sent to serve a sentence for rape meets a counterpart (Snipes) who is an undefeated champ in the prison ranks and the opportunity to have the two fighters face each other in a bout arranged by a former mobster (Peter Falk) who still has mob connections outside the prison and a devoted fan of the sport.<br><br>And the result is a sharp and hard-hitting boxing drama with the fight being the center piece.  Snipes and Rhames are terrific here and the supporting performances are just as good especially Michael Rooker, Wes Studi, and Falk, too.<br><br>\"Undisputed\" may not top \"Rocky\" or \"Raging Bull\" in being the best movie about the sport, but it deserves some mention.","user":"mhasheider","rank":[15,17]}]
