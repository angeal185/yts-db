[{"title":"Amusing spy-story about a double agent during WWII and allegedly based on true events","rating":6,"date":"8 May 2009","review":"This espionage-Flic based on fact concerns an astute safe-cracker named David Chapman (Christopher Plummer) who encounters himself working for both contenders in the 40s , as the German secret service commanded by a baron (Yul Brynner) and a colonel (Get Frobe) , and British military (led by Trevor Howard and Jess Hahn) . Meanwhile , he falls in love with a gorgeous resistance fighter (Claudine Auger) and a mysterious German countess (Romy Schneider) . Chapman attempts to cheat both sides and play each other . The he's sent a dangerous mission and parachuted in England with objective to reconnaissance and factory's sabotages . He's even decorated by General Von Runstedt (Marcel Journet).<br><br>Based on real events starred by a true bank robber named Eddie Chapman , this film packs action , suspense , warlike feats and being quite entertaining. First-rate main cast as Christopher Plummer as an amoral but sympathetic double agent adding a bemusing touch , Yul Brynner as a disillusioned German officer, Von Stauffemberg-alike , and a splendid Get Frobe as a cunning Colonel . Ample and stunning supporting cast with a magnificent Trevor Howard , and the beautiful Claudine Auger and Romy Schneider, among others . Here appears uncredited prestigious secondaries , such as Gordon Jackson , Howard Vernon , Bernard Fresson and Gordon Jackson . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Henry Alekan , Terence Young's usual cameraman (Mayerling , Poppies are also flowers) . Enjoyable musical score by George Garvarentz in a James Bond style . The motion picture was professionaly directed by Terence Young , but contains some flaws and gaps , though tension at times, as well . The film was realized in his best period when he made the classic Bonds films (Dr No, From Russia with love and Thunderball). In fact Young directed actors who played in James Bond movies as Claudine Auger-Thunderball and Anthony Dawson-Dr. No and also performed Gert Frobe who made Goldfinger and Terence wanted his Dr. No leading lady Ursula Andress to star opposite Christopher Plummer . Rating : 6/10 : Acceptable and passable.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[21,24]},{"title":"Plummer's no Connery","rating":25,"date":"25 September 2004","review":"Terence Young directed the first two James Bond films and magnificently set the style of the series. He tries to bring some of that flamboyance to \"Triple Cross\", down to a title song which should have been sung by Shirley Bassey. But this wartime shaggy-dog espionage yarn resisted the 007 treatment and laid a big egg. <br><br>Compared with, say, \"Five Fingers\" or \"I Was Monty's Double\", \"Triple Cross\" is sluggish. It's a European co-production, always a difficult diplomatic problem, and the cast is a mini-United Nations: a Canadian as the secret agent, a British spy master, Germans, an Austrian love interest and Yul Brynner, whose origins (like those of the slab in \"2001\") were still a total mystery. <br><br>Christopher Plummer is sleek and sardonic as Eddie Chapman, a master safe cracker and in reality a working class charmer from North East England who had been a Guardsman; here he seems more of a toff, like Raffles or Bond. The bare bones of his story were true and incredible enough not to need polishing. <br><br>Eddie was in jail in the Channel Island of Jersey when the Germans occupied it in 1940 (by air, not as shown here from ships docked directly under Chapman's cell). He offered himself as a Nazi spy to get back to England. There he immediately re-ratted and got sent to Germany, where he trained other agents whom the British caught and turned. The unsuspecting Nazis were so pleased with his apparent perfidy that he was given the Iron Cross. Hence the film's title.<br><br>Brynner is a \"good German\" colonel, an anti-Nazi aristo who pays the price of involvement in the Hitler assassination plot. Among other heel-clickers who think they are controlling Chapman is Gert Frobe-- so that's what Goldfinger was up to before he became a card sharp in Miami. Trevor Howard sports an ugly little ginger beard. Romy Schneider, no longer the plump little ingenue of the Sissi trilogy, is sharp-jawed and wan as Eddie's aristocratic girlfriend. <br><br>Their lack of chemistry underscores Plummer's lack of sex appeal. He was losing the kudos he had gained as Baron von Trapp-- maybe he'd have felt more at ease in Brynner's part-- and his stellar status was as brief as Julie Andrews's. Eddie Chapman fared better. Given a blanket amnesty at the war's end, he married and lived long, prosperously and respectably.","user":"Oct","rank":[34,47]},{"title":"Aircraft ID for Zipper69","rating":7,"date":"26 April 2012","review":"Quite right, it is definitely not a German plane. The aircraft is a 1946 French SNCAC Martinet.<br><br>This was enjoyable to watch on a quiet evening at home. It was particularly interesting for me because I knew nothing of Edward Chapman's charmed life and wartime exploits so now I would like to know more about him and I'll be tempted to read up a bit and do some research about him.<br><br>The film was well made with good production values and direction. My complaint is with the editing which was off kilter at times. The story line was abrupt and frequently resulted in too many fast changes. For instance we needed to see how Edward Chapman got passage on the vessel to Lisbon.","user":"cook-gareth","rank":[11,13]}]
