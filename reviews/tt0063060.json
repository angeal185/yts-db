[{"title":"Great realism for it's day.","rating":9,"date":"10 June 2005","review":"Loosely based on the exploits of Red Adair, Hellfighters is a perfect vehicle for John Wayne. The characterizations are a bit overstated, but this was standard for the era, so I allow for that. And who could have picked a more appropriate love interest for the Duke than Vera Miles as a San Francisco Department Store heiress.<br><br>I thought Jim Hutton and Katherine Ross made a good offsetting couple to JW &amp; VM and Bruce Cabot, a long-time associate of Wayne's, an excellent comic element.<br><br>I think the thing that sold it for me was the reality of the fire scenes which I just marveled at until I saw that Red Adair was a technical adviser on the film. That and the knowledge that Wayne was all for reality as much as possible really made me a watch it anytime fan of this picture.<br><br>If one takes into account the decade in which the picture was made, it can be and is, for me at least, a very enjoyable film. I highly recommend it!","user":"muvphreek","rank":[33,38]},{"title":"John Wayne portrays a modern-day hero.","rating":8,"date":"17 February 2007","review":"When I first saw \"Hellfighters\" I was only about 13 years old. The movie certainly captivated me, in part because it seemed so realistic. Also, the slogan of the Buckman Company really appealed to me. \"Around the world, around the clock.\" This was a story about someone who really went the distance to help people.<br><br>This movie was so visually stunning that Popular Mechanics ran a cover story on the special effects, describing how a mixture of propane and diesel oil was used to make the fires, which were fed by underground pipes. It also explained that Red Adair really did use explosives to put out oil well fires, which many people found hard to believe.<br><br>This was a highly believable, present day performance by John Wayne, which is somewhat special in and of itself. There was only one brawl, which was all good fun, and we even get to see Mr. Wayne get a face full of what looks kind of like oil. (It was dyed water.) There is no heavy, moralistic message to this film, a minimum of flag waving, and watching it is just plain fun.","user":"scootwhoman","rank":[25,29]},{"title":"Wayne plays Chance Buckman in the mold or spirit of Red Adair","rating":9,"date":"22 May 2004","review":"This is a very entertaining film ... co-staring Jim Hutton, Katherine Ross &amp; Vera Miles. Some of the acting of Hutton &amp; Ross may have been less than one would expect. But the film should be seen keeping mind that this was years before the disaster films of the early seventies like The Poseidon Adventure &amp; The Towering Inferno. It is a fun watch as Buckman's crew travels the world putting out oil well fires while kindling a few fires of their own in the local women. It is fun to watch many of the fire-fighting scenes today and wonder how they pulled this off thirty years ago. It is very John Wayne as can be seen as some of his regulars turn up here, such as Bruce Cabot, Edward Faulkner who were part of his stable. Watch it and enjoy.","user":"nealmassey","rank":[23,28]}]
