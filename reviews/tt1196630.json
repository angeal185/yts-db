[{"title":"Military men back from Iraq after death of friend.","rating":3,"date":"28 April 2008","review":"This is an awful movie. I had high hopes going in and was completely let down when I watched this.<br><br>The acting was horrible and unconvincing. Every bit of dialog was forced and overly dramatic without a talent to deliver a convincing line.<br><br>I guess I was expecting a movie like Day Zero but it was a lot closer to Plan Nine From Outer Space. Just terrible.<br><br>Its a shame really because I have been hoping to see some movies about the soldiers and the things they are going through over in Iraq and Afganistan that will show the truth behind the bravery of our troops and the mission they are on.<br><br>This however is not the film. Good story. Very poorly executed.","user":"stoners-2","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Warning! Watch this movie at your own risk","rating":2,"date":"20 May 2008","review":"This movie was absolutely dreadful. Halfway thru the movie I was still waiting for it to begin. It was flat, dry, bland and unmoving. The acting was horrible, there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters,... the list goes on and on and on. Definitely an eye-closer and NOT an eye-opener, I mean how could you ask viewers to believe in a movie and take it seriously when clearly the actors don't believe in it themselves??? I just wanted it to END.<br><br>The only thing positive I have to say is that the storyline wasn't completely and utterly awful but it definitely could have been portrayed WAYYYYYY better.","user":"champagne115","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"look past the acting and see the film for what is it","rating":7,"date":"2 July 2008","review":"the acting wasn't too great but i think the overall film shows a good insight into what it is like for returning war veterans. you have to remember that mark o'brien was not an actor but a war veteran himself, which i think in some ways is better than having a proper actor for the part. i was slightly annoyed at the beginning of the movie as i thought the acting was terrible but once you get past that and actually open your eyes and see what the film is really about then you could appreciate it a lot more. its obviously not the greatest war film ever made but it is a true likeness of what really goes on once they come home, there are very few films where you see them coming to terms with what has happened and trying to adjust to their normal lives, instead they other films are all \"bang bang kill kill\". i think they had made a good effort in executing this film, and it was nice to see some emotion from mark o'brien rather than having an actor playing the part who has no idea what war is about.","user":"gingrat","rank":[5,10]}]
