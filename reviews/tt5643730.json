[{"title":"Here for it.","rating":7,"date":"8 July 2019","review":"Pretty mind-bendy indie film. Had fun just trying to figure out how all of this was going to add up! At times it's high concept isn't serviced by some of the budget limitations but it's worth checking out if you like bizarre parallel universe drama. Highly specific crowd!","user":"Graham-joey","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"A True Thriller","rating":9,"date":"13 June 2019","review":"I love psychological thrillers and this movie will not disappoint. The character development is and story is hits the mark. Two thumps up for me.","user":"buckeyealum-24568","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Great Psychological Thriller","rating":9,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"This is a great phychological thriller. The main character travels through her own life and the story keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. The production value is high and the special effects are excellent. Great directing too. Highly recommend this one!","user":"kjs1144","rank":[5,6]}]
