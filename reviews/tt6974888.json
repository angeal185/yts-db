[{"title":"ugh","rating":1,"date":"18 January 2019","review":"Really dfficult to get through this - i enjoy ballet and all kinds of ballet movies, but not this one. the drama/acting is just so below anything i have ever seen. juliette is a beautiful dancer, but she does very little dancing in the movie. the movie is trying too hard to be a story, and it just doesnt work. i seek out movies, old and new, with or about ballet, and this one falls way short. bad script. bad execution.","user":"shopping_again","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"What even is this script?","rating":1,"date":"22 January 2019","review":"This is almost as bad as The Room. Can't really fault the actors when this is what they had to work with.","user":"froggiekw","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"The Worst","rating":23,"date":"23 January 2019","review":"This movie is just a waste of time and eyesight?\nHow anyone would like it, is beyond me?\nThe WORST acting I have ever encountered in one film!\nNot one redeeming feature!\nLow budget and it looks as though they're reading cue cards.","user":"sandy-conners","rank":[6,7]}]
