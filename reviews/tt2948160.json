[{"title":"Cringe worthy and messy origin (?) story","rating":2,"date":"21 April 2018","review":"Ohh my this was really bad. And not in a good way, but in the \"I feel really sorry for these guys\" cringe worthy kind of way. <br><br>I am not sure if it supposed to be a pilot for a possible tv show or what the deal was but as a standalone movie this does not work at all.<br><br>Maybe if they had a decent editor there might have been some sort of coherence to the story, but as it stands its a mess. Guess its supposed to be an origin story? The byline here at IMDB that describes the movie is the ending. Getting there is confusing and NOT AT ALL scary in the very least bit.<br><br>The main antagonist, Cory Feldman, as a cross dressing bloodthirsty john was probably supposed to be scary (?) but comes across as a sad sack of you know what. Its a spoof on Buffalo Bill from silence of the lambs, but where he came across as disturbed in a disconcerting manner, Feldman's Bill just feels sad. You simply cant help feeling sorry for him and his mediocre personage. Is this really the best they could do for a bad guy?<br><br>Ohhh yes there is another guy in the shadows somewhere but I guess they saved him for the series. <br><br>To summarize, its not scary. Its incoherent and its all been done and seen before, the main protagonist is as forgettable as they come and the main antagonist is sad and embarrassing.<br><br>I really wanted to like this.. But its just not worth seeing. The poster is OK though.","user":"IamJustTellingyouWhatIthink","rank":[67,89]},{"title":"Bloody Awful","rating":1,"date":"24 April 2018","review":"Not even Corey and his band of merry 'Angels' creating multiple accounts to increase the overall score, can prevent this one sinking to the depths of Razzie award territory.<br><br>There is absolutely no originality in this movie what-so-ever, so i can't understand why the 10 star reviews are rating it as some kind of original 'cult classic' ?? *sarcasm*<br><br>Cinematography and art design is good, but it's totally wasted in a complete mish mash blade knockoff / buffalo bill wannabe story and script. Seriously, I kid you not, the final scene is an EXACT rip off from Blade. <br><br>It's hard to judge the acting, because the script is so cringe worthy! eg 'I'm gonna kill em all' - 'This is a city of sinners' *BLEURGH* The only decent stand out performance for me was the latino girl. At the other end of the spectrum was Feldman, it was as if the director said ' Ok Corey, I want you to offend every transvestite in America, show me what you got '<br><br>....

It's nothing special. I tried very hard to watch this movie. I read the reviews that were very positive and took a chance on it and really regretted my decision to watch it.<br><br>It has a lot of promise, the sound effects were spot on, the B roll was excellent but the movie really disappoints in the A roll, the acting and the editing. I became really frustrated with the way the A roll was shot for this movie. In the first 10 minutes of the movie they don't consider framing to be important, so things that need to be wide angled are shot closely and things that are shot closely are wide angled. It makes no artistic or functional sense. <br><br>There's a dialogue scene in the first 10 minutes where the main character is speaking to another influential character and the acting is just....poor. There is no tension, there is no real emotion being shown, it's like they told the main actor to act conflicted and he took that to mean act as if he was constipated! The line delivery in that conversation was so poor, the timing so bad, I wonder if the person who cast these roles even cared!<br><br>Then there's the editing. Oh God, the editing. In that same conversation they switch the A roll (primary shots) between the two characters for every line they speak. For roughly 3 minutes you have the camera going right-left, left-right, back and forth for every....single....line of dialogue, without any transition, it's almost all straight cuts. They do use L and J cuts but sparingly. If you're epileptic and can be triggered, I'd avoid this movie at all costs.<br><br>I'll try to watch it again, because I've never felt the need to write such a negative review of a movie before. I want to be fair to the people who worked on this movie, but from my first watch, it was terrible.","user":"ijazahmadaqsa","rank":[39,53]}]
