[{"title":"Great film, but who is the \"good guy\"?","rating":21,"date":"21 October 2002","review":"This is an excellent film and definitely one of Rod Taylor's best performances. Taylor is Curry, a mercenary commander in the Congo, during the Katanga secession. Jim Brown is his friend and number two, a US educated Congolese. Taylor plays Curry as a true mercenary of the period: ruthless, greedy, loyal to his comrades, and distrustful of his rivals and employers.<br><br>The film mixes two different periods of the civil wars in the Congo; the Katanga secession in 1960 and the Simba revolt in 1964. The original book is set squarely during the Katanga period and involves the Baluba war, not the Simba's. However both periods were exemplified by brutality on all sides. The film accurately portrays the enmity between the Katanga forces and the UN troops sent to intervene. It also accurately depicts the Belgian interests in Katanga.<br><br>Much like the train the mercenaries ride, the film starts out slow and builds up steam along the route. By the end, it's a runaway that comes crashing to its end. This is war and humanity at its worst, make no mistake. The closest I can come to finding a \"good guy\" is Jim Brown, the soldier who wants his country to be free and have its place in the modern world.<br><br>The Nazi character was based on an actual German mercenary in the Congo, Siegfried Mueller. Mueller was noted for wearing the Iron Cross, which he earned in the Second World War, on his uniform. The film makers changed it to a swastika for greater effect (I presume). There is a slight problem with the continuity of this character, as part way through the film, his voice is obviously dubbed by another actor. Presumably, this was due to sound problems and the unavailability of the actor to loop his lines (It sounds like Paul Frees).<br><br>All-in-all this is a great film; vastly superior to others of the genre, such as The Wild Geese and The Dogs of War. Just remember, war more often brings out the worst in humanity, rather than the best.","user":"grendelkhan","rank":[38,43]},{"title":"a wild ride","rating":14,"date":"14 October 2000","review":"Call it \"Dark of the Sun\" (the better title, I think) or \"The Mercenaries\"--but under any title this film moves fast. A great example of a guy's type of film where the editing, direction, and storyline all compliment one another in the effort towards a fast-paced action flick. It a raw, gritty, and satisfying action yarn. Rod Taylor is really choice in this role: he was easily in his best shape ever and utterly confident as the hardboiled mercenary leader. Jim Brown is fine as well as his sidekick. The two make a good combination together.<br><br>\"Dark of the Sun\" is also one of the more memorable films involving a train as a locus for the action. Train films have a charisma all their own, in my opinion, and this one is no exception. In this venue, a band of mercenaries utilizes a steam engine to blitz across the border into rebel-held territory. The story is set in South Africa and they been enlisted to to rescue citizens cut off by the revolt and also, to nab some diamonds for themselves, of course.<br><br>However, dont think that with this storyline its at all meatless in emotion values, or gratuituous in terms of its violence.<br><br>With regard to emotion, there are definitely some nice story elements and a chance for the actors to apply their skill. There are poignant little moments of humanness amid all the tumult. The characters suit, and have been devised (by the author Wilbur Smith) to correctly add balance and measure to the story. Its not all gunfire and explosions. The violence is kept within acceptable, old-school bounds and the focus is on heroism and loyalty rather than sadism.<br><br>\nThere is an interesting, thought-provoking subplot to the story that eventually factors into the conclusion of the movie. This thread comes from the fact that one of the mercenaries is an ex-Nazi. As a mercenary, he really \"enjoys his work\". But his views raise all sorts of disturbing questions about prejudice and hate and \"where to draw the line\"  for Rod Taylor, who, as leader of the mercenaries, has to set an example of ruthlessness. The two develop a vicious enmity and finally go at it 'mano a mano'. The end of the film is a surprise \"man learns better\" type of ending--but still quite satisfying.<br><br>The film overall is a better-than-average-quality product, and definitely a must-see guy-movie; its a 1960's action pic that does a better job of keeping you interested and absorbed than any twenty action pictures made more recently.<br><br>Believe it!","user":"whitecargo","rank":[30,34]},{"title":"Spectacular and violent motion picture about African wars and intervention of avaricious mercenaries","rating":7,"date":"14 October 2005","review":"This Africa-set picture concerns about some mercenaries (Rod Taylor, Jim Brown and Peter Carsten) hired by a Congo leader (Calvin Lockhart) to retrieve diamonds from a besieged city by the Simbas .

In fact , publicity for this picture declared that it was the first major motion picture to examine the Congo Rebellion which is aka the Congo Crisis aka the Congo Uprising .<br><br>Rod Taylor as the tough and two-fisted mercenary is top-notch . However , Clint Walker was the early choice for the lead Captain Bruce Curry role which in the end was cast with Rod Taylor . Ivette Mimieux is enticing and marvelous . This movie re-unites Rod Taylor with Yvette Mimieux eight years after they co-starred in 1960's \"The Time Machine\" . Furthermore , Jim Brown as the loyal and hunk pal is splendid and agreeable appearance by Kenneth Moore as drunken doctor . Special mention for Peter Carsten who interprets a first-rate villain . Original and thrilling Music by Jacques Loussier , including catching leitmotif . Edward Scaife cinematography is colorful and glittering , as it is splendidly reflected on the awesome jungle outdoors . Picture was lavishly produced by George Englund and well directed by Jack Cardiff , famous cameraman who photographed a lot of classic films . Rating : Above average . Very well worthwhile seeing .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[11,12]}]
