[{"title":"Wonderful","rating":9,"date":"6 March 2015","review":"I was really anxious to see this film since we loved the first one but, as always with sequels, I had low expectations. I was not disappointed in any way, shape or form. There are a lot of negative reviews by people who don't understand the human brain. A sequel will NEVER be the same as the first time you experienced a great film. You already know the characters, general story, etc. and there is no room for surprises. What you can hope for is that the journey is continued and presented in a manner that entertains and stays true to the first film. My wife and I discussed the film afterward and we both agreed that there were components of \"The Second\" that were actually better than the first film. We got to know most of the characters better, we got to see Indian culture in much more depth and the story was much more involved than the first film. Overall, I have to say that this sequel was the best I have ever seen. It stayed true to the characters and most importantly to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.","user":"indiedavid","rank":[78,91]},{"title":"It had big shoes to fill...","rating":9,"date":"2 March 2015","review":"...but managed pretty well.<br><br>There's a terrible risk with producing a sequel to a unique, quirky and successful movie. For want of a better clich√©, it's flogging a dead horse.<br><br>This film confronted that risk and trounced it soundly. I was wondering how the heck the producers would manage it, and went to the cinema expecting to be disappointed at best and mildly annoyed at worst. But no. I left uplifted, happy and feeling as though I had wasted neither the time nor the ticket price.<br><br>The characters continue to develop. New characters are introduced but are generally given the chance to have their own back stories as well. The film genuinely manages to give the impression of being a candid look at the lives of a disparate bunch of people - their interactions, hopes, fears, prejudices and so on are all laid bare for us, as before, yet somehow it still manages to feel fresh.<br><br>There are real, proper laughs, some fantastic one-liners and some very well done moments of pathos. It's beautifully filmed and the big set-pieces are a delight.<br><br>In short it steps into the large boots of its predecessor, and fills them nicely. Go and see it.","user":"yellowgixxer750","rank":[54,65]},{"title":"Warm, funny......and uplifting","rating":8,"date":"27 February 2015","review":"I took my mum to watch this as she is the same age as the characters so identifies with them and plot. But I equally found it a positive take on the opportunities in old age albeit in an exotic somewhat fantastical environment. It does acknowledge the downsides of getting old but sends the message that these will occur anyway.......but the good stuff can still happen to those who are open to it, whatever your age. <br><br>Fabulous casting with every character a joy to watch and all of whom seem to be enjoying themselves immensely. <br><br>Some reviewers seem to be disappointed that this film isn't ground breaking or 'gritty' enough with its plot or dialogue. But if you liked Best Exotic Marigold, this is like catching up with old friends who always make you smile. A gentle film told with humour and warmth.","user":"stephcl","rank":[43,51]}]
