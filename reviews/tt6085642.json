[{"title":"weird and direct","rating":7,"date":"16 April 2019","review":"This is supposed to be an adventure comedy, but you can as well add drama and neonoir on top of that. its a speedy and hilarious movie about two breaknecks, a girl of sleasy properties, and a drunk socalled looser, that meets in a bar one night. they dont want to befriend eachother, but serendipity will something else. its funny, its sharp in the linguism, it balances a fine line of benign adult romance and can stand as a good example of what all of us nonaddicts, non nympomaniacs and not too wealthy miss in our daily living.<br><br>the technical production are really average,so are the sound product, but the screenwriter has made an effort on making us pay attention, cause the dialouges and trialouges are hefty sharp and filled with nearly all the f-words in the OED. the actors who took the task of doing the deeds the characters does, are fenomenal in all its simplicity. the hole in the boiler room door are an excellent example of its crazy deeds.<br><br>so do the dios become a duo? well watch and you will surtainly learn, its worth a try,the grumpy old man thinks. this is fresh new age comedy at its best.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"Much much better than expected!","rating":9,"date":"17 April 2019","review":"I don't usually write reviews - this is my first one on IMDB.<br><br>Usually with smaller productions like this you have a ton of fake reviews and usually they're pretty dismal.<br><br>But I'm in Scotland, UK - and have just watched this movie.<br><br>And I have to give credit to the cast and crew! It's brilliant!!<br><br>Much better than expected. I've given it 9/10 and that's VERY high for me.<br><br>Mainly because of how hard they tried, the humour, the cast, and all done on a budget. But looked professional enough to be a mainstream movie.<br><br>It was very engrossing and addictive. I really could connect with the characters.<br><br>So do yourself a favour - and watch it!<br><br>It may not be to everyone's taste - but my GF &amp; I thought it was a lot of fun and we're in our 40's!","user":"markacutt","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Not even mildly humorous","rating":1,"date":"17 April 2019","review":"Made it 20 mins in and had to turn it off it was so bad. Not funny but very stupid and bland.\nI do not know what has happened to comedy in the last few years but really good comedies are seeming to be a thing of the past.\nIf i could have i would have rated this -5","user":"charvelstrat81","rank":[4,10]}]
