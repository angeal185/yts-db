[{"title":"Maleficent","rating":10,"date":"29 February 2020","review":"This movie is brilliant ans deserves a way higher rating than it has. The whole character of Maleficent is so intresting and the twist of the original story is really good.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[42,49]},{"title":"Maleficent? More like Magnificent!","rating":9,"date":"28 May 2014","review":"IGNORE THE TRAILER: GO SEE IT!<br><br>I saw this movie tonight with a friend and it was spectacular. Going in, I was excited as a life-long Disney fan but also expecting a somewhat cheesy good-vs-evil type of movie based on what I had seen in the trailer. I couldn't have been more wrong! Angelina Jolie delivers an amazing performance and makes a well-known, previously rather one- dimensional Disney villain relate-able and more sympathetic, while also managing to look like a convincing, gorgeous, magical creature.<br><br>The CGI is a tad heavy and a little freaky at times (such as the three coloured pixies/Aunts) but was used, in combination with some amazing sets, to create a fantastic world and creatures which were reminiscent of the beautiful and imaginative work in movies such as \"Hellboy 2\" and \"Pan's Labyrinth\". The effort by the art team here really helps to draw you into Maleficent's world at the beginning of the movie and makes you wish you were a kid growing up with this movie as fodder for your imagination.<br><br>Although Maleficent's character has been humanised in this re-telling, the story really emphasises that she isn't human at all, and explores the ins and outs of her life and how she relates to the humans she encounters.<br><br>The plot for this movie really fits into the current trend of exploring the anti-hero (Breaking Bad, Hannibal...) and shows that Disney is trying to break with its past depiction of characters being black and white, good or evil, etc.<br><br>I feel like I am gushing over this film, but as a Disney classic lover I have been truly impressed by what is sure to be a new favourite with kids and adults equally. I do expect some controversy over parts of the film but I won't discuss those here.","user":"foxfall","rank":[372,579]},{"title":"Stunning Revolutionary Game Changer in the Fairy Tale Genre","rating":10,"date":"31 May 2014","review":"This film is a TRUE fairy tale. It's dark. It's raw. And it's written from the dark, raw experience of women. <br><br>Maleficent is about what happens when your Prince turns into a Frog. It's the personal, inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most. It's about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself. It's message is that profound.<br><br>The critics complaining about this film want \"fairy tales\" to stay in the same \"one-love-fits-all\" mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find \"romantic\" love and marry a \"good\" Prince or Princess, and you will live \"happily ever after,\" safe from any pain or sorrow. But real life is a lot messier than that.<br><br>It's actually evidence of how rare it is to see women's unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it! <br><br>No matter. This film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster, no matter what the critics say.<br><br>And it's equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge, destroying their enemies and...roll credits. People are more complicated than THAT fairy tale we are sold in every other \"action\" and \"adventure\" film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado.<br><br>Sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that it's message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us. This is one such film.<br><br>Woolverton and Jolie have crafted a masterpiece.<br><br>Don't miss it.","user":"amyluna","rank":[364,575]}]
