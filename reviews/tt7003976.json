[{"title":"Actually really funny","rating":9,"date":"16 November 2019","review":"I just rented this on a whim cause I liked the poster. Surprisingly funny! Also surprisingly not very scary. The scares are more psychological and sometimes even funny themselves, which I guess they were going for? I'd definitely recommend if you want a fun, quick little indie film to watch. If you're looking for a straight horror, maybe choose something else","user":"tomwaits109","rank":[8,13]},{"title":"Like watching drama school stage theatre","rating":1,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"Only that crowd would call this well written, great acting, relatable, or art.\nI suggest IMDB create a new category for films like these. Not comedy, not horror.. not worth any more of my time describing. I want that time of my life back.","user":"fleshpixie","rank":[6,12]},{"title":"It gets better","rating":7,"date":"27 November 2019","review":"I nearly turned this off, but I'm glad I didn't. It's worth viewing and gets better as it goes on. A solid 7","user":"tj-208-953853","rank":[3,6]}]
