[{"title":"The stranger, the winter lady & the sisters of mercy","rating":9,"date":"9 September 2008","review":"Leonard Cohen's songs don't seem an ordinary choice for a western, but Robert Altman was no ordinary director, and his \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" was definitely not your traditional western. This film can be called a western because of its settings, but if anything, this is a \"revisionist western\" (à la Clint Eastwood's more recent \"Unforgiven\", a film that also subverted all the clichés and morales of this traditionally macho genre). And, more than anything, it's a love story.<br><br>John McCabe (Warren Beatty), charismatic but no so smart, sets up a whorehouse in the Old West. Constance Miller (Julie Christie), beautiful, strong and determined, soon arrives in town and offers to run the \"business\" and share the profits with McCabe. They start a tempestuous relationship while business thrives... but when a major corporation tries to buy McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller's enterprise, McCabe refuses to sell it. It's the beginning of his, her and the town's doom.<br><br>Even when exploring such a visual genre as the western (and visually the film is also very compelling, with great use of real snow and a beautifully shot \"duel\" on a bridge), Altman uses one of his most notorious trademarks: the overlapping dialogue, commonly used in ensembles but also wisely used in a more intimate, character-driven story like this. It works very well, although the 1 on 1 dialogues are deeply insightful themselves (the scene when Christie teaches a very young widow, played by Shelley Duvall, how she is supposed to behave in her new job, is brief, human, and dry). Beatty gives one of his most subtle, captivating performances, and Christie empowers Mrs. Miller with flesh and blood - she was definitely one of the most beautiful and intriguing actresses of her time, alongside Faye Dunaway and Jane Fonda, who set up a standard for beautiful, strong women who were much more than sheer eye candy. McCabe and Mrs. Miller's relationship is so fascinating that even the bang bang fans will be drawn into it and root for them to end together. <br><br>So, next time someone says Clint Eastwood reinvented the western with his masterpiece \"Unforgiven\", remember: 21 years before, Altman had experimented and succeeded on that with his \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\". Because love stories are more than kisses and happy endings, and westerns go beyond blood and testosterone.","user":"Benedict_Cumberbatch","rank":[55,61]},{"title":"Haunting, wintry Western","rating":10,"date":"20 April 2006","review":"The first thing to know about Robert Altman's revisionist Western \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" is that it takes place in Washington state. Typical Westerns are set in arid semi-deserts, full of blazing skies, blazing shotguns, and blazing tempers. Here, the dank, chilly Pacific Northwest permits, or rather demands, a different range of emotions: poignancy, regret, wintry melancholy. This film takes many risks, using Leonard Cohen's haunting ballads on the soundtrack and shooting scenes in very low light, but remarkably, everything coheres.<br><br>The film features Altman's trademark group scenes with overlapping dialogue, but not his typical interlocking plot lines. True to its title, the story centers on gambler and brothel owner John McCabe (Warren Beatty) and his shrewd business partner, Mrs. Constance Miller (Julie Christie). Still, supporting characters always hover at the edges, taking part in vignettes that underline the movie's themes and occasionally provide some humor. In this way, the movie avoids the chaos and confusion of some Altman films, while always remaining aware that the main characters are part of a larger community. It's a perfect balance: both clear and complex.<br><br>Still, \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" is more a study of place and character than a narrative drama. The small, isolated settlement of Presbyterian Church is newly built, but already seems to molder. Ironically, McCabe's brothel is the most \"civilized\" place in town: it is built quickly and even gets painted, while the church remains half-finished. No families, parents or children live in this bleak town, just a bunch of weary miners and whores who delude and distract themselves. They all have dreams, but barely know how to achieve them; for this reason, they're sympathetic and all too human. McCabe is a true anti-hero, a guy who thinks he's a slick, wisecracking gambler, but his jokes fall flat and he lacks common sense. Mrs. Miller seems confident and shameless, but she secretly uses opium to dispel the pain of living. <br><br>At times, the movie is well aware of how it subverts the clichés of the Western genre to reflect what would really have happened out West. For instance, there is a final shootout, but it arises because of a quarrel over businessthere are no Indians, no outlaws, and no sheriffs here! But \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" is much more than just a clever exercise in revisionism; it's never overtly satirical or mean-spirited. It keenly observes its world and then comments on it, overlaying everything with a delicate sense of poignancy and loss. This is the kind of film that stays with you, but not because of sharp dialogue, beautiful images, or showy performances. Greater than the sum of its parts, \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" is memorable for the pervasive but understated mood that runs through every frame, creating a truly atmospheric and humanistic film.","user":"marissas75","rank":[95,110]},{"title":"Cold And Poetic","rating":13,"date":"13 October 2006","review":"As a Western this film is fascinating for what it does not contain. There are no sweeping vistas of the Great Plains, no Indians, no cacti, no cowboy hats. There is no sheriff, no broiling sun, and no corny music. And unlike most Westerns, which are plot driven, \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" is less about plot than about the tone or mood of the frontier setting.<br><br>The film takes place in the Pacific Northwest. The weather is cold, cloudy, and inclement. You can hear the wind howling through tall evergreens. And Leonard Cohen's soft, poetic music accentuates the appropriately dreary visuals. In bucking cinematic tradition, therefore, this film deserves respect, because it is at least unusual, and perhaps even closer in some ways to the ambiance of life on the American frontier than our stereotyped notions, as depicted in typical John Wayne movies.<br><br>Not that the plot is unimportant. Warren Beatty plays John McCabe, a two-bit gambler who imports several prostitutes to a tiny town, in hopes of making money. Julie Christie plays Mrs. Miller, a prostitute with a head for business. She hears about McCabe's scheme, and approaches McCabe with an offer he can't refuse. Soon, the two are in business together, but complications ensue when word gets around that McCabe may be a gunslinger who has killed someone important. Mrs. Miller is clearly a symbol of the women's liberation movement, and the film's ending is interesting, in that context.<br><br>\"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" is a vintage Altman film, in that you can hear background chatter, in addition to the words of the main character. It's Altman's trademark of overlapping dialogue. The film's acting is fine. Both Beatty and Christie perform credibly in their roles.<br><br>The visuals have a turn-of-the-century look, with a soft, brownish hue. Costumes and production design are elaborate, and appear to be authentic. The film is very dark, so dark in some scenes that I could barely make out the outline of human figures. In those scenes, I think they went overboard with the ultra dim lighting.<br><br>Strictly atypical for the Western genre, \"McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller\" provides a pleasant change from cinematic stereotypes, and conveys a different perspective on life in the Old West. It's a quality production, one that has Robert Altman's directorial stamp all over it. In that sense, it's more like a cinematic painting than a story. And the painting communicates to the viewer that life on the American frontier was, at least in some places, cold and dreary, and had a quietly poetic quality to it.","user":"Lechuguilla","rank":[46,56]}]
