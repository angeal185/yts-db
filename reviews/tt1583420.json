[{"title":"Larry Crowne is like organic wholemeal ciabatta.","rating":8,"date":"8 July 2011","review":"While I was scrolling through the different titles available this weekend, I chanced upon \"Larry Crowne\". Looked it up on IMDb; not so good - an average of 5/10. Scroll down further and voil√†! Written by Tom Hanks himself, gotta see it. And I'm glad I did.<br><br>First, let me get the 'acting' part out of the way - It's good. Not mind-blowing, but most certainly good enough to be worth the US$9 weekend price of a movie ticket here in Singapore. The actors were good enough that I felt connected, and that's as good as it ever has to be.<br><br>As for the plot - nothing jaw-droppingly complicated and twisted, but then again neither was Forest Gump. And what a big success that movie proved to be. Don't expect character development to blow you away, but it did, at the very least, impress me.<br><br>Of course, if you walk into the theater expecting \"Harold &amp; Kumar\" or \"Chuck &amp; Larry\" humor, you would most definitely be sorely disappointed. Some others have criticized the film, saying that it had \"cheap laughs\" at best. Now that isn't necessarily true, because it all depends on what your expectations are.<br><br>So hear this - Larry Crowne isn't an all-out-LOL-fest, it's a wholesome film sprinkled with subtle, clever, and thoughtful humor.<br><br>In my opinion, this film was an excellent cross-section representation of the sandwiched American Middle-class - too rich to qualify for welfare, too poor to save any money. Most people (outside the United States) wouldn't know the America shown throughout this film - where folks are priced out of their own states, where they attend community colleges that aren't crazy over keg parties and crawling with bikini-straddling blonds, where students have to juggle work and school, where they might have to choose the former over the latter too often.<br><br>Hollywood glamorizes the American lifestyle each and every chance it gets, and this film provides a rare glimpse into the real America where most people reside.<br><br>All things considered, I would consider this film a feel-good movie, and there's much more to it than meets the eye. If you enjoyed Forest Gump, you'd most likely enjoy this one - even if the feel-goodness sets in slightly more subtly.<br><br>One final thing - I've never written a review for any movie before, ever. But I felt that the reviews here (as of 9th July 11) were doing Larry Crowne such injustice that I had to write this to balance it out.<br><br>Cheers.","user":"chenghonglim","rank":[217,263]},{"title":"An enjoyable way to spend an hour & a half.....","rating":7,"date":"4 July 2011","review":"To begin, I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers expected to see in this film. Larry Crowne is not a sizzling drama, a fast paced action movie, or an over-the-top comedy, &amp; it's not likely to win a bunch of Oscars for acting, screenplay or anything else for that matter. What is is, however, is a well written, fun movie that is fairly well acted &amp; very enjoyable. <br><br>The story does take a little bit to unfold, but does so in an organic way as not to give away too much too soon. The cast was well chosen &amp; I found the characters to have been well developed &amp; really fun people. Like most other films, there is certainly some creative license taken in that most everybody in it is funny and likable, which is what you want from a film like this. If only reality were filled with such great people, we should all be so lucky.<br><br>There are a few loose ends that may have been stitched up a bit better (per several of the reviews I have read) but I'm not sure that was necessary at all to the story. Moviegoers these days seem to have a need for everything to be spelled out to the Nth degree. If it wasn't critical for the story to unfold, it didn't make its way into the picture. There's something to be said for movies that leave a bit to the imagination for the viewer after the film is over, Keeps you thinking about it for awhile after you've left your seat.<br><br>I would watch it again. I left feeling good, with a smile on my face, which is what I was after upon deciding to watch it.","user":"Jake_III","rank":[111,144]},{"title":"Very good","rating":7,"date":"16 December 2011","review":"Why is the movie getting such a bad rap?? It's really a very charming film with wonderful acting by Hanks and Roberts as well as a very good support cast. While the plot itself is no great shakes, it's very interesting, especially in these times of disheavelment. I know a lot of people as well as critics don't like it. Amazed. It's a 'feel good' kind of movie with no villains. Maybe that's why it doesn't sell to the average movie goer who likes foul language, violence, special effects and fast paced editing with hand held cameras yet. This is an old fashioned movie that was made in the 50-60's, so it's not relevant today? Too bad. See this one and you won't be disappointed. AND DON'T READ THOSE UNKIND COMMENTS.","user":"ron-fernandez-pittsburgh","rank":[21,24]}]
