[{"title":"Not sure we watched the same movie.","rating":2,"date":"22 June 2019","review":"Not sure where the 8,9,and 10 star reviews came from. Trace Adkins seemed to be trying to channel Sam Elliot. The guy playing the villain pretty much chewed the scenery. The hero wasn't developed at all. The action was too little and was either filmed so close or so dark you couldn't see what was happening. Danny Trejo usually brings some life to the screen, he was nice and menacing, but dialogue sounded like he was reading it off cue cards. Flanery was probably the best part of the movie, but his character wasn't really developed either. There were some really strange decisions about what to film. Why closeups of people chewing food?","user":"cjfarley-65939","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"Ain't no cowboys riding across your screen any more...","rating":3,"date":"16 September 2019","review":"It's too bad really. Trace Atkins is so much better than this dark, dank poorly written, pathetically acted 'old west' saga. What plot there is came from a half dozen movies past. Everything from KungFu to Bonanza. (You'll recognize them.) Add this weakness to fact the entire presentation takes place at night and the result is a half baked struggling concoction that's never going to rise past sad. The three stars I gave it are: one for Trace, one for Danny and one for the horses! Save the popcorn and two hours of your life. Miss this one.","user":"wilsp-25512","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Silly Movie","rating":4,"date":"30 June 2019","review":"People who rate this movie above 5 haven't watch any Clint Eastwood, Charles Bronson....","user":"carlosferro36","rank":[17,20]}]
