[{"title":"none of the modern spoofs are masterpieces, this one is the best","rating":8,"date":"22 February 2006","review":"The days of Airplane and Naked Gun are over. Nowadays, we have the Scary Movies, Spy Hard, Date Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc....of all of these, Teen Movie is quite easily the best one. The point of spoofs and satires, to me, are not just to take familiar scenes and do something retarded and gross with them, but instead to actually make fun of all the things in the original movies that, while watching them, we all turned to our friends and said \"wait a minute, thats kind of stupid\". Teen Movie does this extremely well. How many of us lucky movie fans who saw She's All That had trouble seeing why everyone in the movie thought the lead actress was ugly just because she had glasses and a ponytail? She was still a babe! How many of these teen movies give the main lead actress a friend who is clearly into her, but she always seems to ignore any possibility of romance between them, instead pursuing another character and asking for her friend's help/advice? How many people thought the characters in Cruel Intentions were just sexually over the top to the point of being absurd? Teen Movie pokes great fun at all of these flaws. It is, unlike many other movies that attempt to be like it, a true satire, taking characters and not just doing stupid things with them, but exaggerating the traits of their serious counterparts and, when it comes down to it, just making fun of them. It has surprisingly good plot cohesion while still making fun of a variety of teen movies. I suppose the best way to distinguish this movie from all other modern spoofs is that this one is truly intelligent. Sure it has some stupid jokes, and toilet humor (that I admit I chuckled at in disgust like the diarrhea scene and the lesbian kiss with the old woman), but it also has some very clever jokes, like when is it appropriate to start a slow clap, why do these teen movies seem to only have one black character, and how silly is it that things slow down for emphasis when the beautiful female lead enters the room. Please, give this one a chance. If you've seen the other modern spoofs, I'm confident you will appreciate the noticeable and subtle differences between them and Teen Movie that make the latter much more enjoyable and palatable to watch.","user":"bdubstater4","rank":[196,215]},{"title":"Absolutely Hilarious!","rating":2,"date":"2 July 2004","review":"I believe that perhaps a lot of the criticisms of this film come from 90's-00 teens because THEY JUST DON'T GET IT! Most of the comedy in this film spoofs 1980's movies, with a few current barbs thrown in from more recent films. I am an 80's child, and I laughed so hard during this movie! I saw it with younger kids from the mid-to-late 90's, and they didn't get half of the jokes. The school cafeteria is named \"The Anthony Michael Dining Hall.\" The school is \"John Hughes High School.\" There are send-ups of \"Risky Business,\" \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\" \"Pretty In Pink,\" \"Sixteen Candles,\" and an absolutely priceless scene that spoofs \"The Breakfast Club,\" along with the original \"Breakfast Club\" principal, Richard Vernon, spouting almost exactly the same dialogue. Sure, there are much more recent films that are skewered, such as \"Varsity Blues,\" (which was HORRIBLE) and \"She's All That,\" (Which was EVEN WORSE.) There's an hilarious running gag spoofing \"Cruel Intentions,\" in which the slutty sister will stop at nothing to bed her brother, high school football hero Jake Wyler, who makes a bet with his team members that he can turn plain-jain, boy-hating Janie Griggs into the prom queen. Sex jokes and excrement jokes run rampant, all hilarious. Jamie Pressly, who you might remember from Jerry Springer's movie \"Ringmaster,\" is a total riot as head cheerleader Priscilla, who schemes to copy cheers from a rival school's all-black cheerleading squad, spoofing \"Bring It On.\" And the siamese twins who win Homecoming Queen(s) is an absolute riot, especially when homecoming king Jake has to share a dance with them and the band sings \"Put your heads on my shoulder....\" TOO FUNNY! A hilarious movie, especially if you're high or drunk, and you KNOW what they are spoofing.","user":"robc-11","rank":[133,158]},{"title":"Certainly not a bad film","rating":8,"date":"15 March 2005","review":"The IMDb ranking for this film is quite harsh in my opinion. OK, this film was never going to win an Oscar, but it's enjoyable throughout and has some very good laughs in it. I'm not a big fan of teen movies but I saw this and was impressed. It's light-hearted and not afraid to appear ridiculous (infact most of the time it does this deliberately) and it doesn't pretend to be \"Just another teen movie\", indeed it IS \"Not another teen movie\", it's a very enjoyable laugh at the expense of those films.<br><br>Don't expect your life to be changed by this film, but if you want simply a fun film to watch then you won't go far wrong seeing this one.","user":"theonlyidleft","rank":[136,162]}]
