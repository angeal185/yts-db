[{"title":"Bad, really bad","rating":1,"date":"4 May 2018","review":"From the start you can tell it's bad, the unconvincing acting, bad camera angles and horrible background music, like sandpaper on your skin.","user":"haematophiliac","rank":[6,11]},{"title":"Good - and I'm not the only one who think so","rating":7,"date":"4 May 2018","review":"Contrasting my opinion, (that this film is good) with the only other one here as of 5/4/18 that it is \"Bad, really bad\", I had to wonder was it only me? Was it only me who found the acting quite good, the storying interesting and suspenseful, the central idea and the story fresh enough to be truly enjoyable? Is this a film that is well worth watching - as I believe, or like \"sandpaper on your skin\" as that reviewer does. Was this a horror film only I could love? I am easily amused - reader beware. So I sought other opinions. I'm pleased to report that every outside review I could find (not just those listed here) agrees with me. All the reviews were positive and some were very positive. FWIW.","user":"joshua169","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"An entertaining paranormal themed movie","rating":7,"date":"27 January 2019","review":"I'm no movie critic expert, I just want a movie that's enjoyable to watch.\nAnd I usually find them by checking the reviews here. If the majority here rate a movie as 1,2 or 3, I watch it and it usually turns out a good movie.\nThis one, \"Within these Walls\" is no exception.\nIt's well put together, sets a great atmosphere, has pychological traits and at times surreal.\nThe acting is actually very good, especially the chick that plays the lead role.\nSo guys keep on giving us the 1,2 and 3 ratings.","user":"tonymarchei","rank":[2,3]}]
