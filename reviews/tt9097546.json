[{"title":"Garbage","rating":1,"date":"2 December 2018","review":"Thought I would give this movie a chance how wrong was I, complete and utter garbage. Dont bother.","user":"dilsonbelper","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Not scary, and very bad acting skills","rating":1,"date":"16 October 2018","review":"Movie really makes no sense. So why this year out of all the past years? Is it because they put the red light in? It's not a scary movie at all. The acting skills are beyond poor. The girl couldn't make herself drop 1 tear in any crying scene it was ridiculous. You're gonna make the crying sounds and gestures and not even get watery eyes or shed 1 tear? Sorry just very disappointing for a 2018 movie. I'll give 1 star and that's because the camera man was good.","user":"mypugs-32350","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Pretty awesome!","rating":10,"date":"7 November 2018","review":"I heard it was based on a true story ðŸ‘» Ghosts are real!","user":"elenasnewhome","rank":[2,18]}]
