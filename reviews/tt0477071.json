[{"title":"Piecing the Puzzle Together","rating":5,"date":"26 August 2007","review":"Relative newcomers, writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo, have concocted a testy little conundrum of a movie titled PREMONITION: whether the audience decides to step into their little nightmare or reject the premise that powerful emotions can drive the brain to peculiar directions of functioning will be the divisive break in acceptance of the film's premise. It is a fairly well done, thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast.<br><br>The Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and wife Linda (Sandra Bullock) buy their new home. Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls (Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness), a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim. Abruptly, Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend (Nia Long) and mother (Irene Ziegler) help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy. Yet Linda continues to 'relive' moments: one day Jim is dead the next he is alive, and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda's mind become clues to investigate information she doesn't want to know. She encounters a warped psychiatrist (Peter Stormare) and a possible 'other woman' in Jim's life (Amber Valletta), and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense, she learns about the possible 'why' of the mental state in which she is trapped.<br><br>The film has problems holding credibility, but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps. Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely, gains our empathy, and in the end the film works because of her. She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well. No, this is not a great movie, but it is a well-produced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination, and that is a good thing!

This could  be true with this movie as well, but I think it is the latter.  With many movies it is difficult to give a real review without giving  away much of what needs to be experienced first hand. That is  definitely the case with Premonition. So, first I will say that the  exhausting but powerful performance by Bullock was commendable. She was  in every single scene and the toll must have been heavy. She pulled it  off with gold stars.  The story was very unique. The dialogue did not stand out as  incredible, but you have to understand that this is almost a one woman  show. So far I see no flaws in the writing. I will watch it again, but  I think that most of the common confusions with the stories lines can  be explained.  The movie goes back and forth and you really need to pay attention and  have a great sense of time. It can be tricky to figure out if what is  happening is past, present or future. But if I could figure it outI am  sure anyone can.  Now, I want to discuss what this movie said to me. It may however be a  gateway to spoilers. So, if you plan on watching this movie and want to  do so with a fresh headdo not read any further. Just know that it is a  movie worth watching, you need to pay attention and definitely open  your mind.  Bullock's character in the film was a housewife with a husband and 2  daughters. She was a stay at home mom and it was clear that she had  been experiencing some depression prior to the news of her husband's  death. Through out the movie you go back and forth through moments when  her husband is dead and alive. After she learns of his death, she  experiences lapses in time when she seems to jump through timelines in  her life changing little experiences here and there that impact the  next timeline. Does that make sense? Anyway. She learns he was about to  have an affair and for a moment, decides she prefers him dead and that  even though she thinks she MAY be able to help avoid his death, she  wonders if she should even do that. We learn during these times that  their relationship was on its last breaths. They seem almost resentful  and bitter towards one another. She then has a conversation with a  clergyman and asks his opinion on what she can/should do. He basically  tells her that she needs to find something to fight forsomething to be  hopeful about. She finally decides that she wants to not only save her  husband, but their marriage. The night before she thinks he is going to  die she explains to him (in very little words  mostly tasteful and  romantic actions) that she wants their marriage to survive. They end up  making love. The next day she wakes up and it is the day he is to die.  She does what she can to stop it. She finally gets in touch with him on  his cell phone and tells him that she knows all about the affair and  that she doesn't care  she loves him. They exchange 'I loves yous' a  few times and she sees his car ahead of hers right at the spot he was  suppose to die. She tells him to turn around  thinking that will  change the course and he would survive. But when he does this, a gas  tanker hits his car  obviously killing him.  She wakes at the end, you know it is months later and she has a  pregnant belly.  She was able to changes the details in her life. She was able to  forgive her husband before he died; instead of him dying while they  both lived in contempt of one another. She was able to come to terms  with the possibility of his death; instead of the sudden shock. She was  able to allow him to spend some quality time with his children; knowing  she may not be able to stop his demise. And of course, she was able to  create another child  one that would have never existed otherwise. But  she was not able to change his ultimate fate. She was not able to stop  his death.  This is how the film spoke to me, being a depressed housewife and  mother whose marriage has seen better days We can change how we behave  and react in our lives right now. We can decide to make our lives  better for the moments we are in presently. We can make little changes  that can affect us forever. But we truly have little control over our  ultimate fate. And when it comes down to it  we all have the same  fate; death. It can come when we least expect it. It can come after a  long, hideous illness. But it will come. What we need to do is live our  lives for the happiness and love that sit in our paths right now. RIGHT  NOW.  Not a new theory. Nothing I am saying hasn't been heard a million times  before. But perhaps this needs to be drilled into our heads  though  movies, music, books, newswe need to start living the way we deep down  know we should. You want to know the meaning of life? This is it, my  friends. As simple as that. Life is short. Live, love, give and  appreciate. Period.  Most of us won't have the opportunities the characters had in this  movie. We need to take those opportunities now because instead of  waking up to yesterdaywe may not wake up at all.","user":"cheers-2","rank":[201,248]},{"title":"Much better than some reviewers have suggested","rating":8,"date":"23 March 2007","review":"I read some negative reviews of this movie before I went to see it. They were completely misguided! The movie is both intelligent and emotionally appealing. The actors are excellent. The literary symbols are consistent and right on the mark for the destination of this very well-made film. It is important to keep in mind that the movie is made on a time-line of contingencies, so that what would otherwise be inconsistent actually can make sense in light of changes introduced by the non-sequential experiences of Sandra Bullock's character. I suppose those looking for some kind of horror movie or brain-blank thriller (both of which can be enjoyable in their own light) might not have enjoyed it. But those looking for a narrative worth following, a message with some significance, and a generally well-made movie ought to see it.","user":"barrycreamer","rank":[222,314]}]
