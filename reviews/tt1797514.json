[{"title":"Unintentionally Hi-LAR-ious","rating":3,"date":"20 February 2013","review":"If you're in the right frame of mind, this movie can be quite enjoyable.<br><br>Obviously made for television with commercial breaks, it's funny when the music soars and the scene fades out at regular \"peak\" moments, only to resume two seconds later with everyone frozen in position. \"Action!\"<br><br>The characters are classic: the clever good girl, the tramp, the manipulative patriarch (in an ascot, no less,) the tipsy aunt, the mysterious foreigner, the taciturn hardbody with a past.<br><br>From the very beginning, you anticipate an Agatha Christie knockoff where the characters will perish one after another, but this is only \"Ten Little Indians\" if one of those snowbound characters had been adept at CPR and Heimlich and the victims simply required a Tylenol.<br><br>Finally, test your screen writing skills by trying to say the next line before the characters. You are correct, Sir! <br><br>This movie is fun, if you're in the proper mood. Consider a double bill with Charles Bronson in \"White Buffalo.\"","user":"cpoet","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"90 mins of my life I won't get back","rating":2,"date":"3 December 2019","review":"Who the hell gave this a rating of 5.5?\nI had high hopes for the \"Ten Little Indians\" format, but what we ended up with was a few \"clues\" leading to nowhere and a \"plot\" that wrapped itself up in knots and resolved itself with an unexpected (and completely inexplicable) confession.\nAbsolutely awful movie.\nDon't get sucked in by the inflated rating.","user":"davholsea-99002","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"It was Okay","rating":6,"date":"7 January 2020","review":"I kind of sort of liked it. It's a film that has been done before but maybe it had some new things which were interesting. Kind of funny in spots. A film that's not for everyone but it was alright if I give my honest assessment.","user":"joshmmmm","rank":[1,1]}]
