[{"title":"Surprisingly interesting indie picture...","rating":7,"date":"5 November 2019","review":"Evocative &amp; real, this was a surprisingly touching little film. The four leads were all good, but it was the female teacher / male pupil pairing that worked best for me. I really felt the teacher's struggle with the situation, life frustration &amp; the specific challenge she faces - and the pupil's simplistic, optimistic and earnest outlook on life.<br><br>Surprising &amp; touching. Well worth a viewing...","user":"Mark-hardy70","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"I like it","rating":13,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"...maybe because I am an 45 age old teacher and the situation seems to be not real eccentriic, maybe because the intersection of the two love stories is decent, maybe because the revelation is little predactible. Or for not bad acting. A hotel, two couples , beautiful cinematography, moral dilemmas and not awful end. Enough for a reasonable film who, without be memorable, has the virtue to be more than good.","user":"Kirpianuscus","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"You should watch this.","rating":8,"date":"3 November 2019","review":"Just happened to stumble on this absolute gem of a movie. Knew nothing about it so if you like something a little subdued but interesting and quite riveting, this is right up your street. Just wish I could find the song at the end credits.","user":"peckak","rank":[2,4]}]
