[{"title":"Fukrey : Amaxing Laugh Riot","rating":16,"date":"16 June 2013","review":"Fukrey, directed by Mrigdeep Singh Lamba and produced by Farhan Akhtar/Ritesh Sidhwani is set in the bylanes of East Delhi and is about four youngsters who want to make it big in life - but through adopting shortcuts !Cocky Hunny(Pulkit Samrat) and goofy Choocha(Varun Sharma) are two slackers who want to get into a reputed college with the solo intention of ditching classes and ogling at girls. Accounting-phobic Laali (Manjot Singh)wants to get into this college because her lady love. Wannabe musician,Zafar(Ali Fazal)needs funds for his father's treatment. All of them need fast buck and make a deal with a wicked hustler,Bholi Punjabi(Richa Chaddha) but their adventure misfires big time when Choocha flounders.In this bizarre twist of events, how the band of boys come out unscathed forms the crux of Fukrey.<br><br>Much of the film's sheen is derived from its situational humor and Mrigdeep Lamba , who made the horrendous Teen The Bhai, takes a giant leap in direction and writing with a sharp eye for details and getting the nuances of middle-class lifestyle of Delhi-ites right.The narrative is smooth and Lamba infuses some of the ROFL moments when Laali's bike parts are stolen each time outside the Gurudwara or Choocha escapes from Bholi's henchmen. Delhi Belly Dejavu !Choocha's inspection,oops I mean Inception-inspired dreams and Honey decoding them into a lottery number are sheer master-strokes !Ram Sampath's music is peppy and rustic with fresh voices and sync well with the proceedings. Ambarsariya, the traditional Punjabi folk song tops the list, with Sona Mohapatra's mellifluous renderings!<br><br>The camaraderie depicted between Honey and Choocha is the heart of the enterprise and will have you in splits. Pulkit is endearing as the jugaadu-dude of the gang.His mannerisms are very typical of a Delhi boy and he gets the act right. Manjot Singh makes a solid impact with his straight-faced humor and impeccable dialogue delivery.Ali Fazal bores a serious look on his face and does justice to his character.Varun Sharma as Choocha is the scene-stealer and the real surprise package. As a debutante , he exudes ample confidence.Richa Chaddha outshines our fukras with her superb act of Bholi Punjaban and once again proves her supreme talent.Priya Anand and Vishakha Singh are adequate, and don't get much of scope in this male-dominated fare.Pankaj Tripathi,as usual,is first-rate.<br><br>On the whole, Fukrey is indubitably a fresh wave of comedy with a fitting finale and a justified message to today's youth. I laughed and laughed , until my jaws ached and belly gave pangs.Worth a second time watch !<br><br>Rating : 4/5","user":"ahwaan_padhee","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"A Real Fun Time with just a Simple Plot!","rating":16,"date":"16 June 2013","review":"FUKREY is a college comedy directed by Mrigdeep Singh Lamba, starring Pulkit Samrat, Varun Sharma, Manoj Singh, Ali Fazal and Richa Chadda.<br><br>The film revolves around the lives of 4 guys; 3 of them are trying to get into college even though they never study, and the remaining one is trying to get money for his father. All of them are interested in Hunny and Choocha (Pulkit Samrat &amp; Varun Sharma)'s idea. Whenever Choocha dreams, Hunny is able to break that dream down to a lottery number, which always ends up winning.<br><br>Fukrey is an extremely interesting film under the 'Excel Entertainment' banner. It has a simple premise about a simple idea that goes wrong and how four people try to earn money just in order to go to a college or to help out a person in need. The jokes aren't as mindless as you think; they are simple and funny as well as related to the movie at the same time.<br><br>The acting in this movie is quite good. All the cast did a fantastic job with whatever role they had.<br><br>The songs are quite decent as well. They can be heard by both generations; 'Fukrey' and 'Beda Paar' is more for the modern whereas 'Ambarsariya' has a more simple tone that can be enjoyed by any crowd.<br><br>In the end, Fukrey is a simple comedy. It isn't GREAT to a point of praise, but it does well enough to make you laugh out loud and exit the cinema saying, 'I had a great time.'<br><br>FUKREY- 8.5/10","user":"andre_rox99","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Awesome movie. Worth watching...Best movie of the year !!","rating":10,"date":"16 June 2013","review":"This is awesome movie. Must watch movie. Best movie of the year till date. All the actors have made really great performance unlike so called star sons. Story line up is also new unlike typical Indian romantic stories. You won't feel bored during entire movie. Songs are OK but acting of all actors is mind blowing. They don't have big star cast but definitely better than big star cast movie. Movie has real Delhi locations, not funky sets. I would recommend to watch this movie. You will laugh a lot and every moment, you will think what happens next. People should realize that without big start cast also, a movie can be good.","user":"king5238","rank":[19,25]}]
