[{"title":"Affleck is phenomenal","rating":10,"date":"5 March 2020","review":"I have to say I really enjoyed this film. Affleck turns in possibly his greatest acting performance yet. The sports aspect was very well done but the emotional moments make the film. Definitely some hard scenes to watch at times. I think just as a basketball film it's quite solid, but the dramatic elements turn this into a great film. Highly recommend it!","user":"parkertc","rank":[103,136]},{"title":"Well acted, but predictable","rating":7,"date":"5 March 2020","review":"The dialog, acting, the characters, production value, etc. of this movie were excellent. It is a very honest representation of a man suffering with grief and alcoholism.<br><br>However, it suffers from being a retread of many other similar movies. You can trace the story arc easily and predict what will happen throughout. You also shouldn't go into this movie thinking it is a 'sports' movie, while basketball coaching serves as a vehicle of redemption, you could have written the same movie about someone taking a job teaching a class or working with special needs kids.<br><br>Finally, be warned that this is a very 'heavy' movie. There are a few lighter scenes, but &gt;80% of the movie is dramatic and played for an emotional punch.<br><br>Worth a watch for Affeck's performance.","user":"keithsealy","rank":[50,67]},{"title":"Ben Afflecks give the best performance of his career!","rating":10,"date":"5 March 2020","review":"Love or hate Ben, he's nothing short of amazing in this film.
