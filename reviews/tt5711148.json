[{"title":"A Love Story","rating":10,"date":"3 May 2018","review":"One of the most overlooked, exquisitely sensitive films of 2017 somehow slipped past all attention to awards. Based on a true story - published by Peter Turner in 1986 - of a late in life affair between screen icon Gloria Grahame and young actor Peter Turner - this film is radiantly beautiful. The screenplay adaptation is by Matt Greenhalgh and the sensitive direction is the work of Paul McGuigan.<br><br>The story covers the years 1979 - 1981. In 1979 Gloria Grahame (Annette Bening) is in England starring on stage in The Glass Menagerie and flirts with young actor Peter Turner (Jamie Bell), a bisexual young actor who falls under the spell of the femme fatale and despite the significant age difference they fall in love and begin and affair that is real, tender, and meaningful to both. As their mismatched romance waxes and wanes over time, events conspire to keep them in each other's lives even when it proves difficult and demanding. Ultimately, they find that they must each come to terms with whatever fate they face in the future whether they are together or apart. Grahame has breast cancer, a fact she conceals from Peter, and as she becomes close to Peter's family - mother Bella (Julie Walters), father Joe SR (Kenneth Cranham), and brother Joe Jr. (Stephen Graham) - she reveals her illness. On a trip to Los Angeles Gloria and Peter live together in Gloria's house trailer by the Pacific ocean, and are visited by Gloria's mother (Vanessa Redgrave) and sister Joy (Frances Barber) before they return to Peter's home in Liverpool. Gloria grows weaker and ultimately decides to return to her American physician for chemotherapy, escorted by one of her real sons Tim (Tom Brittney) from one of her four marriages, leaving Peter with love and concern that he care for his own family. The story is an affectionate, moving, and wryly humorous memoir of friendship, love, and stardom.<br><br>Oscar worthy performances by Bening, Bell, Walters and the entire cast make this film luminous - one that needs to be seen more than once to fully appreciate all the fine qualities - acting, photography, musical score, and direction. Highly recommended","user":"gradyharp","rank":[53,61]},{"title":"A love story with a kick in the gut , anyone?","rating":8,"date":"16 October 2017","review":"Frankly, I was upset when Annette Bening did such great work in 20th Century Women, which a few of you saw, and wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Once upon a time in movies, people related to one another in funny, sad and flawed human ways. That was 20th Century Women and Ms. Bening was pushed out at Oscar time by that beloved film icon nominated for yowling and singing painfully off key. A travesty. Booray for Hollywood. Assessing no blame to our nameless beloved scenery chewer because she can't help getting nominated for merely belching, with or without an accent. Now, having been swept away by Film Stars Don't Die In Liverpool, I'm not upset anymore. Ms Bening and Jamie Bell had me at \"How do I look?\" Tough cookie 50's film star Gloria Grahame stumbled through her life without much love or tenderness. With Jamie Bell's character Peter Turner, she not only found them but allowed them for a little while. I wanted to be there for every moment Gloria and much younger Peter were together. Throw in Julie Walters as Peter's mum, Vanessa Redgrave as Gloria's mom, and, no-slouch-she Frances Barber as Gloria's jealous toxic sister, and you've got a jewel of a film that may or may not get the recognition it deserves. But I've got my memories of the great Julie Walters, as Peter's Mum, crushing me simply saying \"time to let go of her, son,\" and Gloria with her life scars and Peter trying to make it all better for her. And he does. Hollywood can't hurt me or Gloria anymore. She has passed on and my illusions about talent and fine work being rewarded are gone. It could happen though that Ms. Bening, like Elizabeth Taylor before her, gets her Oscar one year and one film later. This time, if it happens, it will be given for this year's best performance by an actress. Because. trust me, it is.","user":"tkn10015","rank":[50,60]},{"title":"a 2017 hidden gem","rating":8,"date":"4 February 2018","review":"\"Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool\" (R, 1:45) is a romantic drama based on a couple of years in the life of Gloria Grahame, an Oscar winner and veteran of such classic films as \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Oklahoma\". Multiple Oscar-nominee Annette Bening plays Grahame, mostly during her time in Liverpool, England, where she met, had an affair with and was ultimately nursed through a serious illness by much younger man (and local Liverpool actor), Peter Turner (BAFTA Award winner Jamie Bell).<br><br>Peter meets Gloria when she moves into his apartment building. They quickly go from being neighbors to friends to lovers. Peter doesn't seem bothered by their age difference and Gloria seems to cherish it, but it inevitably leads to hurt feelings and conflict between them. Nevertheless, they work through the rough patches and Gloria becomes very friendly with Peter's family. When Gloria returns to Liverpool after living in New York for awhile and she is obviously ill, she reaches out to Peter and ends up staying with his family, who all pitch in to take care of the ailing actress. As Gloria's illness progresses and she begs Peter not to take her to any doctors or notify her adult children in the U.S., Peter and his family struggle to find the best way to help Gloria... while Peter deals with his lingering feelings for her.<br><br>\"Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool\" is a sweet and sad story of star-crossed lovers in an especially unusual May-December relationship. It's terrifically acted and creatively shot and edited. It's a wonder why this hidden gem didn't garner more accolades during the 2017-2018 movie awards season. \"A-\"","user":"dave-mcclain","rank":[31,36]}]
