[{"title":"Two can play that game","rating":7,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"Or maybe they can't ... it's as always rather complicated. And everything is not black and white as the movie shows. There is a lot of gray in here, though I guess you could argue it's the darker shades of grey. While the story itself is pretty simple, the characters are quite complex.<br><br>Overall this thriller will not be an easy watch. The struggles that are depicted in here are close to reality though. The combination of people and events may be a bit too coincidental for some, but it's a movie after all. And it the storylines of all characters work. Be it bleak or hopeful, whichever way it is you hope this goes - don't let the ending form your overall opinion one way or the other. More than decent with really good acting","user":"kosmasp","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Disturbing, yet entertaining.","rating":9,"date":"9 October 2019","review":"As a bit of a squeamish person, some sequences in this film were uncomfortable to watch, but the plot and characters had me on the edge of my seat. As my first introduction to Icelandic cinema, this was definitely a solid watch.","user":"zakarylewill","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Very slow,but Islandic cinema noire at it's best!!!","rating":8,"date":"29 August 2019","review":"Very slow,but Islandic cinema noire at it's best!!!\nVery,very nice drama/thriller.Moody,dark,clever and tragic...\nSuperb acting.Recommended for older audience.","user":"tchitouniaram","rank":[1,2]}]
