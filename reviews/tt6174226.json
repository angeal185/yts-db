[{"title":"Suspenseful and Clever","rating":10,"date":"17 August 2018","review":"The story draws you into the cast of crazy characters living in the same apartment complex. Who hasn't lived with \"interesting \" and sometimes annoying neighbors who are somewhat like family. The acting Veteran actors Jack McGee, Sally Kirkland and Martin Cove are superb. The remaining cast intertwine their quirky characters into a funny yet suspenseful story of found money. You start rooting for these guys to benefit from happenstance . Who hasn't thought they deserve good luck as much as the corporate world??","user":"pdchessare","rank":[5,9]}]
