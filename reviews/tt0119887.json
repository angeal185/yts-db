[{"title":"Fast Paced Comedy","rating":14,"date":"14 May 1999","review":"I found this movie Very enjoyable. I was laughing out loud and I really enjoyed the humor of it. If you are familiar with John Leguizamo's comedy and you are a fan of it this movie is a must see. It is a take on the novel \"The Most Dangerous Game\" and it focuses on the event's Pestario (Leguizamo) must overcome such as the fact the Scottish mob is after him, a crazy German nazi, Gustav, (Jeffrey Jones) is hunting him, and Gustav's homosexual son ,Himmel (Edoardo Ballerini), who is obsessed with \"snakes\", is obsessed with him too! This comedy moves fast yet is highly enjoyable!","user":"Ashlee-3","rank":[18,28]},{"title":"Destroy this movie before you ever watch it.","rating":17,"date":"17 July 2004","review":"I watched \"The Pest\" at a friend's sleepover and let me tell you,it was excruciatingly painful to get through the first half-an-hour.Thankfully I was tired and fell asleep through most of it. I found this movie to be disgusting,crude,obnoxious,idiotic and I wanted to gauge my eyes out. It surprised me that John Leguizamo...A man capable of better roles and a good actor...would degrade himself so much by playing the part of The Pest.<br><br>Pest is right...This movie is a pest and it should definitely be terminated.....0.00001/10","user":"xx_succubus_xx","rank":[10,16]},{"title":"insulting to even an idiot's intelligence!","rating":23,"date":"23 August 2004","review":"If you're like me, you like all movies as long as you can find some redeeming qualities in it. The Pest is devoid of anything resembling quality, it's the equivalent of going to Big Lots, which is a pretty good store usually, and buying their interpretation of a cardiac defibrillator! Lenguizamo, who can be good at times, doesn't even deserve to spelled correctly with his performance in this Razzie winner! Trashy, tacky and tasteless all describe this movie, however if you're drunk or stoned or something, it'll probably help purge the contaminants in your stomach or bowels and then provide either the DVD leaflet/VHS box to help clean up afterward, but the ultimate irony will be that that would symbolize the money you wasted on it!","user":"masschaos","rank":[8,13]}]
