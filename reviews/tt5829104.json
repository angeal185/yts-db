[{"title":"10 star ratings are ridiculous and wrong","rating":1,"date":"22 March 2019","review":"I like all kinds of movies. They don't have to be cinematic masterpieces or high budget films for me to enjoy them.<br><br>That being said, this was horrible. These 10 star \"rave\" reviews have to be fake. If somebody actually did like this boring, plodding mess it should still only rate a 6, maybe 7, tops.<br><br>Nothing was interesting, yet I stuck it out until the end thinking maybe it was a reverse horror flick, in that the body of the movie was bad and the ending would somewhat redeem it (as opposed to the more prominent opposite). Nope.<br><br>The only thing I could think of that was remotely positive was Pancho Moler's performance. I mean, I like Dylan Walsh, but even his character didn't interest me.<br><br>No, this was lame, predictable (which generally isn't bad in itself but didn't help this movie's case), and pointless to watch. The ending was just as bad as the rest of the film, and felt like it was going to continue for a couple more minutes yet just stopped. I couldn't even handle watching it straight through, I had to break it up between two nights of viewing.<br><br>So don't believe the 10 star ratings. If, by some miraculous universal paradox you did find this entertaining, then it still wouldn't be worth a 10. I absolutely hate coming on here and seeing those kinds of pandering reviews since they ruin any kind of fair representation. Which is usually when I decide to add my own.<br><br>That's why this is here. To let you know that this boring sludge fest is nowhere near close to being a \"perfect horror masterpiece\" no matter what your tastes are.","user":"chanfan304","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"fake reviews cheap cheap cheap","rating":2,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"Why this as been done a million times, maybe to compete with the new Halloween movie coming out in October..... but this movie is super cheap the way its filmed with zero budget,,, and its very very very lame.....<br><br>Avoid even for a free watch.","user":"kaefab","rank":[15,22]},{"title":"Could Have Been a Gem","rating":1,"date":"31 December 2019","review":"The plot had so much potential, and the set design/mis√© en scene matched perfectly from what you'd expect from a Halloween-themed movie. Even on a poor budget, the film's editing, screenplay/script, and acting fail to justify the film's existence. Characters are not just paper thin- but fail to match common stereotypes- rendering them completely un relatable and unlikeable. The first half had a decent pace, but the second half of the film drags on and on. Unfortunately, this film is not so bad that it's good- it's simply unwatchable. Unless you are very young and easily frightened, you are better off rewatching a horror classic instead of this sad attempt at B-Movie Horror.","user":"chriswh-714-766798","rank":[3,3]}]
