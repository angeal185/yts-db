[{"title":"The Best Theatrical Re-Telling of the Arthurian Legend--Largely Based on Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1485)","rating":10,"date":"30 May 2007","review":"Late in the film, King Arthur is about to fight his last battle against his estranged son Mordred. His kingdom of Camelot is falling. The knights of the Round Table are disbanding. Guinevere has entered a convent. In short, Arthur's world is collapsing. He rides to the nunnery to see Guinevere for the last time. And there, she produces the ancient timeless object hidden beneath some linen: the sword Excalibur, still gleaming, still magical, still potent to fight in the battle that Arthur cannot win. He sheathes Excalibur, and, in full knightly regalia rides with his remaining loyal knights through the English countryside, their pennants and banners flying in the wind. The fortissimo chorus of Carmina Burana accompanies their ride in perfect harmony, chanting the lyrics from the medieval poem \"O Fortuna\". This is the stuff of legend...<br><br>Artistic treatments of the Arthurian legends date back to illuminated codices from the Middle Ages. Thereafter the first, and one of the greatest, attempts to bring the stories into a novelistic form was written in the late 1400's by a knight, Sir Thomas Malory, entitled La Morte d'Arthur (\"The Death of Arthur\") which is probably the most famous work of English letters proceeding Chaucer but before Shakespeare. Even later renditions include T.H. White's \"The Once and Future King\". By the 20th century, theatrical adaptations began appearing as well, including \"Knights of the Round Table\" (1953), Disney's \"The Sword in the Stone\" (1963), and the musical \"Camelot\" by Lerner and Lowe which was possibly the most popular rendition of the story before \"Excalibur\". These last renditions, although they have their appeal, cannot measure up to the movie \"Excalibur\" which was largely based upon Malory's original tome.<br><br>Many here have detailed very well the merits of the film, and since most people know the story, I will keep this short. The reason why this is the best of the Arthurian-based films is its imagery and its dedication to the original Arthurian myths. The entire look of the film, which I have not seen in a movie since, reeks of Medieval Legend. The lush forests, the huge castles, and the glittering swords give a visual and dream-like reality. This is NOT how it was in the Middle Ages. This is how people in the Middle Ages would have liked it to have been, which is the entire point of the Arthurian myths. The filmmakers of Excalibur understood that myth is about dreams.<br><br>Several moments in the film are inspired directly from Malory and earlier Medieval codices. For example, several Medieval illuminated manuscripts feature the hand of the Lady of the Lake bestowing the sword Excalibur to Arthur. Strangely this episode, which becomes an important theme throughout Excalibur, is lacking from other theatrical versions and yet it is central to the original myth. Another is the strange rhetoric that Arthur and the land are one, and when Arthur becomes ill, the land of his kingdom becomes barren. This concept was a widely held belief in the Middle Ages: that the sovereign was essentially married to the kingdom.<br><br>Another aspect that makes this film outstanding is the portrayal of Merlin by Nicol Williamson. This was possibly the best Merlin ever to come to the large screen. Some of the most humorous moments of the film occur with Merlin. Instead of being the absent-minded wizard of \"The Sword in the Stone\", he is the last of the Druids, a race giving way to Medieval Christians. Worth the price of admission. It is sad that he obtained very little recognition for this portrayal.<br><br>The fact is, a viewer either experiences \"aesthetic arrest\" with Excalibur, or he or she doesn't. If the scenes when the knights go riding through countryside with their pennants flying behind them doesn't give you the shivers, this is not and will never be your kind of movie. If Malory had lived to see this film, he would have been awed and proud. Malory gave Arthur to the world, and Excalibur gave Arthur back to Malory.","user":"classicalsteve","rank":[184,198]},{"title":"A beautiful translation of a legend into sound and light.","rating":10,"date":"11 October 1999","review":"More people telling me their favourite film, have named Excalibur, than have chosen any other film.  People tend to feel strongly about this film.  I can remember that when it came out, a film magazine reviewed it twice, feeling that it had to do so, since its two reviewers had such contrasting opinions. In short, people who don't adore it, tend to hate it.<br><br>Those who hate it have failed to understand something very important: that it is set in the land of dreams.  Excalibur makes no attempt to be realistic.  It is the film of a legend, and it tries to create a world of legend, and it succeeds.  Once one has realised that this is not the real world, then the film is internally consistent and works splendidly. Merlin, towards the end of the film, even says the line \"Your love brought me back to where you are: in the land of dreams.\"  If anything, this makes the film even more tragic, because all of Arthur's sufferings have been not for his world, but for ours.<br><br>The Arthurian legend is probably the world's best legend.  It has been told a thousand different ways, but is so strong, that no retelling can harm it. The story is familiar, but this telling of it is not.  The screen starts blank, with the distant drums of Seigfried's Funeral March playing, and after a few captions, the curtain lifts to reveal a stunning opening sequence with horses breathing fire-lit breath into the night air, as Uther's men do battle with those of the Duke of Cornwall.  The armour is dark, and greenish, and the movements slow, making this seem like a scene of battling dinosaurs.  It is brutal and bloody.  These are the dark ages. This is the time of chaos from which Arthur's kingdom must come.  Into the scene, in a cloud of swirling fog, comes a figure who will be present throughout the film, ageless and mysterious, Nicol Williamson's Merlin, whose voice carries over the din.<br><br>I remember how suddenly I found myself immersed in this world when I first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it.  Allow yourself to become  involved with the film, and you will be rewarded.<br><br>The costumes are magnificent.  Special mention must go to the shining armour, and Morgana's (Helen Mirren) ever-increasingly impressive series of outfits.  The music is stirring (it uses \"O Fortuna\" from Carima Burana before this had become a cliche).  The acting is theatrical and good. Each of these characters is on a stage, to be examined.  This is not a film of quiet intimate moments.  It is a legend, and legends are public.<br><br>Excalibur distills the Arthurian legends into one film of watchable length very cleverly.  At several points during it, a clever cut tells the viewer that several years have passed.  Single characters represent many things. At one point Sir Percival represents all the questknights, at another Morgana is all that is evil.  In telling the story quickly, the film uses simple direct speeches.  In one scene, Arthur visits Guinevere, the woman he loved deeply, whom he hasn't seen for many years.  He spends just a minute in her company and leaves, and yet the speech he delivers to her is so complete and so moving, that you do not feel robbed.  He says his piece and leaves, needing to say no more.<br><br>It is true that the film has dated a little.  Some of the hair-styles and special effects are not quite what they would be today, and the quality of the dubbing is not first-rate, but this is still stunning.  Everything seems to have come together to help this film look and sound good.  The skies over the castles are spectacular, the Irish landscape (it was shot there) looks the part.  The visual imagination and daring to have Camelot as a castle literally made from silver, and to have Arthur's final battle fought in fog with a huge blood red sunset behind it, makes this a feast for the eye.<br><br>I am writing about one of my all-time favourite films.  I cry every time I see the land burst into blossom as a reborn Arthur gallops through it, and I feel the heavy warmth of tragedy as he is carried off towards the sunset to the Isle of Avalon.  I am spoiling nothing by telling you that Arthur dies in the end.  Everyone knows that he dies in the end.  The whole film is leading to that moment.  When you reach the end of the film, ask yourself this: where did he go wrong?  What was it he did to lose his wife, his son, his sister, his best friend, all his questknights, Merlin, his kingdom, his life - everything he held dear?<br><br>\"The one god of the many comes to drive out the many gods.  The spirits of wood and stone grow silent.  It is a time for men and their ways.\"  That's it.","user":"Lloyd-23","rank":[191,221]},{"title":"Excalibur. The best of the King Arthur films.","rating":10,"date":"16 February 2006","review":"Excalibur is a truly atmospheric film. It has the ability to take you back to the time it depicts, without using sentimentality or rose tinted spectacles. Having seen the film numerous times, I still get more out of it with every viewing. It certainly seemed to start many careers on the right path and many of the actors are very well known now. My only sadness is that Paul Geoffrey and Nigel Terry, two of the main character actors, seem not to have become such household names. They both stand out in the film and to my mind have made it what it is, brilliant. Great direction, production, photography and music. King Arthur himself would have been proud of it.","user":"sinicolson","rank":[70,80]}]
