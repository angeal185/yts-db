[{"title":"What the hell did everyone expect?","rating":8,"date":"12 March 2011","review":"I go to Transformers to see Megan Fox look good and giant robots fight. I went to Battle: LA to see the American military and aliens shoot and blow each other up.<br><br>A lot of people seem to think this was supposed to be some kind of District 9 movie. Sure, if you evaluate it on the same scale as District 9, it sucks. But if you just wanted to see an awesome action movie, this is the movie for you.<br><br>Yes, there was no character development. Yes, the plot is a zillion years old. So what? I wasn't looking for those things. Now and then, it's nice to go see a movie with mindless action. 100% of this movie was mindless action. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy it. Compare it to a movie like The Losers or A-Team where the movie tries to build up some characters and an original plot and fail miserably.<br><br>I would also like to add that there are some nice original points to this movie. For once, the aliens are not infallible. I get pretty tired of the oh-lawd-we-hit-them-with-nukes-and-didn't-kill-one type of alien movie popularized by Independence Day. There is no magic bullet in this movie, the aliens die from bullets, and you have to take out the command and control center to do serious damage (hey, just like in a conventional land war!). I also thought this movie was a decent depiction of a realistic military response to an alien attack. Everyone mobilizes, surrounds the landing zone, and combat ensues when they are attacked. Pretty simple.<br><br>I also see complaints about camera style. I honestly didn't even notice. It didn't seem any worse than, say, Black Hawk Down.<br><br>So I give this movie 8/10 on my action movie scale. If you were planning on evaluating it on the thoughtful-work-of-art scale, you must not have seen any of the trailers.","user":"imdb96","rank":[136,184]},{"title":"Black Hawk Down... with Aliens","rating":7,"date":"13 March 2011","review":"I saw this film the other day, and I actually really liked it. It was exactly what I expected (maybe a little better). If you want to watch a really well thought out film with lots of character development and interesting subplots this is not the film for you. If you want to watch a bunch of U.S. Marines beat the tar out of invading spacefreaks, then this is the film for you. From when we first encounter the aliens to sometime in the middle, the movie is a nonstop thrill ride. Stuff explodes, aliens get splattered, humans get burned by lasers. In case you didn't already suspect, this film is very violent. Although there isn't a lot of blood, there are certainly a lot of deaths. The action is unpredictable and zany. One minute everyone will be walking somewhere between point A and B, the next, they're crouching behind burned out cars and houses as aliens pour ungodly hellfire onto them from above. The special effects were also quite good, with the exception of a couple bad animations here and there. That being said, the movie suffers when it slows down. The dialogue is poorly written, and delivered decently, but not well. Aaron Eckhart however did a wonderful job as a stony faced marine staff sergeant who keeps a cool head when under fire. Most of the storyline is pretty standard war movie/alien invasion stuff. You know, when after a bunch of fighting everyone gets discouraged and then the leader gives a big motivational speech and the inspirational music plays and everyone feels heroic. <br><br>So don't expect a masterpiece of modern cinema, expect alien guts and lots of shooting and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.","user":"Jharrison-22","rank":[308,471]},{"title":"Action burger with cheese please.","rating":10,"date":"13 July 2011","review":"Action, aliens, guns, explosions, cheese and some 'kick ass' special effects, sounds like the perfect movie evening in to me.<br><br>It starts you off in the action and keeps it coming right to end, which is unlike many action movies that have been coming out lately.<br><br>The character interaction and register is about the level you would expect along with the onslaught of one liners and cheese.<br><br>This movie's current IMDb rating of 5.9 is to be honest some what of a joke and should not put you off watching it at all. I would however suggest you go and watch something else if you feel like being intellectually stimulated.<br><br>I believe that people are turning their noses up to this movie on grounds that should not be brought up when reviewing this genre.<br><br>I also believe that people aren't generally stupid and if you watch Battle Los Angeles you'll know what kind of movie to expect and you won't be disappointed","user":"d-beckwith","rank":[102,157]}]
