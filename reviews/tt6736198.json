[{"title":"Another Replica","rating":2,"date":"6 October 2019","review":"Promising Idea but the movie turned at the end as a replica of \"How to be single\".\nDeveloping Idea but bad finishing really i thought there was more to it.<br><br>Not meeting my expectations really.","user":"boudybob","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"The main character is horrible","rating":3,"date":"8 October 2019","review":"I found the main character to be absolutely horrible and self centred. This is not a feel good love story, this is a spoilt brat who has no clue about the lives of those around her.","user":"jacinta-c-curtis","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Super Película para Chicas!","rating":9,"date":"16 December 2019","review":"THIS MOVIE MADE ME SHOUT OUT LOUD, DANCE, SCREAM IN FRUSTRATION, AND AT THE END I WAS SINGING ALONG WITH THE WOMEN, THE GREAT LYRICS TO \"A QUIÉN LE IMPORTA\"!!!\nHonestly, I don't understand why there's such a low average rating. Maybe it has to do with the cultural barrier that's built in to this type of movie.\nAs someone who is \"MexicoAmericana\", (like the song by La Santa Cecilia), I completely get the movie.\nWhenever I was in Mexico, whether for school or to visit, the only important thing appeared to be the possibility of my marriage.\nThis movie hits all the pressure points that a woman faces. Especially in a culture where at 30 you are considered left on shelf.\nWatch it, and you can enjoy it beyond expectations, if you remember that not every culture is American.","user":"susiq-318","rank":[5,6]}]
