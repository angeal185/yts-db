[{"title":"Mis-Advertised","rating":8,"date":"28 March 2009","review":"I love this film. It shows the very human struggle to survive after they've been knocked from the top of the food chain. It blends medieval mythology with a modern era breathlessly. Definitely an original take on Man vs Dragon. Now to get this straight, this is a film about Humans, not about Dragons. The dragons merely supply the unique reason for the apocalypse. This is a film about the post-apocalypse, not the apocalypse. It's not about skies full of Dragons turning worldwide armed forces into ash on an epic scale. It's not about Dragons setting the world, quite literally, on fire. It's about after all that's happened.<br><br>Which is a shame this was advertised as a film about Dragons burning all life as we know it. Of course, everyone goes in expecting to see 90 minutes of Dragons destroying everything. If this had been advertised as a more human film about after these Dragons have completely wasted everything, I really think this could've been seen as a good film. It unfortunately set expectations high in the wrong sort of viewers by a mind-blowingly epic trailer.<br><br>Christian Bale, Gerard Butler and Matthew McConaughey all deliver their role superbly, and the script isn't as bad as it's made out to be either. The effects were great and the Dragons do look pretty realistic, to the point I almost believed this was a documentary. Okay, so there are some plot holes, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to fill those in yourself. I mean, does everything have to be explained so obviously? The only reason this film gets 4 stars and not 5 is because, being a film about human struggle, it could've done with a bit more character development. Other than that, it's a deeply entertaining, well-acted, suspenseful film.<br><br>Don't knock it before you see it for yourself.","user":"PyroSikTh","rank":[94,102]},{"title":"Pretty Straightforward Stuff","rating":7,"date":"24 May 2006","review":"This was a bit different than one expected. There was no nonsense, no tongue-in-cheek humor or special-effects just for the sake of it: this was simply a humans vs. dragons story taking place in the future. No laughs and nothing hokey, which is what I expected. They played it straight, simply as a fight story between the two parties.<br><br>Yes, there were credibility problems with the story but overall, it was good escapist adventure. The dragons were realistic-looking, the scenery dreary but the story interesting and intense in spots.<br><br>I wouldn't buy it, but I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a night of adventure on film. You could do a whole lot worse, especially with two young actors who have arrived as stars: Christian Bale and Matthew McConnaughey.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[127,153]},{"title":"Ashes to Ashes!","rating":4,"date":"4 October 2002","review":"The usual quota of \"surface reviews\" here. Are we living in a totally one-dimensional society these days that has no time now for unsupported fantasy - \"Just the facts Ma'am, Just the facts!\"<br><br>We have here an adult fairytale no less, yet what do I read (and I include paid media critics here) but absurd negative comments such as \"How did McConaughey and his intrepid band of marines come up with the fuel to cross the atlantic?\"  \"Why are the children seemingly so well fed in a period of pestilence?\"  \"Where does the seemingly limitless fuel come from?\" etc etc. Who CARES?????????   this is a DRAGON fantasy for God sakes! Someone want to set up a Government enquiry as to why fairies speak English? the possibility that Humpty Dumpty had a middle-ear infection? Perhaps the Easter Bunny has some communicable diseases that he should be tested for?<br><br>Ok REIGN OF FIRE is not up there with other sci-fi classics and the marketing department should be answering charges of misrepresentation for that poster showing an aerial armada of helicopters battling the fire-breathing beasties over central London - that just never happens but I gotta tell you REIGN OF FIRE has some of the greatest set designs and cinematography I have ever seen. It is extremely interesting to LOOK at from a technical viewpoint. The dragons themselves make the least interesting contribution to the film and except for the final confrontation which almost \"gets there\" they are really secondary to the film itself. If you were to actually record the amount of dragon \"screen time\" I doubt it would be 18 minutes....and most of them are not far off laughable. Curiously, that aspect alone should have wrecked it for me...but it didn't - I found the \"wasteland asharamas\" totally credible and involving.<br><br>I thought the much maligned McConaughey's role not without interest. Still haven't worked out whether or not \"Mad Matt\" was supposed to be some hybrid creation - part Patton, part Maximus, part Captain Ahab or just all \"grunt.\" He certainly handled his last solo flight with flair and derring-do. Basil Rathbone himself never swung a meaner sword! Christian Bale replete with his best \"know wot I mean\" brit accent was pretty good I thought as Quinn the reluctant colony leader. What I couldn't believe is how the years have treated Izabella Scorupco the most beautiful Bond girl I ever saw (GOLDENEYE). I realise that a decade of fighting dragons and close-contact aeriel combat takes a lot out of a girl but she looked 20 years older! I would never have recognised her. Totally shattered an illusion I have maintained of her. If she said \"Boys with Toys\" now, I think I'd need a double vodka-martini!<br><br>But I digress.  The dragon fx were just so-so, they saved the best for last sensibly. The script had its moments but the production work and set-design were simply awesome...SO good in fact, the rest of the film really didn't matter! Overall I would bequeath it a 6.9. Worth seeing if one is prepared to watch it in the spirit that it was made.","user":"uds3","rank":[188,244]}]
