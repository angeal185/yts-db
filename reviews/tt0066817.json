[{"title":"Terrific film","rating":6,"date":"6 May 2001","review":"It is unfortunate that this film receives such little comment, as compared to \"Mary Poppins\", for the simple fact that most people DO compare it to \"Mary Poppins\" amd really, it stands alone.<br><br>The story is quite original and well done. The actors are all wonderful, and Angela Lansbury, to me, will always be Miss Price. David Tomlinson is also wonderful as Professor Browne. The children are also great, with the standout being the youngest one, Paul. He has so many funny moments in this movie.<br><br>Again, the Sherman Brothers lend their creative song-writing talents to this film with excellent results. \"The Age of Not Believing\" is wonderful, as is \"Eglantine\", \"The Beautiful Briny\" and the superb \"Portobello Road\" number. The animation scenes are also great and imaginative.<br><br>This is certainly an enjoyable film on many counts, and should be remembered just as so many of the other Disney classics. It should also be seen in the recently restored version, which runs over two hours. The story is more fluent in that version, and the songs are intact, for the most part. A great movie.","user":"laffinsal","rank":[57,58]},{"title":"One of the few films so good...","rating":10,"date":"11 November 2005","review":"This is one of the few films where I consider the film rendition to be an improvement on the original book. The story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are without a doubt exceptional. I adored the cyclical rendition of 'The old home guard' and the charming 'Portobello Road', a great combination of early animation + real actors techniques which, though dated do not detract from the charm of the piece. The background of the Second World War worked well and was not omitted as the film got under way, which so often happens in 'evacuee' stories.<br><br>An often far too underrated film, it produces no end to enjoyment for people of all ages. The performances from the actors are exceptionally well done and the entire text is neatly tied together and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!","user":"Localfreak","rank":[43,46]},{"title":"Simply Magical","rating":13,"date":"13 June 2003","review":"Bedknobs and Broomsticks is one of many movies that has always been with me, in my heart and memory from the time that I was old enough to focus my eyes on a television screen. Although it was already an \"old\" movie by the time I was able to watch it, Bedknobs and Broomsticks completely enchanted me. People here who say that the movie would not hold the attention of a young child are mistaken. I must have watched this movie dozens of times between the ages of 1 and 10 and every time I watched it all the way though, intensely engrossed through every scene. There are a handful of movies that hold very fond places in my childhood memories, this is one of them. It is a wonderful movie, and even now I still find the story charming. Angela Lansbury stars as Miss Price, a widow who is studying witchcraft through a correspondence course during World War II. She grumpily agrees to let three children board at her home in the country to keep them safe from the air raids going on in London. After the three children discover that Miss Price is an apprentice witch, they are swept up into a magical adventure on a traveling bed along with Miss Price and Professor Brown, the headmaster of the College of Witchcraft. The thing I like best about this movie, is that the magic never stops as the children along with the two adults journey to London, the Island of Naboomboo, Naboomboo Lagoon and Portabello Road. The children are treated to a marvelous adventure, flying through the skies on a bed, swimming underwater in a tropical lagoon, watching a football game played by animals and finally helping out in the war when Miss Price enchants a museum full of ancient suits of armor with the magic words, \"Traguna, Macoities, Tracorum Satis De.\" The songs in the movie may be your typical musical-stock, but I challenge anyone to not tap their toes during \"Portabello Road\", or to not get \"Englentine\" stuck in their head. They just add another element of fun and enjoyment to an already delightful movie. The movie is well worth watching, and suitable for any child. Even today's children will find delight in the cartoon/human relations and the spectacular ending sequence were empty suits of armor are brought to life to fight for the good guys. I consider this movie a timeless classic that shouldn't be passed up.","user":"syllavus","rank":[42,46]}]
