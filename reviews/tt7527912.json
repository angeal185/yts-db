[{"title":"Loved It","rating":9,"date":"4 September 2019","review":"A unique, real story style documentary of Lillo Brancato's life. The documentary includes raw and unfiltered testimonies from not only Lillo's friends and family but also from his enemies and people that surrounded him. A interesting guy with a unique story. An unfortunate wasted talent. Sad to see.","user":"carlos886","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Phenomenal Documentary","rating":10,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"I was a big fan of A Bronx Tale and was under the impression this would be a one sided, pro-Lillo Brancato documentary. However, the director did a phenomenal job blending both sides of the story through the eyes of people close to Lillo as well as NYPD who responded to the fatal night. I definitely would recommend this documentary!","user":"brianaaceti","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"C+","rating":7,"date":"10 March 2019","review":"The description of this documentary claims it is examining temptations and struggles of young celebrities on the rise to fame. Um. It focuses on actor Lillo Brancato exclusively. In a nutshell, it mostly focuses on how he got the part in The Bronx Tale, his drug addiction which led to a cop being murdered and how still today New York cops still hate him.\nWhich is fine because it was an interesting story but after watching the one hour and six minute documentary I googled the story and found out he went to prison for 8 1/2 years and I'm not sure they even told us that part. Maybe it was passively mentioned so I didn't even realize it.\nEven though I found the documentary interesting and I enjoyed watching it I'm still not entirely sure what it's supposed to be about. Kind of jumped all over the place and just gave me bits and pieces of random information.","user":"shondarae_99","rank":[20,22]}]
