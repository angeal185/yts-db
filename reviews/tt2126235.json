[{"title":"It has its rewards... if you are patient","rating":3,"date":"3 June 2017","review":"For the first thirty or so minutes of \"Collide\", the movie was shaping up to be a pretty boring and familiar experience for me. The movie was taking far too much time to set up the situation, and what was unfolding was nothing I hadn't seen before in many other movies.<br><br>But then after those first thirty minutes, the movie takes a sudden turn and becomes surprisingly enjoyable. All of a sudden the movie starts delivering action and suspense, and this material is pretty well accomplished. It is basically one scene after another of the protagonist fighting off and/or fleeing his pursuers, but I have to admit that the action is choreographed and directed in a way that I was pretty pumped up. The movie also looks quite eye-catching, with its good photography and its German backdrop that adds some freshness. <br><br>Eventually, however, the movie makes a stumble near the very end, with how Anthony Hopkins' drug lord character is finally dealt with, namely in a manner that happens off-screen, cheating the viewer of seeing him directly getting his just desserts. <br><br>Despite this disappointing ending, and the first drab thirty minutes, I think the movie does deliver enough entertainment in the end. It's not a classic action movie by any means because of those aforementioned problems, but it keeps your attention if you stick with it.","user":"Wizard-8","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"I enjoyed this movie","rating":7,"date":"25 December 2016","review":"I am no real movie reviewer, just a guy who loves watching good movies!<br><br>My first ever review for any IMDb movie. But I have been here looking up movies for years.<br><br>I seen some reviewers underrate this. Which is why I decided to let people know what an average everyday person thinks of this movie It deserves more credit than what it has been given.<br><br>I myself thoroughly enjoyed it! The time went by too fast. I could not keep my eyes off the screen lots of action, fantastic car chases. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. <br><br>I love Ben Kingsley and Anthony Hopkins and to see both in one movie at the same time was very exciting and For Myself personally thought they did very well. Nicholas Hoult did a great job too.<br><br>I know this is no major movie like silence of the lambs. But it was still a fantastic action movie. If you like action movies don't let this one pass you by! It's very entertaining. I look forward to watching this again one day. 7.5/10","user":"headink","rank":[96,125]},{"title":"Nothing all that original or fresh but it is fun to watch and a good way to spend a few hours","rating":7,"date":"1 May 2017","review":"\"I need $200,000. You can have the rest. I just need you yo do something for me.\" Casey Stein (Hoult) has gotten mixed up in a drug smuggling ring and his girlfriend has been taken. Now he is stuck between kingpins Hagen (Hopkins) and Geran (Kingsley) with only one option. Steal from one and ask for help from the other. Casey is now left to wonder if he chose wisely. This is a pretty intense and exciting movie but at the same time really toes the line between generic and original. There is enough in here to make it seem fresh and new and keeps you interested, while at the same time being just predictable enough for you to stay one step ahead of the movie. Normally that's a bad thing, but when it comes to these B action movies excitement is the goal. This one does have that. Overall, nothing all that original or fresh but it is fun to watch and a good way to spend a few hours. I give this a solid B.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[13,15]}]
