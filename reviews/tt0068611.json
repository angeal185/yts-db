[{"title":"One Potato...Two Potato...Three Potato...Four","rating":5,"date":"5 March 2001","review":"The grand man of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, directs this dark film about a man that kills women with neckties with relish, aplomb, and an atypical grimness.  The story is typical Hitch as an innocent man is pushed into a world of intrigue around him as everyone believes him to be the necktie killer.  Jon Finch plays the innocent with earnestness and is quite good in his role.  The rest of the cast is very effective as well. Hithcock, however, is the real star with his camera. Although much of the film is nothing more than tried and true material, Alfred Hitchcock makes the mundane spectacular with his camera and some great shots and spaces of silence.  The scene where a girl coming back from lunch is awesome as we the audience are made to wait what seems an eternity for her to discover what has taken place since she left.  The scene of the camera moving in and out of the house of the killer is also wonderful, as is the scene with the killer in the potato truck.  That scene is easily the most suspenseful of the entire film.  The film is particularly dark for Hitchcock as a women is raped rather abruptly(for lack of a better word) showing naked breasts and genuine terror.  To counter-balance the more lurid aspects of the film is a subplot story of a police inspector, played with charm by Alec McCowen, whose wife constantly feeds him nothing but gourmet meals that sound and look quite horrible!  These scenes are so funny and charming!  A good thriller from the master of suspense!","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[85,98]},{"title":"A truly engaging nail-biter!","rating":8,"date":"7 January 2003","review":"Hitchcock did one hell of a job!  I was planning on watching this movie just for about 30 minutes before going to sleep and was gonna finish watching it the next day, but instead I was so engaged that I couldn't stop watching and stayed awake the whole 2 hours.  I loved the irony of the actual rapist having no clues pointing to him and the innocent man having all clues pointing to him.  The scene involving the rapist in the back of the truck, rummaging through a sack of potatoes (and that's all I'll reveal) is classic suspense.  I also loved how Hitchcock left the rape scenes (excluding the first one) up to the imagination.  There is a great shot where one of the victims is being raped and we don't even hear any off-screen yells or screams.  The camera simply tracks backwards down a staircase and out the front door, where people walk by minding their own business, ignorant to the evil that's being committed a floor above.  Any amateurish director would've went for true shock value and showed all the rape scenes in explicit detail. We don't call Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing.  The scene is still quite haunting.  In horror and suspense, what you don't see can be a lot more frightening than what you do see, since the imagination is a powerful thing.  The last line of the movie should go down in history.  It had me bawling with laughter!  Just that one line gave perfect closure to this wonderful film.    <br><br>My score:  8 (out of 10)","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[51,58]},{"title":"Hitch back in London","rating":29,"date":"29 February 2004","review":"After 30 years in the USA and after the disappointments of \"Torn Curtain\" (1966) and \"Topaz\" (1969), Alfred Hitchcock came back to his native Britain for this film -written by Anthony Shaffer from a novel by Arthur La Bern.<br><br>\"Frenzy\" is his penultimate movie, certainly the best one of his last period. The way the Master films is very classic -deliberately old fashioned; at the same time all the charachters are very modern -they belong to a more and more decadent and neurotic London. <br><br>Almost from the beginning we know who the criminal is, and Hitchcock enjoys himself in showing how the man tries to escape and how he betrays people. Director's trademarks are also back in force: suspense (a lot!) and humour -more sarcastic and sharper than ever. <br><br>For \"Frenzy\" the Master doesn't get movie stars, instead he chooses local stage actors. In my opinion he does this because, first, he wants the film to be very English. Furthermore, he wants this time more ordinary faces for making the story more shocking (with famous actors in the main roles, the plot -in a certain way- could be identified mostly with them and loose strength, instead Hitchcock avoids that \"paradox\"...).<br><br>Maybe \"Frenzy\" is not an unforgettable masterpiece like \"Psycho\", \"Vertigo\", \"Birds\" or many other works. But it is a great movie indeed.","user":"michelerealini","rank":[107,128]}]
