[{"title":"Partly made where I grew up!","rating":28,"date":"28 September 2003","review":"Just a little note to add some local interest to this excellent movie - the action takes place at an unnamed Air Sea Rescue station - I am sure most of the interior shots were taken in the studios but the exteriors are from Felixstowe where there really was a real life A/S Rescue station during WWII.   The German guns were actually at Landguard Fort, which was just around the spit or point from the A/S Rescue station itself.  The shots of the railroad station are likewise taken in what was then Felixstowe Town station.  The area where the A/S Rescue station was is now part of the Container Port and I am sure nothing remains of the hangars and docks, but Landguard Fort is still there, minus the guns.","user":"offbeatlen-1","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Good film but poor process work","rating":7,"date":"11 December 2010","review":"As far as i am aware there are really only 2 British films about Air-Sea rescue ,this film and For Those In Peril.I believe that the earlier film is superior not just because it stars David Farrar who is far better than Anthony Steel,but it has a far more realistic feel.This film is hurt by its inept process work.Nearly every scene featuring Anthony Steel and most of those in the dinghy are clearly shot either on a sound stage or the studio tank and in my view this severely detracts from the realistic feel the film needs to impart.Also at the climax we have the rather strange effect of the boat being shrouded in fog and then in a blazing sun.Quite odd.We have all the usual banter of the lower ranks with some fine performances from a great cast.Incidentally Bonar Cellano who plays an airman and Michael Balfour ,an engineer,were great friends in real life.Alas they had a car crash,Balfour survived but Cellano did not/A real loss to the British cinema as he had made his home here.","user":"malcolmgsw","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Plucked From The Briny Deep","rating":8,"date":"7 July 2006","review":"The Sea Shall Not Have Them is a gritty realistic war film from the United Kingdom about the men who serve on air sea rescue duty. No glamor here, just professional men doing a job, rescuing air crews down in the North Sea and English Channel. Good location photography on an old Royal Air Force rescue station give a ring of authenticity.<br><br>Four men are on a rubber dinghy in the North Sea after being shot down by a German fighter. Two of those men are Michael Redgrave and Dirk Bogarde. Redgrave is in fact got a briefcase with him containing plans for the V-2 rockets with which the British public shortly became acquainted with.<br><br>A rescue sea craft commanded by Anthony Steel is sent to find them and pick them up. Not so easy with a prevailing mist over the North Sea. The dinghy is also in fact drifting east towards the occupied Netherlands. <br><br>The best scenes in the film are on the dinghy. I'm reminded a bit of Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat which was an ocean liner compared to what our RAF airmen are occupying. Best acting honors go to Dirk Bogarde as the Flight Sergeant who is trying to keep the famous British stiff upper lip, but is losing out fast to the numbness and cold. It's bad for all of them in the ocean, check the scene in which Bogarde's fingers are so numb, he can't even light a rescue flare.<br><br>The Sea Shall Not Have Them is one superb piece of film making and even those who don't like war pictures will like this one very much.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[16,20]}]
