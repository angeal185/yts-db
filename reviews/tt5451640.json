[{"title":"Noooooo!","rating":2,"date":"29 July 2017","review":"Jeff's wife (Sydney Black) is unfaithful. Jeff (Chris Degner) contracts killers. Tom Sizemore was a minor role as a in between man whose role seems to have been forced into the script to get the film past an hour. The film is told with an after the fact investigation as a subplot. It looks like they made the film, cut it up into little snippets and tossed them up into the air, splicing things together at random. It was not chronological and it didn't make the film any better or a mystery with the jumble. Robert LaSardo type cast as a bad guy. Acting and characters were bad.<br><br>Guide: F-words. Sex. No nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Very different but I LOVE THAT!","rating":10,"date":"19 November 2018","review":"This was such a different movie then others. loved the editing style.
