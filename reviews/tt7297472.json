[{"title":"Not only for the fans.","rating":8,"date":"1 April 2019","review":"Even if you're not really into rap music this biography is worth watching. The life story of Biggie, as short as it was, is something that had to be told, just to understand how it all started and how it ended with his death. The rivalry in the Hip Hop scene between East Coast and West Coast started because of Tupac Shakur and Biggie and just got blown out of porpotion by the press that thrives on scandals like this. Unfortunately it ended up with two talented rappers getting killed. This biography contains alot of archived footage but also some unseen scenes and interviews that are interesting to listen to. Biggie, as well as Tupac, left a hole in the lives of their friends, family and fans so this biography is a nice tribute to him for them.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[1,1]}]
