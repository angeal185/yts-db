[{"title":"An impressive film school exercise but not quite a movie","rating":6,"date":"16 June 2014","review":"\"Visually arresting, methodically paced, and almost perfectly executed\" says another review here. I agree and would add well-acted, produced, and directed. But it still doesn't quite make it as a movie, something with a real story that is effectively delivered and is more than the sum of its strung-together parts. Each scene is fine, but they just seem like a string of episodes rather than a coherent story. One has trouble getting the point and is left somewhat confused and unsatisfied, with the final twist more baffling than impactive. I would say that the words \"inchoate\" and even \"incoherent\" can't help but come to mind regarding the film.<br><br>Before you write me off as someone who only likes nice linear films where EVERYTHING is made perfectly clear and who can't handle anything unusual, abstract, metaphoric, or different in any way, compare \"Signal\" to \"Dark City\", the recent \"Under the Skin\", and even \"THX 1138\" (which BTW arguably has a lot of similarities to this one).<br><br>Meanwhile, for examples of films that have similar problems as \"Signal\", see \"Citadel\" (2012), \"Critical Nexus\" (2013), and even \"Shuttle\" (2008) or \"Blair Witch Project\". I would argue, tho', that most of these, whatever their flaws, are probably more effective at delivering a real story than \"Signal\". MEANWHILE, to see what a low-budget independent sci-fi movie CAN be, see \"Moon\" (2009).<br><br>Finally, I was just reading a review of \"Signal\" in which the reviewer mentions another director who started out with a middling low-budget sci-fi film and has gone on to bigger and better accomplishments; he sees similar potential in the director of \"Signal\". I fully agree. Again, I think \"Signal\" was impressive and well worth seeing, but doesn't quite make it to the level of a real and effective movie.","user":"robert-blau","rank":[266,365]},{"title":"Visually arresting, methodically paced, and almost perfectly executed.","rating":8,"date":"12 June 2014","review":"In an age where astronomical budgets and A-list stars dominate the sci-fi genre, it's seldom that you stumble across a film that strives to present a unique vision, which is precisely why The Signal is such a breath of fresh air. Directed by Will Eubank (who co-wrote the screenplay), the film follows a trio of MIT students on a cross-country trip, who decide to take a detour in order to track down and expose a malicious hacker.<br><br>Arriving at their destination, Nic (Brenton Thwaites) and Jonah (Beau Knapp) find nothing but an abandoned, dilapidated structure. Haley (Olivia Cooke) elects to stay behind as the guys explore the grounds, and just as they stumble across evidence that they're on the right track, all hell breaks loose. <br><br>Sometime later, Nic awakens with no memory of the previous events and finds himself trapped in a sterile, hospital-like facility, with Haley in a coma and Jonah held in an adjacent cell. His only point of contact is Damon (Laurence Fishburne), the facility's mysterious administrator, who dons a Hazmat suit for every interaction. Damon wants to know everything about \"the signal\" - how Nic found it, when he first discovered it - but Nic's only concern is getting himself and his companions to safety.<br><br>It's nearly impossible to reveal anything more about the plot without wandering into spoiler territory, but rest assured that The Signal does a spectacular job of approaching familiar sci-fi tropes from a completely different perspective. Eubank spent eight years as a cinematographer, and his experience behind the camera combined with his indie-film sensibilities allow him to get a tremendous amount of mileage out of The Signal's $4 million budget.<br><br>The pacing is slow and methodical, doling out information in carefully measured doses before opening the floodgates during the film's climax. There are some truly breathtaking visuals here, particularly during the third act, with one jaw-dropping shot after another building toward a startling mindfuck of a conclusion. If you're tired of seeing Hollywood continually rehashing the same boring sci-fi stories with new faces and bigger budgets, then track down The Signal and buy yourself a ticket. You won't be sorry.<br><br>-- Brent Hankins","user":"BrentHankins","rank":[259,369]},{"title":"Simply not delivering","rating":5,"date":"24 July 2014","review":"Actually I think, it could have been something good, but it was not.<br><br>It tried to be something special, but it failed.<br><br>It has absolutely no message, no emotions no nothing, although the director tried to create the illusion of them.<br><br>Overused slow motion, unrelated scenes cut randomly together, theatrical music totally misplaced and overused, unfinished characters and their background stories, no suspension at all, mixing up styles, like he didn't know if he wants to make a \"found-camera\" movie, a road trip movie, an alien abduction movie, a romantic movie, a Bonnie and Clyde kind of movie or something else.
