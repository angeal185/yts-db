[{"title":"Not a horror movie,neither a comedy one","rating":7,"date":"19 November 2015","review":"While I was watching this movie there was plenty of times I couldn't stop myself from thinking I was watching an anime. The way the guys walk, talk, that sniffing thing. At first, I thought the writer went bananas when wrote the script but in the middle of the story I got it. It has gore and remind me of Hostel at the beginning, then it turns out to be more like Scary Movie. The story is good, you need to know that it is an anime like story to enjoy it. So wait for something like uni- dimensional characters, unnecessary dialogs and somethings with a bad explication. I laugh with some of the butcher boys, I guess they wanted to do them as crazy guys who are mad in all the possible ways, their personalities reminded me of Deadpool. The dog and that dress, they're comic. The end is like what theÂ…? I loved and hated this movie. That so bad that it's good thing. A good movie to relax if you relax with screams and this kind of crap. It has a lot of potential, it just was not used so well. PS: English is my second language, so I'm sorry about any mistakes.","user":"nayara-g-oliveira","rank":[31,32]},{"title":"Had to say something about this movie","rating":6,"date":"23 February 2015","review":"It is very over the top crazy multiple things happening you never really form attachments to any of the characters but I really enjoyed this movie. I like quirky weird story lines and I love weird concepts in movies such as cannibalism (spell check) I did only watch this movie because I was bored and nothing else was on but if you're into weird nonsense movies this is one for you. After you will be asking what did I just watch. I do think this movie is a hit or miss for people. I am seeing people either really hated it or people really likes it. No middle base here. It ended on very weird terms I almost thought it wasn't over. Like all that and this is the end but again I did enjoy it and I don't think this movie gets the props that it deserves.","user":"mxwhatley","rank":[29,31]},{"title":"Horror fans seem either to love or hate this film","rating":6,"date":"25 January 2014","review":"This movie is pure adrenaline from start to finish. It doesn't waste our time explaining why the villains do what they do, it simply follows the terrible journey our main character must endure. The movie is chaotic and I never knew what was going to happen next, it was extremely unpredictable and for some reason I really felt myself caring for the main character.<br><br>A lot of people hated the ending, but I thought it was great. TOO FREQUENTLY do horror movies of this vein kill off the main character because the plot gets too insane and confusing to keep them alive. Sissy escaping made me feel good. Because the creators chose to deviate from the disgusting boredom of the norm, I ended up enjoying this. If they played her off as a crazy or killed her I would have liked this MUCH less.<br><br>All in all, we've all seen better movies. There is no doubt. This movie will entertain you for an hour and a half though.","user":"spankert69","rank":[33,37]}]
