[{"title":"Engaging throughout. . . Very enjoyable.","rating":8,"date":"17 February 2018","review":"I had seen the early first screening nearly a year ago, and this final pre-release screening (with its improvements in editing and sound) had me engaged throughout the 89 minutes. As I am a \"senior citizen\" male, generally I do not go for \"chick flicks\" but I must admit that For the Love of George is entertaining, engaging and funny at times. I liked it and I recommend it.\nTore B.

It had a unique story and fun characters. It centers around Poppy, a long time married woman, who's catches her husband with another women. She take off and goes in search of her celebrity crush, who happens to be George Clooney! This is definitely more of a film that will appeal to women. It was directed by Maria Burton and written by Nadia Jordan (who plays Poppy) and Hayley Nolan and has a whole load of female characters. Loved the message it got over too!","user":"laurengreen-37273","rank":[22,25]},{"title":"Fun quirky comedy","rating":10,"date":"17 February 2018","review":"Watched this with my girlfriend the other day. I wouldn't normally watch a romantic comedy but it was Valentine's day and the trailer looked good. I have to say though that i thoroughly enjoyed this film and so did my girlfriend. The story is sweet and I loved the soundtrack! In particular I liked the lead (Nadia Jordan) and Rex Lee (from Entourage) is good in this too. Highly recommended if you want something that both you and your significant other will enjoy!","user":"EricMcCullough1","rank":[25,29]}]
