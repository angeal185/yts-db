[{"title":"Some of the worst acting ever.","rating":2,"date":"19 June 2019","review":"This is one of the worst Westerns I have ever watched. I have seen high school plays with much better actors than the lead villain . He was absolutely horrible.","user":"jimaquil","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"23 June 2019","review":"Very quickly you realize that this is terrible... acting is bad and the camera is shaking all over the place... Had to turn it off. Why would they waste money on this??","user":"zathan-32848","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Hilarious.","rating":1,"date":"20 June 2019","review":"I usually just rate movies, don't write reviews. In this case, I just felt necessary to add a few words. This \"movie\" was HILARIOUS. Only watch it if you are a calm and relaxed person who doesn't mind wasting time watching it.","user":"zaethermind","rank":[3,6]}]
