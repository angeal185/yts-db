[{"title":"Underrated movie with Matthew McConaughey at his best!","rating":8,"date":"13 July 2017","review":"I don't know why this movie has been underrated so much. It deserves at least 8. If you liked Blow, or Wolf of Wall Street... this is just as good! Maybe not so deep story, but still, amazing Matthew does what he's supposed to.<br><br>Don't follow the ratings and check this out!","user":"mratynski7","rank":[46,51]},{"title":"A lot of content, not a lot of substance","rating":7,"date":"22 April 2017","review":"First of, Gold is better than its IMDb rating and meta-score. I feel this movie is a victim of the studio going wild with a pair of scissors, trying to make it short(er) (even at 2 hours) to please the mainstream audience, but while doing that, this movie loses a lot of substance. Character development is lacking, apart from our protagonist, so it doesn't really feel like we get to know them. One moment we have a new (seemingly an important) character, and then he or she will either disappear or roam in the background. I guess that happens when you start cutting. I suspect there's a great version of this movie out there, and I'd rather watch a 3 hour version with everything included, than this. The movie also takes place in the late 80's(?) or early 90's, but I don't feel like time was important here, which makes things a little confusing. I have no idea if they've been at something for a week, a month, or five years. <br><br>The whole movie also feels a little rushed in the sense that it tries to get to the end as quickly as possible. It lacks the details; Slow down a little, speak to us, breathe. I want to know more, I want to see more, but it ends up being a National Geographic article instead of a book. <br><br>It's far from bad though, and it's an enjoyable watch. Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece.","user":"LordManhattan","rank":[39,44]},{"title":"Actually a pretty entertaining movie","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2017","review":"I actually thought this was a pretty good movie, despite the relatively low ratings. Both McConaughey and Ram√≠rez played very well, also good to see Stoll in this movie. The story was entertaining, never a dull moment (unlike Moonlight, sorry, but that was really boring and I believed the rave reviews...). Anyway, it was worth seeing it!","user":"mwinglunchan","rank":[100,121]}]
