[{"title":"\"Angels we conclude our broadcast day\"","rating":10,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"Always loved this movie since I was a kid, even had it on VHS back when that was relevant; I need to own it now! So much fun to watch, in fact I have always thought it's underrated. Some of my favorite camera shots, stunts, silly humor, great soundtrack, gorgeous cast, and memorable moments. I love Tom Green, Bill Murray, Crispin Glover, Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Kelly Lynch are all amazing actors! I will always love this movie even if others don't! Not much else to just relish this gemstone of a awesome film!","user":"UniqueParticle","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"A slick, enjoyable fast paced and hilarious action movie","rating":7,"date":"23 November 2019","review":"One of my childhood favourites, Charlies Angels is an enjoyable, fun and comeidic action movie with heaps of memorable moments and some great action aswell. If you love early 00s action movies, this is for you with Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu and Drew Barrymore all playing good roles an overall just kicking lots of butt and being cool. It's no masterpiece and it's really not anything really that complex or original, but it's a fun and crisp action movie that you can always come back to an be entertained by","user":"coasterdude44","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Solid fun","rating":8,"date":"6 November 2019","review":"While this is certainly not an Oscar winner, it's always been a low key favorite of mine. The acting is comparable, the action is a bit far fetched but fun, and it's got funny moments. I enjoy the chemistry between the angels and I think their personalities are perfect for each actor. The plot is well developed and there's a good flow to the movie. I think some of the effects don't work, too much showing off in the fx department. But thoroughly enjoyable.","user":"Calicodreamin","rank":[8,9]}]
