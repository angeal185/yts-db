[{"title":"TIME TRAVEL","rating":7,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"A very fresh performance by two sisters and a very impressive job of make up artist who can make 26 and 23 yrs old actresses to look like 13 &amp; 16 respectively as if they travel back and forth in Time.....the film also shows how little we know our own family and when we do it is most of the time too late","user":"vanmust","rank":[21,27]},{"title":"Unwatchable-- audio is terrible","rating":2,"date":"16 January 2020","review":"Whoever the sound team was on this deserves to get fired. The recording, the dubbing, the ADR, the mixing... terrible. It was offensive to my ears.","user":"uwprof","rank":[11,17]},{"title":"Such an emotional story line loved it really gives a 13 Reason Why Vibe","rating":10,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"This story is great so well acted as after Zoe is murdered a year later Echo starts investigating further into it as the police could not find anything. All suspicions are on Zoe's boyfriend still even though he has been cleared of all charges rightly so and after Echo doing some digging there is more than meets the eye to the mystery of Zoe's Murder and she goes along to solve it with a very emotional ending. I would defiantly recommend you watching it as you will not be disappointed and Vanessa Marano and Laura Marano acting is on point as we go backwards in time then forwards in time to present day too.","user":"tomtalbotty","rank":[18,32]}]
