[{"title":"Actually quite good but not an action sci fi","rating":6,"date":"1 August 2019","review":"A reasonable guess into alien psychology. Granted it's a bit slow but I really enjoyed it. Good for a Brit flick.","user":"lopezpatricia-06139","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Excellent","rating":10,"date":"30 July 2019","review":"This is a film which relies on an excellent idea and high quality acting and characterisation. For that reason, comments on graphics and sets are completely superfluous and rather miss the point.<br><br>It's a rather clever parable of colonialisation and the very human disdain and tendency towards genocide of other peoples - others who are labelled as inferior, savage, animalistic, subhuman.<br><br>The two characters grope towards this realisation, ultimately realising that they must free themselves from the yoke of propaganda and deceit imposed on them by their masters and see the others as their equals.<br><br>As a comment on the historical and existing failures and crimes of supposedly superior civilisations, and the insidious control that the elite exercise over the common man, it succeeds admirably.","user":"lukepaccounts","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"For Fans of Thoughtful Scifi","rating":8,"date":"17 June 2018","review":"Really enjoyed this movie, the acting was excellent and the story engaging. Definitely for true fans of the scifi genre. If you're looking for a superficial CGI driven western in space this isn't it.","user":"enhaxed","rank":[14,20]}]
