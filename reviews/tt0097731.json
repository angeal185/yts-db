[{"title":"Best Gambling Movie Ever!","rating":10,"date":"23 March 2005","review":"I love, love, love, love this movie! I have probably watched it beginning to end 25 times and never tire of it. Probably the only other comedy I have seen as many times is Blazing Saddles.<br><br>Dreyfuss, Garr and Johansen and especially Tilly are great. I couldn't think of anyone else playing these parts.<br><br>This is the type of movie that gets lost on the shelves of your local video store. The actors are solid, but not stars, and the movie is not geared to the \"moron\" crowd. But it constantly delivers belly laugh after belly laugh.<br><br>And to think it's just a little story about a guy at the track that is \"having a very good day\"!","user":"wdevil-1","rank":[39,41]},{"title":"An absolute charmer!","rating":9,"date":"23 March 2005","review":"This movie is on cable a lot. My intention to watch a few minutes invariably turns into my watching until the end. I love this movie.<br><br>It is a simple and very funny movie with a fine cast portraying an array of eccentric characters. Yet there is often a sweetness in this film reminiscent of a movie like Roxanne.<br><br>The premise is that at times the universe can align in such a way that you just know in your bones that nothing can stop you from having a really good day. Watching Richard Dreyfuss come to this realization and watching him savoring it while it is happening is appealing.<br><br>It struck me last night that of all Mr. Dreyfuss's admirable body of work, I like him the best in Let It Ride.","user":"rchb13","rank":[29,30]},{"title":"This is one of the all time most underrated films....","rating":10,"date":"9 August 1998","review":"This is one of the all time most underrated films. It is a little film , but rarely do you see so many wonderfully funny characters in a comedy. Along with \"Breaking Away\", and \"Harold and Maude\" it falls in a special category of films I like to watch when I'm feeling life sucks.  Richard Dreyfus and Teri Garr give their best performances; and the supporting cast, especially Robbie Coltrane, is terrific. Don't miss this little gem.","user":"somf","rank":[33,36]}]
