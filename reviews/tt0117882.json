[{"title":"Hints at how good Hilary Swank will become","rating":8,"date":"16 August 2005","review":"This film was edgy for a made-for-television show, dealing with real issues for a change. Miss Swank showed promise here early on, as well as newcomer Rachel Youngberg. Cinematography was good. Direction, for a film this size, was also good. The location shots were believable, which puts it ahead in my book. What made this film interesting was a storyline that moved it along, and enough action to keep it going. Some of the smaller parts seemed better acted than most, and may be due to the Utah casting. While it dragged in spots, the intensity of the characters pulled it through. I really liked seeing a younger Hillary Swank, with a hint at what she carried inside for later expression.","user":"Pewterhills","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Better than average for Lifetime","rating":7,"date":"31 May 2005","review":"I was curious about this as an early credit for Hillary Swank, and if I were she and someone mentioned this movie in my presence I'd probably be thinking, \"I'm a big movie star now, I've won two Academy Awards, I should be allowed to forget credits like that.\" Truth be told, though, it's a better than average Lifetime movie and Swank acquits herself marvelously in it as the rebellious teenage girl whose violent relations with her family open a lot of old wounds going back three generations. This has some of the usual Lifetime weaknesses  melodramatic plot construction, an overly reverential attitude towards psychotherapy, sappy piano-and-strings background music (they must have a library of millions of these records) and a limp excuse for punk rock allegedly performed by Garrett's band, as well as the obligatory soft-core porn scene  but it's also solidly acted by a tight ensemble cast, it's all too believable despite the melodramatics, and Gregory Goodell has a visual sense far ahead of most of the Lifetime directors.","user":"mgconlan","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"PRETTY GOOD TV MOVIE","rating":1,"date":"1 September 2001","review":"As far as t. v.  made movies go this gets a B+. Hilary Swank better known for her role in \"The Next Karate Kid\" plays an abusive teen who starts to violently hit her parents when she gets real angry, through all the fighting and her dating a delinquent the violence turns into an authority involvement. Joanna Kerns (Growing Pains) plays her alcoholic mother who can't seem to control her daughter or keep a punishment, she's believable but tries too much. I'm not saying it's the best but I would see it as often as it may come on.","user":"MOVIEFAN433","rank":[9,10]}]
