[{"title":"Awful Animated Atrocity","rating":1,"date":"1 October 2018","review":"Aaaaaahhhhhhh! The sound of me screaming. My reaction to watching this piece of animated #&amp;@-hole.<br><br>Holy crap! This movie is garbage! Total waste of time, money, effort, and human sanity! With the cutesy cover with anthropomorphic sea life and the case description of getting lost in a sunken ship and finding the way back home I thought, \"Hey, maybe it's one of those Finding Nemo inspired films. It wont be good, but might be decent and have laughs\". Nope. Nothing. <br><br>The soundtrack is awful to the point of being able to raise Cthulhu from his dark slumber. I could make a fart symphony and it would sound better.<br><br>The voice acting is also horrendous. Either they speak in a weird way of rhythming their sentences and it falls on the ear weirdly, or they suck at voices and the sound is absolute nightmare fodder.<br><br>The animation is also horrible and scary beyond all appointed rhyme or reason. I've seen better animation in a 1970s Yes music video. It doesn't even seen consistent, and some scenes have 2 different animation stylings in the same shot and the movement looks so awkward. <br><br>The plotline like I said should be reminiscent of Finding Nemo, but all that is presented in the most uninspired, unprofessional, and unpleasantly evil way that masks anything good, making it complete crap. Animals get lost, make a friend, get back home. We all have seen it thousands of times. Come on!<br><br>Avoid this movie! If you want a good fish themed animation, just watch Finding Nemo. There is nothing in Fish Tales 2.","user":"etusciuk","rank":[1,1]}]
