[{"title":"Book was way way better","rating":4,"date":"18 May 2019","review":"After seeing a commercial for this movie, I decided to read the book, which I LOVED! Naturally, I expected to like the movie as much as I liked the book. Yeah, didn't happen. The events in the movie seem more rushed, and that takes away from their impact on causing the characters to fall in love.<br><br>The most epic disappointment for me was that the movie does not contain the side stories of some minor characters like the book does (and the character with the most touching side story isn't even in the movie). I really liked the \"everybody has a story\" element that was throughout the book and wish it were in the movie.<br><br>Like another reviewer said, maybe you'll like this movie if you haven't read the book, but if you have read the book, don't bother.","user":"BlackSheep773","rank":[33,37]},{"title":"Trailer was better than entire film","rating":4,"date":"17 May 2019","review":"Gosh, I wanted to love this! The trailer made me emotional every time I watched it. But the movie fell flat. What went wrong: chemistry was only felt during a few scenes, not enough dramatic background music to help set the mood, too many dizzying scenes, ending was strange and a little disjointed, idk. Best scene was in the karaoke bar but you already saw most of it in the trailer. Wait for video. ðŸ˜”","user":"cmalek98","rank":[45,57]},{"title":"Cringy for Me","rating":5,"date":"20 May 2019","review":"Today I watched \"The Sun Is Also a Star\" without knowing anything about the movie. The movie poster only made me aware of the genre: a romantic teen movie. Hence, I immediately knew that I did not belong to its target audience. Thanks to my PathÃ© Unlimited Movie Pass, I decided to give it a chance anyway.<br><br>The most disappointing was the acting for me. The lead actor (Charles Melton) and lead actress (Yara Shahidi) lacked chemistry in my opinion. Furthermore, I did not feel many of their 'monologues' &amp; emotional moments...<br><br>I am still wondering to what extent writing/directing had an influence on the acting quality though. Unfortunately I did not watch any other movies with these actors, so I am not sure whether they are bad actors in general haha.<br><br>Positive points for some beautiful shots and a fairly 'original' approach with regard to directing a teen romance movie. Am I the only one who thought director Ry Russo-Young got inspired by Adam McKay's latest movies (e.g., The Big Short)?<br><br>Most noteworthy for me is that I never cringed so much due to a combination of bad acting, writing and directing. So if you are not part of its target audience, be prepared to cringe! Teenagers may relate to some of the issues the characters are dealing with, but I would still avoid as a teenager if you do not like romance movies in general. :)","user":"jessevasse","rank":[16,20]}]
