[{"title":"Just OK, nothing really to brag about.","rating":6,"date":"1 June 2015","review":"Jerry Ferrera's leading man role is in a movie about a limo driver who becomes a thing in the club scene in New York City was perfectly small for the Entourage Costar. <br><br>But the movie is too by the numbers to stand out to be anything. It did not have enough style and attitude that it needed to really be something. <br><br>All the acting was too on cue. Just no real passion in it. <br><br>Club Life had a lot of potential, but it does not hit you, it does not stick with you, it kinda goes away. <br><br>Good effort, but falls short.","user":"bbickley13-921-58664","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Entertaining for what it is","rating":5,"date":"11 July 2015","review":"The charm in watching this flick is the ambition in the plot line and Jerry Ferrara's acting.<br><br>Outside of that the movie seems to crawl and stall at times. But ... just when you think you can see the obvious ending a big plot twist is unexpectedly tossed up and the movie emerges from the deep it seems to be sinking into and it brings a breath of much needed air!<br><br>I'm not going to describe the twist in the story, nor tell the reader when it happens, but it took me by surprise and it ended with me liking this movie. I don't love it but it is worth seeing.<br><br>There are a lot of good actors in the story whom I had never heard of, and the production value definitely is not cheap!","user":"cekadah","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"my notes","rating":2,"date":"26 June 2019","review":"This is barely a straight to DVD film. low quality in so many ways (1 viewing)","user":"sstrunks-05245","rank":[0,0]}]
