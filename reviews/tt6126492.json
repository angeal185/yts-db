[{"title":"No, hell no!","rating":2,"date":"27 October 2017","review":"Instead of this movie going from 0 to 60, it went from 60 to 0. It started out like it was going to be a good movie, but somewhere towards the middle right down to the end it became horrible. The story line was good, but the acting and directing started to suck, it seems like the actors lost their scripts, gave up and started improvising. The acting was bad and the movie turned ridiculous. Save yourself 1:28:45!","user":"janmarju","rank":[20,24]},{"title":"Not worth the time unless you are just in it for the gore","rating":3,"date":"29 November 2017","review":"The movie starts out confusing and just snowballs. As clues to what is happening are revealed, and the identity of Frau Perchta/Molly (Why the heck call her Mother Krampus?) is revealed it just gets more baffling. When the movie wrapped up I had more questions than answers as to what they were trying to say. The surface plot was really tossed together too fast to leave anyone who wants to think about their movies satisfied.<br><br>Overall, I would skip this movie unless you are just watching it to see some people die, and don't really care what is going on.<br><br>Also the original title makes much more sense, Krampus has NOTHING to do with this. Should have left it 'The 12 deaths of Christmas'. Neither title really works but the latter at least isn't a huge lie.","user":"Steal_masters","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Why was this ever made?","rating":24,"date":"24 August 2018","review":"I have seen some bad movies but this is the worst in my opinion. I usually can tell a bad movie within 5 min of watch time; sometimes even less. I gave this movie a chance because I liked krampus. I actually liked two krampus movies and the third one was just ok. But this, was shyt on a stick ,pretending to be a corndog. Disappointment all around. The story, the actors, the acting, the blood and gore, the special effects, the climax, the ending. I don't know how this movie is on hulu for ppl to watch. I feel like i should be refunded a year of hulu subscription fees because I was able to watched this. Hulu should have standards. Only watch this movie if you want to see the worst movie made thus far. I feel like actual middle school kids could make a better movie.","user":"qthoward","rank":[3,5]}]
