[{"title":"This is a must see!","rating":10,"date":"24 September 2017","review":"Just saw Stuck at the Breckenridge Film Festival in Colorado and I have to say it's easily one of my new favorite movies. I was worried it was gonna be a little froofy cause it's a musical, but it wound up being powerful, emotional, and hysterical. It never bothered me that they broke into song. The music was incredible, a blend of a whole bunch of styles so that each of the main characters had a unique voice. It was a simple enough premise- six strangers stuck on a NYC subway- but I feel like I really got to know these characters and can't stop thinking about what's gonna happen to them now. Though I related to just about everyone in the film, even if you don't, the story is so universal you're bound to identify with one of the characters. I'm never gonna look at a stranger the same way again.","user":"pmarkey-09103","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"pop musical film about six strangers stuck on a New York City subway together","rating":10,"date":"13 October 2017","review":"Saw STUCK this week at the Woodstock, NY film fest.

The talented cast, great story, and very very special music make this a truly unique film. Overall, this is a gem.
