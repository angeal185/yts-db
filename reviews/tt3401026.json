[{"title":"Tomorrow I will remember nothing from this movie and I don't have Alzheimer yet.","rating":5,"date":"26 March 2020","review":"This Little Piggy is just an average movie, really nothing special about it, unless you like to watch some coke snorting (which takes up half the movie) and whatever 'great' things might come from doing coke. It's a drug drama but not even a good one, there are much better movies with the same theme. But it's watchable, you just watch it without much interest, at least i did. The acting isn't good nor bad, just average like the whole movie.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Nice human drama","rating":7,"date":"8 December 2019","review":"Really good in connecting with the feeling. Nice acting from the main character, nice end.","user":"champetudo","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Excellent drama","rating":8,"date":"3 June 2019","review":"This was a very polished and well done film. I checked this out on amazon prime not too long ago and I'm very glad that I did. Not too many risks were taken with this film, but I'll sure as hell say that it held my attention the entire time!","user":"xavierhollins","rank":[1,5]}]
