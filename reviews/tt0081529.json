[{"title":"It needed Olivier, it Got Kramden","rating":6,"date":"25 May 2005","review":"OK, I'm kidding. Hey, listen, this film is no strain to the synapses. It's another Hal Needham carwreck fest wrapped up in a really dumb plot that at times tries too hard. However, I find an odd entertainment value in this genus of southern cheese. An aging professional highway show-off, an even more annuated hick sheriff in hot pursuit, an oddly swift and resilient Trans Am, a very talented yet dumbed down leggy sidekick, a country singer turned epitomal southern truck driver, Dom Deluise, and an elephant. Add plenty of incompetent law enforcement officers and marlboro reds and you have the makings of one fine redneck cross-country chase movie. I don't know why but I actually enjoyed this. It's really about the stunts I think and when it comes to Hal Needham you never can have too many car crashes. In the spirit of Cannonball Run and the Dukes of Hazzard there is an odd appeal in watching good IL boys tear up backroads to the tune of Hank Williams and police sirens. And of course there's always a way out leaving a pile of police cruisers in the dust behind. It's an action flick and as such you shouldn't expect it to be anything other than what it is; it's just fun to watch. You may notice it does have some very talented actors so it begs the \"what were you thinking doing this film?\" question. Perhaps. But on face value it's all about the car chase. And who doesn't love a good car chase?","user":"dgl1199","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Not that great","rating":21,"date":"21 July 2004","review":"As much as I liked the first movie, I find that I don't really like the second film.  While the film had it's moments, especially with Jackie Gleason as Buford T. Justice, there really wasn't much to redeem this film.<br><br>Everything about the film seemed rather contrived, especially the comedy. The comedy seemed to be forced most of the time.<br><br>While I can watch the first film over and over and it never seems to get old for me, the second film wore out its welcome almost right away.  I don't know, but maybe if they hadn't tried so hard with the second film to measure up to the first film it would have been better.","user":"jgreen8824","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"The Bandit and Snowman at It again","rating":8,"date":"5 December 2010","review":"well the bandit and snowman are back and this time they have one hell of a big adventure.
