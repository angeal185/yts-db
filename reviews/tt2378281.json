[{"title":"An Unexepected Gem","rating":10,"date":"26 September 2013","review":"My boyfriend and I went to see this with my father last night. It was not at all what I expected and as the movie progressed, I was continually surprised. What a lovely movie. Not just a comedy, but a truly heart-warming story. The little girl's acting performance is Oscar worthy. Seriously, where did they find her? My boyfriend usually hates movies with sub-titles, but this one made it worth the trouble for him. If you speak Spanish, like me, then you will get more of the cultural references, but you don't need to understand Spanish to get this movie. Fear is universal and so are lessons in courage, and this movie really spoke to that. Make sure to take your hankie. Watch, watch, watch this movie!!!","user":"maria-mahecha","rank":[19,19]},{"title":"Great!!!","rating":10,"date":"10 September 2013","review":"This is the Best movie ever!! I thought it was going to be like other movies, but it sure was a different movie with ongoing scenes and jokes. this is a great movie that the whole family will enjoy!!... loved that it was spoken in both languages! Just for the fact that Eugenio is a great comedy actor gave me that feeling that it was going to be a good movie.Now that I watched it, I have to take my whole family to watch it and I am willing to go for the second time. I think comedy movies are the best and this is a great movie that other producers should look into to be able to have more movies like this. I kinda do not know what to write anymore, I just want to say that is a great movie and people can have a great time watching it!!! love it!!!!","user":"candyh1010","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Pregnant With Meaning, Amazing Movie","rating":9,"date":"1 September 2013","review":"I believe Eugenio Derbez carried out a solid performance and worked very well with the little girl. I recommend this movie especially to Spanish speaking people. The directing is great. You'll find yourself lost in beautiful cinematic scenes and comical situations. The screenplay is amazing and very well-written. They mix Spanish and English quite cleverly and create scene's in which you'll find yourself either laughing gazing in amazement at how they could come up with that. You like the characters you're supposed to like and there are many surprises packed in this beautiful film that will make you think about life and fear and why it's worth taking risks.","user":"BabyCakes97","rank":[43,48]}]
