[{"title":"Sweet Movie","rating":9,"date":"3 April 2020","review":"If you want to see a Christian love story this is the one to watch. Without giving away any details , all I can say is this movie had me in tears. It makes you realize, as a Christian, sometimes things are out of our control but we still need to rely on God to get us through.","user":"joette-67783","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Based on a TRUE STORY!","rating":8,"date":"20 January 2020","review":"For all you haters out there who hate it because of the ending or even the plot, it's based on a true story. The acting was great, the story line was good and directing was very well done. Yes, it's sad because what happened was sad. But overall, they had a happy life together and kept their valuesm","user":"JaMar1996","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"One of the worst romantic dramas I have seen.","rating":1,"date":"7 June 2019","review":"The story is so cliche and unoriginal. The dialogue is boring slow and seem to have been scripted by a 4 year old.. The ending is also unbelievably bad. At the end the old man is about to die, but then has one more breath. You would think oh it is a miracle he will survive! No he won't. The nurse tells them it is normal when someone is about to die.. Only good thing about this movie is the somewhat cute girl with way too much make-up. Wow, such a waste of time..","user":"resan100","rank":[9,14]}]
