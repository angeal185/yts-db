[{"title":"A Lovely Romantic Comedy","rating":7,"date":"22 May 2016","review":"While following many romantic comedy clichés and having a rather predictable plot in terms of how it'll end up, this film offers a lovely romantic tale with some unique humour in the mix.<br><br>Despite knowing, for the most part, where the characters would end up, the journey to the conclusion is what mattered, as is the case with most romantic comedies. I found myself grinning throughout most of the film, which is rather rare for me, as Planeta Singli offered numerous laugh- inducing scenarios and lines, while being a sweet, romantic plot at its core. The characters, while not entirely unique, feel three dimensional and there are some nice interactions.<br><br>Nothing spectacular or truly unique, but definitely achieved what it was trying to achieve and has a lot of heart involved. The thing most worth noting for me is the humour, as hardly any of the jokes seemed recycled and the cinema broke into laughter a number of times.","user":"Alex_Hodgkinson","rank":[27,30]},{"title":"Planeta Singli: A Nice Polish Comedy!","rating":8,"date":"26 December 2016","review":"A very good 2 hours and 10 minutes of Polish romantic movie: well written (Credits list no less than eight different Authors, in strict alphabetical order), well acted and very well filmed and produced.<br><br>The plot is nicely intertwined and lets you enjoy an updated version of Polish life, probably different from what most of us can commonly expect.<br><br>A display of beautiful and charming presences (I'm sure Weronika Ksiazkiewicz won't go unnoticed) helps to fill the screen and entertain.<br><br>And you might like to know that there are 4 (not particularly remarkable) final seconds after the titles","user":"niutta-enrico","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"A very relaxing, funny and sweet movie.","rating":10,"date":"11 April 2017","review":"A very relaxing, funny and yes.... sweet movie about love, misunderstanding, intrigue with a little bit of sarcasm. It is well served: very good acting, plot is interesting and actually each of us could find some episodes familiar. It is just so real. I wish more Polish songs were used as a background, but the foreign ones match the story as well. Well done! And I want more!","user":"IPP2017","rank":[9,13]}]
