[{"title":"Classic!!!","rating":8,"date":"7 September 1999","review":"I have to say that the most fun I had at the movies this summer was when I saw American Pie, the funniest picture I've seen since last summer's There's Something About Mary. This movie has taken the classic teenage boy film (Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds) and spruced it up for the 90's.  It is hilarious from start to finish. If you like physical comedy, gross out comedy, sexual comedy, American Pie has it all.  A great ensemble cast of likeable young actors makes this a joy to watch.     <br><br>I think this year's breakout star has to be Chris Klein.  He was phenomenal in Election and he is even better here as a jock who tries to soften his image to score before prom. I have a feeling Klein is going to be Hollywood's next big thing and I hope he has a chance to flex his acting muscles in some different movies (I can definitely see this guy in an action film).<br><br>Also very good is Jason Biggs who plays the sympathetic Jim character, the guy who is least likely to lose his virginity.  His antics are very funny to follow and he gets the lion share of the laughs. Finally a huge ovation for Eugene Levy, who gets major laughs as the Jim's dad.","user":"Starks","rank":[66,78]},{"title":"They just do not make them like this anymore","rating":8,"date":"9 July 2019","review":"Can you believe it has been 20 years since this film? It is still funny and amusing. The boys were boys, the girls were hot girls and had long hair and flaunted their bodies and the father was super cool.\nNowadays we have Daisy of Disney 'Star Wars' with short hair and looking all 'I have a chip on my shoulder' .. aaarrrgh I am going to stop right there.\nAmerican Pie is funny and you should watch it if you already have not.","user":"jeremiloki","rank":[47,56]},{"title":"Another reason that the summer of '99 is the Season of Comedy","rating":8,"date":"12 July 1999","review":"I laughed so hard I spit out half the bucket-o-pop I was drinking, and finally had to stop sipping from its fine nectar, because so many times I was hooting and bending over in joy.<br><br>There are some slower moments to let you catch your breath and allow for moments of sincerity, but only for a minute. The scenes in the previews (the ones you think will ruin the movie for you) are expounded on ten-fold, so there are plenty of surprises.<br><br>During the movie I kept saying, \"This is me and my friends when we were in high school!\" They were almost the same conversations about life, sex and girls; just not as frequently, but it's only a two-hour film. Any guy will appreciate American Pie full tilt, and girls will realize just what hoops guys jump through in order to get their attention, let alone in their pants.<br><br>What added to American Pie is that I liked every character, because the filmmakers didn't feel the urge to give us prototypical teen characters. Their personalities are distinctive, and their situations are all different, which leads to a hilarious finale where we see just how their pact plays out on prom night.<br><br>As I mentioned before, there are genuine moments on the screen where the guys and gals have revelations of sincerity. It adds a needed depth to a film like this, where it's not just raw, raunchy comedy, but important to the lives of the characters who know more than sex is at stake. Which is another reason to like Pie, there are several slices, and sexual conquest is only one of them.","user":"JeffCNN","rank":[140,182]}]
