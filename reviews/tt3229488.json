[{"title":"Reviews cannot be from audience members","rating":1,"date":"2 August 2017","review":"Come on, what is happening here. Did these reviewers actually see the movie or did they just work on it? I don't buy that this movie which is cheesy with people I have never ever seen or heard of could have a higher rating than The Goonies or E.T. I mean are we really buying that? Don't waste your time or money on this. It is not watchable.","user":"NicholasMCG","rank":[44,62]},{"title":"Watchable, somewhat funny flick","rating":5,"date":"23 October 2017","review":"There are some funny moments and the premise is funny. Some of the acting is very amateurish and the editing isn't great. The story cannot be much simpler.<br><br>I guess it's OK to have it in the background while you're doing some work - it's watchable with some laughs but nothing to write home about.<br><br>5 out of 10","user":"gbozoki","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Get BOONED today!!","rating":8,"date":"14 May 2018","review":"I loved this movie! I have an unhealthy obsession with movies starring Pro Wrestlers and I always go in not expecting much in return. This movie however did not disappoint me at all. John's charisma, delivery of the one-liners and athletic display in this movie were outstanding. Definitely want a Boone 2!","user":"DrSeamus","rank":[5,5]}]
