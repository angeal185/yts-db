[{"title":"a perfect movie","rating":9,"date":"9 April 2001","review":"This is my absolute favorite movie.  The quiet story of a young widow coping with the loss of her husband and a move to the big city is tender, humorous and hopeful.  Fine performances by Jessica Lange, Chris O'Donnell (in his first screen role), Kathy Bates, Arliss Howard and Joan Cusack round out this film.  Casting is perfect in every sense and the emotion of the movie is carried well by a haunting score. One of my favorite scenes has  Lange arriving unannounced at Howard's home. Her sadness is palpable and his gift - a trip to the Polka hall, where she loses herself in a wild dance with a waitress, while he sits in with the band - is moving.  There is such a sense of hope, generosity and goodness in this movie.  It is not at all maudlin, or contrived.  Just a wonderful exploration of the darkness of grief and unwelcome change, and the love and support sometimes found in unexpected places.  There are also great comedic moments, chiefly involving O'Donnell and Cusack.  See this movie!","user":"lizeroo","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"A Treasure - realistic, need some maturity to understand it","rating":9,"date":"6 August 2000","review":"I am a longtime fan of Jessica Lange's, and a newfound fan of Arliss Howard's after viewing Men Don't Leave. A really good performance also by Chris O'Donnell and Joan Cusak. This is a true-to-life type of movie. It's Wow Factor isn't measured by action shots or stunts or explosions, but rather by the satisfaction and peace each character reaches by story's end.<br><br>It's your favorite shirt: not flashy, but comfortable and proven to make you feel good. Watch Men Don't Leave - it's a good little movie.","user":"biznest","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"one of the unheralded gems of the 1990's","rating":9,"date":"8 May 2001","review":"It usually takes me two viewings of a film to decide whether I think it is a great film. The second that \"Men Don't Leave\" ended I knew it was a great film. It tells the story of a middle aged woman (Jessica Lange) who moves her two sons to Baltimore following the death of her husband. There she meets a quirky musician (Arliss Howard) and her older son starts dating an equally quirky x-ray technician (Joan Cusack). This film is by turns joyful and heartbreakingly sad and features sure-handed direction by Paul Brickman and a beautiful score by Thomas Newman who also scored \"American Beauty\". The performances are wonderful, most notably Jessica Lange's and Joan Cusack's. If you're looking for a wonderful family drama with comedic moments then \"Men Don't Leave\" is for you. One of the best films of the 1990's.","user":"jscanlon","rank":[9,9]}]
