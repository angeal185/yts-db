[{"title":"In desperate need of a wake-up call...","rating":3,"date":"20 July 2019","review":"A complete waste of time, yes. However, at least it was short. I don't know about the original, but 'Return to Horror Hotel' is nothing but a cheap knockoff of a Full Moon production or a Troma film without any of the cult movie charm. This movie fails so hard that it's actually kind of funny in some areas. Still, no excuse for bad acting and unoriginality. I recommend staying away from this one, as well as the first movie. From first impressions alone, I imagine that the first 'Horror Hotel' is just as terrible, if not worse than this travesty.","user":"shanemoose-88715","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Can't look past the poor acting.","rating":1,"date":"17 July 2019","review":"These stories may have been great if they weren't destroyed by the poor acting.","user":"Max_Lucas","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Tales From the Crypt on Acid","rating":8,"date":"12 July 2019","review":"Return to Horror Hotel is a zany, gut-wrenching treat that would be good to put on during a party. Four unique stories make up this twisted ride. My favorite was probably the third one, which centers around a lost submarine crewman and a curious bookstore employee. Their chemistry was great, and the execution (and art direction) of the theme was fantastic. At times, the performances are campy or over-the-top ridiculous, but that's the point. Grab a beer, pop a fake blood capsule, and laugh red juice out of your mouth for this guilty pleasure!","user":"ben-36333","rank":[6,13]}]
