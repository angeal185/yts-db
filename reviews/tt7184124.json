[{"title":"great film, really loved it","rating":9,"date":"22 October 2018","review":"Just a great film, great acting, great story, deeply meaningful, I can see how some wound find this film slow but thats what develops the relationships, I really thought it was great, I am surprised by some of the bad reviews here, watch it for yourself. I wont tell the whole story here, but your really feeling these girls' lives and the struggles they face and what they have to overcome to just be average in our world, its heartbreakingly real.","user":"johnbookstar","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Interesting story","rating":7,"date":"18 March 2019","review":"I thought this film was very well acted and had an interesting story. The story of trauma on children and the ones that slip through the cracks.<br><br>Like some of the other reviewers have stated, it is kind of slow paced throughout. It keeps the somber, melancholy mood throughout however and it fits with the dark subject matters that are touched upon in the film.","user":"rawisnwo","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Not Great but Definitely Not Bad","rating":5,"date":"10 August 2018","review":"Starts out slow and continues slow all the way to the slow ending...\nThis seems like it might be a true story that someone it trying to tell, \nBut, it just doesn't go anywhere.<br><br>The acting was not the problem, It's the incomplete story.\nMaybe they didn't have a budget, I just don't know.\nI'm giving it 5 stars only because the girls made an effort.<br><br>After we viewed the movie, everyone was asking me: \"Why Did We Watch It?\"","user":"Pro_Viewer","rank":[5,10]}]
