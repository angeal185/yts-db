[{"title":"Pleasantly Surprised","rating":9,"date":"13 February 2015","review":"The script comes off as a bit far-fetched at times and some if the CGI is downright comical. However, nothing prepared me for the atmosphere Wyrmwood created. Whoever was responsible for costumes and props did a knockout job, absolute best work I have seen in recent zombie flicks. The sweat poured into minute details makes this film a must see for anyone who enjoys zombie culture. Wouldn't be surprised to see a cult following.<br><br>With that said, the script is a little devoid of direction. The director knew what this film was about and didn't try to make it into something it wasn't. You should be ready to sit down and watch characters doing quite literally whatever comes next as a zombie apocalypse unfolds. I didn't recognize a single actor in the film, but I was blown away by the work they put into their roles. You could tell everyone involved just wanted to make a great movie.<br><br>Entertaining, exciting, and funny, could not recommend enough.","user":"AudiTT669","rank":[84,103]},{"title":"What happens when you mix Braindead, The Evil Dead and Mad Max.","rating":8,"date":"14 February 2015","review":"Before the multitude of the crappy zombie movies you've seen lately, back in the day in 1992, Australia was producing a zombie movie that remains cool even today, made by a little known New Zealander called Peter Jackson. It mixed zombies with comedy, original ideas and wacky Aussie characters.<br><br>23 years later Wyrmwood is an obvious homage to Braindead, but adding a few elements of its own. The main character, almost a dead ringer for Bruce Campbell in The Evil Dead, is trying to get to his sister's place in the middle of a zombie plague. Not only are there zombies everywhere, but petrol has become not flammable. The only solution: rig a car to the gasses that zombies breath out and make an armored truck running on zombies. Meanwhile, the sister is being captured by sadistic psychopath military types in order to experiment on her.<br><br>There are many references to cult films, like The Evil Dead and Mad Max, and the ending of the film leaves a lot of place for sequels. This is not a perfect film, but considering that it is an Australian zombie movie made with unknown actors and probably a low budget, there was no chance it could have been. Instead we are treated to a wonderfully original film, made by people who clearly enjoyed playing with the genre and love the same movies that we do.<br><br>Bottom line: more than anything, this is a fun film. If you liked Braindead or The Evil Dead you will like this one as well. It opens an interesting idea, also used in the season finale of Z Nation, of the zombie whisperer. People die or live based on luck more than anything and it is refreshing to see this in an era when nobody ever dies, for fear of antagonizing the viewers. I recommend it, I enjoyed watching the film!","user":"siderite","rank":[62,77]},{"title":"An interesting take on a tired genre","rating":7,"date":"22 October 2014","review":"Having watched many zombie films of all different types over the years, I am happy to say that Wyrmwood is an interesting take on the genre. I can't say too much about why I like this film and I would suggest going into it without doing much research into it.<br><br>What I will say is that there is a decent amount of action and some very unique and creative twists on the zombie phenomena. Some of these work better than others, though to be fair the film has a somewhat playful dynamic so the unorthodox creative liberties will be appreciated fans who enjoy a bit of silliness.<br><br>The bizarre plot devices and comically stoic characters like Frank (Keith Agius) contrast well with the always sombre lead Barry (Jay Gallagher). That said, the character development of Benny is a bit problematic. What starts out as cringe-inducing stereotyping quickly moves to what might be construed as racism. It could be the case that this is an attempt at a deeper social commentary on the genre or Australian film, but that might be a stretch given the overall tone of the film.<br><br>The practical effects are decent and the use of CG, while not perfect, doesn't take away from the experience. There are some gory shots but these are nothing that more skirmish viewers wont be able to handle if they are familiar with the genre.<br><br>There isn't really too much in the way of character development and the plot is fairly light, but the pacing and the way the film jumps between a couple of different story lines makes the film enjoyable to watch.<br><br>One of the things that makes this film stand out is the somewhat surreal and often mysterious cast of characters. It might be the case that the filmmakers left the characters underdeveloped on purpose. Either way the somewhat larger than life characters work well with the overall ambiance of the piece, especially when reflecting on a certain theme revealed by Frank. The Doctor in particular stands out (just how long has it been since the dead started rising again?).<br><br>In the end viewers are likely to be left with some unanswered questions, but it is forgivable if we take this to be a slightly different zombie universe than we are used to. Ultimately Wyrmwood is a fun and enjoyable film that will be particularly enjoyable for zombie fans, partially because it unapologetically refuses to be held back by the unspoken rules of the genre.<br><br>Although the film is not perfect, I salute the filmmakers for taking some risks and ultimately producing an interesting take on an otherwise tired genre.","user":"liamjaques-1","rank":[74,94]}]
