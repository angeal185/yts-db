They have a 16-year-old daughter Sofía (Beatriz Olivares ) whose relationship with Eva is under strain . Everything is in order: the first course is ready, the roast is in the oven and the table is set. Without a doubt, this is going to be a gathering of true friends and the waiting comes to an end when the first couple arrives. The bell rings and it is Antonio (Ernesto Alterio in real life married to Juana Acosta) , Ana (Juana Acosta) , the newly-wed Eduardo (Eduardo Noriega) and Blanca (Dafne Fernández ) . And followed subsequently the only one missing who is Pepe (Pepón Nieto ) , their friend who is still single . Pepe doesn't bring his new girlfriend with him, which is to the discontent of the rest, since none of them have been met her yet, and there is always a reason behind.\n Before long, the group is complete and without any delay, they begin the feast. Surely, this is a nice but somewhat usual dinner, when suddenly someone makes a proposition : to place their mobile phones on the table and like a Russian roulette, whatever arrives (texts, WhatsApp messages, calls) they would share it with the others. Clearly, this uncommon truth or dare game has no point among friends who share everything with each other, nevertheless, when the phones start ringing, who will be the one with the sweatiest palms?<br><br><br><br><br><br>The story takes place in Madrid , present day , altogether restricted in one night , among seven tight-knitted friends, three couples and a recent divorcé , Pepe , during a dinner party hosted by Alfonso , magnificently played by Eduard Fernández , as a cosmetic surgeon , and his beloved wife , splendidly performed by Belén Rueda , and dealing with a twisted game , as whoever receives a phone-call, a message whether it is a text message will have to read or hear it . De la Iglesia's bewildering comedy ¨Perfectos desconocidos¨ blends intriguing elements with humor , tongue-in-cheek and thrills ; so, the tone of the film is light-hearted as well as stirring . The film starts at a slow pace, and it took a while to catch me , when it did it was fantastic . Very amusing and twisted film concerning about seven long-time friends get together for a dinner , then they decide to share with each other the content of every text message, email and phone call they receive, as many secrets start to unveil , the equilibrium trembles and things go wrong .The brilliant beginning idea is developed in a marvelous crescendo that turns into rapidly the situation from a nice dinner with old friends into a bloody battleground that reveals the surprising secrets . As well as the darkest secrets are disclosed to all of them and then awry consequences take place , some are cunningly revealed only to the eyes of spectators . A wonderful and talented plethora of actors, the mainstays of current Spanish cinema, implements a totally suspenseful melodrama interspersed with twists , turns , top-shelf comedic flair and naturalistic theatrics . It also contains a final twist in the screenplay that I will not reveal . It's well acted and smartly written.The movie is both funny and dramatic and so is the bitter-sweet ending .<br><br>It packs an adequate and moving musical score by Víctor Reyes . And a colorful and appropriate cinematography by Ángel Amorós . The motion picture was masterfully written (along with his usual screenwriter Jorge Guerricaechevarría) and directed by De La Iglesia , well known as the Spanish king of black comedy . He's a cool director has got much success as ¨Accion Mutante¨ ,¨Dying of laughter¨ or ¨Muertos De Risa¨ , ¨Baby's room¨ , ¨Oxford murders¨ , ¨Balada Triste De Una Trompeta¨ and ¨Perdita Durango¨ is probably the weirdest Javier Bardem film ever made . And , of course , ¨Day of the beast¨ and ¨La Comunidad¨ obtained the unanimous praise of both the critics and the public and result to be a lot of fun¨, especially for those who enjoy surrealist humor , they won several Goya prizes and and resulted to be a turning point in his meteoric career ; from then on he became his own producer, beginning with '800 bullets' (2002) through the Pánico Films company . Winner of several Goyas (Spanish Oscars), however his movies have not yet reached box office in USA, but he has strong followers , as his films have a kind of comic edge to them . Nonsense, ridicule , laughters , absurdity , disturbing scenes and many other issues ; you can find everything in this flick . ¨Perfectos desconocidos¨ captures the essence of the best Alex De La Iglesia, a filmmaker who, at this point in his own story, is respected and admired worldwide and has the most committed fans in the film universe . This is without a doubt an enjoyable movie to be enjoyed for comedy buffs and Alex De Iglesia fans .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[14,25]},{"title":"Good !!!
