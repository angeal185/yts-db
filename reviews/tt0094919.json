[{"title":"Terrific sequel!","rating":8,"date":"25 May 2006","review":"Two years after the first Krite attack on the Browns's farm, everything was peaceful in Grover's Bend but there are some remaining Krite Eggs still left and Brad Brown ( Scott Grimes) has traveled from Kansas City to visit his grandmother for Easter vacation. Soon the Eggs hatch as it makes trouble as the Krites has returned and the bounty hunters from space Ug ( Terrence Mann), Lee ( Roxanne Kernohan) and former town drunk turned bounty hunter Charlie ( Don Opper) head back to Earth, will they rescue the humans with the help of Brad or will everyone end up on the space monsters's menu? <br><br>Very entertaining and action packed sequel that is almost better than the original and THE only sequel in the series worth watching. What works here for this sequel is there's more action, bigger special effects, off-the-wall humor, a more intense and dramatic score, Mick Garris's directorial debut and of course there's a memorable moment where Lee the faceless bounty hunter from space looks at a Playboy magazine and transforms into a beautiful nude blonde centerfold babe played by B-movie beauty Roxanne Kernohan. Look for Eddie Deezen ( best known for Mandark on \"Dexter's Lab\" and Eugene from \"Grease\") as a restaurant manager and there's an amusing Freddy Krueger in-joke since the movie is from Freddy's home known as New Line Cinema.","user":"TalesfromTheCryptfan","rank":[17,23]},{"title":"Classic 80's","rating":6,"date":"22 February 2017","review":"Much better than the subsequent films, but not nearly as good as the first. Settings, characters, nudity, and other important basics are pretty much the same as the surprisingly-good original. The movie? Well those furry devils aren't all gone and we get to see the main characters a few years later. Of course looking at it as an adult now I can saw the timeline wasn't very good - not enough time passed for the age of the characters involved or all that the back story claimed happened.<br><br>\"Critters 2\", however, drives the point home just in case you couldn't figure it out. The Critters now have more scenes involving \"mischief\" as they tear up restaurants in all sorts of silly ways, accompanied by sight gags, slapstick and plenty of cartoon sound effects. The Critters also develop the ability to speak broken English, too, only adding to their status as Gremlins clones. While \"Critters\" was far from a serious horror film, Critters 2 starts the series down a more humorous path that a lot of fans didn't exactly cotton to.<br><br>Overall rating: 6 out of 10.","user":"PredragReviews","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"When Critters bite, bite back!","rating":9,"date":"21 April 2007","review":"The Critters have always been cool little monsters, they aren't just little omnivorous monsters that eat anything that won't run away and then chase after it. They are smart, clever monsters with their own language and strategies. The interaction between the characters work, the acting is great. The gore effects are effective. The story is a cool continuation from the first movie. The new batch of Critters are cool and the rampage continues to be fun. But there is one character that gets killed this go round, but I'm not saying which character. It was hard watching that character get it. But other then that, I say that Critters 2 could be anyone's main course of a video feast. 9 STARS.","user":"lordzedd-3","rank":[7,9]}]
