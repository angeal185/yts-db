[{"title":"Unpredictably written South Korean action film!","rating":10,"date":"2 July 2018","review":"THE MERCILESS always excited me from the beginning; the moment I found out that it had Sol Kyung-gu in it, and that it was an action movie which was officially selected for Cannes Film Festival, I waited for a proper digital release. I watched it last month and had got up from my seat with a feeling of pure satisfaction which only exceptional movies give me.<br><br>THE MERCILESS or BULHANDANG is a highly entertaining action movie. It is an exceptional film which combines action, drama and unpredictable plot twists in an unprecedented manner. <br><br>The director for sure has done a great job in extracting the best out of his cast as well as crew. The film really delivers on every front: be it the technical aspects or some other, the film rarely lets one down. It's not a boring film, as right after a decent setup in the early minutes, the film starts delivering knockout action sequences and plot twists very well. <br><br>Im Si-wan is the star to watch out for in this film. I watched him only in THE ATTORNEY which was a powerful social drama. In this particular film, he does a lot of action and delivers a solid performance. Sol Kyung-gu: don't know why I always run out of words when it comes to praising him! His act is straightaway an award-worthy one. His crazy laughter adds a lot of fun to the proceedings. Other actors like Kim Hee-won are also very impressive; he adds a great comic flavor to this somewhat dark film. <br><br>The film impresses with its well choreographed, violent action sequences which stand out as a major highlight of the film. For sure, there is a lot of bad language used in the film which is enough to put off a lot of viewers, but as it progresses, this no longer remains an issue. The atmosphere built by the director and writers pulls the viewer in it and makes him feel like a part of the narrative. The ways the feel gets darker in the second half without getting melodramatic or boring is perhaps one of the best things about the film.<br><br>THE MERCILESS is a masterfully crafted action film from South Korea which effectively entertains the viewer with the best stuff it has got. Also with an outstanding climax, the film makes sure viewers don't soon forget it.","user":"Prashast_Singh","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Beautiful Cinematography, Beautiful Story, Must Watch!","rating":10,"date":"7 October 2018","review":"This movie outdid itself - is simply not any dude bro action flick. It has everything that has been lacking in many blockbuster films that I have been waiting for - for years.<br><br>I can tell the team behind it were passionate about the project; the sound effects are poignant when it matters the most, the fighting scenes have humour with people flying out of view (I legit laughed out loud), and the cinematography (sometimes like wes anderson), with appreciated story boarding, makes for contrast and relief from the building tension in the full 117 minutes - which I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of it.<br><br>The film feels like it was made with meticulous love and I recommend it for anyone searching for a ride or die action drama.<br><br>Hint: invest in the relationships as there is more than meets the eye.<br><br>Also, better than Infernal Affairs, better than the american version The Departed, which, come on, hollywood always forgoes about character and relationships to more fighting scenes.<br><br>The Merciless didn't skimp on any of the good stuff - it is in a league of it's own.\nShippers will be satisfied - I can't wait to get my hands on a director's cut.","user":"Quilesca","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"This is what top shelf action crime drama looks like....","rating":10,"date":"9 September 2018","review":"If you want to see what top shelf action crime drama looks like ,The Merciless, as the title translates, is its very definition.<br><br>This is a polished, likeable, laughable but ultimately, very dark film. Its essence if you look closely, is a proxy dysfunctional father son styled relationship. The older and younger crime figures play ball, they have fun, they make jokes, hang out, rough house, conspire, collaborate, share the good and the bad.<br><br>Of course given the nature of what they are and what they do the outcome was and is, very bleak and could be nothing else. In its closing scenes there's a certain sense of the events of this film coming full circle too. Of loss and a grim kind of anti hero, rebirth.<br><br>If you like quality crime drama, with healthy amounts of action, with an adjoiner that this film is violent and occasionally sadistic, then you really can't do better than this offering from Korea. A deeply impressive effort. 10/10 from me.","user":"s3276169","rank":[11,14]}]
