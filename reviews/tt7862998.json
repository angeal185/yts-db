[{"title":"A Journey To The Self","rating":9,"date":"26 July 2019","review":"Djon Africa can be seen as a variation of the classic hero's epic journey. This film is an epic journey where John's journey is one of self discovery of who he really is. In the begining confused and out of place in the land of his birth, he travels to his ancestral land of the Cape Verde Islands where he feels at home but others see him as a foreigner. Gradually melding in to the society there, he loses what was imprinted on him in Portugal and learns the ways of Cape Verde. The cinematography is excellent showing the dramatic but impoverished beauty of the islands, and the atmosphere reflects the mood of the situation accurately. Even without the engrossing character revelation of John, the film would be watchable just for the majestic scenery. In the end we are left guessing, just as the results of our searches for meaning in life are a mystery waiting to discovered.","user":"tariq-hossenbux","rank":[1,1]}]
