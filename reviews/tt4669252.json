[{"title":"Disapointed...","rating":6,"date":"22 March 2020","review":"I had much more expectations from Cristophe Waltz, but his film did not delivered, sorry to say. The story just doesn't deliver. Is not a disaster, yet far from a good movie.","user":"lucian-g","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"A poor directorial debut","rating":4,"date":"8 April 2020","review":"This is the story of Ulrich Mott, an eccentric who seduced and married a wealthy older widow, Elsa Brecht. Although Mott wad three decades younger than his her , they join forces to dominate the political and social circles of Washington, DC by throwing lavish events at their townhouse in the fashionable suburb of Georgetown. When Elsa is found dead just hours after a dinner party, Ulrich immediately comes under suspicion .<br><br>This is Christoph Waltz's directorial debut and going on this effort , he should probably stick to acting alone .<br><br>I originally thought that Georgetown was a film about the massacre's in Guyana in the 70's but sadly it wasn't anything quite as dramatic or exciting.\nThere is definitely an interesting movie trying get out here but sadly it doesn't even come close to succeeding.<br><br>The problem is i didn't fully understand or even care what was happening with the plot . It was a mixture of a Walter Mitty like story , intertwined with a very weak murder thread and sadly By the end I cared about neither .","user":"valleyjohn","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"A Few Hiccups With An Interesting Plot","rating":6,"date":"24 March 2020","review":"Flamboyant Ponzi scheming sociopath with an inferiority complex slithers his way into the life of a geriatric Georgetown socialite.","user":"zac-68274","rank":[1,4]}]
