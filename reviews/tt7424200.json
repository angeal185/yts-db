[{"title":"If You Love The Show, You'll Really Love The Movie","rating":10,"date":"28 July 2018","review":"As a comic book nerd and a Dad of kids who love the show as much as I do, I was thrilled when I found out they were making a movie. The wit, sarcasm and cameos from the DC and Marvel universe are awesome. Teen TItans Go to the movies is exactly what fans of the franchise want and need. My kids range from 6-14 and we had a great time. They laughed. I laughed. The entire theatre laughed.","user":"Cizzurp215","rank":[70,84]},{"title":"A rating from a 10 year old","rating":10,"date":"4 August 2018","review":"Let's think for a moment.... this film is predominantly aimed at children. So I asked my 10 year old what she thought<br><br>LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! I would defiantly see it again<br><br>From an adult point of view - I took 3 children (8,9 &amp;10) who laughed all the way through it. I was entertained with the songs and wit and also the nostalgic references.","user":"tinkerbellflyin","rank":[75,91]},{"title":"Better than what I expected.","rating":10,"date":"27 July 2018","review":"It was different then Teen Titans Go!
