[{"title":"Amazing for what it is!","rating":8,"date":"13 February 2015","review":"\"Dragonheart 3: The Sourcerer's Curse\" is a fun fantasy movie with brilliant action sequences and just enough story to keep most viewers entertained. The film is immediately better than its \"A New Beginning\" predecessor and is a decent sequel to the original, incorporating enough of the lore and original score to make any fan geek out for a moment.<br><br>The film starts out at a brilliant pace, but is held back by some really glossy character development towards the middle, but is ultimately redeemed by its final action set piece and good casting choices. It is not clear where the film takes place in the time-line, but it seems to take place decades or even a century or two before the first film on the series.<br><br>The ending sets up the now confirmed \"Dragonheart 4\" which will be a great film if Universal can continue and/or improve the the quality.<br><br>Most of the people giving this film a low rating have not even seen the film and are a disgrace to critics everywhere.","user":"Rorimor","rank":[32,45]},{"title":"Love all things DragonHeart","rating":10,"date":"12 February 2015","review":"I think we all know that nothing will ever compare to the original DragonHeart and Draco will always be the best dragon of all time, but I really enjoyed this sequel. Much better than the second(though I still enjoyed that one as a kiddo). Its a little cheesy, but I still loved it. I might just be a huge DragonHeart nerd. I liked the story line, I think they put more thought into it this time around. It was a fun adventure and the effects of the curse were very interesting! I enjoyed most of the characters. I feel it must be a requirement of the DragonHeart movies to have an annoying monk ha but they all grow on you. I think Drago and Gareth were fantastic. This is a fun new chapter to the wonderful story that we have known and loved for almost 20 years.","user":"hugs_ponies_and_vampireb","rank":[27,38]},{"title":"Third sequel with sympathetic performances , attractive characters and spectacular scenarios .","rating":6,"date":"2 May 2019","review":"Entertaining fantasy movie with thrills , emotion and state-of-art special effects bringing the fabulous dragon to life .¨Dragonheart 3 The Sorcerer's Curse¨ by Colin Teague boasts a passsable cast cast as Ben Kingsley , Julian Morris , Tamzin Merchant , Roger Ashton-Griffiths , Christopher Fairnbank , Jake Curran , all of them get together to battle and protect themselves from a ruthless sorcerer : Jonjo O'Neill .
