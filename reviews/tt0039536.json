[{"title":"Intense Noir Thriller","rating":20,"date":"20 December 2001","review":"Henry Hathaway does a bang-up job directing this taut, realistic gangster noir. With the exception of a couple of domestic scenes with Mature and his family, this film never lets up.  In one of the most unique film debuts, Richard Widmark steals the show with his portrayal of the giggling, psychopathic killer Tommy Udo. There is no doubt about who is the star of this movie.  Victor Mature gives a fine performance as the basically decent guy who turns \"stoolie\" and  for whom you have sympathy and the rest of the cast is strong in support.....but it is Widmark who mesmerizes you with his performance.  The oft cited senseless violence of the \"wheelchair pushed down the stair\" scene is still one that makes you turn away.  The real life New York City setting adds more realism and the black and white cinematography is excellent, capturing shadows which foretell the violence that is coming.  Look for Karl Malden in a small part, early in his career. This is a classic of the noir genre and should be added to your film library.","user":"Bucs1960","rank":[36,37]},{"title":"A Tale Of Two Crooks - One With A Heart, One Without One","rating":13,"date":"13 May 2006","review":"This was a 1940s film noir with a little bit different slant: the main character \"Nick Bianco\" (Victor Mature) being a caring father. Here's a guy torn between being a crook most of his life and the damage it did to him mentally, but at heart a real softie who is desperate to go straight and just be a regular family guy with everyone leaving him alone. In the story, he turns \"stoolie\" so he can earn that freedom and be that family man.<br><br>Among film noir buffs, however, this film is noted more for Richard Widmark's debut as the sadistic \"Tommy Udo.\" One of the most famous noir scenes of all time is \"Udo\" throwing an old lady in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs! Widmark puts on a fake pair of choppers giving him an exaggerated overbite to go along with his insane little giggle. He also calls everyone a \"squirt.\" His over- the-top performance puts a lot a spark into this film which, otherwise would have wound up more as a melodrama.<br><br>Two other actors have key roles in here: Brian Donlevy and Colleen Gray (making her credited film debut, too1). Donlevey plays a character who never see in modern-day films: a compassionate district attorney who goes out of his way to help \"Nick.\" It's refreshing to see, for a change. Gray becomes Nick's love interest and is a very appealing wholesome type, as are the two sweet little girls Nick had with his former wife who killed herself while Nick was in prison. Gray becomes the step-mother.<br><br>Although not spectacular, the film is entertaining, especially the suspenseful last 20 minutes. It's quite dated in spots but Widmark's character alone is worth investigating this film if you've never seen it. I'm surprised there aren't more reviews of this.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[46,48]},{"title":"A Shocking Screen Debut","rating":8,"date":"26 December 2005","review":"Richard Widmark belongs to a select few players who from their screen debut became instant stars. No bit parts, no walk-ons, Widmark's first feature role netted him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and stardom.<br><br>Widmark's portrayal of Tommy Udo in Kiss of Death shocked audiences nationwide. When Widmark tied up Mildred Dunnock and threw her down a flight of stairs, gasps aplenty came from audiences. That maniacal giggle became his trademark and fodder for impressionists from then on in. Widmark in fact had to really convince his bosses at 20th Century Fox that he was capable of more than being a psychopathic killer.<br><br>Widmark was fourth billed in this film and so dominates it that it's forgotten that Victor Mature is the lead and contributes a good performance in his own right. Mature is a career criminal who was left holding the bag for his associates during a jewel heist. He refuses to rat them out and gets a stretch in prison for it. By his refusal to be a stoolie, Mature gains the friendship of Widmark who has a special hatred for the breed.<br><br>Things then go bad for Mature when his wife commits suicide and his two little daughters wind up in an orphanage. At that point he rethinks becoming a stoolie for District Attorney Brian Donlevy and the main action of the film begins.<br><br>Mature gives a very good performance of a man running out of options. He's caught between concern for his family and living up to the honor system that criminals have among themselves. Brian Donlevy, usually a villain, does a good job as the District Attorney.<br><br>One other performance is worthy of note. Though he only has a few scenes, criminal defense attorney Taylor Holmes is also a real stand out. His Earle Houser is definitely one of the sleaziest lawyers ever portrayed on the screen. <br><br>For all the many good performances Richard Widmark has given in his 91 years, his debut film turned out to be the only time he was ever nominated for an Oscar. That's a shame because I could think of a couple of other films like Night and the City, Pickup on South Street and Panic in the Streets that would have been worthy of consideration. <br><br>Hopefully the American Film Institute will give Widmark a Lifetime Achievement Award and soon.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[55,60]}]
