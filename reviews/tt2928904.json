[{"title":"Dont know what they were thinking","rating":1,"date":"30 December 2018","review":"One person is talking and a movie track plays in the backround with sound louder than the narrater and they decide to play guitar music on top of that. I lasted about 5 mins then turned off","user":"mickerick2000","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Yikes! Bad!","rating":1,"date":"10 January 2019","review":"This movie begins with a guy in jeans, a white shirt, a grey tie that is tied way too short, a blazer on which is pinned a plastic badge. That tells you the quality of this film right off the bat.\nIt's horrible.\nPoorly written poorly directed poorly acted.<br><br>Early on there was a sort of hot babe typing. Wanted her to get nake. She didnt.\nDon't waste your time.","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[5,12]},{"title":"a well executed documentary..","rating":10,"date":"3 January 2020","review":"Based on other reviews here, people are mistaking a beautifully executed documentary as a poorly executed narrative action film.... it is a documentary with creative recreations, animations, crime scene photos, and a magnificent sound track for a documentary.. and to that end, tells an amazing story that I never heard of. If you like a good true crime doc that this is as good as one can ask for.. it also will have you researching this story, as it did me..","user":"jim-2147","rank":[0,0]}]
