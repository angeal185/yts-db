[{"title":"R.E:A Fun & Entertaining Horror Film!","rating":7,"date":"30 April 2006","review":"I watched the film Deathspa under the title Witchbitch in 1990 and i found it quite enjoyable, It is fairly difficult to find but worth it.<br><br>The following review contains *Spoilers*<br><br>This film is not your conventional slasher flick but more of a horror/mystery film that does not take itself too seriously. The story is about a health spa which has been cursed by the spirit of a woman named Catherine who dies shockingly and her husband and brother work there. Unexplainable accidents and even deaths occur in the health spa and while this happens two detectives try to unfold these unexplainable occurrences, could Catherine be responsible for all the mayhem going on at the Starbody Health Spa.<br><br>We are introduced to at least a couple of dozen characters of various stereotypes including two workers in the club who are con artists, bimbos and vain people that like nothing more than to look good.<br><br>This film also contains many classic death scenes including a woman who is killed with a food processor!It also has many celebrity cameo appearances from Karyn Parsons who played Hilary in the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air and Brenda Bakke from Demon Knight.<br><br>Recommended to horror fans who want to watch a film for enjoyment and have some fun 7 out of 10!","user":"laslowhite","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"From A Time When The Horror Genre Was Done Right","rating":7,"date":"2 October 2015","review":"If someone asked me to define 80s horror there's a lot of obvious films to select from, but this would be one of my choices. Between the body obsessed people, the slasher elements, the nudity and the blood, this kind of says it all about your typical 1980s horror film. What's cool about this one though is it's no ordinary slasher. There are your typical red herrings and very inventive kills, but there's also a great supernatural element that at first seems fake but then turns out to be very real and changes the whole dynamic of Death Spa. The movie does seem a bit more brutal than your standard fare as far as it's tortuous ways of killing people and all the bloody/boiled corpses it is willing to show us. That's perfect for those of us who enjoy some dirtier grindhouse elements in our horror movies. I assure you, as typical as this film may feel at first stick with it because whether you enjoy Friday The 13th, The Exorcist or Jungle Holocaust this should appeal to you in some way.","user":"AllNewSux","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Laughable Bad 1980's Gorefest","rating":6,"date":"13 March 2005","review":"Wow - this movie is fun and bad all at the same time. I'm amazed at how many people rent \"horror\" movies expecting them to actually be good - good in a sense of a strong story, decent plot, top notch acting and true scary moments - don't they realize that for every truly good horror film (and they are rare) there are fifty bad ones? And out of those fifty bad ones, there are maybe ten that rise to a new level - ones that are so bad that they are entertaining for all the wrong reasons - ridiculous script, bad acting, lame music and horrible directing. DEATH SPA is one of those - they rip-off many other movies including CARRIE, The EXORCIST and actually another murder spree in a gym movie, KILLER WORKOUT. Now Killer Workout is actually more fun and more lame but Death Spa has some hilarious moments. DEfinitely worth checking out for you fans of cheesy and laughable horror movies.","user":"shark-43","rank":[20,30]}]
