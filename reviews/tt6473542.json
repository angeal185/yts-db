[{"title":"don't believe the positive reviews","rating":1,"date":"18 August 2019","review":"Watched this movie to see why it got such high reviews. when the plot sounded weak. thought i'd give it a chance. regretting that i did. all i can think is the 9/10-10/10 reviews where written by friends and family of the people in the film.\nstay away.","user":"honeyrydar","rank":[31,42]},{"title":"Great concept and movie","rating":9,"date":"31 March 2020","review":"What a really great idea for a movie! And done so well. There was terrific suspense, comedy, horror. All rather ingeniously blended. The story was always moving forward, the pace never slacked. And wow, what great acting. Hey, I just paid $20 for The Invisible Man on Amazon. Big budget and actors. And this little indie was better made and more suspenseful. And it was free! Yay!","user":"directortim2012","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Every over 5 star review here is fake","rating":3,"date":"3 December 2019","review":"I am so sick to death of IMDB doing nothing about new release movies being flooded with fake reviews to make it sell a movie.<br><br>The movie is not scary, funny, great or worth a rental. Who rents these days any way?<br><br>In fact this has got to be the worst ending let down to any movie of 2019.<br><br>It's not terribly made, the acting is decent, plot is ok, editing etc us all fine. But it has an anticlimax and went no where. Why bother to set up characters with no pay off for this rushed ending that made it seem like it should have been either a short indie film on YouTube or a 25 minute long episide of Goosebumps.<br><br>Avoid it, you'll hate wasting your time on this that you will never get back.","user":"MikeHunt1075","rank":[15,20]}]
