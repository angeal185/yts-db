[{"title":"Old film, new title.","rating":4,"date":"14 August 2018","review":"Something struck me immediately as a bit off with this movie; it looked old, like mid 2000s clothes and film... So I look at the imdb page and sure enough this seems to be the director's previous film from 2008 just retitled and repackaged as a horror.<br><br>It might appeal to fans of old mumblecore Adam Wingard, like Pop Skull or Horrible Way to Die, but it is tangentially related to horror at best.","user":"imnicholls","rank":[26,28]},{"title":"Terrible Amateurish Movie","rating":2,"date":"27 August 2018","review":"The terrible amateurish \"Enter the Wild\" is one of those overrated movies in IMDb with the wrong genre (horror?). The storyline is awful with a screenplay that does not develop the unpleasant characters and uses the most absurd situations and dialogues. The pace is inadequate and boring, and the dismal camera framework is ridiculous, cutting the heads of the characters in every close-up. The cinematography and locations are also very poor. It is funny to see the gorgeous Ella Scott Lynch wearing mini-skirt in the wild and changing clothes many times along their journey. Watching this movie is a complete waste of time. My vote is two.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"Slow. Non-horror. Lame.","rating":2,"date":"15 August 2018","review":"Just completely boring, slow, not the slightest bit scary. Not a horror movie from any angle. Don't waste your time. Best of all there is no ending.","user":"timothycrugnale","rank":[23,25]}]
