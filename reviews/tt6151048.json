[{"title":"My Review Of \"Between The Trees\"","rating":6,"date":"4 May 2019","review":"The story teases a cryptoid style horror but that is only in the dialog at the beginning between the main characters. I thought it was going in. It was not. What unfolds is a nicely concealed, layered horror story that brings hints of \"madman\" and \"mutants\". Douglas does a good job of regulating how much of the deeper plot elements get revealed. At some level the complexity of the movie elevates the experience of watching the story unfold.<br><br>The cast is fully committed to the characters. Unfortunately they are not developed to the level that makes you connect with them. They are thinly veiled stereotypes, overdrawn. None are likeable. Still, \"Between The Trees\" has some stuff happening that is interesting, and there is some atmosphere that keeps your attention. It does go left midway when some comic relief appears- and falls flat.<br><br>Special effects, minus CGI gunfire, stays practical. It is pretty good work and, even though it is limited, is a pleasure to see onscreen. The creature design and concept is a bit lackluster, kind of like a theme park mutant from a haunted attraction. Still the idea of It all is chillingly delightful. Overall, \"Between The Trees\" has as much working in its favor as it has going against it. It's worth checking out and despite it's flaws it is mildly enjoyable.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Backwoods craziness","rating":5,"date":"26 February 2019","review":"Steve's marriage is just about over. To escape, he and three of his closest friends head to the mountains to relax for the weekend. However, things are only beginning to go wrong, as a killer is on the loose and what was once a getaway has turned into a battle to survive.<br><br>Soon, our protagonists SUV has been vandalized and strange inhuman footprints are found all around their cabin. Add in some definitely monstrous screams and it seems everyone is in trouble. They are, that is, until they shoot the monster.All good? Nope. It turns out that the beast they got was just the kid version...<br><br>I liked Michael Draper's nerdy character the best here, wearing a ridiculous sweater and throwing up nearly any time he's in danger. And oh boy, these guys are in danger for most of the film.This is a fine monster/rural horror low budget movie. It's quick, has some surprises and scares.","user":"BandSAboutMovies","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Lots of area for improvement","rating":2,"date":"5 October 2019","review":"There's a lot of areas this could've been improved I don't think the story is very strongly written and the individuals who do the acting are either trying to over act or are doing characters that are above their scope of their abilities.","user":"brixtonwa","rank":[1,3]}]
