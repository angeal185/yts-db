I have a bias against \"shaky cam\" and it needed a bit of editing. Some moments were paced fast and others went on too long and you could see people get out of character etc. If the grading was a little more \"hollywood\" like hustle and flow, ray etc it would have been better in my opinion. Digicam + too sharp doesn't suit this movie. The drive by scene is one of the most realistic gun sequences I have seen for a while.","user":"shadako","rank":[0,0]}]
