[{"title":"Straight to DVD sequel can't hold a candle to brilliant, Chihuahua #1","rating":3,"date":"9 April 2011","review":"For those of you who loved Beverly Hills Chihuahua (including myself), I am sad to report that Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is not a worthy sequel to its enormously entertaining predecessor. Obviously patched together rather quickly to capitalize on the success of Chihuahua #1, BHC2 is a straight to DVD concoction. All the actors have been replaced except for George Lopez who reprises the voice of Papi. Also missing are stars Jaime Lee Curtis, who had a short but effective role as the dog loving businesswoman, Aunt Viv, and Drew Barrymore who had the starring (voice) role as Chloe.<br><br>BHC2 begins right away with the wedding of Papi and Chloe. A few months later Chloe gives birth to a brood of five pups, four girls and a boy. Chloe's owner, Rachel and her mother Aunt Viv, are off on a trip to the Amazon rain forest and have even lesser roles here than in the original 'Chihuahua'. The audience is further short-changed when Delgado, the German Shepard former police dog, is relegated to a supporting role as he attempts to locate his long lost 'sons' who are now police dogs for LAPD.<br><br>It takes a very long time before we break into 'Act 2' in BHC2 and that occurs when Sam and his parents (the Cortez's) are faced with losing the family home. While BHC1 had a menacing and realistic drug cartel member as an antagonist (coupled with his equally scary canine counterpart, 'El Diablo'), all BHC2 can muster up is a buffoonish bank executive, entrusted with taking possession of the Cortez family home.<br><br>Sam needs to come up with $50K cash so they decide to enter a prestigious dog show. Somehow, the dogs are allowed to enter the contest without any investigation into their pedigree. It's only after Papi ends up winning (by arranging flower petals into the shape of a heart) that it finally occurs to the stuffy lead judge, that Papi isn't a full pedigree. Papi is disqualified and Sam is back to square one, trying to figure out how to get the cash to prevent foreclosure of their home.<br><br>The 'dark moment' at the end of the Second Act occurs when the puppies follow Delgado who's still looking for his long lost sons. Sam, Papi and Chloe are frantic that the little ones are now lost. The puppies end up in duffel bags containing stolen cash, carried by criminals who have just robbed a bank. Papi's brother, Pedro, finds a cap belonging to the one of the robbers and the scent leads the dogs to a bread factory, where they rescue the puppies and chase the robbers out, into the arms of the police.<br><br>Unlike BHC1, which had an extremely inventive plot and all kinds of interesting characters and production numbers (remember that wonderful 'Aztec warrior' Chihauhau dance?), BHC2 is simply a formulaic Disney second-rate comedy. While BHC1 was full of laugh out loud jokes, BHC2 simply expects us to laugh merely by offering up a bunch of talking dogs without the wit of the original. For those who haven't seen BHC1, please pick up a copy; and try to forget the sequel!","user":"Turfseer","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"More Chihuahuas!!","rating":8,"date":"1 February 2011","review":"I liked the original Beverly Hills Chihuahua well enough. It certainly wasn't spectacular, but it was OK. I remember saying at the time: \"It needs more chihuahuas.\" Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 answers my request. Chloe and Papi are back with a litter of puppies. They have some really cute adventures and save the day with chihuahua can-do. The film is quick too, with an 84 minute run time. It is a nice little kids movie. The dogs are cute as buttons, which I think is the point of these movies. My 12 year old enjoyed that. I did as well. I think adults will like it too as long as they remember that it is a Disney children's movie about talking dogs. Unfortunately, Drew Barrymore does not return as the voice of Chloe.","user":"Wolford","rank":[11,20]},{"title":"Simply Splendid Family Comedy","rating":7,"date":"7 July 2011","review":"Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is an irresistible Disney comedy with tons of adventure that is perfect for the entire family! It is directed by Alex Zamm and written by Dannah Feinglass, Danielle Schneider, and Jeffrey Bushell. <br><br>Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is about two newlywed Chihuahuas named Papi and Chloe who start a family. Chloe gives birth to 5 impetuous and reckless puppies, but the pups soon get their act together when they find out their human owners have trouble paying off the mortgages for their house. The dogs decide to enter the Beverly Hills dog show in hope for the $50,000 prize to help their owners keep the house, but unfortunately, the dogs do not win. However, a bank robbery occurs and the pups decide to stop the crime. Their mischievousness leads them to capturing the robbers and saving the day, but will this good deed be enough to stop the bank from foreclosing their human owners' house? The voice over of the movie is excellent. The dogs' voices fit their personalities well and the voice over contains a lot of emotion. For example, Delgado (voiced over by Miguel Ferrer) who is a sleuthhound, had a husky voice which matched well with his appearance as well as his role in the movie. Papi's voice also adjusted well to things that were going on in the movie. For example, when he told his pups nightly bedtime stories, his voice would become low in pitch and he would sound mysterious. <br><br>The movie is also very comical. I found myself giggling in almost every scene! This movie overall is exhilarating and it contains heartwarming messages such as \"true love is worth any risk,\" \"love fearlessly, and help others share their hearts as well,\" \"family is about who you love, not just who you are born to,\" \"we are stronger together than we are alone,\" and \"stick by your loved ones, even in hard times.\" The message \"stick by your loved ones, even in hard times,\" is perhaps the most significant message in the movie because Papi's entire family as well as his owners' family tried their best to prevent the bank from foreclosing their home. <br><br>I would recommend this movie to ages 6 and up. Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 is a splendid family film, but if director Alex Zamm created more suspense while the dogs were enjoying their escapades, the movie would have created a bigger impact on the audience and hence, become more captivating. Nevertheless, all in all, this film is perfect for anyone who wants to watch a humorous entertaining adventure about talking dogs! <br><br>Reviewed by Gabriella Chu, KIDS FIRST!
