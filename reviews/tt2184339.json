[{"title":"\"Because Moviegoers Love Stupid Characters!\"","rating":2,"date":"8 June 2013","review":"DIRECTOR: Good afternoon, sirs! I came in today because I was stoned out of my mind earlier and I thought of the best idea for a movie ever! STUDIO: Alright, we're listening! DIRECTOR: So, like, in the near future, the government will allow 12 hours of crime a year! Like, murder will be legal and stuff! STUDIO: Okay, cool! Why? DIRECTOR:Uh... well... because if people go crazy on one day, then they won't need to do any other crimes the rest of the year! Because all crimes are created by random murderous passions, right? ONLY SMART GUY IN THE ROOM: Why don't the rich people just leave the country? That's the worst idea I- STUDIO: That's so original! People will eat that up. And it can double as a shallow social commentary! DIRECTOR: Uh... yeah... social commentary. I know what that is. Anyways, I got Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke to sign on! STUDIO: Fantastic! I bet you have lots of good dialogue to go between them.<br><br>DIRECTOR: Yeah... good dialogue... I know what that is. Anyways, the dad sells these security systems and the mom is... well... a mom, I guess. She can sulk a lot. And the older female kid can be a \"typical\" sulky teenager who is completely brain dead! She won't see anything suspicious when her much-older boyfriend, who her father disapproves of, sneaks into her house on the night murder is legal and says he's come to see her dad! And the also brain-dead boyfriend can botch his low-awaited parent killing by yelling out the dad's name before shooting! He'll die and then the shocked girlfriend will cry and then wander around the dark house by herself for no reason! ONLY SMART GUY IN THE ROOM: Uh, why would the boyfriend think she'd continue to date him after he killed her dad? That's an awful and unnecessary i- STUDIO: Perfect! It'll be tense when she wanders around because we really care about her character! Who else is there?<br><br>DIRECTOR: Well, there'll be another son with that awful super-long hair that's popular with horror movie boys nowadays! He'll be reclusive and play with creepy remote control dolls and he'll be the only moral character in the movie while being completely moronic! He will shut down the security system without letting his parents know in order to let a homeless guy in, and then he'll hide him, even though that means his whole family will die. And then, when he sees his sister about to go hide in the same spot, he won't yell out or warn her or anything! And then even later on, he'll hide in the basement and STILL let one of the invaders sneak up behind him, even though he has a gun! STUDIO: He sounds so lovable! What about the other characters? Are they dumb too? DIRECTOR: Oh yeah, super dumb! For example, the dad will have a complete 180 degree moral change halfway through the movie even though he sees the purge first hand, as if he didn't already know about it because he sells security systems for the purge! And then, he won't even untie the guy he's saving so he can help! He's completely retarded. And then there's the wife! Instead of hiding and having the advantage against the invaders, she can get up and wander around so she can be snuck up on! And then she won't shoot the guy who's threatening to kill her daughter because... well... she's stupid! And finally, the lead bad guy will try to kill the main character, but stops and leaves after giving him a flesh wound in the stomach! And then gets snuck up on, too! <br><br>STUDIO: That's wonderful! Movie goers are much more likely to cheer for stupid characters than intelligent ones! DIRECTOR: Oh and the invaders will wear masks like \"The Strangers\"! STUDIO: Great, that movie was terrifying! ONLY SMART GUY IN THE ROOM: No it wasn't, that movie was awf- DIRECTOR: I'll be sure to include the max amounts of clichés, too! Like, a bad guy will be ABOUT to kill a main character, but there'll be a dramatic pause before he does, and seconds before it happens, he'll get killed from behind! STUDIO: Genius! That should happen AT LEAST 4 times.<br><br>DIRECTOR: And for the icing on the cake, the invaders will be like cultists and recite prayer-like incantations dedicated to America and the \"new founding fathers\" because that's what would happen in real life, right? STUDIO: Perfect! Let's get this movie made. ONLY SMART GUY IN THE ROOM: **** this, I quit.","user":"OrsonLannister","rank":[715,828]},{"title":"What went wrong","rating":1,"date":"23 September 2013","review":"I usually don't write reviews but this one was infuriating. I am going to list all of the things that do not make sense in this movie.<br><br>1. The kid that lets in the stranger. This kid is unrealistic and does not have his own character. At one point he is so afraid of the purge and shows his knowledge for it so much. It is probably not his first purge either, yet he shows so much ignorance for what is going on, as if he was born yesterday. If I was a kid, and I was afraid of the purge, I would just watch the surveillance camera for 12 hours making sure nobody gets in. Instead, he opens ever door in the house on the most dangerous night of the year to a man who looks like he has nothing else to lose. His decisions were purely moral, but not of a kid in fear. If my father was fighting for my family's lives, the least I can do is sit in the corner and shut up.<br><br>2. Now more of the purge itself, it seems unrealistic that so many people would actually participate in this act. OK, lets pretend for a moment here that this purge DOES actually release anger. Do people have so much anger trapped inside that they would risk their own lives just to relieve anger? The only people, I would assume participating in this, would be people who have nothing else to lose and people who have a particular grudge on someone. But lets say you do have a grudge and you happen to kill this one person. You not only risk getting killed yourself, but their family members will come after you on the next purge, putting you and your family members at more risk. This movie pretends that laws and legal regulations are the only things preventing murder on the streets, but people consider reputation and networking as well. <br><br>3. The \"bad guys\" in the movie. Particularly the women. This night is the most dangerous night of the year. And you're running around with a knife? I thought you guys were good at this \"purge\" thing. You can afford equipment that can demolish high tech security but you can't afford guns? Why don't you just stay inside? Your chances of living are very slim.<br><br>4. So apparently, these bad guys are huge fans of the purge, but they spend most of their night waiting in front of a house just to kill one guy. In that time, they could have killed hundreds. But no. They NEEDED this one guy.<br><br>5. Why is murder the only crime being committed? I would assume robbery is the number one crime being committed. I think a huge robbery movie would have been a better theme. Everyone would just steal each others' stuff. It would be like a huge capture the flag game.<br><br>If you haven't noticed, this movie made me very angry (especially the kid). Do not watch this movie.","user":"shinwi","rank":[156,185]},{"title":"The Purge","rating":4,"date":"12 February 2018","review":"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br><br>First off, this film could have been amazing. The plot and premise are very original and had a lot of potential. But sadly, the story is full of clichés such as stupid teenage kids, bad decisions, and clueless villains. If they had only made the film in a way that we could see multiple Purge stories, it would have been better. The ending is the probably the best part of the story.<br><br>The acting is okay at best. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey perform the best. Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane play two of the most annoying, stupid, and idiotic characters I have ever laid eyes on. <br><br>The film starts off very slow and continues to have slow pacing until the end.<br><br>The blood and gore aspect of the film is very good. This is one of the highest points about the film.<br><br>Pros: Very original story, the ending, good acting from Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey, and a good use of blood and gore<br><br>Cons: Slow pacing, wasted potential with the story, annoying characters, Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane and their terrible performance, and a lot of clichés<br><br>Overall Rating: 4.3","user":"WubsTheFadger","rank":[13,13]}]
