[{"title":"Boring from start to finish","rating":1,"date":"18 November 2018","review":"John Cusac is just in this for the sake of a well known name I think. Terrible acting, terrible camera work and the story isn't great. Infactual as in police work in solving murders and so on. Just another rubbish movie that had enough money spent on it that it could have been a half decent movie, but NO, total rubbish movie, don't waste your time.","user":"miki-watt72","rank":[25,29]},{"title":"The acting, dialogue and people are so bad","rating":1,"date":"16 November 2018","review":"This is really bad.\nThe script is pathetic but the cardboard actors make it worse.\nEverything about this movie is cringeworthy.\nNo excuse!","user":"binthaider-755-822849","rank":[27,33]},{"title":"Zero Character Chemistry","rating":3,"date":"25 November 2018","review":"Husband and wife don't kiss on the lips. The bedroom scene is shot in individual half screen clips even though they are supposedly in the same bed talking.<br><br>Acting is horrid. But the worst is the wife. How did she make it past screening?<br><br>I watched it for the concept of what the story represented. The acting made it painful.","user":"reg-18226","rank":[23,30]}]
