[{"title":"You gotta admire Tallulah!","rating":7,"date":"28 August 1999","review":"Two ways we enjoy movies are 1) to share the emotional life of characters in a great story, regardless of the performer, and 2) to watch a great performer, regardless of the story.  \"Die! Die My Darling\" \"Fanatic\"] falls into the latter category; here, Tallulah Bankhead is the great performer.  Bankhead was, it is popularly believed, in the depths of alcohol abuse when she made this classic melodramatic thriller.  Yet, she turns-in a terr(or)ific performance.  Alcohol abuse may have helped her to slur some lines in that unique drawl of hers, but the well-experienced actress that she is - underneath the numb - shines thru by having clearly planned ahead to alternate her episodes of sweetness and rage, and performs them with well-crafted notes.  It's an absolute tour-de-force: That ET-like bourbon voice of hers croaking out commands to her servants; like a witch shrieking \"Liar!\" to Stefanie Powers (and slapping her silly!); and looking like a backsliding soul at her most pitiful digging in her closet for a secret stash.  And my favorite image: force-feeding a sermon to Stefanie Powers at gunpoint (Bankhead holding the Bible *and* a gun in her hands!).  The story that sets all this into motion:  Bankhead receives a visit from her dead son's one-time fiance, played by Stefanie Powers.  Bankhead, a religious fanatic [thus the other title to this movie], presumes her son's betrothal to Powers means that they *are* husband and wife - FOR ETERNITY!  Powers plays along, at first, but reveals little truths that counter the religious Bankhead's plans for her son's eternal peace; Bankhead, then, turns determined to \"save\" her son's Grace by keeping Powers pure.  And so it goes from that, with escalating animosity. Bankhead is great.  The production design is great (sets and color), and Yootha Joyce as the housemaid Anna is also terrific.  Powers, however, grossly overacts; but, to her credit, she lets Yootha Joyce really lay into her with obviously no stunt-doubles between them. That was fun.  Oh, there's also a couple homage to PSYCHO: recall that scene in Psycho when Vera Miles screams and flails an arm to set swinging the overhead lamp upon entering the fruit cellar.  There's an instance when Powers screams and does the same with an overhead lamp.  At that moment, listen to the soundtrack: it shrieks for a measure or two like Psycho's shower scene shrieking violins.  Cool.  I'll let you find the second \"borrowing\" from Psycho; it's not as obvious.  For some campy fun, definitely rent this'n.  Powers is a snitty over-acter, and she'll annoy you, but you'll feel she gets what she deserves when the Ol' Lady smacks the stuffing out of her.  Plus, Bankhead simply saying the line \"Milk?!\" will make it all worthwhile - and that's just at the beginning...!","user":"Sardony","rank":[30,31]},{"title":"A young woman goes to visit her overbearing, religious fanatic ex-mother-in-law who decides it's time the girl joined her dead son in the grave.","rating":15,"date":"15 September 2000","review":"This effectively creepy little Gothic horror tale is one of Hammer's finest psychological-thrillers, and a valiant attempt to duplicate the success of American thrillers like \"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?\" and \"HUSH..., HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE\" featuring aging, flamboyant female stars in macabre, unusual roles. This film is a showcase for the talents of the great Tallulah Bankhead whose last film this was. She manages to be both amusing and terrifying at the same time. It's a blissful performance, and next to LIFEBOAT it's her finest hour on screen. A very young Stefanie Powers(then age 23) also comes through with a remarkably strong performance as the terrorized daughter-in-law. The movie also features Peter Vaughan as Bankhead's menacing handyman, and in an early role Donald Sutherland as an imbecile who also works at the place. The workman-like script was written by Richard Matheson, from the novel NIGHTMARE by Anne Blaisdell.","user":"verna55","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"Chew! Chew! The Scenery!","rating":6,"date":"8 February 2001","review":"What inspired casting!  The libidinous Tallulah Bankhead as a drab, sober, religious zealot!  That alone is worth the price of admission.  Thanks to Bette and Joan, the 60s era of Grand Guignol brought some of our favorite glossy \"middle-aged\" legends back to the somewhat less glossy cinematic limelight.  Debbie Reynolds, Shelley Winters, Olivia de Havilland, Geraldine Page, Agnes Moorehead, and Ruth Gordon all took the Gothic plunge.  The prerequisites?  Simple.  Look like hell and act like a mad bull in a china shop.  So why not grand ol' Tallulah, dahling?<br><br>Here, the \"Alabama Foghorn,\" as Fred Mertz once called her when she guested (hilariously so) on an episode of \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour,\" is called upon to play the prim, tight-lipped Mrs. Trefoile, a wacko bible-thumper whose only child died a short time before.  When her dead son's fiancee (Stefanie Powers) comes to pay an overdue visit out of respect, she makes a big whoops and tells the old lady that she is about to marry another man. And now the fun begins...<br><br>Urged on by her Maker (of course) to exorcise the young girl's demons and restore her purity (she wears that blasphemous red lipstick, you see) and, oh yeah, also to punish her (of course)for her mortal wickedness and ultimate betrayal to her dead son, the old lady (of course) imprisons the young damsel in her medieval-styled lair for a week's worth of (naturally) bible verse and repentance.  But then the old crackpot decides she'd be better served if she (you know) takes it up a notch and makes her (of course) a sacrificial lamb instead.  See, Trefoile finds out that the girl is still a virgin so (of course) if the girl's still a virgin, her soul can still be (you know) saved and, at the same time, she can be reunited with Trafoile's dead son in heaven, which better serves his memory.  You know, kill, I mean save, two birds with one stone.<br><br>Seeing Bankhead cavorting around as a dowdy, highly repressed teetotaler while spewing passages from Revelations is an admittedly sinful pleasure. What's even better is that the old girl gets away with it. As bizarre and campy as one could hope for, Bankhead's Mrs. Trefoile is still all prickly seriousness and deadly menace, possessing a convincingly firm, fervent gait. She doesn't really play the joke.  Moreover, she manages to slightly stroke audience sympathy with human shadings of loneliness and utter despair. The atmosphere is appropriately claustrophobic and suspense is built up expertly too, with every Bankhead entrance punctuated by creepy, stringy harpsichord music.<br><br>Fun too is watching Bankhead's Addams Family-like household run amok, especially Donald Sutherland as a mute, dim-witted servant -- a role I'm sure he'd love to erase permanently from his resume. Poor bruised and bloodied Stefanie Powers does yeoman's work here, gaining our sympathy from the onset and making a wonderfully feisty \"straight man\" to the Bankhead histrionics.<br><br>And just wait until the skeletons come out of the closet.  Like you knew they would!  Bankhead's final curtain in the flick is a great wallow.  And speaking of final curtains, this was regrettably her last feature film.","user":"gbrumburgh","rank":[29,32]}]
