[{"title":"It's not that bad","rating":14,"date":"14 September 2019","review":"This film tells the story of a private investigator who goes back to his hometown to investigate a case.<br><br>The story is actually quite engaging and suspenseful. The fear of the king of the small town is palpable. It is much better than the rating suggests. It's not that bad at all.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[22,26]},{"title":"It's worth more than it's rated","rating":6,"date":"25 May 2019","review":"Forget some of the film's flaws. It's an entertaining film-noir type of the 1940s. Travolta is not an ideal PI, but a joy to see him act with Morgan Freeman and Brendan Fraser.<br><br>If you like film noirs of the 1940s, don't miss The Poison Rose","user":"byron-116","rank":[57,74]},{"title":"Predictable but entertaining.","rating":7,"date":"28 May 2019","review":"The film starts like a typical Chinatown syndrome.\nThe locations r gorgeous with those plentiful awesome greenery all around.\nIt has some violent shootout scenes but the best is Freeman's screen presence, Fraser's laughable body shape n Travolta's cool act.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[59,77]}]
