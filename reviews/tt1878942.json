[{"title":"For GAY and SRAIGHT dudes.","rating":9,"date":"2 March 2014","review":"As a gay man, I'm happy to see a gay-related-film without sex scenes or stereotypical characters. There's no flags, awkward coming outs, clich√©s or any of that. In fact, this isn't as much a gay-related film as it is about friendship. We get to see two guys, both dealing with their newly discovered difference and trying to stay friends in their own way.<br><br>For the straight audience, I believe this can be equally funny and touching. The movie really shows how a straight guy can still be friends with a gay dude. Nothing has to change. Also, it's nice to see a gay character that isn't effeminate, overly dramatic or promiscuous. An original and refreshing teen story I must say.","user":"jorgequeiros-pt","rank":[47,58]},{"title":"Finally a movie without stereotypical gay characters","rating":20,"date":"20 February 2014","review":"I've watched plenty of gay movies/series and unfortunately they always tend to stick to the same stereotype of the \"queen\", colourful, flamboyant gay men. This one finally breaks free from that mould and presents a consistent coming out/of age story with a non-stereotypical gay main character, someone who doesn't like musical theatre, Britney Spears and is actually on the chubby side, which was quite refreshing to see. Granted, it's still a teen/prom movie like oh so many out there, but the acting was fine throughout and the setting/location was pleasant too. It was good to see some familiar faces like Dakota Johnson, Megan Mullaly and \"Ron Swanson\" acting like his usual butch self, albeit with glasses this time around. I thoroughly recommend it if you are tired of the usual gay stuff and want something light and fun to watch.","user":"dfc-london10","rank":[30,40]},{"title":"Ignore the rating, it's a decent movie.","rating":7,"date":"5 May 2014","review":"I watched this despite it being 5.7, (I tend to trust IMDb quite a bit) but I'm glad I ignored my instincts. This is far better than its 5.7 rating.<br><br>Pretty entertaining, generally light hearted, standard teen movie really. It is a bit crude and definitely adult, not a family movie to watch with kids.<br><br>Also nice to see a gay guy in a film that isn't over the top flamboyant and feminine and is instead just a normal guy that likes other guys. For a while there I wasn't sure Hollywood realised that there are plenty of people like that.","user":"callaghanrh","rank":[23,30]}]
