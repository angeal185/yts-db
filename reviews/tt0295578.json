[{"title":"Give it a chance and savor Lau Ching-wan's performance!","rating":7,"date":"15 March 2002","review":"I'm sure many people are going to say that this film is not as good as the first one, and they would be right.  Many people are going to say that Ekin Cheng is not as good as Andy Lau, and they would be right.....<br><br>However, if for nothing else, watch this film for Lau Ching-wan's wonderful performance.  He is truly one of the greatest actors in the world.  In the last 6 months, he has portrayed a bra designer (La Brassiere), a hip-hop mahjong conman (Fat Choi Spirit, which I have not yet seen), and an ace police negotiator (Running out of Time 2).  His performances, including this one, are always a joy.  In this film, he is funny, edgy, exasperated, tough, and cool.  I thoroughly enjoyed him.<br><br>Regarding the film itself, the plot revolves around a Robin Hood-style thief who steals precious art for a ransom, and then challenges a police negotiator to a game of \"catch me if you can.\"  The plot is simply an excuse to set up some \"cool\" scenes between Ekin and Lau, and most of these scenes worked for me.  I particularly enjoyed scenes revolving around a smoke bomb in a police station and an extended chase scene which culminated with both participants on bicycles.  I was also surprisingly touched by the resolution of a small subplot involving Lam Suet's gambling addicted character and Ekin.  This subplot was important to me as it finally allowed me to feel some sympathy for Ekin's character.  Some elements of the film didn't work as well for me.  The inexplicable speaking of English in various scenes, the ever-present eagle, and the stupidity of Lau's boss immediately come to mind.  Those annoyances aside, I enjoyed this film.  Lau Ching-wan was wonderful and director Johnnie To included some signature style.  Finally, regarding Ekin Cheng, I thought he was quite good in the film even though his character was not as interesting as Andy's in the original.  While you're giving this sequel a chance, give Ekin a chance too.","user":"bcrain","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Worth watching! well done","rating":9,"date":"22 June 2006","review":"well i have seen this movie many times repetitively and honestly i find it very good, though of course not as good as the first part because of the plots etc. This Running out of time 2 really tackles the mentality. Don't compare this show at all with PART 1 before watching this movie at all.. it'll just spoil the show throughout as u'll tend to make comparisons. I like Ekin very much in this movie; he portrayed the very intelligent mysterious character very well indeed. And as to what i notice, the last scene regarding Ekin walking on the wire connecting the buildings.. and also a few more scenes or rather a bit of the plot, involves ideas from Conan, a Japanese detective comic. Overall, well done; worth watching. Moreover, Lau ching wan's boss in that movie makes it even funnier! I wonder how did he manage to get promoted to assistant com!","user":"mel_lum","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Pretentious Cop-Thief Cat and Mouse Game That Puts You to Sleep","rating":3,"date":"11 April 2002","review":"This movie is about a cop (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a super-clever thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company headed by a Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand. This movie, covered by handsome lead actors, beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of Hong Kong scenes, really has no substance at all. It's all flash, and the flash quickly becomes dull too. I lost all interests a third of the way into the movie, and there is no redeeming quality after that, except for the cinematography, which looks good. Only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free. Also, consider stopping watching the movie 20 minutes into the movie because it's all the same to the end: BORING. 6/10","user":"dougjih","rank":[4,11]}]
