[{"title":"That's an old baby","rating":5,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"The movie is a perfect 5. Just very average. Nice if you just want to put your brain to 0. The real reason I wanted to write this review is just because their \"newborn\" baby is obviously just 6 months old. It's ridiculous and therefore hilarious.","user":"eugeniedemeyer","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Great cheesy movie.","rating":8,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"This series is great. I wish they used 10 more $ from the budget on making the hairdos a little nicer, but overall, fun to watch. That is one healthy 6-mo-old newborn...","user":"amandahenderson-93295","rank":[25,31]},{"title":"Silly, fun Christmas trilogy","rating":8,"date":"7 December 2019","review":"These movies aren't great, but they're super fun, and totally in keeping with this genre. They're Christmas romance, and they're not pretending to be more than that. Just pop some popcorn, snuggle up with a blanket, and enjoy. Sure, the lighting is terrible, the makeup artist made Rose McIver look like she was back on iZombie, and the acting was completely stiff, but anyone who appreciates cheesy holiday movies will love it.<br><br>I also have total respect for a woman who allows her husband's family, staff, and visiting royalty into her bedroom while she's in labor. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚","user":"annelyce","rank":[15,18]}]
