[{"title":"An expedition formed by Spanish soldiers down the Amazon river searching for the fabled city of gold","rating":7,"date":"9 December 2017","review":"A misfit expedition formed by Spanish soldiers down the Amazon rivers searching for the fabled city created with gold , Dorado-alike , to claim it to the Spanish Empire . It is set in the 16th century , King Carlos de Ausburgo of España sends a bunch of Spanish soldiers to the new continent to locate Teziutlan , a legendary golden city . Alone in the rainforest and without a help , soldiers face not only indigenous tribes but the manifest hate themselves by their respective birth places . Commanded by the ruthless and insane Don Gonzalo (José Manuel Cervino) who leads the Spanish group in search of the fabulous city , accompanied by his young wife Doña Ana (Barbara Lennie) who is assisted by a maid , La Parda (Anna Castillo) . The elderly and weak health Don Gonzalo becomes in danger Doña Ana , who is disputed by Alférez Gorriamendi, (Oscar Jaenada) Gonzalo's right-hand , and soldier Martín Dávila (Raul Arevalo) . The travelers who are over-dressed for the heat in their old world clothes and armour must survive the crises of jungle life and human frailty . After to realize that Viceroy of Port Prince has send another bunch looking for them commanded by Juan Medrano after to accuse Don Gonzalo of betrayal ; Dávila, Gorriamendi and other soldiers as Sargento Bastaurrés (Jose Coronado) and Barbate (Antonio Dechent) must decide if fight against Medrano's and his men or continue until Teziutlan . Other import soldiers in the dangerous expedition are : Iturbe (Juan José Ballesta) , El Escribano or writer of their feats called Licenciado Ulzama (Andrés Gertrúdix) and the bigotry priest , Pater Vargas (Luis Callejo) . The river , jungle scenery and several dangers dominate the motley characters in the risked journey . But the twisted loves , envy , ambition , double-crosses , fights among them will reveal more violent than the own rainforest and the indigenous tribes .<br><br>This historical flick set in Amazon rainforest, 1538 , results to be a slow-moving and interesting film that contains epic events , impressive battles , thrills , betrayals , violence and wonderful scenarios in which take place the death clashes in a neverending search for a city built with gold similar to El Dorado . The picture has been criticized for its plodding plot in which emerges a strong rivalry and hate among the violent adventurers , with several moments of tension where the travelers must survive the crises of jungle life and human frailty . Good performance from a great main cast as Raúl Arévalo , Bárbara Lennie , Oscar Jaenada José Coronado .It contains an atmospheric and evocative musical score Javier Limón . Colorful but dark cinematography by the great cameraman Paco Femina . The plot bears remarkable resemblance to classic ¨Aguirre¨ by Werner Herzog with Klaus Kinski and in 1988 was realized another version titled ¨El Dorado¨ by Carlos Saura ; because of a similarity in plot and characters, the movie suffers by comparison but stands on its own as a less fantastic version of the same travel of obsessed adventurers .<br><br>Agustin Diaz Yanes' return to top form , with an intelligent and engaging script which uses exciting situations to give us a good movie in slow pacing , engaging as well as violent events , plot twists and that kept me entertained for the almost 110 minutes of duration . Diaz Yanes is a fine craftsman , thanks to his reputation as screenwriter and the support of Victoria Abril he was able to set up his first film as director: \"Nobody Will Speak of Us When We're Dead \" that became the greatest hit of Spanish cinema at its release in 1995 and the Festival San Sebastian , including best actress to Victoria Abril . Yanes subsequently directed the successful ¨Alatriste¨ , \"Don't Tempt Me\" and ¨Solo Quiero Caminar¨ that failed at Spanish box office","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[25,33]},{"title":"i do not konw","rating":10,"date":"23 March 2018","review":"The actors well,i'm not good at remembering them from other spanish movies,but they do a very good job.I enjoy the movie very much,10 stars from my point of view.","user":"fasada","rank":[13,27]},{"title":"Has potential, but lame","rating":2,"date":"11 February 2020","review":"The story has a plot that could had worked better if from the start had been well researched. It's supposedly a historic/period film, and it's full of clichés and logical errors, not to say complete lack of historic accuracy. Indians speak Spanish like caricatures, men curse on God all the time, and the story too soon turns into a race between a band of greedy, immoral gold seekers and a band of similar men under the orders of the new Viceroy (who suddenly wants the all the gold for himself - and not for the King of Spain), to find the Golden City, aka, El Dorado.<br><br>This is a clumsy film written through an outdated and shameful colonial gaze. Despite some weak sparks here and there, the overall acting is pretty bad.","user":"mvpoeti","rank":[0,0]}]
