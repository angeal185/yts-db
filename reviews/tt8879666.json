[{"title":"What Will They Do?","rating":6,"date":"28 May 2019","review":"Not bad. It is a weird mix of a decent script, great actors and actresses, mediocre lead actress and a low budget. It is definitely a Sunday afternoon BET cooking movie. BUT! It's got a pretty good cast. A few undeniable underrated and unsung actors and actresses...then there's the lead. She isn't bad...she just isn't a natural. It clearly had to be forced a few times. Overacting and no real tears. But what can you do. With a few more coins behind the budget, this film could have really been something great. I might have gotten emotional two or three times. So, prepare for that. The movie is about a married couple who gets the greatest news and the worst news of their life on the same day. Are they on the same page? Can they make it through? Is love enough? Gotta watch and see. I gave it a six because of the lack of a dynamic female lead. And the fact that it looked like they shot a lot of it on a android phone.","user":"Magnolia_Green","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Typical Netflix movie","rating":3,"date":"20 July 2019","review":"This movie was ok but had so many unnecessary scenes. also the main actress was very cringy to watch and not the best.","user":"sashasmith-61425","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Great movie!","rating":10,"date":"15 November 2018","review":"Really enjoyed this movie!
