[{"title":"Could have been better, could have been worse","rating":5,"date":"20 August 2006","review":"\"Needful Things\" is a typical mediocre Stephen King adaptation. The drawn out book itself isn't among King's best work. Still, the fascination of the story lies in the detail and that had to be trimmed down for a 2 hours-movie version (there is another cut of the movie that's one hour longer, by the way). A lot of things had to be kicked out, but there was way too much changing around of events, items and characters. Ace Merril, a very important character for the novel's big finale, was ignored completely, for instance. I could understand things like that if they improved the movie. Kubrick made a lot of changes with his version of \"Shining\" and at least one could see why. With \"Needful Things\" the changes seem totally random and that's rather annoying for someone who has read the book.<br><br>If you don't know the story beforehand the movie will probably still seem rushed. You can't really make a connection with the many characters and Sheriff Alan Pangborn finding out what's going on in the town seems unbelievable. It didn't really work in the book, but in the movie it's just stupid that he would draw such far fetched conclusions so quickly.<br><br>The acting, on the other hand, is solid. Max von Sydow is a good choice for the part of Leland Gaunt, and Ed Harris is great as ever, although he has to work with a rather mediocre script. The sidecharacters are okay for the most part, even though Polly Chalmers and Wilma Jerzyck are maybe exaggerated.<br><br>Unlike a lot of latter King adaptations this one seems to have been made with a decent budget. The locations look good and there are a few nice special effects. At times the explosions and the score can be too much, though. It's as if director Fraser Clarke Heston realized his movie wasn't turning out as exciting as he hoped, so he decided to blow it up with some dramatic music and fire.<br><br>Well, as I've said in the headline. This movie could have been a lot better, but it could also have been a complete failure. As it is, it's good for one viewing but if you've read the novel you're going to be disappointed.","user":"Superunknovvn","rank":[58,69]},{"title":"Sydow carries the movie","rating":7,"date":"28 April 2006","review":"Needful Things is an unexpected gem of a movie. I think its subtlety worked against it. Looking at the comments here, I think people missed the point of Max von Sydow's performance.<br><br>The plot is simple. Leland Grant (the Devil) moves into a small town and opens up a shop that can get you anything you want, but he'll ask you for a favor. The favors exploit tensions in the town, causing people to turn on each other.<br><br>Ed Harris is solid as the town sheriff, but he isn't given a lot to do, neither is his fianc√©e Bonnie Bedalia. This movie belongs to its the villains, the town politician J.T. Walsh unravels over the course of the movie, and von Sydow is utterly brilliant.<br><br>This would be an easy role to overact on. You could be the mustache twirling villain quite easily, but Leland Gaunt is grandfatherly, likable, a complete gentleman. As he manipulates and torments, he never seems sinister which makes it a much more complex and rewarding performance. I think it was quite a choice to play him that way, he really took something on paper, and made more of it.<br><br>Some movies are great in their entirety, and some just have great performances. The movie isn't perfect, but has a great performance.","user":"Chicky5150","rank":[29,34]},{"title":"An entertaining film.","rating":20,"date":"20 January 2000","review":"I have never read the King novel 'Needful Things' and so can't compare it with this film one way or the other.<br><br>But this film, about a mysterious character who sets up a shop in which local residents find various treasures and are then tricked into perpetrating horrors against their neighbours, is entertaining and contains some good characters and marvelously black comedy.  Though there are a few cheesy moments (like that ridiculous model which is supposed to represent a skinned dog), the film is still a winner.  Max Von Sydow is good as the literally devilish owner of the Needful Things store and the climax is nicely-done.","user":"G.Spider","rank":[38,46]}]
