[{"title":"Alarmingly Bad","rating":1,"date":"21 September 2019","review":"I generally like slow burn psychological dramas which this movie is supposed to be. Holy mother of God is this a bad movie. They try to get you emotionally involved in the father-son drama but have one preposterous plot line after another.<br><br>In order to get to Mars you have fly to the light side of the moon and then drive a car to the dark side of the moon where you are attacked by moon pirates. Moon pirates?<br><br>On the way to Mars, you stop to answer a distress call, kind of like stopping to help someone with a flat tire. Of course you easily enter the distressed ship from the outside. And when you enter you are attacked by a rabid Rafiki from Lion King.<br><br>Once on Mars, you are able to sneak into the rocket to Neptune even though you were standing on the ground under the rocket engines when the count down was at 10. And, for some reason, you had to swim underwater in a space suit quite a ways to get to the rocket.<br><br>When you get to Neptune, you park your rocket, and I mean park, on the opposite side of the rings so you have to go through the rings on the way down to loony pops and come back through the rings with a makeshift shield that you removed from the outside of the spacecraft with no tools while wearing a spacesuit.<br><br>To get back home from Neptune to Earth you are propelled the whole way by the nuclear bomb that you used to destroy loony pops' ship. The ship that was, by the way, somehow destroying the known universe.<br><br>The moral of all of this is that we may be alone in the universe so we should all love each other.<br><br>The End.","user":"devilwolfdog","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Depressing, ridiculous script and bad science","rating":4,"date":"19 September 2019","review":"Saw the reviews for this and was really excited for it. But this was dreadful.\nThe story just doesn't make sense. Obviously radio waves just don't exist in this universe! If they did this story wouldn't have been necessary.\nA guy needs travel all the way to mars to send a voice message to Neptune?? It couldn't have been sent to Mars? Brad Pitt needed to be in a sound proof room to record a message??\nHe's able to board a rocket as it launches? Obviously G forces don't exist either or Newton's laws of motion for that matter.\nWhen is this set?? They had better Luna buggy's in 1970's!\nA wave capable of power surges billions of miles through space but doesn't effect the source in any way!\nRidiculous character reactions ruin the acting too! The most important mission in human history and they pack pitt off on a commercial flight for secrecy?? With a geriatric?? My god.\nI was actually laughing every few minutes.\nIf this was fantasy sci-fi fine, but this seemed to want to be \"realistic\". Baah. Space 1999 was more realistic than this.\nBy the end you have to ask what was the point and how are you not up for 3 counts of manslaughter?\nIt gets 4 stars for the visuals only.","user":"mark-fenwick29","rank":[1,2]},{"title":"Ad Astra-nomical Failure","rating":2,"date":"20 September 2019","review":"Let me begin by saying that I'm being generous with my rating of 2 stars. This movie was a disappointment on so many levels. The science was completely wrong. There were elements of the cinematography and overall visuals that deserve some credit. But apart from that, the movie left much to be desired.<br><br>As a fan of space movies and Brad Pitt, I went in expecting an epic, but left disappointed. On one hand there are movies like gravity that keep you on the edge of your seat literally gasping for breath. While this was a 2 hour closeup of Brad's face and had very little, if anything, to do with space.<br><br>Here's what was wrong with the movie.\n<ul><li>Firstly, the movie fails to show the vastness of space with skewed distances and timelines.</li><li>Secondly, space, a place that requires calculations and accuracy down to the millimeter. But we see Brad eyeballing his jump thru rocks and debris orbiting neptune, while holding a piece of sheet metal as a shield, yet perfectly nailing his jump and landing on his rocket.</li><li>Sneaking into a rocket from a magical airlock near the thrusters after lift-off ? Erm.... NO!</li><li>Discharging a firearm in a pressurised confined space travelling through deep space, hmm... what could go wrong?</li><li>Using a nuclear explosion as propulsion? Science and logic both took a major hit there.</li></ul><br><br>I could rant on......<br><br>Somewhere between the unexplained lunar pirates and unnecessary killer baboons, the storyline just fell flat. Even an actor as amazing as Brad Pitt could not save the movie. It is nothing more than a drama about daddy issues, the setting for which just happened to be space. The backdrop could easily have been an old people's home and it wouldn't have mattered.<br><br>The people who have rated this film highly are wannabe intellectuals who are pretending to understand a \"deeper psychological meaning\" that just isn't there. Don't waste your time or money on this one.","user":"saadimam-43128","rank":[1,1]}]
