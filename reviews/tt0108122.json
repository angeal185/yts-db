[{"title":"A different kind of L.A. Story","rating":8,"date":"22 March 2005","review":"Robert Altman has never shied away from casting every actor known to mankind in his films, and this is certainly true with his 1993 film \"Short Cuts\", a film set in Los Angeles over the course of a couple of days. In terms of primary actors, ones that had a substantial enough part to merit a supporting tag, I count at least 22; but more impressive than the sheer number of the cast is the fact that the film does not suffer from character overload, nor do their intertwining stories (and they are all separated by no more than one or two degrees).<br><br>I started this review by going through each character and the story each brings to the table, but after about three paragraphs worth of explanation, it is clear that it is not only a bad idea, but probably counterproductive to the review itself. \"Short Cuts\" is simply about human relationships, all of which seem to be completely unhealthy. The beauty of Altman's script and direction is that this isn't imminently apparent in all cases. Something as subtle as a sigh and a minor roll of the eyes speaks volumes in a film this well done. The acting in the film is, to be expected, great in most cases. Andie MacDowell, though not quite as insipid as usual, is still pretty bad, but gems like Lyle Lovett, Peter Gallagher, Tom Waits (who I am really biased toward) and a fairly fresh and new Julianne Moore more than make up for any minor acting mishaps.<br><br>There are not many films that are so involved that I simply throw up my hands at the prospect of doing my standard summary review for them, but \"Short Cuts\" is one of them. The script is compelling enough to easily sit through all 187 minutes of the film, the ending doesn't disappoint, and the film contains a cool jazz score. If you're a fan of ensemble films, this should be on your list. If you're an Altman fan, this should be on your short list because I consider it to be one of his best. 8/10 --Shelly","user":"FilmOtaku","rank":[73,89]},{"title":"Six degrees of separation","rating":18,"date":"18 May 2002","review":"In front of a group of fishermen, a waitress bends over for a slab of butter.  They take in the image like hungry wolves gulping meat, as her skirt rises high, revealing everything.  They like what they see, so they ask her, `Can we have more butter, please?'  The double meaning is obvious.<br><br>In a nightclub, a singer languishes over a sultry little song about `a good, punishing kiss.'  The conversation in the foreground -- ex-cons relating cruel, violent stories from prison -- moves to the rhythm of the jazz saxophone, a dissonant snare-drum-prose accompaniment to the song.  It's a deliberate ambiguity that binds the viewer in the scene's artistic tension.  <br><br>In an upscale home with a breathtaking view of the city of angels, a struggling artist is being questioned about her relationship with another artist.  She's naked from the waist down, suggesting both sexual aggressiveness, and vulnerability, simultaneously.  She's seductively defiant with her husband.  She confesses to an affair;  but she does so angrily, indignant for being asked.  It's sweet and sour, light and dark, truthful but deceptive, all at once.  More double entendres. <br><br>\nRobert Altman's Short Cuts weaves all these disconnected scenes together like common strands of rope.  It's the interplay of opposites that firmly holds them all together.  The title itself, `Short Cuts,' has dual meaning: it's an interconnected mixture of `short cuts,' as in `off the cutting room floor' or `film clips;'  and, it's an unmistakable reference to the web of human life, the social short cuts between ourselves and everyone else, as in the famous `six degrees of separation,' which tells us that we are only six personal relationships away from everyone else in the world.  Set in LA, this idea makes for a lovely irony:  although the main characters are completely absorbed in their individual worlds, they are intimately connected to each other.  They just don't know it.  <br><br>Short Cuts is one of Altman's masterpieces.  See it if you can.","user":"csm23","rank":[83,102]},{"title":"This then, is a rare gem: A Hollywood movie of artistic enormity.","rating":6,"date":"6 March 1999","review":"After watching this film one thing I was left with was a feeling of tremendous euphoria, a glowing feeling which lasted well into the next morning.  I could not help but think that this collage of events in the lives of 22 people in sunny LA was realism.  Not the harsh gritty realism of 'Taxi Driver', but a different realism.  This movie is who we are, as people.  This movie chronicles the emotions we may have when confronted with a persistent crank caller, or the lingering suspicion of a partner's affair. And the acerbic intelligence of the script is tempered with director Altman's stunning technical virtuosity.<br><br>The style is very pastiche, and one scene cuts to another, as the title suggests, with reckless abandon.  This lends a very fresh and watchable quality to what is by any standards a long film.  While most of the characters never meet, the movie is given shape by the connections between scenes.  The connections are of two kinds: thematic connections for which the credit goes to the script, and also visual connections whereby the direction and editing employed by Altman allow him to create recurring imagery with which he weaves the sprawling, kicking constituent bits and pieces of this movie together.  This style works very well indeed and at the end of the film, miraculously you are left not with the impression of having just watched a series of 'short cuts', but something entirely more holistic in nature.<br><br>There was not a false note in the acting and the star-studded cast did great justice to a remarkable script.  The casting is flawless, from Tim Robbins' adulterous cop to Julianne Moore's adulterous painter. The camera-work is refreshing in its fluidity and control, transmitting an intense watchability. However many feelings there are in the human emotional vocabulary (and I am sure there are a fair few), it seems that 'Short Cuts' is somehow able, in the course of three hours, to display (in the actors) and evoke (in the audience), each and every one of them.  For those who are of the belief that modern Hollywood is unable to produce films of artistic merit, watch this movie now or hold your peace forever.","user":"Scorsese-2","rank":[72,89]}]
