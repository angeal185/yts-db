[{"title":"Not good on any level.","rating":1,"date":"16 February 2018","review":"I love stand up comedy and I'm willing to give any comic a huge chance to win me over. Unfortunately, Chris Rock was so boring. I'm terrible at predicting jokes and so many punchlines were obvious and stale. I actually couldn't believe a comic god like Chris Rock would have such dull and standard punchlines. <br><br>The worst part of the special is the racism. I don't mind if it would be interesting and a new take on racism, but it was the played out: \"I'm black so I can make fun of white people all day with no repercussions.\" How original...<br><br>I would not recommend this special to anyone. <br><br>(P.S. I am only harsh here because I love comedy and I want to give my honest opinion. I really didn't want to dislike this special.)","user":"ezgames","rank":[102,146]},{"title":"Chris Rock was the best","rating":1,"date":"16 February 2018","review":"Chris was at the top of movies and stand up but over the years his acting and movies were good and funny. Now his acting career is trash but his stand up has always been great maybe close to Richard Pryor but after this hack performance I lost all my respect for him.Racism and totally mail in act. Must need money after his ex clean him out.","user":"blomax75","rank":[64,102]},{"title":"Disappointment","rating":3,"date":"17 February 2018","review":"I have wait it for another Chris Rock standup for so, so long... I did not laugh, not once. Cliche after cliche after cliche, one bad joke after the other. Where is the Chris Rock of \"Never Scared\"? Racism, machism, and bad comebacks, that's all there is to it.","user":"galeanoadrianfernando","rank":[58,92]}]
