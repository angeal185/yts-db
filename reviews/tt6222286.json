[{"title":"Fake Deep: One of the Worst Movies I have ever seen","rating":1,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"Unfortunately, the visuals were not stimulating enough - bootleg Vaporwave at most. The graphics were so cheesy.<br><br>There was no real plot. Don't waste your time, or money. Any great music by Flying Lotus was ruined by terrible scenes.<br><br>I don't think I have ever seen anything so terrible.","user":"photohobo","rank":[42,61]},{"title":"I could only watch the first 20 minutes","rating":3,"date":"16 September 2019","review":"Irritating and pompous. The very first scene has strobes that goes on for what feels like hours, it gave me a headache. I love mystery and having to find out myself what's going on in a movie, but this one gives nothing, it puts you in a never ending waiting state that got the best of me after 20 minutes. I gave 3 stars because I liked some of the look of it and the feel of the soundtrack. I just hope the story does not start after the 20 minutes mark, well, I will never know, no FOMO here.","user":"nicolasmaczk","rank":[28,42]},{"title":"Definitely NOT perfect but also not the worst, here's the deal.","rating":5,"date":"16 September 2019","review":"\"PERFECT\" 5/10 ðŸŒ ðŸŒ ðŸŒ ðŸŒ ðŸŒ \nThis very slow and somewhat demonic Sci-fi feature set in the future about a young man attending a rehabilitation retreat for a mysterious condition is visually shot in the style of a music video. And not just the models on parade or the heavy shadowy scenes filmed under vibrant florescent lights or the many extended clips utilizing slow motion every aspect appears to be one big fever dream. The acting also feels as though I can't give it a true grade because I just didn't see enough of it, like actors portraying a scenario in a rap video it looks great but who can say watching 60fps through a macro lens slowed to half speed. The pace of this film lends to the psychological horror that unfolds but as much as they reveal graphically theres equal amounts that are abstract and hard to understand. I give this movie credit for it's artistic effort but the whole movie felt like traveling through a worm hole with no idea of what's up or down by the time it's over. Under developed is an understatement here even the few people who appear barely ever say a name. The budget for this film is small, it doesn't come across as cheesy or cheap but the limited locations and actors along with some of the special effects echoes independent financing. My conclusion in the end is I believe I may have figured out what the intended meaning of the movie was but your guess would be as good as mine. Would I recommend this movie for others not necessarily although it has some good qualities but to take that trip again knowing the final destination is really not worth it.","user":"tkaine3","rank":[16,25]}]
