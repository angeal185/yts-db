[{"title":"Ordinary boring and somewhat funny shooting and friendship","rating":3,"date":"10 May 2019","review":"You find anything new, extreme, or interesting here. Just if you wanna a bit smiles or laughs. Killing, ignorance, joking, funny beginning and similar ending, but really nothing worth watching. Everything happens too fast, too ordinary, and nothing special. Story is a bit boring too. There is lack of emotions and story. Just some ordinary random daily stuff you can see in your neighborhood. Its about 2 friends and relationships, but too ordinary. It is about bit imperfect life and wicked friends. Not good enough, like most older crime movies. Could be considered comedy too.","user":"asocialis","rank":[2,3]}]
