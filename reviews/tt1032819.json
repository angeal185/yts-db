[{"title":"Not bad in spots, but the story and dialog never rang true for me.","rating":21,"date":"21 July 2009","review":"Of course this is the movie where much was made of the fact that Jessica Biel plays a stripper, Rose Johnny, and infamously did her very first nude scenes. I can now verify that all those magazines that formerly chose her as \"most sexy\" or something like that were right on.<br><br>But this movie wants us to take it seriously, it seems, but is written in a very whimsical style. Take Brit Eddie Redmayne, for example, who plays Qwerty Doolittle, a mortician who is faced with losing his business just after his father died. Qwerty? Does that sound familiar? Those are the 6 leftmost letters in the top line of the standard keyboard, just like the one I am typing on now. It is commonly referred to as the \"qwerty\" keyboard.<br><br>Take Forest Whitaker as Charlie. He did something dumb while driving, his pretty new wife died in the crash, and now he has taken all of his savings, $50,000, and is going from person to person, to find someone who will kill him and receive the money in exchange. Why? Maybe because his religious beliefs do not allow him to kill himself?<br><br>I like Ray Liotta who plays distraught Jack Doheny, seemingly without much time to live, just off a prison stint. He is looking up his daughter and grandson who don't even know about him. But he is one continuous sad sack in this movie.<br><br>Then, at the end the editing is done to make the movie seem very clever, as we see some people dying, some achieving redemption.<br><br>Not a particularly good movie, with choppy dialog and some over-acting, but it was nice seeing Jessica Biel the way our Creator intended for her to be seen.","user":"TxMike","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Quite good, despite a few cheesy scenes.","rating":8,"date":"10 May 2009","review":"My rating: 7.6<br><br>It was better than expected. It definitely reminded me of \"Crash\" and especially \"The air I breathe\" with multiple story's, drama and the city atmosphere, it has a similar feel to it.<br><br>Despite a few REALLY cheesy scenes in the end, it really was entertaining all the way trough. The acting was good, most noticeable by the mesmerizing Jessica Biel and the always strong actor Forrest Whittaker.<br><br>Biel has a few nudes scenes in the movie which was done very tasteful and very sexy ! and if you didn't think much of her before, you most like will be in love after watching her dance :-). Too bad this is probably the only thing this movie will be known for, as it lacks serious promotion and probably will go straight to DVD.<br><br>Hope it will do good, just spread the word I guess.<br><br>It should find it's indie audience I'm sure.","user":"kingofyou","rank":[80,119]},{"title":"Oh my...","rating":2,"date":"12 May 2009","review":"This film aims high. It seems determined to extract heart-wrenching, raw, profound human truth from each and every scene. Unfortunately, because so little of the characters' behaviour makes sense, and so much of the dialogue is so unbelievable, the result is a relentlessly overbearing mess - and very difficult to sit through.<br><br>Are we expected to believe that a person who wishes to die, but does not wish to commit suicide, would go about it as Mr Whitaker does? If we don't believe this (and how could we - I mean, thrusting a revolver into the hands of complete strangers - and not even murderous-looking ones at that - and begging to be shot dead) then how could we be expected to make any sort of emotional investment in his character's plight from that point on? (In any event, wouldn't prompting someone to shoot you amount to suicide anyway?)<br><br>For me, expecting an audience to believe a premise of this sort is pretty insulting. If a film maker can't put a little more thought into their character's behaviour, they do not deserve an audience's attention.<br><br>Similarly, are we expected to believe Ms Biel's interactions with Mr Liotta, given the circumstances of their meeting? The rapidfire progression from stalking, to friendliness, to \"don't look at me!\" was just baffling. By even the loosest standard of believability, her character just seemed unhinged (her flicking between extremes in her scene with the doctor, and the speed with which she absorbed her son's eventual fate, did not help in this regard either). If her behaviour was not intended to be realistic (i.e., if there was some exaggerated theatrical style in mind) then surely that style would need to be maintained throughout the movie in order for the whole to remain coherent. It wasn't.<br><br>Further audience insults include: lazy hints at complex or meaningful back stories (e.g., Mr Kristopherson's character, Mr Whitaker's wifely and priestly flashbacks, Ms Kudrow's scoundrel ex-husband and Qwerty's puppets); a completely unrealistic injured dog (which, after being hit by a car at speed, just lies there placidly and allows itself to be carried away by a stranger without so much as a whimper or snarl, despite remaining conscious throughout); and a guy's absurd attempt to slip past two huge doormen and make a slick getaway...in a clunky old freight elevator! - as though the doormen might not catch him!<br><br>Stilted dialogue? You bet! Just wait for the 'easy banter' between the two nurses on the way to the room where Ms Biel's tyke enters cardiac arrest. Then check out the same nurse when she later informs Ms Biel that the hospital bills have been paid. Yeeeesh.<br><br>This film seems to strain for the type of tone and effect achieved by Magnolia. But to make a film like that, you need to be Paul Thomas Anderson. This guy is not he. This guy is not even Paul W S Anderson. This guy is a bad-vibe merchant at best. A floater.","user":"rurquhart-2","rank":[55,80]}]
