[{"title":"a good teen movie that shows how bad today's teen movies have gotten","rating":9,"date":"27 August 2003","review":"with the recent release of the special edition dvd of this film, i'd suggest you go watch it.  yeah, this movie is a light, fluffy gen-x teen movie with its music video moments.  however, what was eight years ago just a normal teen movie has gained some semblance of social relevance --  compared to today's teen movies, this film can be seen as some sort of masterpiece. <br><br>\nfor one thing, you never see films anymore where teens are actually fighting for something except for a date to the prom.  the characters in empire records, yes, are submerged in their overdramatic romantic escapades, but their main prerogative in the film is to prevent a large corporation from buying out their independent record store.  are there films that spark that kind of activist spirit in middle- and high- schoolers today?  no.  we're going backwards.  <br><br>also, the humor in this film offers up some absurdist wit, which you never find in teen movies now.  a kid glues some quarters to the floor so he can laugh at the poor saps who later try desperately to pick them up.  a shoplifting teenager gives the fake name of 'warren beatty'.  do kids today even know who warren beatty is?  i doubt it.<br><br>this film was made in 1995, right before many of the laws allowing corporations to buy and control multiple media outlets were passed.  the years since '96 have shown us a homogenization of music and movies, especially in the teen sphere, and it is turning today's teens into a bunch of celebrity-obsessed idiots. <br><br>compared to your sons and daughters, the kids in empire records can be now seen as role models.","user":"emily37","rank":[88,108]},{"title":"See it twice to appreciate it.....you'll be lukewarm the first time and love it the second time.","rating":19,"date":"19 December 2001","review":"I love this movie.  This movie is the kind of movie I watch movies for (um....did you follow that?).  I would make one suggestion, however....watch it twice before you decide if you like it or not.  If you're like me you'll probably be lukewarm the first time you see it but like it more each time you see it after that.<br><br>The reason for seeing it twice is because the film's strong points become more evident the second (and beyond) time around.  Each character is well-defined, with individual traits and idiosynchracies, but this can be lost the first time through because you're trying to follow the story. There is a very strong soundtrack for the movie, but you appreciate it more the second time through, because you better understand how the music applies to the scene.  The actors have great chemistry and the character interactions are great.  The movie never takes itself very seriously and it's just a lot of fun to watch.  You'll find yourself rewinding it to see certain scenes again and again.<br><br>I grant you the movie will never win any Academy nominations.  The plot is simplistic and the \"neat\" ending (all problems solved perfectly in just one day) is unrealistic (not that this bothered me....I personally loved the ending....if I want \"reality\" I'll watch the evening news).  Also, trying to follow the storyline tends to take away from the character interaction the first time you see it; hence, the suggestion to see it at least twice.  I actually didn't care for it the first time I saw it because I was looking at it strictly story-wise.  The second time I saw it I concentrated on the characters and the dialogue(which I loved), and that's when I realized the appeal.  If you're into serious movies that reflect real life and real suffering, you'll probably want to pass on this one.  However, if you watch movies to have fun and laugh, watch this one.  Also, if you like music- especially a moderately wide variety- you'll enjoy it.  It's worth your time, but save the beer for the second viewing.  \"Sugarhigh\" is awesome- Well done, Gina!  Hot voice....  Oh, and Damn the Man!  9 out of 10.","user":"Taggarttrains","rank":[62,75]},{"title":"Perfect...Well, not quite Perfect","rating":10,"date":"11 August 2001","review":"For me, Empire Records is a very conflicting movie.  On the one hand, it's hysterically funny.  On the other hand, it attempts to make great revelations about America's youth.  Somehow, though, it all works!  Sure, there are some \"sappy\" predictable parts that you're not sure whether to laugh or cry at, but the timing of these scenes is fantastic.  One thing that really struck me about this film is the amazing use of music.  Certain songs can be heard repeatedly throughout the movie which really help to distinguish parallel story lines.  All in all, I think it's great.","user":"po5mrk","rank":[59,82]}]
