[{"title":"Why do people hate this movie so much?","rating":3,"date":"3 August 2003","review":"I rented this movie last night with a friend of mine because I had heard it was sooooooo awful on this website and wanted a bad movie to laugh at.<br><br>\nI was suprised to find out it is actually a decent horror movie. People who say this is one of the worst movies ever must have only seen 5 movies in their whole lives and they all must have been in the top ten here at the imdb.<br><br>I do have a couple of problems with it.<br><br>1)The CGI monsters are very fake looking in a few scenes, this really detracts from suspense.<br><br>2)They show too much of the monsters too early on in the movie. They should have watched The Others where suspense was created by not showing The Others till the very end.<br><br>Other then that I thought this was a decent horror movie, what else do people expect out of a horror flick then this? It was kinda creepy and interesting to watch the people die, the plot was decent involving the whole psychology aspect. People who think this is one of the worst movies ever need to watch Fear Dot Com or any of the Freddy/Jason movies after number 3 or so.<br><br>7 / 10","user":"Svperstar","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"not all that bad...","rating":7,"date":"18 October 2004","review":"Some SPOILAGE...<br><br>I didn't think this movie was all that bad...certainly wouldn't call it trash or a classic. It did \"borrow\" some from \"Darkness Falls\" but for whatever reason, i found this a bit more creepy....maybe because i find creepy, shapeless, unseen-moving-shadow-type monsters (like those from our childhood fears) more frightening than a screeching witch-like thing flying about as if on a broomstick....i've seen the moving shapeless shadows moving in the dark corners of my room; i've yet to see a flying witchlike thing. The star could have been more voluptuous, but then that's kind of what i liked about this movie...none of the standard gore, sex, and slash. The slightly open doors of the dark closets which hid the monsters of our childhood as they observed us, worked for me; I made sure my closet doors were shut that night. Also the abandoned pool scene was somewhat of a flashback-fright for me. All in all, I thought this was an entertaining movie that was technically well done. Contrary to most, i also liked the ending. \"They\" definitely works better on viewers who are home alone at night...those dark areas of the house seemed a bit darker; and all the little unexplained creeks and bumps a sleeping house makes seemed more meaningful. I do wish they would have expanded more on the brief theory that darkness may be the channel used to travel from one dimension to another... In truth, there is really a limit to how many different ways a horror movie can scare you; we've seen them all over and over...it is just like a thrill ride, we all know what is going to happen; the challenge in a horror movie is to touch something in us that results in a fear response; i guess therein lies the key as to whether you like or dislike this movie.","user":"foilbeany","rank":[48,65]},{"title":"what is WRONG with you people????","rating":3,"date":"3 December 2002","review":"okay people say that most teens like the \"scream\" type movies, you know, scary guy with a big bad knife, jump out of a closet, ditzy girls scream and run upstairs instead of outside, stab stab, blood blood gore gore. now the big bad psycho guy goes and kills more people, more blood, more gore, yee haa, whoopie. this does not go for me. im 17. i hate movies like that. they are so predictable! the main character never dies and ALWAYS catches the bad guy in the end. whoop-de-doo. now this movie scared the hell out of me. i saw it a few days ago, at night. not wise. havent been able to sleep with the lights off yet. everyones been complaining how this movie doesnt explain everything, like what THEY are, and why THEY mark people as kids but eat them as adults. now i have a question. why do you need answers? why must you have everything spelled out for you in black and white? dont you people have imaginations? would you be more scared if someone told you \"there is a large slimy alien with big red eyes right behind you\" or \" there is some sort of strange lurking presense behind you\"? personally, i think that if the movie leaves stuff to Imagination, (like what THEY actually look like, and so on) you use your Imagination to fill in the blanks. i think anything your imagination can come up with is a heck of a lot scarier then anything a movie can show you. and please stop dissing the lead actress! i thought she was a fine actress. and so maybe she didnt have the big-boobs-blond hair-ditzy thing going on. she looked Real. and the ending was a great ending. how often do you see the main character get it? NEVER!","user":"Alianorah","rank":[15,18]}]
