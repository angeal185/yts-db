[{"title":"Exciting western with a sensational acting by Elvis Presley who barely sings.","rating":7,"date":"31 October 2005","review":"The film tells about Burton family formed by the father (John MacIntire), his second Indian wife (Dolores del Rio) and two sons , one (Steve Forrest) of the first wife and another (Elvis Presley) results to be a half-breed . The latter will have to choose sides when the battles between white men and Kiowas (Rodolfo Acosta) go on the warpath . Burton family splits loyalties , the confrontation will be violent and lethal . <br><br>It's an interesting western with an exceptional interpretation by Elvis Presley who only sings two songs at the beginning of the film . He's a mestizo who along with his mother will be excluded for both races . Originally planned as a vehicle for Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift ; however , the picture is considered to be Presley's best western and along with ¨King Creole¨ (directed by Michael Curtiz) and ¨Jailhouse rock¨ (by Richard Thorpe) his greatest movies . Andy Warhol's famous diptych of Elvis Presley as a cowboy came from a shot in this movie . Steve Forrest (Dana Andrews's brother) as his kind brother is very fine . Dolores del Rio as his affectionate mum and Rodolfo Acosta as Kiowa chief , repeat well their usual Indians roles . Barbara Eden as a wonderful youngster who helps protagonists is enjoyable and enticing , though Barbara Steele walked off the picture after an argument with director Don Siegel , she then was replaced by Eden . Besides , in the secondary cast appears Richard Jaeckel (Dirty dozen) , L.Q.Jones (Peckimpah's habitual) and Karl Swenson . Glittering and shimmer cinematography is perfectly reflected on spectacular outdoors and colorful interiors by cameraman Charles Clarke . Lively as well as atmospheric musical score by Cryl Mockridge . The motion picture was professionally directed by Donald Siegel (Dirty Harry) . The flick will appeal to Elvis Presley fans and Western genre enthusiasts.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[34,39]},{"title":"Actually..","rating":18,"date":"18 October 2000","review":"This is definitely one of the King's best flix, his best performance surely. It was nice to see him play a taciturn guy but be believable, the surrounding cast-from LQ Jones to Jeanie there to Del Rio to John McIntire-were all pros, plus Don Seigel's record(Dirty Harry, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, etc.) speaks for itself.<br><br>Elvis, in Walter Matthau's opinion(co-starred with Elvis in 'King Creole')had some talent and could have become a decent actor if he'd stuck to things like this.<br><br>By all means, give it a look, its worth watching-Elvis gives it his best and it's a solid flick all around.<br><br>*** outta ****","user":"gazzo-2","rank":[28,33]},{"title":"Elvis's best film.","rating":29,"date":"29 March 2003","review":"Elvis stars as a half-Indian in this exciting Don Siegel-helmed Western with a ton of action and a meanstreak. Elvis's character is surprisingly tough and hard-assed, plus the songs are kept to a minimum (he sings the title song and does a little hoe-down at the beginning...that's it). Anyway, Indians are massacring farmers in an attempt to take back their land, and Elvis is torn between the Indians and the racist white folk. Elvis gives a great, understated performance...he seems aware that this is a Siegel film, not an Elvis film. All in all it's the King's best foray into filmland.","user":"Samoan Bob","rank":[22,26]}]
