[{"title":"a 3 just for the work","rating":3,"date":"10 August 2019","review":"I was surprised to learn that Camilla played in a movie. Her acting is bad throughout the whole riverdale seasons. Here it is no difference, the lack of emotion brings back the memories of the first twilight movie with kirsten stewart.\nWhere is the suspense? This movie could have been much better, but not with these actors.\nThe movie is nothing original and excuted poorly. Don't waste your time on this.","user":"xhandsomedevilx","rank":[9,17]},{"title":"Authentic film , believable storyline.","rating":7,"date":"25 October 2019","review":"Very entertaining film based in the USA on the Mexican border. The acting is very good and the characters easily immersable.","user":"ian-blair2","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"A Different Crime","rating":7,"date":"9 January 2020","review":"Lacked subtitling for the Spanish speaking dialogue, and there was a lot, which made no sense as subtitling existed for the English speaking portions so the cost to add the rest would have been minimal.\nA bit different take on criminal activity. Just can't trust those sweet mamas &amp; daughters. Definitely not going swimming in that lake. The suspense is in how you think it's going to end.","user":"westsideschl","rank":[1,1]}]
