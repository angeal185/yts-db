[{"title":"Locked in a room with Drew","rating":1,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"Watching this \"comedy standup\" special will without a doubt induce a panic attack in even the strongest willed, stable minded person. It feels as if you are locked in a room with no exits with an unstable man, spewing his darkest most cringeworthy secrets. An insestual spiral of Freud's greatest hits. This is not an exaggeration, this is the most truthful review I have ever written. If you're a person who finds this brilliant, you're the same type of person who finds a toilet in the middle of an art gallery thought provoking and moving. Flush this thing down the drain, I'm sorry if you already put yourself through the torment that is Drew Michael's inner thoughts. It's cold and dark in there, I still feel haunted by his ominous stare.

It was kinda like watching slam poetry at a coffee shop. I did not laugh once but I did glance at my husband asking him when it was going to be over. Finally after a few more minutes my husband turned it off. I read that this guy was a writer for SNL and I'm completely baffled. This was a disaster for HBO and I hope they do a better job vetting the comics that come their way next time.","user":"melfoxridr","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"Uhg!","rating":1,"date":"1 September 2018","review":"Spend your time doing something else besides watching the Narcisistic Cluster B drivel.","user":"I3ricktop","rank":[12,16]}]
