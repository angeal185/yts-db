[{"title":"A well-intentioned movie that stays on a course of political correctness","rating":6,"date":"6 April 2008","review":"To those who can remember that far, this movie has close kinship, or is even a non-identical twin to, \"The Inn of six Happiness\" where Ingrid Bergman portrayed Gladys Aylward, an English woman who escaped with 100 Chinese children from the invading Japanese. \"Escape from Huang Shi\" (or \"The children of Huang Shi) is almost identical in many ways, the story of English reporter George Hogg who took 60 Chinese children on a \"mini long March\" along the Silk Road to safety before the Japaneses' onslaught hit the orphanage. There is a little more detail in this story prior to Hogg getting to the orphanage where he won the heart of the children embittered from witnessing atrocities unspeakable done to their loved ones. But the relationship between Hogg and these children is the heart of the story. Most remarkable is what we see during the end credit roll, where some of these children (now well advanced in age) recounting how they remember him  the most touching part of the movie.<br><br>This is not to say that the dramatization in the movie is not well done. Here, the credit goes first and foremost to the cast. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Radha Mitchell are two of the most notable actors today not because of their looks (which they certainly have) but because they are good character actors. Meyers is great in his portrayal of Hogg as a mild-tempered young man from a sworn Pacifist family finding himself challenged by the emotion of hate triggered by some of the things he witnessed. Mitchell is wonderful as nurse Lee Pearson who seems at first hardened and drained of any emotions after all the atrocities she has seen, but later found to have a weak spot of her own.<br><br>Chow Yun-fat plays \"Jack\" Chen, a seasoned military man who saves Hogg from decapitation under a Japanese sword and goes on to help him all along the way. This character is portrayed with a dry sense of humour uncharacteristic of the Chinese people at the time. This is a good approach as it balances somewhat the story that is essentially heavily tragic. Chow handles the role with customary ease, making his character very likable. Michelle Yeoh plays Mrs Wang, a successful, pragmatic merchant who, although taking pains to hide it, also has a caring heart. Yeoh has everything it takes to bring out the dignity and charm that prompted Hogg to refer to her as \"a great lady\" when he said goodbye upon taking on the \"march\".<br><br>This Australia/China/Germany collaboration steers a careful course of political correctness in the sensitive issue of the delicate relationship between the Chinese Nationalist and Communists during the Japanese invasion. The depiction of Japanese atrocities of course need not be spared unless one wants to falsify history, but even here, there is only very brief mention of historical details. The main focus of this movie is a human story well worth telling, as the interviews of the actual survivors shown with the end credits clearly underscore.","user":"harry_tk_yung","rank":[48,51]},{"title":"Wait for the Credits","rating":7,"date":"20 May 2013","review":"In 1937, the British reporter George Hogg (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) travels to Shanghai expecting to cover the Japanese invasion of Nanking. However, the British consul does not give a visa to him since the Japanese authorities do not want journalists in the capital. George deals with a Red Cross driver that wants to get married and he assumes his identity to travel to Nanking with two other journalists in his truck. <br><br>George witness and photographs an execution of dwellers by the Japanese soldiers but he is captured. When the soldier is ready to behead George with a sword, he is saved by the communist Chinese soldier Chen Hansheng, a.k.a. Jack (Yun-Fat Chow). George is wounded by a shot and Jack brings him to the Red Cross camping where the nurse Lee Pearson (Radha Mitchell) heals him. Jack sends George to an orphanage and he becomes responsible for sixty orphans. George improves their lives and every now and then he sees Jack, who has become his friend, and Lee, for whom he has fallen in love. With the Japanese occupation and the civil war between nationalists and communists, George decides to travel of about 800 km to a distant but safe land through the mountains and desert with the orphans. <br><br>\"The Children of Huang Shi\" is a movie based on a true story about the life of a British journalist that saved sixty orphans during the Japanese occupation of China in 1937. The movie has magnificent cinematography and art direction, and a great cast, with Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Radha Mitchell, Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh. However, the narrative is cold and without emotions, and the only touching moment is in the credits, with the testimony of survivors that will certainly touch the heart of the viewer. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Órfãos da Guerra\" (\"Orphans of the War\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Heke is a hero","rating":8,"date":"12 May 2008","review":"I watched this movie last Saturday, and here are some feelings of mine. \"The children of Huangshi\" brought me an vivid image of the reality during the pre-WWⅡ. George Hogg, also known as Heke was a courageous, insistent and responsible man. He treated the homeless orphans as ordinary innocent children while the Japanese enemy and the nationalists never showed any mercy to them. Children were victims of the wars. They lost their families, their childhood, and even their courage to live. Wars also raised the hatred in their mind, changing them into devils. In the movie, two echo scenes impressed me a lot： One is the photo of Shikai' family, the other is a photo of a Japanese soldier. Shikai saw his parents and his sister be killed atrociously by Japanese and since then he became dissociable and unreasonable and the only hope to him was the photo. When he got the chance to kill Japanese, he did it decidedly, only to find that a family photo holding in the soldier's hands. Heke tried to release the children's hatred and he wanted them to be normal children. At some aspect, he succeeded, because the children of Huangshi, e.g. Laosi, found his way back to be a happy child under Heke's education; however, the damage of the war was too huge to be cured. Most of the children were saved but not what they were used to be any more. Anyway, Heke is a great man. Although he is a foreigner, he is our national hero forever.","user":"avan261412430","rank":[44,56]}]
