[{"title":"There's not really any twists or anything but when you watch a movie like this you pretty much know what your are getting into.","rating":5,"date":"13 July 2015","review":"\"This is my house, the only thing that badge will get you in here is a slit throat.\" Mason (Cain) is a cop at the top of his game. After finally tracking down and arresting Victor Abbott (Wight) he moves on to the next criminal. When there turns out to not be enough evidence to hold him Victor is released and wants revenge. The next time Mason finds him Victor is standing over his dead wife. Now it is Mason's turn for revenge and after deliberately getting arrested he has Victor right where he wants him. This is a movie that is pretty much exactly what you would expect. The movie is really a B-rate action movie that plays off every clich√© in the book. All that said the movie is pretty entertaining and is watchable. There are not really any twists or anything that isn't unexpected but again, when you go to watch a movie like this you pretty much know what your are getting into. Overall, nothing terrible but if you've seen one of these movies you have seen them all. I give this a C+.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Clumsy execution and repetitive story, Vendetta won't bring your time back","rating":4,"date":"13 June 2015","review":"While having distinct cast with Dean Cain and Paul Wight (Big Show) Vendetta feels terribly mundane. It follows a straightforward plot of a renegade cop who does everything he can to exact his revenge. The main problem isn't the plot itself, but how the execution falters in almost every action sequences. It just looks amateurish as punches and kicks barely land, while the choreography consists of random flailing or pushing. The poor presentation is incompatible with the gritty mood it tries to build and the film ends up running around in circle like the on-screen inmate.<br><br>Mason (Dean Cain) is a detective in feud with crime mogul Victor (Paul Wight). After shoddy first act where development feels forced, Mason deliberately incarcerates himself to the same prison Victor does time. The film repeats this hardened cop gimmick too much, almost the entire movie portrays him fighting and outsmarting Victor and the corrupt warden. This get repetitive very fast as events happen with little to no build up.<br><br>At some points the screenplay almost literally repeats itself by rehearsing the same scene, I even wondered whether this wasn't already done fifteen minutes ago. There's no intelligent move on Mason's part, honestly his plan relies far heavily on coincidence and the others' stupidity. Dean Cain is stuck on his Batman impression with overdose of angst while Paul Wight is just not convincing on the antagonist role aside from his large physique.<br><br>The weakest link must be the lackluster cinematography, Vendetta's action is timid and feeble. Motions look awkward and editing is jittery, it resembles WWE match with fake blood. Character would swing and miss, yet his enemy would fall, in the wrong way. Gun effect is poor as well, as though they plaster flash effect with lots of strawberry jam filled prosthetic for blood substitution.<br><br>None of the action looks genuine. With good presentation Vendetta could've been a decent action, but seeing it's hampered by obvious flaws, it'd be better to serve your time somewhere else.","user":"quincytheodore","rank":[21,29]},{"title":"Far from great but you get what you expect","rating":6,"date":"24 September 2015","review":"A low budget action b-movie extravaganza, nothing more and nothing less and it doesn't pretend like it's something more either so it works if you're in the right mind-frame and don't expect more than that.<br><br>All I wanted to see was Dean Cain as the good guy going vigilante-style and kicking some bad guys asses, and that's exactly what I got.<br><br>Could it have done without one or two twists? Yeah, could it have been a little tighter edited? Yeah, that too but overall a fairly entertaining movie.<br><br>I'm not a wrestling fan so I have no idea who 'The Big Show' is but he was better than you're average wrestler turned actor, at least in the role he was playing which was just a big bully bad-ass with a bad attitude.<br><br>I don't think he'll ever become as versatile as say 'The Rock' but hey, as far as this movie goes he did what was asked for, being the menacing bad guy.<br><br>It sort of has the feel of an Asylum-movie at some times (the movie company not the institution) but if it was an Asylum-movie it would be one of the better ones at least.<br><br>Yeah nothing amazing on any level but it served it's purpose.","user":"Seth_Rogue_One","rank":[7,9]}]
