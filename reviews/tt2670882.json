[{"title":"Not top comedy or even top drama ,, but i really liked it","rating":7,"date":"15 August 2018","review":"The movie is purposeful has a clear message and that is what it's all about,<br><br>The plot is strong and surprisingly the script is well written, and the events are connected and goes fast and smooth without any dull moments.<br><br>\"Accept yourself but never stop improving\".<br><br>The casting was really good ,, loved Blake Cooper even though he isn't a fat anymore, he had that honest, pure and innocent sense of humor ... we haven't seen much of Judy Greer or Luke Wilson, i love the folks but their appearance was so minimum ,, Donald Sutherland was also good ,, but after all lets be honest it was all about that \"Bobby Marks\" kid.<br><br>Anyway, heartwarming family movie , definitely recommended.","user":"Aktham_Tashtush","rank":[10,17]},{"title":"Good life story.
