[{"title":"Chinese Cinema","rating":16,"date":"16 May 2000","review":"After hearing Martin Scorsese declare Horse Thief as the #1 film of the 90s (actually released in 1987) when co-hosting the annual \"Best of\" show with Roger Ebert, I set out to see this film.  Luckily, there was a copy available in the library.  Unfortunately, the library would not allow me to take it home.  So, I was stuck watching this film on a 10 inch screen television in a cramped cubicle with uncomfortable headphones crushing my ears.  Obviously, this was not the way that Tian intended his film to be viewed.<br><br>Tian Zhuangzhuang's third feature, Horse Thief, is essentially dialogue-free and is rather slim on plot.  The film is reminiscent of the silent-era when directors were capable of manipulating the camera to communicate their desired idea.  Basically, the film centers on the banishment of Norbu (forcefully personified by Rigzin Tseshang in an astonishing debut), a local horse thief, and his wife and son.  Norbu gives up stealing horses for his wife and sets out to find a more respectable profession.  When times get rough, Norbu is confronted with the reality that he must steal again to save his family from the harsh, unforgiving winter.<br><br>Tian's film has a striking realistic quality to it that plays like a documentary.  In one scene, we are given the chance to watch a ritualistic ceremony designed to please the mountain god.  While this scene evokes awe, some scenes may be seen as quite offensive.  For example, Norbu comes up behind an unsuspecting lamb and slits its throat.  The viewer is forced to watch the animal writhe and thrash agonizingly struggling for its last breaths.  This scene, although I cannot deny its accuracy and technical beauty, is distressing to watch.  The reality of this scene is not achieved through use of mechanical animals and fake blood; it is achieved by the actual killing of a lamb for the production of this film.  Aside from this painfully unpleasant section, Tian's cinematic mastery is thoroughly evident.<br><br>Because of the deficient viewing conditions, I was only able to catch a glimpse of Tian's overwhelmingly glorious cinematography: Norbu dolefully places his son's dead body in the middle of a snow-covered meadow for the gods to take.  In deep focus, the camera slowly reveals Norbu's utter aloneness and emptiness.  In this one shot, Tian has created cinematic perfection.","user":"LeSamourai","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Stunning in its Elemental Power","rating":26,"date":"26 August 2002","review":"Set in 1923 against the breathtaking Tibetan landscape, The Horse Thief describes the retribution visited upon a clan member who is stealing horses. With minimal plot or dialogue, it is essentially a meditation on the Tibetan's struggle for survival in a harsh and uncompromising environment. The film  dramatizes both the everyday occurrences and the religious rituals that are  part of the fabric of Tibetan life.<br><br>The simple tale involves Norbu (Rigzin Tseshang), a member of a clan, who is accused of stealing horses and temple goods to support his wife Dolma (Jiji Dan) and their adored young son Tashi (Jamco Jayang). To keep the clan cleansed of evil, Norbu and his family are ostracized and banished to assume the life of wanderers. Norbu and his family leave the clan but do not renounce their faith. Appealing for divine intervention to keep them alive, the family engages in Buddhist rituals such as turning the prayer wheels, masked ceremonial dances, and prostration to Buddha.<br><br>Ultimately, their nomadic existence takes a grim personal toll. At the point of starvation, Norbu has to eat the newly fallen snow to give him strength, and is forced to resume stealing to save his family from the cold winter. The conclusion is stunning in its elemental power.<br><br>Though I was deeply moved by Tian's despairing vision and awed by the film's gorgeous cinematography, I found The Horse Thief to be quite demanding to watch. The film moves very slowly with long, static shots during which the camera remains fixed for several minutes. Also, being unfamiliar with Tibetan culture, I sought more explanation of the significance of some rituals, for example, the grazing of sacred sheep and the dances using ceremonial masks. I feel, however, that The Horse Thief transcends specific cultural limitations and achieves a universal quality in its depiction of the importance of faith and the strength of family.<br><br>I would have liked to have seen The Horse Thief in the theater, and hear it spoken in the original Tibetan language (it was dubbed into Mandarin). Nonetheless, I am grateful for having received this authentic insight into Tibetan culture, something that is uncommon in these days of Chinese occupation. Watching this film was almost a furtive experience, like stealing a glimpse into a beautiful and haunting secret world and rediscovering what it means to be human.","user":"howard.schumann","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"cautious attempt of contemporary criticism","rating":10,"date":"21 November 2003","review":"The theme behind this movie is the same as that of Ben Ming Nian (1990) directed by Mr. Fei Xie: criminals trying to go straight but are forced to go back to the old ways for survival due to lack of opportunities.<br><br>The theme reflected the problem of current society, and the problem started in the 1980's.  As one of his early works and the political climates of China back then, it is understandable that the director adopted the cautious approach by using remote region such as Tibet and time setting that is more than half a century ago.  One really needs to acknowledge the problem of current China (and in fact, the problem of many countries), in order to discover the link between the movie and its subtle attempt to criticize the contemporary society.","user":"zzmale","rank":[12,16]}]
