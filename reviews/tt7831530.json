[{"title":"Highly recommended!","rating":10,"date":"26 May 2019","review":"An interesting glimpse into a part of World War II that has previously never been depicted in film. The untold story of the invasion of Hong Kong on Christmas Day is brought to life by filmmaker Craig McCourry.","user":"nflesq","rank":[4,9]},{"title":"Fanciful take on the Battle of Hong Kong...","rating":7,"date":"26 May 2019","review":"A fanciful take on the Battle of Hong Kong, which glosses over the grim realities of WW2 to bring us a charming love story of courage in adversity. It looks like a million dollars even though it was independently made for much less.","user":"tstutchbury","rank":[3,7]},{"title":"Thank you Craig McCourry","rating":2,"date":"2 June 2019","review":"The first film using the Battle of Hong Kong as a backdrop in a looong time. It was a great pleasure when Craig McCourry asked me to be involved as the Military Consultant. I have researched and presented the story of the 18 day battle and the following 3 years and 8 months of Japanese occupation. I must say that the director has worked wonders with so little at his disposal and I am proud to have been associated with this fine film. I love the way he pays homage to the young Canadians that came and helped defend Hong Kong in it's time of need, and feel that I must point out also that he supports the HK Ex-Servicemen's Association and the WW2 Veterans Associations by allowing some of the screenings to be used as fund raisers for these two worthwhile groups of veterans. Thank you Craig and cast and crew for a job VERY well done.","user":"hkbill88","rank":[2,4]}]
