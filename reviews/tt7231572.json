[{"title":"Enjoyed watching this","rating":9,"date":"9 April 2018","review":"Full Disclosure: I'm a 60 something male who generally likes Westerns (with John Wayne, James Garner, Clint Eastwood, ...), the Dirty Harry movies, Police dramas, and so on . . . Normally this is not my type of movie. But I really enjoyed this modern retelling of the Cinderella story when I watched it with my wife. It's quite moving with some strong acting by the actors playing the three main teenage characters: Indy, Bryant, and Max. Obviously the evil aunt and uncle are caricatures, but that's a bit of a vehicle to help move the story along. And it's more than just the Cinderella tale, it's also very much about being a teenager and the trials kids face during those years.<br><br>If you're like me (or not like me?), I would say give it a try. You may very well be surprised by this little gem.","user":"wsidejack1","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Broad Acting, but a Great Message","rating":7,"date":"6 April 2018","review":"We enjoyed it in spite of the terribly broad acting, particularly of the aunt and uncle. The reality is much grittier, but the emotional abuse suffered by the title character is not as rare as you might think. 'Want to be the hero yourself? ...then consider serving as a CASA. Just Google it.","user":"dlpoole-87244","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"Sweet and refreshingly honest","rating":7,"date":"27 April 2018","review":"So nice to have a teen romantic film where people just communicate properly, sensitively and get on with it! None of this sneaking around, no big misunderstanding or not telling the truth for some other nonsensical reason, they talked. I loved it for that. It is a bit twee and the Cinderella theme is dominant but there is a modern element that I have never any other Cinderella-esque movie.","user":"farthingstorey","rank":[15,18]}]
