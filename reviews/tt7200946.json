We can find: misogynistic joke, cheap humour and a bunch of stereotypes","user":"marse_angelo","rank":[108,159]},{"title":"Total waste of time","rating":1,"date":"15 February 2019","review":"I was excited when I first heard about this movie, seemed like it has great potential.\nWell, after watching it last night (I resisted the urge to leave in the first 20 minutes) I can say for sure that it is a bad movie. An American Pie wanna be, but way worse than that title.\nThis might be the worst movie that I've ever seen.\nMy personal advice: don't waste your time with this movie.","user":"gabi_xr","rank":[115,170]}]
