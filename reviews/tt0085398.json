[{"title":"An underestimated masterpiece (**** out of ****)","rating":9,"date":"5 May 1999","review":"DANIEL<br><br>\"Some day I shall understand\"<br><br>Some words abouts the complex story. Paul and Rochelle Isaacson (Mandy Patinkin, Lindsay Crouse) were executed in the early 1950s for alleged espionage. Their children Daniel and Susan can't get over this. In the late 1960s, after an attempted suicide of his politically active sister Susan (Amanda Plummer), the rather unpolitical Daniel (Timothy Hutton) tries to find out what exactly happened in the past, tries to understand his parents' lives, tries to help his sister and to get along with his own life...<br><br>Sidney Lumet's film \"Daniel\" (1983) and E.L. Doctorow's novel \"The Book of Daniel\", which it is based upon, are inspired by the controversial Rosenberg case.<br><br>The film shows how children can be affected by the lives of their parents. And it is about the search of one's place in life. Lumet treated these themes again later in his fascinating \"Running on Empty\" (1988), starring River Phoenix, Christine Lahti and Judd Hirsch. Another theme of \"Daniel\" is the wish of human beings to understand their parents. Lumet described the movie in a Village Voice interview in the following way: \"To me, \"Daniel\" is the story of a boy who buries himself with his parents, and spends the rest of his life trying to climb out of the grave.\" The film uses a complex flashback structure to tell its story. \"Daniel\" illuminates from Daniel Isaacson's view the history of the American left from the 1930s to the late 1960s, including the different left movements. In its criticism of death penalty and McCarthyism, \"Daniel\" is also a political statement.<br><br>Sidney Lumet is one of the great directors of the American cinema. Lumet himself is politically left-leaning, and \"Daniel\" is probably one of his most personal works. It was about seven years before he got the chance to realize this project. Many people worked on the film for the minimum salary set by the union. Timothy Hutton turned down a million-dollar offer on a film and played Daniel instead for about 25000 dollars.<br><br>And Lumet is right when he writes in his informative book \"Making Movies\": \"Despite its critical and financial failure, I think it's one of the best pictures I've ever done.\" The film proves again Lumet's ability to tell complex, emotionally absorbing, unsentimental stories. Everything works in this uncompromising picture. A few of Lumet's films were marred by their scripts (\"The Appointment\", \"Power\", \"Family Business\", \"A Stranger Among Us\"). But Doctorow's screenplay for \"Daniel\" is excellent and extraordinarily multi-layered. Lumet's direction is sensitive and fascinating. Timothy Hutton (who later starred with Nick Nolte and Armand Assante in \"Q &amp; A\"), Edward Asner (who plays the Isaacson's attorney), Lindsay Crouse (who also appeared in \"Prince of the City\" and \"The Verdict\"), Mandy Patinkin, Amanda Plummer and Ilan M. Mitchell-Smith (in the role of the young Daniel in the early 1950s) stand out in a fine cast. The impressive cinematography, which supports the flashback structure by a careful use of color filters, is by Andrzej Bartkowiak, who has worked on 11 Lumet pictures up to now. The rich soundtrack, mainly consisting of songs interpreted by Paul Robeson, perfectly fits and illustrates the film's themes. The editing is excellent as well (a good example is the brilliantly filmed end sequence).<br><br>There are many great moments in this film. For instance, there is a powerful rally scene in which you can feel that the Isaacson's children are afraid of the world around them. Another  moving scene is a sequence in which young Daniel and young Susan (played by Ilan M. Mitchell-Smith and Jena Greco) walk through New York in search of their home. This scene, also showing Lumet's typically great use of the city of New York, reminded me of Michelangelo Antonioni.<br><br>I'm an admirer of Sidney Lumet's cinema. \"Daniel\" is one of his most underestimated motion pictures, really a must-see. Of course, don't expect standard Hollywood entertainment, but a serious work.","user":"Karl1975","rank":[28,34]},{"title":"Daniel is my favorite movie ever","rating":10,"date":"3 November 2006","review":"Daniel, dear fellow movie lovers, is my favorite movie of all time.<br><br>I can barely list all the reasons why I love this movie. I have recommended it to many people, and frankly no one has basically reacted to it as enthusiastically as i have.<br><br>But guess what, I don't care. This movie resonates with me. Thanks to E.L. Doctorow, Lumet provides us -- specifically -- with a devastating examination of the nature of political martyrdom and its effect on the martyr's family. We look at the critical intersection between family and ideology.<br><br>Beyond the scorching power of the plot and the highly ambitious story line, the Daniel cast is superb and they play their roles to tremendous effect, with a couple of minor exceptions. I don't remember how Paul Isaacson was portrayed in Doctorow's novel, but the casting of the powerful and macho Mandy Patinkin as the Pauly character directly modeled on Julius Rosenberg (who at least from his photos appeared to be nebish-y and not projecting any degree of the virility Patinkin offers) was perfect. What a wonderful liberty Lumet took.<br><br>First-rate acting also comes from the tortured siblings Timothy Hutton and Amanda Plummer, plus Ed Asner, Lindsay Crouse, Tovah Feldshuh, Ellen Barkin and numerous supporting players.<br><br>The target audience for Daniel, perhaps, is the person who (like me) at some time(s) in their life has allowed political action to become more important than ostensible self-interest or family interest. Unless you have personally had this experience, I am guessing you will relate less to this movie.<br><br>But please don't let that stop you! This is a martyr movie I am sure many non-martyrs can enjoy.<br><br>I can rattle off no less than a half dozen scenes that I consider timeless and priceless. Don't get me started.<br><br>OK, I relent. I will say that the Peekskill riot scene is memorable and special. Every time I am on a bus, and it makes a turn or goes through the woods or whatever or whatever, I think of this scene. The scene's intense crucifixion/climax is excruciating to watch.<br><br>And the kids' return to the shuttered Bronx apartment -- and attorney Ed Asner explaining to the befuddled aunt that, 'Lady, these people are in trouble!' -- and the Union Square rally -- and the Sing Sing scene -- and omigod the Paul Robeson score -- and and and and...<br><br>When Lumet got his special Oscar a yr or so ago i thought, oh good, finally, the world will hear about Daniel, my #1 movie. But I was deflated when it got mentioned maybe not at all or at best in passing. Some newspaper movie critics covering the award, alluded to the 'underrated' Daniel. Sigh ****.<br><br>Well, dear friends, lemme just say that 'underrated' is a gross exaggeration. In my mind, I cannot overrate this movie.<br><br>Thus -- I exhort all IMDb people to watch this movie, get past the early Patinkin Russian folk dance scene in the apartment, and stay with it! I hope you will begin to appreciate Daniel just half as much as I do.<br><br>And thank you, Sidney Lumet.","user":"Steve-on-LI","rank":[21,26]},{"title":"As an acquaintance of Robert Meeropol...","rating":7,"date":"3 August 2005","review":"The story of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed in 1953 on the trumped-up charge of spying for the Soviet Union, \"Daniel\" is fictionalized but still relevant. Mandy Patinkin and Lindsay Crouse play the Julius and Ethel characters Paul and Rochelle Isaacson, while Timothy Hutton is their son Daniel, trying all his life to try and find out what happened to them, and what was behind it.<br><br>I actually know Robert Meeropol (Julius and Ethel's real son). After he and his brother found out the truth behind their parents' execution (that the McCarthyites wanted to eliminate any opposition), they sued the government and won. They established the Rosenberg Fund for Children, to protect the families of political prisoners. On the 50th anniversary of his parents' execution, Robert Meeropol reminded the world that the \"War on Terrorism\" has replaced the Cold War.<br><br>As long as totalitarian governments exist, \"Daniel\" will remain a relevant movie. Or even under democracy, to remind people of despotism.","user":"lee_eisenberg","rank":[25,37]}]
