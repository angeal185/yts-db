[{"title":"hugely entertaining cheapo horror","rating":10,"date":"15 August 2005","review":"This film just doesn't get the credit it merits, its a cheaply made film which inevitably relies on the viewer to accept the limitations of the genre and \"go with it\", just as an old tom baker doctor who episode never had anything going for it except the characters and storyline so it goes with rawhead rex,the story and characters are good enough to carry the film, the setting in celtic ireland and the roots of the beast from the underworld are classic horror fare and i just don't see what more you can expect from this genre, its a blast from start to finish with gore and an unusual baptism scene for good measure, I've seen much worse major budget films, some of the acting . particularly the irish priest is gloriously over the top and all the more entertaining for it, its funny and gory at the same time, it sort of meets hammer and the evil dead and comes up with an entertaining movie, i voted a ten to hype the figures lol but its a good seven if truth be told:)","user":"kevin-caprani","rank":[35,42]},{"title":"Rawhead Rex and the forgotten monster horror genre.","rating":6,"date":"30 April 2011","review":"So the year is 2011 and time has not been kind to poor old Rawhead Rex (1986) and the monster horror genre in general.<br><br>Anyone who has read Clive Barker's short story Rawhead Rex knows that this is a downright disturbing and wicked tale. The monster Rawhead has sexual issues, he hates women, he pisses on priests and has an appetite for eating small children/babies. However, all these awful things are what makes the story such a page turner and adds more depth to what would otherwise be a mindless monster work.<br><br>The movie Rawhead Rex (1986) suffers from a very low budget. The main offender is Rawhead's mask itself. Its cheap rubber with little to no animatronics and the rubber shakes as the actor tries to move quickly. A higher budget would have done this monster so much justice, if only a creature master like Stan Winston had gotten involved, this would have been a whole different movie experience.<br><br>I would love to see Rawhead Rex remade today with all the trimmings, but unfortunately Hollywood is a complete mess. Bad actors are thrown into quick PG-13 horror crap fests and CGI technology has become the only main focus of everything.<br><br>I think it's time for someone to step up to the plate and re-boot the monster movie genre. Rawhead Rex could be an action/monster movie extravaganza if remade correctly. Hollywood simply refuses to take any chances and because of this, the horror genre is more or less dead. In the end, Rawhead Rex is still an enjoyable monster flick for the bored late night horror buff. But it just doesn't measure up to the more well-made 80s monster classics like \"Pumpkinhead\".","user":"Excaliber82","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Rawhead Rex has its own special place in its genre!","rating":8,"date":"8 April 2000","review":"Im the kind of person who alot of the time will buy movies before I have even seen them.  That was the case with this movie.  I loved this movie! People say it was cheezy, maybe a little but if you love cult horror, get this movie.  Its defently a fun little satanic film and I would recomend it to anyone that are fans of the horror / cult genre.","user":"y2campo","rank":[20,26]}]
