Finally!!!","rating":10,"date":"14 March 2018","review":"This film , the first one that touched my heart capturing Electronic Dance Music from the root to present day! Sit in with first generation DJs and DJs of today as they clash &amp; unite in this epic tale of DJ/ Dance culture. I felt as if I was on a DJ booth road trip. Great work to the Directors Bert Marcus &amp; Cyrus Saidi for the deep \"Dance\" dive!!! This film is for everyone &amp; insightful for those seeking to explore a movement that exports celebration.","user":"abe-41","rank":[14,17]}]
