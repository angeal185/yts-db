[{"title":"Pretty average movie","rating":5,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"I checked all the 10/10 reviews and it's all people who signed up like a week ago and have only one review to their accounts. Like all of em are pretty much identical and in my opinion are fake reviews to boost the score...no you will not be at the edge of your seat the whole time watching this.<br><br>As for the movie the first half is interesting then they drop the ball at the end. It's full of plot holes the acting of the driver is not bad but when a certain character start going maniac near the end it's laughably bad. Watch it on a rainy day but don't expect something spectacular. I'm a horror movie fan and there's little to none horror in this it's more of a thriller than anything, i don't understand why this is in the horror category at all. Also they could have gone for more social commentary on our use of social media and our phones but it's really on the surface here.","user":"rarepeperonis","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Wacth the movie if this is what you want","rating":4,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"What can I say? It's about a taxi driver going around in the dark, but unlike Ryde (2017), there aren't many instances of murder, and the few murder scenes are not really disturbing or shocking like they were in Ryde. The acting and cinematography are generally good. The taxi itself was more nice-looking than the one used in Ryde, so was the driver. For the first 45 minutes, you're going to watch the two main characters talk in a dark taxi to each other about their lives until they apparently become friends. What the killer does afterwards is not really believable and since the movie has no back story, you have no idea what his motives are. The victim is not attractive or pleasant to look at, and what she does to save herself is pretty basic and uninteresting. The last few minutes were only a little thrilling, although pretty mundane, and that's about it. It's a pretty tasteless movie, but not exactly boring if you like listening in on other people's life stories, so you're not going to miss out on much if you simply skip it.<br><br>Final score: 4","user":"politehere","rank":[14,21]},{"title":"Interesting idea; not the best execution","rating":5,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"Nowadays, with apps like Uber becoming more and more popular, a movie like this is scary because it's something that could actually happen. I found the idea behind the story interesting and this movie was an okay watch, but I definitely wouldn't say that I enjoyed watching it. There isn't much action (mostly just talking amongst the main characters) and the plot becomes very predictable. It would have been a better movie if the story unraveled with the \"reveal\" at the end, rather than making the main plot obvious early on.","user":"natswim","rank":[8,11]}]
