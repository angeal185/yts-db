[{"title":"Weird but kinda fun","rating":6,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"The Robert movies continue to head deep into Puppet Master territory with this one although the Russian setting is new and something they haven't done in the Charles Band franchise. If you like your doll flicks served with creepiness and jump scares you're better off with Annabelle as the horror here is pretty minimal. But the laughs are plenty with pitch black comedy throughout and the Toymaker character acting even more over the top in this one than in any of the other movies. There's a pretty full quota of utter bizarreness, a Russian officer being resurrected from the dead with his eyeball dangling and the killer dolls performing in a theatre show hit about an eleven on the weirdness scale. But overall a fun time if you dig movies like Leprechaun and Puppet Master.","user":"tonyturner-82384","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"Goes for the humour rather than the horror","rating":6,"date":"2 July 2019","review":"Another entry in the Robert series and much like the later films in the Chucky series the emphasis is now on trying to make the audience laugh rather than scream. While it could have done with more serious horror I give the filmmakers props for being self aware about how silly their story is. This time Robert is joined by two new dolls who are very Puppet Master in their design and they end up on a plane with what I presume are KGB agents although its never really said. The addition of a doll who has machine guns for arms is the best aspect of the film but overall they should have spent more time on the plane where the most interesting action takes place.","user":"jessicachartain","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"Robert's back...and this time he has company","rating":7,"date":"5 July 2019","review":"I enjoy the Robert movies as they are like a throwback to the Charlie Band stuff. You can tell the makers are just having a good time with the absurdness of it all and seems to push every new movie into surprising directions. The best part of this one is the addition of the two new dolls a cyclops girl with freddy Krueger fingers and a skeleton soldier with gun hands. I hope we get to see more of those in the next one.","user":"geraldblake","rank":[14,17]}]
