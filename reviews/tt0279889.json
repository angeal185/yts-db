[{"title":"Ignore the critics, this one is a warm, light-hearted, feel-good film for the entire family.","rating":21,"date":"21 November 2003","review":"OK, folks, I've read almost every comment on here regarding this movie, and all I can say is... some of you just haven't got a clue.  No, it's not a blockbuster comedy, but it wasn't intended to be.  So, OK, clearly, this movie isn't for everyone... well, there isn't any movie made that appeals to EVERYONE, no matter how good it is.  The point is this: This movie was very enjoyable.  It does not try too hard, it makes you love or hate the characters appropriately, has a nice, fun (albeit somewhat simple) story, and is all around a nice, light-hearted film that the entire family can enjoy together.  If you're not into family movies, then skip this one, otherwise, I definitely recommend it.","user":"rcryniak","rank":[32,37]},{"title":"Exceptional? ....No.","rating":7,"date":"5 July 2007","review":"Serious? ....No.<br><br>Lighthearted? ....Yes.<br><br>Funny? ....Yes.<br><br>Full of morals and clich√©s? ....You bet.<br><br>But it's the Bullied verses the Bully and most of us, especially those of us who might have been in similar circumstances, like these kind of movies; don't we? Obviously this movie isn't meant to be taken too seriously and Tim Allen pulls it off nicely and, along with the support characters, they combine to make this one of those movies you can enjoy without having the feeling you have to barf.","user":"gbkimberley","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Sweet little movie.","rating":7,"date":"8 August 2007","review":"Nothing wrong with this movie really. I don't think people treat this movie fairly. It's a sweet little entertaining comedy, that is not hilarious but at all time a pleasant one to watch.<br><br>Normally director John Pasquin really doesn't make great comedies but I think I can say that this is a good movie and probably easily his best.<br><br>Yes, of course the movie has morals in it that are bittersweet and make the movie also predictable. Nevertheless, I think the movie delivers its messages well and not so much in a preachy kind of way. It helps the messages of the movie come across and therefor the movie is an effective one.<br><br>As a matter of fact; everything in the movie works out quite well. This includes the love-story, the movie its dramatic elements and the characters themselves. The movie is a good balance of fun and entertainment and some more serous and dramatic family plot-elements, that of course never divert from the movie its fun and pleasant elements.<br><br>Not too much about the story really, it's actually kind of silly and hard to believe but it serves as a good basis for the movie to tell its story. The characters and actors in the movie are definitely good enough to make the movie more fun and entertaining to watch. Tim Allen fits the role and the movie has a great supporting cast with actors such as Greg Germann, Patrick Warburton and James Belushi in some good and fun comedy roles.<br><br>It's easily a movie I would watch again.<br><br>7/10<br><br>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","user":"Boba_Fett1138","rank":[13,14]}]
