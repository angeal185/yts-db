[{"title":"Great!","rating":8,"date":"17 April 2016","review":"Excellent actor's performance. Great script. Worth seeing it. The isolation given by the fact of not knowing the language of the place you are at, as well as the cultural background you need to explore before you visit a foreign country. The ideological contrasts leading to how we evaluate the artist's role in society.The pros and cons of a society establishing ways of relationships based on the social Internet networks. The price you have to pay to be recognized as an artist if you do not accept the market law. All these serious matters are overlapped in different layers the script manages wonderfully in a funny story with an outstanding role played by Sam.","user":"misinda","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"Very good movie!","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2017","review":"I thought this was such a great film! Funny, witty, engaging throughout. Fantastic performances from the familiar face of Sam Huntington to the amazing Argentine talent that rounds out the cast! Alex's confusing encounters with Sofia's boyfriend, Victor, remind me of the many times that I traveled abroad and had no idea what was actually happening around me. A lot of laughs come from subtle \"lost in translation\" moments, but the movie does not hinge only on that device. I also resonated with pessimistic undertone about art, what it means to make it, and what it means about those that do. The film never takes its self too seriously, and is a refreshing take on a romantic comedy. I would recommend to anyone really.","user":"kv-910-943489","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"Just O.k.","rating":6,"date":"13 January 2019","review":"This is a movie about a boy who goes all the way to Argentina in search of love. Some fun and weird things happen after that.<br><br>It's fun at times and I was able to make it all the way through, but I just felt like it went on a bit too long. I want to recommend it, but I just cannot.","user":"socratesadamo","rank":[1,1]}]
