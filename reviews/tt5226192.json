[{"title":"Where is the story?","rating":3,"date":"6 June 2018","review":"Some nice gore effects and interesting creature (nice breasts , shame about the face lol).<br><br>Problem is there is no story to back up the CGI/Special effects and the acting is purest of pants - where did the creature come from, why is it there - duh!!!\nWithout any details its just another formulaeic stalk and slash creature feature movie. Oh and the end of the movie is just awwwwwful!!!!!<br><br>When are they going to make a decent horror like with a story and some scares and give us a break from this toxic tosh! It can be done you know; Sam Raimi proved it with DRAG ME TO HELL - We need more Sam Raimi's and less Tom Tits!<br><br>Stupid, stupid, stupid.","user":"omendata","rank":[15,22]},{"title":"Low Budget Monster/Slasher","rating":6,"date":"28 January 2019","review":"I enjoyed it. Not Oscar material obviously but from a guys who enjoys B monster/slasher style films I thought this was fun.","user":"mattchambers-80193","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"The monster thing is well-made. Or is it?","rating":3,"date":"1 July 2018","review":"Clearly they either captured a real one of these creature dealies, or they spent all their budget on cloning one. Because they obviously didn't pay for a real cast, writer or camera crew. <br><br>And for all you gardening enthusiasts, there are NO rakes in this movie.","user":"Otkon","rank":[5,6]}]
