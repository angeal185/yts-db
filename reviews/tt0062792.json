[{"title":"Excellent, under-rated movie","rating":8,"date":"13 October 2014","review":"This excellent film is about the effects of displacement, of being a fish out of water. Working-class Charlie Bubbles has ascended from his humble origins to become a successful writer. He has clearly not handled the transition well from within, but it's hardly surprising when there are so many hurdles to overcome in the world outside of himself.<br><br>The story would have been familiar to a lot of people in Britain in the 60s, as the first generation to benefit from the post-WW2 welfare state came to adulthood. CHARLIE BUBBLES nails this more effectively than any other film I know. Playwright Shelagh (A TASTE OF HONEY) Delaney's script is full of acute observation; the acting is marvellous, the cinematography (by a young Peter Suschitzky, now better known as David Cronenberg's DOP) noticeably European, the charming score (by Misha Donat - Mr Suschitzky's sister) a nod to to the work of Georges Delerue and Nino Rota. Indeed, the movie as a whole leans more towards New Wave and Fellini than the realistic school in which Finney made his name as an actor. Here he is also the director - his one and only feature film in that capacity - and a very creditable achievement it is too.<br><br>How CHARLIE BUBBLES reads to people unfamiliar with its social and historical background, I don't know. For me it is one of the finest British films of the sixties, but it somehow gets overlooked in the enthusiasm for THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG-DISTANCE RUNNER, A KIND OF LOVING and of course Saturday NIGHT AND Sunday MORNING. They are all fine films films, but so is this one. Re-assessment in its favour is long overdue.","user":"gsygsy","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Slow but endearing - akin to a Pinter play","rating":30,"date":"30 June 2002","review":"Warning: Mild spoilers<br><br>\"Charlie Bubbles\" is a curiously appealing film where very little happens but all that does is more than enough for the lead character. Finney plays a wealthy successful writer whose implied literary observational skills have declined into a kind of passive voyeurism. Not just sexual, although Finney's jaded response to his student secretary Liza Minnelli's seduction creates about the most passionless encounter you will see on screen, but Finney's ennui extends to series of encounters with friends, employees, his son and his ex-wife. The 'bubble' motif extends throughout the movie, as Charlie's life plays out behind the window glass of his Rolls, in a private box at a soccer match or gazing dispassionately at the TV screens of his home security system. The movie creates a moving portrait of a man who 'has it all' and yet has nothing real anymore, and the performances by all the actors are uniformly excellent and completely convincing, revealing more layers of complexity than usual. The movie is as British as a song by The Jam, and a viewer having a good knowledge of the post-war decline of England, the North-South divide, and the perennial class struggle will get more out of it.","user":"musickna","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Mostly remembered as Liza's first film, this is worth your time","rating":8,"date":"22 September 1999","review":"\"Charlie Bubbles\" actually won Billie Whitelaw a Best Supporting Actress award from the New York Film Critics circle back in 1968, but it is mostly remembered today as Liza Minnelli's film debut. She's in it for about a third of the running time, and it's an assured comic performance, quite different from her later screen personas. Albert Finney's direction and performance are fresh and intriguing, and Whitelaw deserved her accolade--she walks off with the last third of the film. You'll either love or hate the ending.","user":"Capboy","rank":[13,15]}]
