[{"title":"So bad.","rating":1,"date":"9 September 2019","review":"Just so bad. Terrible in every regard. There is literally no redeeming quality about this movie, it fails on all fronts. I watched just to see how a movie could manage to get a score of 1,1 (at the time), and must say that is about 0.9 too high of a score for it.","user":"efreed09","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥","rating":10,"date":"17 October 2019","review":"This represents me.
