[{"title":"A neat little indie-hipster-romcom","rating":7,"date":"1 September 2019","review":"A first date goes downhill when the couple get locked in when the cinema abruptly closes.<br><br>There is not a lot of substance to this film, the story is very basic with a tiny cast.<br><br>Sometimes the execution of the movie feels a bit amateurish.\nA few scenes are inexplicably shot without tripods and the editing clips some of the conversations so they feel jilted and forced.<br><br>But, saying that, this is a very enjoyable short film.\nThe cast are great and, although simple, the story is endearing and works well with the available budget and plays to the cast's strengths.<br><br>The majority of the production, sound, lighting, camera etc. is to a standard you could almost forget you aren't watching a big budget movie.<br><br>I enjoyed this greatly, I wouldn't recommend centering your weekend around it, but this goes down perfectly on a weekday evening with a bag of popcorn.","user":"thekarmicnomad","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"Surprising","rating":10,"date":"28 August 2019","review":"Great chemistry.Between the actors .Very enjoyable film","user":"anhaveit","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"If you're under 30, and have had a lobotomy, you'll probably love this","rating":4,"date":"28 December 2019","review":"A team of unlikable poseurs who aren't actually good at anything (owners of an empty theater and a bookseller who's never read a book) spend a night and a day trying to impress each other, only to come up with a dumb, derivative idea. The story is further dumbed down with cartoon squiggles, like the visual equivalent of the stupid noises added to \"America's Funniest Home Videos.\"","user":"imdb-2920","rank":[1,3]}]
