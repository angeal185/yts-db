[{"title":"Going for gold in California","rating":6,"date":"15 August 2019","review":"I had a holiday job in 1984 and it meant I did not watch a lot of the 1984 Olympics live. It was shown late at night in Britain because of the time difference.<br><br>I do have some abiding memories such as Steve Ovett struggling to defend his 800 metres title, Sebastian Coe bouncing back to defend his 1500 metres title after getting silver in the 800 metres again.<br><br>Daley Thompson winning back to back decathlon gold medals, Mary Decker hitting the deck and not getting up and blaming the person in front of her for tripping her.<br><br>Michael Gross reigning in the pool and Carl Lewis emulating Jesse Owens.<br><br>These moments and many others are celebrated in this official record of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. The commentary is a little bit too serious and sombre. What counts are the look back at some of the events seen through the perspective of some of the featured athletes. They may not all had won gold but they have an important contribution even if was just finishing a race after battling an injury.<br><br>This is a monster of a documentary clocking in at over 4 hours.","user":"Prismark10","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Excellent documentary of the 1984 Olympics ...","rating":7,"date":"10 March 2001","review":"1st watched 2/12/2000 - (Dir-Bud Greenspan): Excellent documentary of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles which focused on both the ups and downs of those who were competing.The very first segment focuses on a last place finisher who can still hold his head high because he still held the world's record to the victories of Mary Lou Retton &amp; Edwin Moses and their stories.  Every story seems to include a second person who inspired the athlete.Well done.","user":"dwpollar","rank":[2,4]}]
