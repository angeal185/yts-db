[{"title":"A Frank Sinatra Ultra Cool Miami Beach Classic","rating":10,"date":"5 February 2006","review":"Frank Sinatra made two detective films in which he played the hip, Miami Beach private-eye Tony Rome.<br><br>Lady in Cement was filmed in the mid 60s when Miami Beach still had that hip-cool reputation. The movie takes place in the now gone Jilly's Nightclub which belong to Frank's pal, Jilly Rizzo. Other neat spots are the old mansion (now gone) of Panama dictator General Trijullio, the Fontenbleau Hotel and houseboat row(also a memory). <br><br>Dan Blocker steals the show as a 2nd rate hood named Bronski. Richard Conte gives his typical good performance, and Old Blue eyes shines in this type of hipster role. The biggest scene stealer is the ultra hot Raquel Welch. Raquel was in her prime and her swimming pool scene is steaming. The funny thing is that this bombshell could act. Look for South Florida \"cult\" legend Chris Robinson in a minor part as a gay funeral home director.....he's fantastic in his 3 minute part.","user":"kikiloveslegwarmers","rank":[27,31]},{"title":"Sinatra hardboiled again","rating":7,"date":"29 May 2005","review":"As far as a vintage detective thriller, \"Lady in Cement\" has enough wit and charm to make it memorable. It takes itself just seriously enough to get the job done. Sinatra's second turn as Rome doesn't quite have the bite of the first film but it's clear he's enjoying himself. The weary cynicism of Rome suits him well. The late Dan Blocker's delightful as Gronsky. The recent DVD reissue looks sharp and has plenty of trailers but is a bit light on extras.<br><br>Director Gordon Douglas (\"In Like Flint\") keeps the action moving and Raquel Welch looks terrific. Her first appearance is emerging from a swimming pool. I was a bit surprised to see nudity in a mainstream Hollywood feature in 1968 but, well, this was the late 60's after all.","user":"wtdk123","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Ol' Blue Eyes meets Hoss Cartwright","rating":3,"date":"3 April 1999","review":"Sinatra once again plays the Miami based private eye he originated in \"Tony Rome\" a year earlier.  He was pretty effective the first time around, but that one didn't have a script as silly as the one he has to contend with here.  Of course, scripts never meant much to Frankie, anyway.  If the Chairman of the Board WAS bored, or just tired, he'd rip a few pages out of the script to keep things moving.  When the movie was something like \"Lady in Cement,\" it probably didn't matter, anyway.  Besides, with a more stunning than ever Raquel Welch in the cast, I mean, who really cares?<br><br>Wherever Ol' Blue Eyes went, his entourage of goons and sycophants were sure to follow, and one such unfortunate, Pat Henry, a comedian of little talent, is along for the ride as Frank's buddy.  Richard Conte, the fine actor from such interesting film noirs as \"The Blue Gardenia\" and \"Cry of the City,\" shows up, as he often did in Sinatra films (\"Ocean's 11,\" \"Assault on a Queen\") and provides the mostly mediocre film with his usual competence. The best performance, however, belongs to TV's \"Hoss\" (Dan Blocker).","user":"bwaynef","rank":[18,21]}]
