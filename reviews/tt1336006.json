In most cases, it's what a movie invokes after you watch it. After seeing the trailer and being overly anxious, I finally watched \"The Revenant\" and to say it blew my mind would be an understatement. To pigeon hole it as just a horror/comedy doesn't really do it justice either. D. Kerry Prior has taken a great concept and through the superb storytelling and visual aesthetics has brought this terrific movie full circle. The end really justifies all that the characters would be put through. You really buy into actors Chris Wylde and David Anders as friends and the conversations feel very real. I have been telling everyone I know about this movie because I think it is one that can be enjoyed across genres and needs to be seen.","user":"nzalewski","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"Best indie horror I've seen in years","rating":10,"date":"17 August 2009","review":"Last night I watched The Revenant at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival, and it was clear the film took everyone by surprise. Going into the screening armed only with what I saw in the trailer, I wasn't looking forward to much; I feel that I should make it clear to anyone interested in seeing this film - the trailer for The Revenant represents the film in only the most superficial way. Yes, it is a buddy movie; yes, one of the buddies is undead; and yes, there is sarcastic dialogue and gun-play - but those just building blocks to what is, as a whole, a fantastic and sincere film which doesn't let itself get stuck in a box. What impressed me most about The Revenant was it never felt like it was trying to be cool. It was never trying to imitate, or appeal to a specific market. Granted, it does deal with supernatural elements; even so I would strain to call it specifically a horror film. The characters acted honestly and with a sense of realism that is too often neglected in the genre as of late. I enjoyed watching them make decisions and think for themselves - these were real characters, and real friends. The director was introduced as a special effects artists, who has worked on such films as The Abyss, Bubba Ho-Tep, and the Phantasm series - which is both impressive and unfortunate. Watching The Revenant, he's definitely not just a special effects artist taking a stab at directing; this is a film handled was great confidence and ability, marking a start to what will hopefully be a prosperous career. It would be a great shame if The Revenant just winds up playing the festival circuit and falling into obscurity. Someone needs to pick this thing up, it's gold.","user":"the_bulb","rank":[49,62]}]
