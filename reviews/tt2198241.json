[{"title":"It wasn't *that* bad! I've seen much better but also much worse.","rating":5,"date":"8 July 2015","review":"This movie is not very good. That said, it's not awful and it will hold your interest long enough so that you stick with it to the end -- but I can't put my finger on why.<br><br>The problems with it are the characters, all one-dimensional stereotypes. We've got the British military giant-of-a-man, the estranged daughter, the detective and the corporate bad guy, as well as a handful of others who don't do anything beyond bulk up the cast list.<br><br>Take the Brit for example: His accent is convincing until you realise it can't decide if it's London or Northern, switching back and forth between the two often within the same sentence. His character is our lead and so we get behind him in his search for his daughter that seems to consist entirely of one coincidence after another with several scenes that see him beating up people for no good reason. The actor is not very good and has to be carried by his costars.<br><br>I will say this for the movie: James Caan is great in it.<br><br>Overall this movie is okay but nothing special. It's just so by the books and lifeless that you shouldn't care but there's something about it that makes you care anyway. This movie is a good way to kill some time on an evening in but that's about it.","user":"zacpetch","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Pleasantly surprised","rating":7,"date":"24 February 2014","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised for this low budget film. Suspenseful, action packed and good story line, this movie kept me waiting for what was next. The first five minutes got you straight into the film with the murder of a girl thought to be the daughter of Lex Walker. As the plot unfolded, it was easy to see who was behind the murder but the suspense came when you didn't know where his investigation would lead him next. Good mix with the British and American cast. The action was great, clean and not blood thirsty which tied in well with Lex Walkers character as a military man. Only criticism is I would have liked it better without all the 'F' bombs, the movie would have been better without it.","user":"Tattytails","rank":[27,45]},{"title":"It is so not Taken, but this is a decent caper kind of action movie.","rating":7,"date":"12 March 2014","review":"I like Craig Fairbrass as a lead, he comes across a lot like the ham fisted Liam Neeson in a performance that is very similar to Taken, in the part plaid by Firbanks only, the story does not develop in any way like Taken there is just a similarity in the characters. Beyond that noise there is a decent movie here with action, and some good suspense. Not much beyond a TV movie, though of a decent quality. The story is well written, it takes from a few other stories of this genre, and weaves it's own results. I Enjoyed the character development, and the action was good, always fast, and back to the story with a good flow. I would recommend this one to action movie fans, on the whole it is really not exceptional, but it will fill some time, and you won't feel ripped off at the end. Some language, and a bit of blood, but very tame really for what it could be, and even compared to the way Seagal used to break things back in the 90's.","user":"face-819-933726","rank":[16,25]}]
