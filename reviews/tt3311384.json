[{"title":"Absolutely Brilliant !! Red or not this is a must see for any football fan","rating":7,"date":"3 December 2013","review":"The Class Of 92 as players need little introduction, the 90s belonged to Manchester United &amp; at the core of that success were a few young lads, mates, who not only lived their dreams, they did it together &amp; made history. This film tells that story &amp; gives us an insight into what it was like, the film is much more than just the football, it is a look back at a brilliant decade when Manchester was leading the way both on &amp; off the field. Growing up most young lads can only dream of what these lads went on to achieve &amp; for us sat at home being all nostalgic about the beautiful 90s, it is a treat !!! I really cant recommend this highly enough, a 10 from me !!!!","user":"Sausage1","rank":[31,37]},{"title":"Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful!","rating":10,"date":"6 December 2013","review":"The Class of 92 takes us through the story which has been told time and again but the sheer beauty of how its done bringing the whole culture, the wave of change around Manchester at the time and of course the brilliance of Manchester United and especially 6 home grown talents who grew from being boyhood fans to becoming Legends and history makers for their beloved Manchester United, is a joy to watch. For United fans of this generation, you would already be in love with the protagonists here and its a chance of going and falling in love with your heroes all over again.<br><br>Its a truly remarkable motion picture. Anybody associated with football or not must watch this, for its a tale of male friendship, togetherness, discipline, hard work, sacrifice and much much more.","user":"vinzermania","rank":[23,30]},{"title":"The Class of 92","rating":8,"date":"19 May 2015","review":"The Class of 92 tells the story of 6 Manchester United players who all came through the academy system and went on to achieve great success, winning the treble in 99 being the highest point.<br><br>The 6 players were David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers, Gary &amp; Phil. All of them have now retired (some of them were in their final years at the time of filming) so it was time to look back on their achievements.<br><br>Whether you love or hate Manchester United, you would struggle to find anyone who doesn't admire what they have done. I am an Arsenal fan so obviously watching this documentary bought back some horrible memories of Bergkamp missing his penalty in the FA Cup semi final but looking back now I have the utmost respect for what they done at the time. It also made me feel nostalgic about the old rivalry between Arsenal &amp; Manchester United.<br><br>All of the players came across well in the documentary and you could tell that they were just normal blokes living the dream. Paul Scholes &amp; Nicky Butt were particularly interesting as during their playing careers we never really knew much about them off the pitch. David Beckham is of course a global superstar who is known for other things but he came across as a very humble guy, as did Ryan Giggs who undoubtedly achieved the most success as a player at Manchester United. The Neville brothers were full of grit and determination as well, they wasn't the most talented of the bunch but their love for the game kept them going to the highest level. Both of them are now pundits and Gary in particular is very informative when talking about the game.<br><br>Overall I feel the documentary was a good insight although it perhaps came a little too soon. It may have worked better to look back once another 10 or so years had passed. I liked how we was snippets from the other youth team members but the input from Tony Blair seemed pretty irrelevant. I also feel the documentary could have been done in more detail, for those of you who are not football fans you may get a little lost when they jump through various timezones and start talking. I also think it would've been interesting if they had also talked about their careers after Manchester United (as 3 of them did move on to other clubs) and also maybe some more input from other team members such as Roy Keane etc.<br><br>An interesting watch never the less. A documentary that all football and sport fans should watch and admire.","user":"tr91","rank":[3,3]}]
