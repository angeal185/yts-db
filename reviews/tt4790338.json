[{"title":"Surprisingly good","rating":7,"date":"1 March 2019","review":"It's not a high-budget film, and it shows this at times, but that's to be expected of a film like this. The cast is surprisingly large for a film like this, and really, all the characters are interesting.<br><br>What's not usually expected of these types of films is really well-fleshed out characters, and a good honest, thought-provoking, inspiring story. And Varsity Punks delivers on those fronts, with great success.<br><br>The title is slightly misleading as their is only one punk-rocker in the movie. And apart from his attitude, and a misfits patch on his jacket, the movie doesn't have much of anything to do with punk.<br><br>If you value good character studies and/or a good story over high-production values (with simplistic or unrealistic/hollow stories and characters, then I'd recommend checking it out.","user":"beardotheweirdo","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Great movie!","rating":10,"date":"16 March 2019","review":"Varsity Punks is a great movie. I loved the storyline and character development. I wasn't into sports/ cross country in high school but the characters seemed so relatable that I felt involved in what they were going through. It was a great indy/ high school drama/ sports film. Definitely recommend it!","user":"athederan","rank":[2,4]}]
