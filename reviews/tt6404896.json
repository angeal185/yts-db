[{"title":"Please make another movie!","rating":9,"date":"16 October 2018","review":"Loved it! I do wish the series had of had more interest from the public. Cause I liked it. \nConstantine is a great character. Be good if he and the team got more air time and better time slots!","user":"vukimaureen","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"(movie) This is pure horror, not a superhero film","rating":8,"date":"10 October 2018","review":"This does proper service to Constantine, as how his world should be portrayed. Complete opposite of what had been the neutered vision presented in the live-action tv series ( and probably will continue to be in whichever major network pickup in the future) . <br><br>No forced heavy accents, no unnecessary love interests, and plenty of gore and blood. Would had been R rated if it was live-action, and an R that is much much stronger than that of Deadpool.","user":"Crystal_Dive","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"Doesn't qualify as a show","rating":1,"date":"27 March 2018","review":"The intro and outro are longer than the content. About ten sentences of dialog, and the program's over. Better to wait for the edited together re-release, which will probably run for 30 minutes. Watching it the way it is, is a waste of time.","user":"mmoneta","rank":[61,117]}]
