[{"title":"I Loved This Movie and No One Can Stop Me!","rating":9,"date":"6 July 2004","review":"There is a lot in this movie that is fun to watch, fresh, charming, original and could not have been made with any other cast.  <br><br>Shelley Long won me over with this film.  I was never a big Cheers fan but this made me wake up and take notice of her.  She has been underutilized in Hollywood because she isn't outrageous...but that's everyone's loss.<br><br>Judith Ivey is another great talent with which Hollywood has no idea what to do.  Her charm and kookiness in this film lets her shine.<br><br>The rest of the cast has a great deal of chemistry and is cast well for their broad characteristics.<br><br>Please don't listen to others - - there are hundreds of other movies that deserve to be reviled and vilified more than this.  Sure it's predictable -- How many movies aren't??? <br><br>The concept is enjoyable and I predict that some bimbo-star of the future will remake this and it will be fabulously popular.   People will flock to see it just because of the bimbo and then finally THIS movie will have had its vindication and will be eulogized -- pardon the pun. <br><br>\nJust see it.  It's fun.","user":"Enrique-Sanchez-56","rank":[22,23]},{"title":"Great Movie","rating":8,"date":"17 January 2005","review":"Hello Again's best characters are Shelley Long and the actress who plays her sister. It offers an unique storyline that isn't beat to death in the movies. The film also provides an array of kooky characters,such as Shelley Long's sister, daugther-in-law, and brother-in-law. As usual Shelley's physical comedy makes you chuckle, even if it is more subtle in this flick. The comedy is off-sets by watching Shelley's struggle through this particular predicament, and although at times you empathisize with her, the movie never brings you down. It generally makes you chuckle and provides a feel-good atmosphere. The combination makes this one of my favorite comedy's of its era. It's a must see.","user":"dennison-3","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Not the best; but, one of the most entertaining.","rating":5,"date":"7 July 2005","review":"Shelly Long has proved herself to be very versatile in comedy. While this is not a complicated movie -- nor one of the best acted, it is one of the best acted that Shelly Long has done. The story is simple, but one that I'm sure most people have dreamed about. \"What would happen to my family if I no longer 'existed'.\" A perfect world is not available in life -- or death, but on the screen it works. Even though it won no awards for acting, I find that it is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen -- one that needs to be added to a personal library, along with one of Shelly Long's funniest movies to be seen: Troop Beverly Hills.","user":"bpercival","rank":[12,13]}]
