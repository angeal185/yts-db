[{"title":"Lots of fun!","rating":10,"date":"8 June 2019","review":"Took my five year old grandson. He loved it and so did I. Cannot understand why anyone would give a bad review. Wonderful animation and humor.","user":"gayle-55156","rank":[114,171]},{"title":"An excellent sequel!","rating":7,"date":"1 August 2019","review":"We find the same protagonists of the first opus (Max, Duke, Snowball, Gidget, ...) confronted with new delirious adventures, which allow joyful flights with a quirky humor. Not to mention new characters such as Rooster (<a href=\"/name/nm0000148/\">Harrison Ford</a>).<br><br>As a synthesis, this second opus is ultra-vitamin!","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[39,59]},{"title":"Intense and entertaining","rating":26,"date":"26 May 2019","review":"Narratively, the film is not without fault. In particular, the three storylines are fairly loose, and do not seem to relate to each other. Nevertheless, this does not prevent the film to be thoroughly unpredictable, wildly fun and extremely fast-paced. While introducing a new character Tiger or Hu, the film retains most of the characters from its predecessor, all of which are adorable and cute. The characters, dialogues and actions are super hilarious, and the children in the auditorium kept laughing throughout. Several scenes, including the cliff scene and the chase scenes, are pretty intense.<br><br>See the movie if you want fun and happiness.","user":"TheBigSick","rank":[54,90]}]
