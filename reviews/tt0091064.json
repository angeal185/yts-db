[{"title":"Better than the original and one of the best horror films ever made","rating":10,"date":"16 July 2003","review":"David Cronenberg redefined what we think of as creepy with this brilliant film. The makeup special effects and grossouts are top notch, but what is most surprising about The Fly is that it turns out to be a very well acted and emotional love story. It greatly surpasses the original '58 version.<br><br>The film focuses on the relationship between Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis at the top and once it takes its turn towards horror it really pays off. It's not just scary, it's a tragedy too. Jeff Goldblum is phenomenal. He is mesmerizing as he delivers great dialogue and once he's barely recognizable he still breaks through the makeup and you can feel the human inside. I can't believe he didn't get an Oscar for this, it's easily his best performance. <br><br>I can't express how much I love The Fly. It's more than just horror, and it's proof that you just may find a truly great movie where you least expect it. <br><br>My rating: 10/10","user":"Derek237","rank":[199,235]},{"title":"Does one thing well","rating":8,"date":"7 June 2005","review":"Most science fiction films are big on ideas and special effects, but weak on coherence and character development; most horror films are just the same, except without the ideas. But David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' takes one simple idea, develops it properly, and eschews (its genuinely terrifying) special effects until its truly horrific climax. And by paying some attention to the personalities of its protagonists, it actually makes you care about them (Jeff Goldblum is excellent in the lead role), and adds a level of serious reflection on the very nature of human mortality to the raw shock. The mix amounts to a gruesomely good film.","user":"paul2001sw-1","rank":[148,187]},{"title":"Still Fascinating & Very Disturbing","rating":9,"date":"8 March 2007","review":"It's been over 20 years since this movie was made, but the special effects are still amazing and the story is an entertaining - and disgusting - as ever! I watch it about every 5-7 years. It's utterly fascinating, but it is so uncomfortable to watch at times I always wonder, as I am viewing it, why I put myself through this each time! The original movie, with Vincent Price, is \"dullsville\" compared to this re-make.<br><br>Things can get really disgusting as Jeff Goldblum ('Seth Brundle\") slowly turns into a huge fly. The transformation is very gross in certain spots, and certainly gut-wrenching to witness. You can just feel his girlfriend's anguish and horror as she witnesses Goldblums' incredible physical and mental change. Geena Davis gives a convincing performance in that roles as \"Veronica Quiafe.\"<br><br>The story is not just a dumb horror-creature movie, but an intelligent science fiction tale with both leading actors excellent. I don't Davis ever looked prettier, too. John Getz also is good as her magazine boss, \"Stathis Borans.\" Those three characters dominate the film. I can't even remember anyone else in here.<br><br>The ending is stunning, almost leaving the first time viewer in shock. In fact, by the nd, this movie will have you emotionally worn out.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[94,120]}]
