[{"title":"Engaging and affecting, but lacking its rightful purpose","rating":6,"date":"30 September 2018","review":"I found the short engaging and innovative in portraying the similarities between the two shootings, however, it fell far short in conveying the differences.\nThe trailer culminates on the issue of gun ownership. In the film, however, it is covered in a very isolated way: a 2 minute segment on the opinion of the priest in Dunblane and the introduction of tighter gun laws in the UK (already far stricter than the US) and then the text at the end of the film which compares changes to gun laws in the UK and US. \nRather than the issue only being presented to the viewer, there should have been dialogue between the priests and the communities about the issues. The reason a school shooting hasn't happened in the UK since Dunblane is not because of the support and hope in the community (valuable as this is), it was because of the action taken and a wholly different mindset on gun ownership. For me it was a missed opportunity.","user":"katiemariathilthorpe","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Can't believe people are disappointed in this","rating":10,"date":"21 June 2019","review":"It touched my heart deeply. To me this short documentary is about the two priests who are both citizens of their different towns but also the ones who have as their work to hold the community in grief together. I don't understand the negative comments because this is a documentary about two priests in two towns that have had school shootings. Nothing else.","user":"alice-kugelberg","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Disappointing...","rating":4,"date":"7 October 2018","review":"The trailer shows the main focus of this short being centred around gun control, but for less than 5 minutes, this issue is discussed. Most of this documentary is just about the two priests talking about their experiences and meeting up. This could've been so much more. An hour long documentary would've been nicer, they could've spent equal amounts of time on everything.","user":"dylanpowell-45367","rank":[5,6]}]
