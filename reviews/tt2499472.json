[{"title":"Rather enjoyable!","rating":7,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"This movive reminds me of the 2004 flick Cellular.. it's action packed, brainless fun! Is it groundbreaking? No. Is the plot deep and thick with twists? Not at all. Yet, it's a great way to kill an hour and a half with enjoyable action, cool chases, a dose of humour mixed in that isn't forced like it is in alot of movies and shows these days. It's just a straight to the point good time! I'd recommend it to anyone looking to just kill a bit of time and have some fun in the process :)","user":"ryanpainter","rank":[72,89]},{"title":"everyone's a critic","rating":7,"date":"12 July 2019","review":"Don't expect a masterpiece just a very enjoyably action movie with some good enough acting, a solid 7/10 for me.","user":"brammalschaert","rank":[89,114]},{"title":"Dont buy into the negative reviews","rating":7,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"Great Netflix movie to watch not sure why so many negative reviews really enjoyed this flick","user":"madhawk-02399","rank":[39,51]}]
