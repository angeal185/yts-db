[{"title":"Not the adaptation we hoped for.","rating":6,"date":"20 July 2019","review":"Here's my review of Batman: Hush. So 'Hush' is the new addition in the DC animated universe or whatever it's called these days. People say that Hush is one of the greatest Batman stories ever told . I strongly disagree. Hush is one of the greatest stories ever told . But did this adaptation get it right ? NOPE. Why ? Because it's not an adaptation like it was marketed to be. For those of you who've been following the animated Batman movies in the dcau, you know that the movies take inspiration from the source material but don't adapt them entirely unlike standalone movies such as Under the red hood and dark Knight returns which adapt the books entirely . For example one of this movies prequels 'Batman v Robin' borrowed heavily from Scott Snyder's book 'Court of Owls' . This movie does the same but unlike 'Batman v Robin' it was marketed as an adaptation of Hush when it was just another movie in the Batman continuity of the dcau . However there were a lot of things I liked in this movie , like the animation which is very fluid for something handdrawn , been a fan of it since Son of Batman. Jason o Mara reprises his role as the voice of Batman and I've been a fan of the voice since the first one . Selina Kyle voiced by Cameron from House Md was great. Never been a fan of the older incarnations of the animated Catwoman , but this one was great and had amazing chemistry with Batman as well. Speaking of animated incarnations , the joker in this movie has the worst art design ever ! And I was really dissapointed , because ever since they started adapting the new 52 artstyle for animation I was always looking forward to how the Joker was going to look and they screwed it up . He even sounds Scottish in this movie , they could've gotten Mark Hamill's or at least Troy Baker or John DiMaggio for the part to save the character. In the end , Hush is not the adaptation it was marketed to be , and if you're someone who hasn't read the book and has been following the animated DC movies , you might actually enjoy it !","user":"Abranth-d","rank":[40,56]},{"title":"Disappointed","rating":5,"date":"22 July 2019","review":"Batman:Hush does Many things correctly that make it a watchable film from action to good quips. The romance between Bruce and Selina pulls you in as you see Batman finally letting his walls down and allowing someone in and it's done well especially with how much the makers of this film are pushing to the forefront for the audience. The biggest mistake it makes is ultimately Why the adaptation of The Killing Joke didn't go so well which is adding and making unnecessary changes. Turning Hush from a brilliant albeit twisted and dangerous former childhood friend of Bruce's that not only wants to punish and torment him but take his place LITERALLY to a Physically and mentally distraught version of the Riddler( thanks to a Lazarus Pit) is a poor way to repay longtime fans not only of DC but also of this storyline. From The Killing Joke, to now Batman:Hush, and even characters like Shade or Firefly on their CW shows DC has got to stop with these last minute changes and undercutting of characters.","user":"zackwitting","rank":[26,37]},{"title":"Don't watch this movie if you're a fan with graphic novel","rating":5,"date":"22 July 2019","review":"How I start this review? Yes, this movie is a piece of crap!!!! They butcher everything that i love from the graphic novel in this movie. What I can't accept is that they waste one of the most interesting and important character from the source material in this movie. The best part is that they already building up his character from the beginning. And we got nothing. The big reveal also disappointing.","user":"amerulaidil","rank":[49,76]}]
