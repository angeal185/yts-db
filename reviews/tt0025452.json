[{"title":"British Version is Fast-Paced, Witty, & Atmospheric","rating":20,"date":"20 July 2001","review":"Both versions of Hitchcock's \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" are well worth watching, and each one has its own strong points.  While this British version cannot match the Hollywood remake in terms of star power and lavish production, it has several strengths of its own: it is fast-paced, filled with wit, and nicely atmospheric.  Despite being 20 years older, it is also more 'modern' in its portrayal of the woman whose child is kidnapped.<br><br>Aside from Peter Lorre, always a big plus to any movie, the cast does not have too many names that would be familiar to today's audiences, but they all are good actors who fit in well with the style of Hitchcock's British films, exuding self-control and good-natured wit even in the most trying of circumstances.  Edna Best as the heroine is noticeably different from Doris Day, lacking the glamour but giving a convincing performance as a more determined, resourceful mother.<br><br>There are some interesting settings in this version, too, with much of the action taking place in some interesting buildings in a less elegant neighborhood in London.  A lot of it looks a bit murky in the old black-and-white print, but in a sense even that adds to the atmosphere.<br><br>Certainly there are those who have good reasons for preferring the remake, but every Hitchcock fan should watch the original, too.  Hitchcock's British films had a pleasant style all their own, and while this one might not measure up to \"The Lady Vanishes\" or \"The 39 Steps\", it's still very entertaining.","user":"Snow Leopard","rank":[60,70]},{"title":"Hitch and the \"Anarchist Revolt\" of 1911 in London","rating":7,"date":"2 January 2006","review":"In the novel, THE SECRET AGENT, Joseph Conrad had dissected the world of anarchists, double agents and spies, and police in the East End of London of 1894, the year that an attempt to destroy the Greenwich Observatory occurred. Alfred Hitchcock used Conrad's novel for his film SABOTAGE in 1936. But two years earlier he did the film THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. It was the first of two films in which Peter Lorre was directed by him. It was also the only one of his movies that he remade complete with title. But he decided to use the film to film a scene from British criminal history - the January 1911 \"Siege of Sidney Street\".<br><br>There had been an incident in December 1910 when several Russian aliens were involved in a burglary in Houndsditch. The proceeds of their robberies (aside from supporting themselves) helped fund anti-Tsarist activities in Russia. They killed three constables in making their escape from the shop. They were eventually tracked down to a house on Sidney Street, and fired at the police who tried to get them to surrender. The Home Secretary of the day (a politician named Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill) sent out troops, sharp shooters, and artillery. The cannon set the house on fire, and the men found inside were found to be dead. The best account of the event is Donald Rumbelow's THE SIEGE OF SIDNEY STREET called THE HOUNDSDITCH MURDERS in Great Britain.<br><br>Here, instead of radicals (called anarchists in 1911) we have foreign conspirators planning an assassination in London of a foreign head of state. Peter Lorre is the leader. Leslie Banks and his family are on vacation to Switzerland. Banks witnesses the murder of a Frenchman (Pierre Fresney, a great French star of the period - this English film is a rarity for him). Fresney reveals the assassination plot to Banks, and Lorre and his associates kidnap his daughter (Nora Pilbeam) to keep his mouth shut. But the police are aware that he heard something from Fresney, and try to pressure him to talk.<br><br>So we watch Banks try to track down his daughter (and get captured himself) while his wife goes to the Albert Hall to see what she can do.<br><br>The finale of the film is based on the Siege - with some exceptions (one of the bobbies in the Houndsditch tragedy is shot and killed in the start of the movie's version of the incident). But Hitchcock maintains the suspense to the end, when the last villain is taken care of.<br><br>It's an interesting film - not a great one. And it is somewhat different from the 1956 remake.","user":"theowinthrop","rank":[42,51]},{"title":"Classic Early Hitchcock...","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2004","review":"Perhaps a bit hard to watch for younger generations, but this is the superior version of the yuppie couple whose only child is kidnapped and held for ransom (remade under the same title in the 50s by the same director, Alfred Hitchcock). <br><br>The film doesn't live up to \"The 39 Steps\" or \"The Lady Vanishes\" as one of Hitch's early works, but it is a superb example of classic low-budget filmmaking at its best. Yes, the effects (like the opening ski slope run) are incredibly laughable, but hey--it was filmed on a virtually empty budget by a relatively unknown director at the time with a low-budget cast in Britain.<br><br>Superb.<br><br>5/5 stars.<br><br><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>","user":"MovieAddict2016","rank":[41,53]}]
