[{"title":"It's great at what it tries to do","rating":9,"date":"16 August 2017","review":"If you want great acting, then this isn't your movie. If you want a great plot or even a realistic one, same answer. But if you like movies with kids and a good piano performance, then this is a fun movie.<br><br>100% sappy. Maybe 10% realistic. After Lacey Chabert who is barely in this, and Jonathan Bennett, most of the adult actors are like they are in community theater. Some of the kids aren't bad. The story is a little slow and very predictable, but it's heartwarming.<br><br>But the total gem in this movie is 12 year old Ethan Bortnick. He plays a prodigy and he comes off a little like a savant and maybe even as very high functioning autistic. But his piano playing is golden. He performs several piano numbers at length, and a couple are repeated more than once. But remember it is the kid playing, not someone else, and what's more, he wrote the original songs he plays. He even sings. This is someone who has performed on national TV.<br><br>The kids have fun. Almost everyone in the movie is encouraging. But this is not a religious movie. If anything the theme is - you can do anything if you believe in yourself.","user":"Jackbv123","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Great movie","rating":10,"date":"14 November 2019","review":"Some one else said this.

This is a sweet and inspiring story which beautifully show-cases Ethan's gifts as well as societal concerns worthy of our loving support. Anything Is Possible emanates wisdom and hope of value to all ages.<br><br>As Einstein said, \"There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.\" Ethan, I'm with you.
