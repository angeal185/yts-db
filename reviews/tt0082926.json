[{"title":"strange movie and strange viewing","rating":1,"date":"1 August 2007","review":"I have to comment on this movie.It was 1981 and it was my birthday.I moved to a new job and knew absolutely no one and went to a theater to see \"Polyester\" knowing nothing about it.It was raining and as soon as I entered to buy a ticket three employees started laughing and looking at me.They said you are the only one here to see the movie.I was handed a card and I went to a seat and sat down and the previews started.An usher walked by and I said hey,turn down the lights and turn up the sound.I put my feet up on a seat-back and thought hey,this is okay.It was my first John Waters movie and I laughed a lot at the crazy movie.I used the scratch and sniff card as prompted by the screen which was cool.I had a great time.It wasn't until several years later when I saw more Water's films that I even knew that Divine was actually a man and Water's films were a wee tad irregular.If you are humored by odd movies and odd people then watch the movie.I wish I had saved the scratch and sniff card.Not a movie for the kids.","user":"imr4064","rank":[29,32]},{"title":"Smellovision","rating":10,"date":"10 November 1999","review":"This was my first John Waters movie, and it opened with scratch and sniff cards.  Each \"spot\" had a color and number and when the appropriate scene arrived we had the privilege of smelling what was on screen.  Devine's character had an odor fetish and was constantly spraying air freshener, while a nefarious plot was instigated to drive her insane by planting offensively smelly things like gym sox, dead fish etc for her to find at home.  <br><br>Her husband runs an adult cinema. Her son, based on the Baltimore Stomper, a true character, sniffs industrial solvents, stalks women with cute shoes and feet, and then stomps on them with his combat boots.  The daughter, obviously the model for Christine Applegate's character in Married With Children, is the high school slut that dances on tables for quarters.  And Mom worries about fresh scents.<br><br>With these subplots to the main plot, it should be obvious that plot resolution and character development are not the main attractions in a John Waters movie.  The caricature of society and its stereotypes is his game, and the best moment of the movie has to be when the TV news camera is in the face of one of the Baltimore Stomper's victims as she is being carried to the ambulance on a strecher.  The victim's on camera stream of obscene invectives against the callous media was one of the great moments of the movie because it was such a refreshing expression of the common person's real disgust and frustration with tabloid evening news and a culture that trivializes human suffering.  Juxtapose a broken instep with the main character's insufferable pain of finding a smelly sock and you have the theme of this movie.  Even the fairytale resolutions to the problems are a hilarious sendup of 80's America.<br><br>If you want to see what makes John Waters such a cult hero, but would find Female Trouble or Pink Flamingos too offensive, this was his first attempt to bridge the gap to the more accessible films he made later, while still having enough of the gross-out quality for a good laugh riot. <br><br>\n(Serial Mom will be on TV the weekend after Veteran's Day, and it is another very accessible glimpse into the mind of Mr. Waters.)","user":"batzi8m1","rank":[24,27]},{"title":"Stiv Lives!","rating":26,"date":"26 August 2003","review":"I remember seeing this the night it came out (God, was it really 22 years ago!). We all went down to a late night showing at the Cedar on the West Bank in Mpls., with about 4 hours worth of \"feelgood\" in us. <br><br>I was familiar with Waters' work, having seen PINK FLAMINGOS, and was ready for the \"Odorama\" cards handed out when you bought your ticket, but my \"associates\" were a bit mystified. It all led up to a very different &amp; unique experience, which really hasn't been equaled since. <br><br>Basically, there were about 10 (numbered 1-10) scratch-n-sniff scents which were to be activated by you from the card when a flashing number appeared on the screen. They included a rotten egg smell for flatulence (somebody broke wind in the movie), along with a natural gas smell when a character stuck their head in an oven, among others. You get the idea. Anyway, it had the usual John Waters' cast of characters (Mink, Edith, Divine, etc.), along with the late, great Stiv Bators making his big-screen debut as (what else), a delinquent. Stiv pulls it off quite well, and everything else pretty much amounted to a fun show-going experience. <br><br>Not nearly as shocking as FLAMINGOS or FEMALE TROUBLE, but surely rent it if your into that sort of thing (a/k/a the pre-HAIRSPRAY Waters). I'm sure those \"Odorama\" cards are long gone, so you'll have to get creative on your own to replicate the experience that was \"Odorama\".","user":"Twins65","rank":[28,32]}]
