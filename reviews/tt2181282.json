[{"title":"Surprisingly good","rating":7,"date":"22 April 2017","review":"I often find it difficult to find anything good on Netflix. This is the exception. This film was surprisingly good. It had a good story, and was well acted. It also had enough plot twists to keep it interesting throughout. Initially, I thought I had a pretty good idea as to how the story would unfold. However,things go a bit different than expected, and the ending was quite unexpected. All in all, a very entertaining movie that I think most will enjoy.","user":"jhr2012","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"Brilliant, just Brilliant","rating":9,"date":"25 January 2017","review":"Do not expect special effects to try to thrill you, do not expect stunning landscapes to enchant you, but do expect one hell of a ride.<br><br>This is possibly the most intense and clever thriller I have seen. An array of characters but after the film you cannot remember any of them apart from 2 people. Thats what this film is about, 2 people and one incident. The blurb does not sell this film, I mean, it tells you what happens and there is nothing exciting about a famous shoplifter getting blackmailed. Get ready to be awe struck. This is clever, sad, witty and real. twists and turns galore. Go and watch it and get ready for 90 minutes of pure film","user":"tdowney-31207","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"A look at loneliness from an unusual angle","rating":7,"date":"14 November 2016","review":"A Patch of Fog is a small Irish film about a security guard who blackmails a celebrity he finds shoplifting into being his friend. <br><br>This is a small film that probably would have worked better if it was cut down in length and used as a one hour TV drama. Saying that it still manages to be reasonably entertaining.<br><br>The two leads do a good job especially Stephen Graham who shows his versatility here as the lonely man just looking for friendship but going about it the wrong way. Although both actors are great the one slight downfall was that neither character manages to garner much sympathy from the audience which left me a little detached from the events that followed. <br><br>Overall I thought this was a decent small film and it did have a very good ending which makes it worth sitting through.","user":"MattyGibbs","rank":[18,21]}]
