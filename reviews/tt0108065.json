[{"title":"Brilliant intelligently sensitive drama","rating":9,"date":"6 August 2004","review":"Let me start by saying I am not a person who goes for sentimental, \"heart on your sleeve\" type big dramas that seem to be the idol of most professional critics. In fact, to put it bluntly I totally loathe them. (I prefer movies that at least try to have a cohesive plot line with a reasonably accessible story idea and some decent tight pacing; ie: something that's both informative and fun. This is my interpretation of the classic idea of \"a good story, well told\".)<br><br>With that in mind, I wish to state that this movie (film, whatever) really does work, at all levels. It's a good intelligent story (apparently based on fact} about a very bright, very young kid who is discovered to be naturally good at chess and enters the serious national tournaments. During which time, there are raised issues of the concept of the winning ethos; and keeping (or losing) your humanity in the process.<br><br>This cast is magnificent here. The central leads are played by Joe Mantegna and Max Pomerance as the father and son respectively. Both give very well-balanced performances. Sensitive, without being sappy. Max in particular is very good, especially in the dramatic climax of the film; which he handles with total dignity. It could have been so over the top and patronizing in lesser hands, but this time it isn't.<br><br>They are ably supported by Laurence Fishburne and Ben Kingsley as two different types of coaches, from \"opposite side of the tracks\" (sorry for that old clich√©). It may seem formulaic, but in this case the dramatic contrasts works surprisingly well, and both come over as intelligent representatives of their particular points of view. And there are also great character moments by David Paymer {QUIZ SHOW, MR Saturday NIGHT, etc} and Hal Scardino {THE Indian IN THE CUPBOARD} as well.<br><br>Over all, I would highly commend this film as the type of story that manages to tread the fine line between intelligent ideas and an entertaining story. I recommend it to everyone. Give it half a chance and it can work for you. It really is a great example of intelligently entertaining!","user":"BadWebDiver","rank":[46,50]},{"title":"Big movie, in a small package","rating":9,"date":"2 December 2003","review":"This is such a great film! And there is more than one reason why I believe this.<br><br>First of all, Ben Kingsley is one of my favorite actors. And this movie(along with \"Sneakers\", \"Death and the Maiden\", \"Twelfth Night\", and \"Sexy Beast\"), really helps me believe that. And I believe that this is one of his best characters, and best films.<br><br>As far as Max Pomeranc's acting is concerned...wonderful. Even today I can't think of a kid who's had a better performance. Truly good acting. And sadly for his short lived career, I'd have to say he was in his prime there.<br><br>The creativity in this film is awesome! My favorite scene is when Bruce(Kingsley) is teaching Josh(Pomerac) the dynamics of chess, and when the camera flips back and forth between the chess pieces, each time building up the conversation, and going up the ladder of significant pieces. Powerful scene, with powerful lessons.<br><br>I also enjoy that if you don't have much of an interest in chess, that it still keeps you capitvated. I wasn't as interested in chess until I saw this movie. And I'm even more interested in film (I thought that I couldn't be more interested).<br><br>And finally...the score. I love James Horner. And this is one of the reasons why. Along with \"Sneakers\", \"Braveheart\", and many other Horner scores, I find it makes the movie that much better.<br><br>Truly a movie to remember always.","user":"Sneaky_Pete_XXVII","rank":[30,32]},{"title":"A life-changer","rating":10,"date":"5 November 2001","review":"_Searching for Bobby Fischer_ is possessive of a certain wonderful insight; it is a film that offers no heart-warming premeses and still manages to ease the soul.<br><br>The characters dwell in an utterly contemporary world; you will find no neighbors hauling in bags of money, chiming churchbells, perfect families, or million-dollar smiles anywhere in the film.  At the same time, this world of this film exhibits a resilience against its crueler realities that most of the art of the twentieth century eschewed in favor of probing the darkness of existence.  Yes, the main characters are prosperous, but the spectre of Fischer hangs over the world as a daunting warning of things to come.  The mood of the piece, enhanced by the excellent cinematography, sets the film up to succeed wonderfully, and the actors and text deliver.<br><br>One of the things I like the most about this movie, superficially, is that it does not insult the game of chess as it depicts it.  The depiction of the chess world is insightful and accurate, from the sharp division between granite-hewn chess scholars and colorful tactical wizards to the truly unequaled awe and gravity accompanying the notion of the Grandmaster. Perhaps these are things that can only truly be appreciated by those who have ventured to this world, but, thankfully, the film integrates these elements seamlessly into a universal story that is original and poignant in its detail and elegance.<br><br>Every actor in this film is spectacular, without exception.  That is a bold statement, but it is completely justified.  At no point do any of the actors miss a step; all the performances are smooth and appear to be utterly effortless.  In their featured roles, Ben Kingsley and Lawrence Fishburne put in performances that match in art, craft, and intensity, if not in length, any of their more prominent film roles.  Joan Allen is mind-bogglingly wonderful, considering how precise she has to be to fit such a massive character into such a truncated part in the script.  This is Joe Mantena's very finest performance, and, of course, this movie contains child acting to match any film ever made.  Even the bit parts are acted with intensity, depth, and elegance.  A lot of this is easy to miss because, on the surface, the film is so even-handed, but repeated viewings continually bring to attention wonderful nuances of these performances.<br><br>Any summary or synopsis will fail to accurately relate the \"message\" of this film; as in any great work of art, the quickest, most efficient way to word the resolution of the film's ideas and conflicts is to watch the film. This is where _Searching for Bobby Fischer_ really shines.  There is no way these characters could have ended up where they are from any other sequence of events than the one that took place; this is a wonderful example of how a plot is woven into a story rather than imposed on it.  The flipside of this is that there is extremely little to be found in this film that can be applied universally without reservation, and yet it still manages to be convincing.  There is something mysterious about this movie that rises toward the staggering mysteries of life, and repeated viewings are really the only means toward a full understanding of these ideas.<br><br>Undoubtedly, this is the best film made in the 1990s based on a true story (if you, like me, discount _Schindler's List_ from such assessments.  It hardly seems fair to compare _Schindler's List_ to any other film due to its unique purpose.).  If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it.  It may just change your life.","user":"PeteBDawg","rank":[42,48]}]
