[{"title":"The Babysitter: Okay bear with me on this one","rating":9,"date":"5 December 2018","review":"Anyone who knows me is aware that the older I'm getting the stricter I am with my ratings, so how did a goofy little horror comedy just get a 9/10? Well, because it's actually really damn good.<br><br>It tells the story of a scaredy cat weak little boy who still has a babysitter. One night he falls curious to what she does after he goes to sleep and see's more than he ever could have expected.<br><br>A Netflix original movie starring Samara Weaving, Hana Mae Lee, Bella Thorne, Leslie Bibb and Ken Marino it looks shiney, makes great use of it's soundtrack and has a wonderful 1980's vibe about it.<br><br>Make no mistake this is not a light hearted piece and is overflowing with lashings of violence and gore to go hand in hand with the hilarity.<br><br>Early on I recognised that the film had a real charm about it but I certainly never expected it to be THIS good. I get the impression this will be one of those odd titles like the infamously hated The Hottie &amp; The Nottie (2008) which folks don't agree with me on but I think this was excellent.<br><br>A gory rollercoaster ride that tips its hat to 80's classics but brings them into a new era which I couldn't help but appreciate.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Looks great<br><br>Solid soundtrack<br><br>Perfectly crafted<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Nothing immediatly springs to mind<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>We still didn't find out why he was shirtless!!!!<br><br>There are spoilt kids, then there is him<br><br>It's normally ugly people who are sacrificed","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[55,73]},{"title":"Hillariously Cheesy Slasher Comedy","rating":8,"date":"14 October 2017","review":"This is exactly what a good Halloween prank should look like. A little bit of gore, a little bit of T&amp;A, outrageously stereotypical high school kids, and nothing in the way of a plot to worry about.<br><br>That's not to say it's not extremely successful at what it aspires to: good, silly fun for Halloween.<br><br>Completely self-aware of all the slasher films it mimics, and more than able to mine the comedy in those memes, this film is just a hoot. Not anywhere near as serious as the Scream franchise tries to be with the horror/slasher genre, this film takes the opposite tact: remember that these films are for fun and a bit of escapism.<br><br>A soft PG-13 would be the MPAA rating for this if it wasn't Netflix, and it's appropriate for your tweens. But if you're in your 30s or 40s, it's gonna be a lot more enjoyable, since you know and recognize all the tropes at play, but know that the filmmakers know and are just letting you have fun watching them play out.<br><br>I hope the three leads get more good work out of this, because they all do a fabulous job with the material - there's not a lot to work with, but each of the three (the babysitter, boy kid, and his bestie girl) give you a good show and don't fall into the trap that this film could easily have done: there's not a scenery chewer among them, and they all do a great job of keeping their eye on the prize: a silly, fun, bit nostalgic, Halloween slasher.","user":"trims","rank":[76,105]},{"title":"Good Halloween movie when you don't really want to be scared","rating":8,"date":"13 October 2017","review":"It's not scary so if that's what you want skip this one. But it was a fun movie with a good amount of blood, some tension &amp; excitement and a fun story. It should probably be seen as a horror/comedy, not just a horror. It's kind of like the horror movie your mom would have let you watch when you were 12. Well I guess nowadays parents let their kids watch Freddy &amp; Jason at 5, but think back to the 70s or 80s, in fact my mom probably wouldn't have let me watch it because of the amount of blood &amp; guts. It does have some terrific kills, original for sure! I did think it was well done for what it was, acting was decent, production was good. The pacing was gold! No lulls in this. From the get go you care about this kid and whats going to happen to him. The poor underdog that we all want to see come out on top. I'd give it an 8 of 10.","user":"Psy-Ko","rank":[62,89]}]
