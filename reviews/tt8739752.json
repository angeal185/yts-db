[{"title":"Powerful","rating":9,"date":"14 October 2019","review":"While the plot is somewhat predictable and Elyas MBarek a bit too old for the character he plays the movie is a compelling thriller. Franco Nero delivers a powerful performance. Worth watching!","user":"mmaguina","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"Touching and thrilling","rating":9,"date":"24 April 2019","review":"Starting like a better TV crime movie, The Collini Case turns suddenly into one of the best drama films I have seen for a long time. A very emotional and also shocking movie and yes, real good cinema from Germany. I hope for a nomination for the oscar for the international feature film.<br><br>Don't forget tissues, and please note that the movie has some (necessarily) heavy scenes.","user":"kostehrenberg","rank":[25,41]},{"title":"Best Courtroom drama !","rating":9,"date":"30 October 2019","review":"A young lawyer defends a killer, ( Collini) who killed lawyer's mentor. While proceeding we found revealing mystery behind killing. Although movie starts very slowly and nothing going ahead till half hour gone, but after that movie starts to grip you and then enjoying shocking suspense till the end. Details of old time law and its codes are described well and we realised that same low is used to save Collini while he could not prove real accused before. Must watchable. Good acting by leading actors. perfect casing.","user":"saptesh786","rank":[6,8]}]
