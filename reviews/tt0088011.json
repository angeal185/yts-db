[{"title":"One of my favorite adventure movies","rating":9,"date":"1 December 2003","review":"A lot of great adventure movies came out of the 80's like the Star Wars sequels, Indiana Jones, The Goonies, etc. Romancing the Stone is one of those little gems, no pun intended, that somehow gets lost when we think of a great adventure movie. I just adore this movie, ever since I was a little girl I just wanted to live this movie. Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas had this amazing chemistry that made you wonder how the heck they were not a real couple in life. Though like Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, their friendship shows so well on screen as well as off that you're grateful they could bounce off each other so well. Romancing the Stone is such a fun film that shows off DeVito, Turner and Douglas' talent so well that we saw them all again in War of the Roses. Romancing came first though and what a great movie.<br><br>Joan Wilder is a lonely New York romance novelist who receives a treasure map mailed to her by sister, Elaine who calls Joan and begs her to come to Cartagena, Colombia, because Elaine has been kidnapped by bumbling antiquities smugglers Ira and Ralph, and the map is to be the ransom. Hastily flying to Colombia, Joan is detoured from the rendezvous with Ralph by Colonel Zolo, the man who killed Elaine's husband. Joan ends up in the jungle and is almost killed by Zolo, but is saved by the swashbuckling American exporter Jack T. Colton. For getting her to Cartagena, Joan promises to pay Jack for getting her to Cartagena so she can save her sister. But she ends up living one of her romance novels as her and Jack grow closer as they discover the map holds a stone that they will romance.<br><br>Romancing the Stone is a perfect mixture of adventure, romance and humor. It is literally like a romance novel, but one that even the guys could get into. I really like how Kathleen's character Joan goes from this anti-social caterpillar into a woman of the world by the end. It had such a great story arch for her. Michael Douglas as Jack, couldn't have been a more perfect choice, like his daddy, he reminds me of one of those old Hollywood actors who has been doing it for years. He's handsome, charismatic, funny and strong, so perfect for the role. Danny DeVito was so funny, I nearly died laughing when his cousin was leaving him to take the fall and Danny screams \"When will you come back\" his cousin screams \"Soon!\" he asks \"How soon?!\" and the cousin replies with \"very soon!\", how sweet to do that to your family, right? The villains are great and very scary. Everything about this film is just a ton of fun, I guarantee there will be something that you can connect with in this film. Wither it's the action, the romance or the humor, Romancing the Stone is a film not to be missed.<br><br>9/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[42,45]},{"title":"Hilarious, entertaining, timeless, classic","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2002","review":"I love this movie.  I'm sure that it's in my top-ten somewhere, because ever since I was a kid, I've never gotten sick of watching it.  The premise is one of those that's just so damn crazy it actually works.  It starts with a successful romance novelist, Joan Wilder, who has just finished her last book, but lacks the sort of love-life that she writes about.  When she learns that her sister has been kidnapped and is being held hostage, she takes off to South America to help her out.  It seems that the kidnappers want a treasure map that is in Joan's possession.  Joan is very much a city girl and doesn't fully realize the bind that she and her sis have gotten themselves into.  Once in South America, she takes the wrong bus, which breaks down in the South American jungle.  When she's held up by a corrupt Police Chief, a very rugged, unshaven, shot-gun toting, Michael Douglas (Jack Colton) shows up and kicks some ass.  See, Jack is a bird-trapper who wants nothing more than enough cash to buy himself a yacht.  Realizing that Joan is lost in the jungle and fully incapable of surviving on her own, Jack agrees to take her to the nearest town for $300 in travellers' checks, so off they go.  By now, we've learned that besides the two goons who've kidnapped Joan's sister (one of which is Danny DeVito in one of his funniest roles EVER) the South American police are after the map as well.  Everyone wants what's at the end of the map.  What follows for the next hour and a half is one of the most exciting and funny action/adventure movies ever filmed.  Michael Douglas is absolutely perfect in the role of Jack Colton and delivers some of the funniest one-liners I've ever heard.  Kathleen Turner is equally great as the naive romantic and, as always, she looks great.  A great script is brougth to life perfectly by Robert Zemeckis and his direction is air-tight.  Please go watch this movie, even if you've seen it a hundred times already......\"Oh YEAH!!!! Now that's a campfire!!!!","user":"billybrown41","rank":[54,63]},{"title":"Great","rating":8,"date":"7 July 2003","review":"Great action comedy adventure from the mid 80's starring Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny De Vito. Douglas and De Vito are great but to me the film belongs to Kathleen Turner, she's fantastic and looks absolutely stunning. Its also very well directed from the future director of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump amongst others. Its often mentioned as a rip off of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but I don't really think it is that apparent, the scenes in the Jungle at the start of the film are really good especially when they find the crashed plane \"There's nothing like a good fire\"!!!. Danny De Vito is really funny as the comic relief and his cousin has some funny lines \"Look at them snappers, would ya\". My only small complaint is the romantic stuff is a little corny but I suppose thats for the female audience. They followed this up with \"Jewel of the Nile\" just a year later! Sadly like most sequels it wasn't nearly as good as this, actually its not really worth bothering about unfortunately, Douglas, Turner and De Vito also teamed up again in another film \"War of the Roses\" but that film has no connection with this or Jewel of the Nile. So if you haven't seen Romancing the Stone look out for it, it's excellent.","user":"LuboLarsson","rank":[53,62]}]
