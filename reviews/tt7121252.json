[{"title":"A tour de force","rating":8,"date":"19 September 2018","review":"Set in suburban Rome, this is the true story of Stefano Cucchi, who was arrested for possession of drugs, then fell victim to police brutality. \nSounds familiar, even boring, I've-seen-it-all-before fare? Far from it, this is no white Rodney King story, there is no morale here, no heroes or anti-heroes, just a dysfunctional police &amp; penal system and its victims. And the movie? \nSimply, this is one of the best films produced by the ailing Italian cinema of the 2000s. \nA grueling, insanely gritty, claustrophobic, intense thriller, boosted by an array of painfully brilliant performances and the documentaristic, crammed with close-ups, direction - reminiscent of Kassowitz's work in La Haine. \nThis is an absolute tour de force. If you're even remotely interested in great storytelling, do not miss it.","user":"papadopoulos-panos","rank":[48,65]},{"title":"One week within the depths of the abyss","rating":8,"date":"30 April 2019","review":"Police officers using shameful techniques to extort confessions, an expeditious and dehumanized justice, a minimalist and indifferent prison medicine, ... Thus, we helplessly witness a slow but inescapable descent into hell. As sad as true.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[22,28]},{"title":"A real italian drama..except the fact, that really happened!","rating":8,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"It's my first review here on IMDb. I saw this movie today and I had really felt the pain lived by the Cucchi's family. The acting is awesome, assuming that Alessandro Borghi is a superb actor (he played Aureliano in Suburra). In Italy, where I live, the death of Stefano Cucchi has been a matter for many years and it's still today. All hail to Netflix, trying to \"do justice\" to this judicary case.<br><br>A must see, to understand better what Italy really is.","user":"Prex_28","rank":[38,55]}]
