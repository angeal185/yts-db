[{"title":"Good sequel with excellent acting by Gene Hackman and splendid support cast","rating":7,"date":"23 September 2005","review":"The movie concerns on Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman), an unorthodox New York narcotics cop investigating the flow of drug that follows the trail of the French connection . He travels to Marsaille following the foreign connection and tries to track down the eluded evil Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) , the smuggling ring chief , who escaped from N.Y.C. There , he joins forces to the French gendarmes (Bernard Fresson and Jean Pierre Castaldi , among others) to hunt down the ringleader . Then , Popeye getaways his French escorts and goes himself into action .<br><br>The picture is the follow-up to ¨French Connection¨(by William Friedkin) but didn't achieved the same success and was a flop at box office . However , being , nowadays , considered a very good film and highly rated . In the movie there is action , suspense , violence , intrigue and a little bit of humor in charge of Popeye Doyle , as he begins to find himself as a fish out of water in France and particularly on his relationships with the French people . The film develops a certain social critical to the French habits and there's specially a banter to the Police called Gendarmerie . The motion picture has action-packed but in the intervening period when the starring ends up being abducted by Alain Charnier's henchmen , it results to be a little bit boring , with overlong scenes ; besides , quite disagreeable as Popeye is injected heroin . Gene Hackman's interpretation as the rebel and nonconformist Popeye Doyle is top-notch as well as the previous film that's why he gained deservedly an Academy Award . Fernando Rey repeats perfectly his role as the elegant and cunning nasty and the secondary casting formed by French actors are very fine . The picture was stunningly directed by John Frankenheimer. Rating : Very good and well worth watching.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[52,61]},{"title":"Popeye in limbo","rating":5,"date":"5 August 2003","review":"This certainly must be the strangest of all sequels in motion picture history. The two main characters of French Connection I are still there, played by the same actors, Don Ellis composed another compelling musical score  but everything else has changed. The script is by someone else, the director is not a young experimentalist but an experienced and highly respected professional, the location is not New York but Marseilles, France for the whole duration of the movie. If you like FC I it is not at all certain you will like FC II, they did not use the same recipe (and I thought that's all the sequel business is about!). I, for my part, think this unusual kind of dealing with a sequel is fascinating. I like both FC I and FC II, but for entirely different reasons.<br><br>FC I is, as I see it, a situation. The actors, the events and their surroundings constitute a whole. Everything fits, that makes FC I a great movie. In FC II we meet Popeye Doyle in Marseilles. And from the first moment it becomes very clear: Popeye does NOT fit - and this is basically the story of FC II. A man finds himself on foreign ground, where all is incomprehensible, where every step is dangerous. Popeye is a fish out of the water, he nervously gasps for oxygen. All his contacts are French and Popeye can't figure them out, be they policemen or criminals or just common individuals.<br><br>POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD<br><br>So FC II focuses on the person of Popeye Doyle (all alone, without his buddy \"Cloudy\"). At first sight one might think, knowing the story of FC I, that Doyle is on a personal vendetta. But no, he is in France on official business! His commission is to assist the French police in the capturing of drug kingpin Charnier as he is the only one able to identify him. Being under the command of some frog he can hardly understand, that's not to Popeyes taste. Soon he strikes out on his own. Charnier's men capture him, hold him in a dingy room somewhere in the old town for weeks and make him a heroin addict. He then is deposited at the stairs of the police commandature. <br><br>The French police take Popeye in, lock him in an underground cell and force him to go cold turkey. His contact in the French police monitors Popeye and stays close to him during that time, without really becoming his friend. The harrowing scenes during the \"rehabilitation process\" are probably Gene Hackman's best on screen performance (apparently much of it was improvised). The movie resembles here a stage play and is far from mainstream moviemaking.<br><br>The \"rehabilitation\" is a success, but Popeye is not the person he was before. Somehow the viewer gets the impression that he is a broken man (or maybe he has just become more mature?). The French police officer confirms Doyle's suspicion that his superiors in New York did not send him over to act but had an agreement with the French police to use him as a bait for Charnier  a mere puppet. So it becomes clear  more so than in FC I  that Popeye Doyle is nothing but a small cog in the big, incomprehensible system.","user":"manuel-pestalozzi","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"\"I'd rather be a lamp-post in New York then the President of France\"","rating":8,"date":"13 August 2013","review":"John Frankenheimer may be the best Director that modern Movie Lovers have never heard of. He was always ahead of His time and never compromising. This Movie is surely uncompromising. It took a well known Best Actor Performance from a Best Picture Winner and the Character, Popeye Doyle, and stripped Him of the already barely likable persona of a tough, one dimensional Cop and laid Him open for all to see. It was not a pretty picture.<br><br>Neither is French Connection II. It will have you squirming and the Second Act detox is not for anyone with expectation of a slick Action Movie. This is a gritty, dirty, unpleasant Character Study that is compelling Cinema, but not Viewer Friendly. It was taking that Seventies realism just one step further. <br><br>It has enough Action and energy to make it as a Thriller but it never lets you forget the painful pursuit of Doyle's obsession with removing H from the Street and the even deeper pain of removing it from your body. This makes this compelling and completely coarse Cinema that makes you pay the price for your Entertainment. Not the best Box-Office formula but it is the stuff of Artistic Angst.","user":"LeonLouisRicci","rank":[11,12]}]
