[{"title":"Long, drawn out, and boring","rating":3,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"Omitting all of the scientific fallacies here (such as a silicon-based iPad and other things working after an EMP), this film just fails to keep the viewer's attention with any action. If a teenage girl running through the forest for 90 minutes is your thing, then enjoy.","user":"vap02703","rank":[38,43]},{"title":"What complete dross.","rating":1,"date":"30 November 2019","review":"This movie was just utterly frustrating to sit through. Something that should have been so easy to get right (post-EMP world) just somehow managed to actively get EVERYTHING wrong.<br><br>Spoilers follow.<br><br>The movie opens with the main protagonist, a teenage girl, drowning\" in a strange room trying to figure out a puzzle with the numerous telephones on the wall as the room fills with water. Ultimately, this turns out to be a VR video game. The girl is a game programmer who is working on her own video game, which is \"coming along\" as she tells her dad. This plot line is then dropped and literally never mentioned again.<br><br>What appears to be a magical EMP fries the electrical grid while leaving laptops, cell phones, and cars functional. At this point, you think you're going to be treated to a movie about the post apocalyptic story, exploring the intricacies of life without electricity.<br><br>Well too bad, Nancy, the entire plot will ignore the fact that literally in less than 24 hours, people are losing their minds, but rather this story is going to pivot into West Virginia \"Deliverance\" for no particular reason.<br><br>And that's it. That's the movie. From watching the main protagonist make an AC radio work by plugging it up to a DC battery, to watching her make exactly zero attempt to escape when loosely tied up for days, the entire show was just terrible. We kept expecting the \"twist\" to be that she was in a video game that she was going to wake up from since every character in the movie made all the worst decisions until the credits rolled rather abruptly.<br><br>Which was a good thing. The best part of the movie was that it was over.","user":"Javin","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Painful to watch...","rating":4,"date":"25 February 2020","review":"Okay where to start? They start with an \"intelligent\" girl escaping form an escape room simulation. Put her in a torn sack with an open top and she falls asleep? Why do people with a gag on their mouth and hands tied in front not just remove the gag and untie their feet? You are tied with leather straps in a workshop full of tools and metal objects and you decide to sit on the floor for 24 hours? And why didn't they drive off in the camper at the start (that was blocking the road)? You have a disabled car with half a tank and a camper with no gas and you need to travel 20 miles? hello? gas into camper??? Also running thru the woods has the kid wearing sneakers in some shots and barefoot in others? And when you are surrounded by woods and run out of a house being chased, don't run into the empty field... this movie totally destroyed Darwins theory. (Don't get me started on not picking up the rifle when it almost falls on top of you...)","user":"michaz-22974","rank":[8,8]}]
