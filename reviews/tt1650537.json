[{"title":"A movie that has a whole lot of nothing ever happening","rating":3,"date":"17 April 2012","review":"Inkubus (Robert Englund) spends the evening tormenting the unfortunate members of a police station skeleton crew and Diamante (William Forsythe), the detective who nearly put him away years ago. While it may seem like all fun and games for the crafty demon, he has two objectives: settle a score with Diamante and find a new host for rebirth so that he may live on for another century.<br><br>While the film boasts quite a few recognizable names and faces, the dialog is feeble, in stark contrast to the menacing tone and visuals. It's not quite campy and has no flow. A lot of the banter between Inkubus and the officers are laundry lists of past victims dating back to the beginning of time. I get it, he's killed a lot of people, I don't need to hear every name and date. In fact, Inkubus talks more about murdering people than actually killing them. <br><br>Englund and Forsythe are always a treat to watch but, yeesh, the acting by the rest of the cast is shameful. It's a baby step above porno-grade. (This coming from someone who watches a buttload of indie and low budget horror.) Speaking of pornos, there are two sex scenes, neither of which contains any nudity, despite the casting of rather well-endowed actresses.<br><br>The entire movie is one, long teaser of things to come and therein lies its colossal weakness. Scene after scene, I was itching for Inkubus to go postal on someone, anyone. Is that too much to ask from a beast that, in the beginning of the film, shows up with a decapitated head and a vehicle adorned with dismembered limbs and internal organs? I was both disappointed and relieved when the movie was done. Disappointed because the final showdown between Inkubus and his rival, Diamante, had ended so abruptly. Relieved because I was finally put out of my misery.<br><br>Skip this unless you're like me and hellbent on watching every horror ever released.","user":"scarletheels","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"A very low budget but watchable horror movie that is only that way because of the cast. Freddy Kruger makes it OK. I say C+","rating":5,"date":"17 February 2012","review":"\"You can't pull that trigger, you can't even move. There's nothing you can do about this.\" While working at a police station on it's last day the few cops that are left begin to question a young teen on his girlfriend's murder. When a stranger walks in holding her severed head the night takes a wicked turn and they wonder if the stranger is an Inkubus out for revenge. This is a movie that will very much appeal to horror fans, and that may be it. The movie is just one step above a movie made for cable TV and if it weren't for the cast it would have been that. I'm not saying that the cast and acting are great but the fact that Freddy Kruger is in this adds a level of creepy that actually helps the movie. The budget is very very low and the film quality is blurry at times. 95% of the movie takes place in a very plain and boring station but that actually helps the movie I think. Overall, not really impressed at all but worth watching for the cast or if you are a huge horror movie fan. I give it a C+.","user":"cosmo_tiger","rank":[20,24]},{"title":"Inkubus","rating":3,"date":"10 May 2012","review":"Robert Englund stars as a demon—he calls himself Inkubus (with an inverted K)—tormenting and playing mind games/magic tricks on a police station containing a small crew (the police station is being closed down as most of the employees have now moved into a brand new one), before killing each one. Joey Fatone (yes, of NSYNC), is a cop who has suffered what others consider a complete mental breakdown, being interviewed by a doctor while momentarily in a strait-jacket. His wife, a uniformed cop, suffered a gruesome fate, it seems, after her demon fetus rips itself from her belly. Fatone tells the doctor of the horrifying night at the soon-to-be-destroyed station after Englund turns himself in for committing serial killings for over a prolonged period of time (a century or so!). William Forsythe is a former cop who lost his wife and son to Englund's savagery, coming down to the station with his psychiatrist at Fatone's request to see if the man held in the interrogation room, hand-cuffed, is perhaps responsible for the murders that had left him a broken man (I personally think Forsythe is good here, playing a man relatively calm but fragile and barely held together; I think you can see the effort his character, the strides, has made to move on past a tragedy that many couldn't survive). Before long, members of law enforcement (security and personnel, including Jonathan Silverman of \"Weekend at Bernies\" fame) are manipulated and viciously mutilated/butchered by Englund who takes delight in his slaughter. Englund is having a blast, you can just tell, but this film's budget is obviously low. \"Inkubus\" looks like most of the money went to Englund and Forsythe with primarily the violence left off-screen, aftermaths of those decimated shown in explicit detail (a lot of body parts props are used along with plenty of colored Karo-syrup for blood) to convey how Inkubus hacked his victims to bits. A lot of quick cutting and careful camera placement diminishes the on screen brutality. The special effects involving Englund's abilities to jump around from one place to another and morph his body into whoever he so chooses to torture his prey are quite unimpressive and cheap. See this for the recognizable names, even though Fatone gets a brunt of the movie's scenes, this is all about Englund's battle of wills with Forsythe. My favorite scene has Englund, in the aforementioned interrogation room, taking credit for many well-known murders, including the White Chapel slayings among others, much to the dismay of Fatone and company. Probably the most memorable scene could be when Englund shows up to turn himself in for the murder currently holding another (the boy in the room with the female victim killed) under interrogation, carrying the head of the victim!","user":"Scarecrow-88","rank":[4,4]}]
