[{"title":"It's beautiful","rating":9,"date":"22 April 2019","review":"I am confused by all the negative ratings. I think anyone who has experienced true heart break can appreciate this movie. This film showcased a beautiful love, the ups and downs, the hardships and choices that happen when two people share their love together, and then ultimately, the end. No it isn't your typically happy ending film, but the love between these two was special, and the relationship between these three girls, well it's what we all want. People in our corner, who support us, and hold us up when we need it.","user":"megmarquis-39874","rank":[161,186]},{"title":"With friends like these!","rating":8,"date":"21 April 2019","review":"I loved the premise of this movie. Having such strong women support each other through some of the lows in life is truly what friendships especially women's friendships are about. I love Gina she's the reason I watched this film and Brittney Snow and when I saw Lakeith omgggggg done! Such an awesome cast.\nYes it's a bit predictable, yes it's not full of a lot of surprises but aren't all romcoms somehow very similar.\nAll of that is easily pushed aside and you can enjoy the story of this film. Plus the chemistry of the lead actors is so genuine you can tell they are friends outside the film.\nLast but not least the DIVERSITY!!! YESSS !!!!<br><br>I loved it and encourage you to watch it.","user":"brizzyb-","rank":[71,90]},{"title":"So real","rating":8,"date":"22 April 2019","review":"I loved this movie. I loved the characters. The visuals and the story. It's nice to see a love story and a break-up story that you can actually identify with. It was so real and so raw it actually made me cry and hurt my heart, but I laughed a lot as well. It's very accurate to what relationships are now and the ending was amazing. I loved it!","user":"vdiazq","rank":[52,67]}]
