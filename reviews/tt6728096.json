[{"title":"edgy, dry, dark and ridiculous","rating":8,"date":"15 February 2019","review":"Funny NZ movie, don't be swayed by some poor reviews from people who likely prefer their humour served up American style rather than Antipodean, but I for one appreciate their edginess, no limits and ability to laugh at themselves very much indeed, I think its quality. This film doesnt come across low budget to me as some reviewers claim, I think its on point, well acted with laugh out loud bits in it. I love the fact the two main actors wrote, directed and starred in the film, which is about a business run by two friends who offer a service dumping peoples partners for them, the varied and extreme ways they go about it is at times too funny/shocking for words. Amongst many brilliant scenes there is a short but fab cameo near the beginning, a tinder date getting down to it played by the wonderful Jermaine Clement (What We Do in The Shadows, Men in Black 3). The whole film is edgy, dry, dark and ridiculous throughout - but not at all heavy. I thank the Lord above that we have such quality stuff coming from the other side of the world to lighten our northern hemispherical lives, Chris Lilley's Summer Heights High, No Activity, What We Do in The Shadows spring immediately to mind, and although this isn't quite the same caliber, it IS under the radar quality comedy and I can think of many worse ways to spend an hour and a half on a dark February evening in the UK.","user":"vicky-51523","rank":[29,34]},{"title":"No filter friendship","rating":7,"date":"16 February 2019","review":"I admit, I'm surprised it was a movie. I thought I had clicked on a TV series and was going to enjoy new break up scenarios every episode. So for me it was over too quickly and wrapped up too easily. But regardless, I had fun. I laughed, I cringed, I was entertained.","user":"theirishfox","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"definitely a laughing out loud situation","rating":6,"date":"17 February 2019","review":"Just a great funny, uplifting and easy movie. it doesnt ask you for much, it lets you relax and have a good time.\nDark and corky comedy at its best.\nGood acting, lovable characters.\nAll the characters could have turned out to be played out so stupid or caricaturesque, but the actors do a great job.\nIts certainly a 'lifter upperer'","user":"The_Mich_","rank":[16,19]}]
