[{"title":"\"Requiem\" Is a Heavyweight","rating":9,"date":"12 February 2001","review":"You will not so much as want to take a sip of wine after watching this mesmerizing film about the horrors of drug addiction.  I was not a fan of director Darren Aronofsky's debut film \"Pi,\" but with this movie he proves to be a filmmaker of unlimited vision and style.  Four characters in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn are all driven to despair due to their drug abuse, the saddest being Ellen Burstyn as a nice Jewish widow who unwittingly becomes addicted to prescription diet pills that help her lose weight but drag her into a world of hallucinations and paranoia.  Burstyn is superb. It is so refreshing to see such a great veteran like her in such a challenging leading role, one in which she goes through a hell worse than that in \"The Exorcist.\"<br><br>But this is a director's film if there ever was one.  Aronofsky knows how to tell a story in a way that is dazzling in its use of sound, editing, and cinematography.  The score by the Kronos Quartet and Clint Mansell is the most striking movie music I have heard in a very long time.<br><br>\"Requiem for a Dream\" is not a movie for everyone.  It is the essence of independent filmmaking, a daring, engrossing, artful film that stays with you long after you leave the theater.  Hollywood bubblegum this ain't.","user":"Brian Scott Mednick","rank":[949,1]},{"title":"Like being repeatedly punched in the back of the head by Mike Tyson","rating":10,"date":"30 January 2002","review":"It's difficult to know what to say about Requiem For A Dream. I first saw it in the cinema when it was released in England and I have never seen an audience react to a film like this one. The climactic sequence, where the protagonists are effectively destroyed by their addictions, seemed to trigger a bout of heavy breathing in the audience. As it was ending I heard a few people crying. My girlfriend and I didn't say a single word to each other on the bus home.<br><br>I bought the film on DVD the day it came out, but it took me around six months to watch it again. And only then because a friend of mine was curious. If anything, the impact was heavier than the first time I watched it and I've vowed never to watch it ever again.<br><br>Yet I have still awarded a rating of 10 on imdb and would definitely assert that it's one of the three greatest films I have ever seen. Why? The acting is just amazing. Jennifer Connolly gives the best performance of her career (not too tricky considering the movies she's been in) and remains stunningly beautiful (in a haggard sort of a way) and noble even when she's roped into a gang bang to fund her heroin habit. Jared Leto annoyed me intensely in Fight Club but he's perfect as hapless junky Harry - forever exuding an air of kindly incompetence that endears him to the audience but that will ultimately destroy him. Marlon Wayans is equally brilliant - wearing a beaming smile for the first half of the film and a compelling look of confusion and betrayal for the rest of it.<br><br>As for Ellen Burstyn... never has an actress been so unfairly cheated out of an Oscar (and I've seen the atrocity that won Marcia Gay Harden that Oscar for). She is just the picture of sadness the whole film through - a heartbreaking example of what loneliness can do to vulnerable people. The scene where she complains to Harry about being old is honestly one of the most tragic things I've ever seen and it makes me want to break down just thinking about it.<br><br>As such, I can only recommend this incredibly important movie with certain reservations. If your favourite film is 'You've Got Mail' steer well clear. If 'Snow Dogs' has been your most thrilling cinematic experience of this year then put this film back on the shelf. Trust me, it'll save the costs incurred by those expensive therapy sessions.<br><br>However, if you believe that cinema is an important tool in helping us understand ourselves and that we will only achieve self awareness by plumbing the absolute depths of despair and self-destruction then you must watch Requiem For a Dream.","user":"Danfish","rank":[581,640]},{"title":"Awful and Essential","rating":25,"date":"25 November 2002","review":"I'm not going to waste space with a synopsis, as every second or third review provides one. A good indication of a challenging and original film is the number of 1/10 and 10/10 reviews, where the 1/10 reviews consist of just a few lines.  A pretty sure sign that those folks weren't able or willing to watch with an open mind.  Which is a good sign for casual viewers to give this film a wide berth.<br><br>I wish everyone I care about would see Requiem for a Dream.  Not because they will like it, or that it will teach them something they did not already know, but that it's a rare piece of work that will challenge and probably change them.  It's a film that has never been made before, with nothing to compare to it - a rarity these days.  I often find myself recommending films to people that I am unable to briefly describe.  These are usually the most involving and affecting ones. I'd like my family to see this, but can't *recommend* it to them.  I've recommended it to two friends, and they both had the same reaction:  I am glad I watched it, but I doubt I'll be in the frame of mind to watch it again, knowing what you feel.<br><br>As I sat watching the credits roll, I began crying, but I'm still not sure why.  Partly in reaction to the devastatingly tragic ending, partly the beauty (yes) of the film, partly my gratitude for good things in my life. I watched it again the same night with my girlfriend, not because I wanted to upset her, but I felt that I had to share it. After the credits rolled, we both were silent for a good ten minutes.  I found that I had thoughts I wanted to express, but could find no words.  This is one of the few films that are painful to experience, but I feel compelled to share with people I care about.  Some others in that short list include The Thin Red Line, Happiness, River's Edge,and The Deer Hunter.<br><br>These films all share a quality that's difficult to name.  No one likes feeling disturbed or shattered by a film, a work of art, a piece of music, but I feel experiencing these emotions and being asked to think, not just be entertained, is important now and then.<br><br>\"Favorite\" does not apply to this for me - this isn't about entertainment. One of the most devastating and beautiful experiences I've had watching a film.  One of the top five films I've ever seen.","user":"eric226","rank":[1,1]}]
