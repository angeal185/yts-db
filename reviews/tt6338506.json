[{"title":"Welcome to Hades...","rating":1,"date":"2 February 2019","review":"...is a better title in my opinion. You know not Hell where your immortal soul is punished for any of the deadly sins or even the original sin, but where such trivial things as trying to outsmart the Gods are punished by endlessly pushing a boulder up a steep hill only to have it roll back down on you, or forever trying to grasp a low hanging fruit that just inches away every time you reach for it, or where simply looking forward to watching a nice scary movie results in being punished with watching this.\nThis ... I don't know what to call it. It's not trash, or even human excrement because those originally had substance that had been depleted then have been discarded. This is just nothingness. Not even amateurish, because the word \"amateur\" implies some interest if not love in doing something, but not achieving a desired quality.\nThis looks like somebody opened exactly four Wikipedia pages, Psychoanalysis, Horror Tropes, Fetishes, and Phobias, and to make a quick buck, concocted a cacophonous sequence of sounds and image.\nSo I guess on some level, it does deliver. Welcome to the lowest of the low.","user":"sandginner","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"I love you mommy","rating":5,"date":"12 October 2018","review":"The production consists of six different short features by six different directors. All of the stories have some sort of twist. Some are supernatural and others are not. This is supposed to be a VHS tape that got delivered which never concluded or tied things together. And who even has a VHS player?<br><br>There were low budget effects and some were simply bad such as the zombie. The incest one was uncomfortable at times. Most of the twists you see coming. <br><br>Guide: F-word, sex, nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[2,5]}]
