[{"title":"La Bella Luna!","rating":5,"date":"5 June 2003","review":"People call this Cher's movie, but Olympia Dukakis makes it for me. It's under her roof that I heard some of my favorite dialogue in the movies.<br><br>I am not a violent person, but  \"Old man . . . you give those dogs another piece of my meat and I'll kick ya til ya dead!\" has got to be on my top ten list of memorable quotes.<br><br>I like the conversations around this family's kitchen table maybe because growing up, meals in my house were pretty silent even though there were seven of us.  Funny that it took an Irish screenwriter to capture the Italian cadences.  These people aren't caricatures of Italians or any other ethnicity, they are just a vocal family.<br><br>In another time, with just a few changes in the script, this story could have been high operatic drama.  But it's not.  It's a romantic comedy not a tragedy - even though it contains elements of tragedy - death under a bus, a lost limb, betrayal of marriage vows, and misinterpretations and misunderstandings.<br><br>But these characters TALK about what's on their minds. You want to know where the Met is located? You ask your hairdresser.  You think your husband is flirting with another woman? You tell him that while you're both working behind the wine counter - in front of a customer.  You're mad at your brother, you want to know why men need more than one woman, you want your son to pay for the wedding of his only daughter?  If you really want to know, if you really want results or answers,  you speak up!<br><br>\nBesides movies based on Agatha Christie novels, it is rare that a story ends with bringing the entire cast together more satisfyingly than \"Moonstruck.\" The morning-after-the-opera scene in Rose Castorini's  sunny kitchen with all the characters present is one that I can watch again and again. \"You've got a love-bite on yer neck - your life's goin down the toilet!\" \"I want you to stop seeing her\"  \"Who are we waiting for?\"  \"Johnny Cammarari\" \"You're a part of the family!\"<br><br>No matter what sort of table you grew up around, rent or buy this movie.<br><br>\nAnd remember, \"No matter what you're gonna do you gonna die, just like everybody else!\"","user":"yayamagic","rank":[96,101]},{"title":"Love this movie. It is on my \"at least once a year\" list.","rating":10,"date":"24 December 2004","review":"This movie is brilliant in every way. It touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way, but never lectures. The script never condescends toward any character, not even the hapless Johnny. It also and benefits from spot-on direction, production design, casting, and performances. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike \"Cher\" than she has ever been is a wonder to me. I watch Moonstruck at least once a year and I just viewed it again this Christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well. It has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end.","user":"addedit","rank":[71,81]},{"title":"So warm","rating":10,"date":"17 August 1998","review":"So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. A kitchen sink world of bakeries, and hairdressers, and plumbing, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. Should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction? Take your pick -- they're both faultless. Let me get back to that New York City that lies just beyond the looking glass.","user":"Varlaam","rank":[85,100]}]
