[{"title":"A solid scare with no cheap shots or plot holes","rating":8,"date":"10 December 2017","review":"The synopsis here on IMDb is not quite accurate. There are actually 2 stories happening here, and how they connect is revealed slowly, with perfect timing and a suspenseful buildup. <br><br>The first story concerns the town doctor, who is helping the police with an investigation of a woman who has died. His character spend the entire film teetering between trying to figure out this town's dark past and how it connects to some recent and frightening events, and trying to live with the torment of the loss of his son, who went missing some years earlier. <br><br>The other story is about a married couple (and her best friend) who are in town to convert an old, disused building into a bed &amp; breakfast. There are some personal issues between the three, but the most interesting character by far is the wife. She's also experienced some trauma in her past, and it is she who suffers the strange events that happen in this story. None of what happens to her is ever seen by her husband or her friend, so we don't really know if it's real or imagined. <br><br>The town's current crimes, the renovation of the b&amp;b, how the two narratives cross paths is revealed slowly, with suspense and satisfying scares, and is done exceedingly well. <br><br>The actors' performances were well done; not a stinker among them. And the landscape is perfect for such a tale. Desolate, cold, isolated...not just in miles, but in connection with the outside world (for example, difficulty in getting a cell phone signal). There are no cheap shots, no stunt scares. A beautiful soundtrack and gorgeous cinematography are icing on the cake of this thriller.","user":"horrorismyhome","rank":[60,72]},{"title":"Where we at?","rating":8,"date":"23 February 2018","review":"A very moody film, that cuts back and forth between two storylines. And that makes it really interesting. Also the location of the one storyline is really setting the mood. While there are phantastical elements to it, I would argue that this is more of a thriller, rather than straight horror. But it does have quite a few \"jump scares\" and you might feel frighten from time to time.<br><br>If that sounds intriguing, believe me it is. It is also very well made. The acting is great, the script will keep you guessing what will come next and there are enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat ... maybe even after the movie is over. The guessing part of it all is what makes it work the first time around. I haven't seen it a second time, but I'm sure there are things to discover and enjoy then too","user":"kosmasp","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"don't renovate an isolated Icelandic cabin in the off-season","rating":7,"date":"22 August 2019","review":"Iceland in winter looks bleak, stunning, and mysterious. enjoyed this one. great atmosphere.<br><br>Got a bit annoyed with the ending for how smart the psychologist is and with all these ghostly pointed visions he has -- how on earth does he just ignore the wet seashells, footsteps downstairs, and open cellar door at the end? absolutely shocking. and to not even mention it to home girl detective who has linked pretty much everything??? he could have cleaned up 2 cold cases for her in 10 seconds. Cannot blame him tho...if I found my young child ended up stuck in a used septic tank on a remote island I would be just as bitter","user":"gpflinn","rank":[8,9]}]
