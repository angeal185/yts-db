[{"title":"Express Chungking Express","rating":13,"date":"13 April 2001","review":"Every day we interact with people.  Within the course of 24 hours we can influence someone's life (for better or worse) so deeply that they will never forget us.  Is it possible that the next person you fall in love with could be a notorious heroin smuggler or the counter girl at the express luncheonette counter?  Wong Kar-Wai, the writer/director of Chungking Express seems to think so. The film is broken into two tales.  The first story is mainly about the sadder side of love.  Love comes and brings us light and joy, but it also goes and leaves us feeling empty and needing fulfillment.  The two main characters in this half of the film, a police officer played dolefully by Takeshi Kaneshiro, and a heroin smuggler played icily by Bridgitte Lin, interact for only ten percent of the story, but their meeting leaves them both with memories that will last life time.  The story ends on a high note that shows us that a simple act of kindness can bring the most unreceptive people to appreciate the beauty hidden in life. The second (and far stronger) story centers around two people and their interaction at a fast food counter in the Kwaloon section of Hong Kong. Tony Leung plays the part of a rejected lover perfectly and gives of the air of being sad without ever really being pathetic.  Faye Wang's quirky portrayal of the free-spirited counter girl who helps Leung forget about his ex-girlfriend, is exactly what the film needed to counter-balance its darker first half.  These characters and their bizarre relationship illustrates that love can manifest itself in any number of ways, many of them unconventional. The mechanism that allows these seemingly disjointed stories together is the camera work.  Wong Kar-Wai uses a decidedly unique filming technique for much of the first half of the film; a blurry hand-held technique (think Blaire Witch on drugs) used during the chase scenes.  The recurring style in the second half is a time-lapse type shot with people around the main subjects moving very fast and the subjects themselves moving in slow motion (a really cool effect).  The camera styles add a common surreal element to each of the stories, while still keeping them somewhat independent. Perhaps the most striking element of the film is the interconnectedness of the characters and situations.  There are many establishing shots showing characters inhabiting the same places at different times, and even the same places at the same times without noticing each other.  This style of filming can alter the viewer's perception of reality, daring us to believe that we are all extras in somebody else's movie.","user":"CardMastah","rank":[153,167]},{"title":"Wong Kar-Wei's Best","rating":10,"date":"26 April 2002","review":"Flawless tale of brief encounters and abstract moments.  Far superior than most of Hong Kong's bullet ridden action fests, Chungking Express takes you on an emotional journey of love, loss, and chance excursions. Cinematography and editing is groundbreaking as this drama unfolds soap-opera-like stories without all the overacting and melodrama.  Wong Kar-Wei has sealed his place in cinematic history with this tour de force.","user":"Yum","rank":[79,92]},{"title":"A little gem...","rating":28,"date":"28 December 2003","review":"I love this film. There, that is as simple as I can make it out. I am not going to go into any details about the plot (some people have accused it of not having one)or what takes place in the film, just want to say that this is the real deal. A film about love that is mired in reality (though shot through the lens of alcehmist - truly a visual experience to be savoured)though not gritty reality, just every day boring life and love, the sort of love we go through each day ourselves, the kinda incomplete love where two people touch each other briefly and spend more time dreaming of what could be rather than it actually taking place. A film that is romantic in all the right places, in all the right ways (believe me it will make you smile not reach for the sick bucket - Hollywood take note)and has a deft light comic touch that leaves you smiling in recognition at the heartbreak rather than crying over it. The acting and script are both first rate - tony leung can do no wrong in my book - and overall it leaves you hungry for more little gems like this. (Either that or wishing you were in love...)","user":"parker-longbaugh","rank":[96,114]}]
