[{"title":"Terrible. Absolute trash!","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"Filmed at our high school my daughter was and other students were extras so I was exited to see it. It took forever to be released and I was almost ashamed when we finally watched it. Over the top language and subject matter. What a pathetic attempt at a high school comedy....and I grew up watching all the high school movies in the 80s. <br><br>Horrible. Just horrible. If I were Zach Fox I would NOT be proud of this one.","user":"bramaddyl","rank":[27,34]},{"title":"This is not a John Hughes film","rating":1,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"If this is not a John Hughes high school movie, then what is it? It's most definitely not Bob Clark's Porky's, because Porky's was kinda funny. <br><br>The OTT acting, the jokes that has been used more than a $5 hooker at a Vegas convention and the frog-cum-prince story line made me stop watching at probably 30 minutes in this \"coming of age (HAHA) movie.\" There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. None. Zip. Zero. Nada. Nothing. It's a black hole of God-knows-what.<br><br>I highly doubt that even over-sexed high school kids will find anything in this movie remotely funny, or amusing.","user":"ruan-pretorius30","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Horrible! Beyond horrible!","rating":1,"date":"24 August 2018","review":"Who on earth rated this an 8.2? This is one of the worst movies I've seen...ever! Avoid this movie. I watched it til the end to see if it somehow got better to explain the high rating but nope. Waste of time.","user":"dancing_ostrich","rank":[18,25]}]
