[{"title":"A Good Famous Mystery","rating":9,"date":"18 October 2014","review":"The film is in fact based on the 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie. It is a wonderful film - I have never read the book to compare to the movie - but I can say the film is worth watching if you love a good mystery movie.<br><br>An all-star, well seasoned, cast does help to make the film more intriguing, more appealing because all gave outstanding performances in this film. The story itself will easily pull you in even if you are unfamiliar with the cast - the story (mystery) is that good.<br><br>If you like this movie then you may enjoy similar types of films like \"Sleuth\", \"Deathtrap\" or \"Murder By Death\".<br><br>9/10","user":"Rainey-Dawn","rank":[24,24]},{"title":"A Cast To Die For","rating":8,"date":"14 September 2007","review":"That Sidney Lumet knows how to frame an actor within his or her character is a very well known fact - \"The Pawnbroker\" \"Network\" \"Dog Day Afternoon\" and some other spectacular pieces of acting prove that point unquestionably. Here, there is a sort of \"divertissment\". Agatha Christie given a first class treatment (not that Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple wasn't first class, but the production value here is as impressive as the cast) in the hands of Sidney Lumet who knew how to put a bunch of sensational actors in a confined space - \"12 Angry Men\" for instance and make it riveting. There a 12 Angry people here too and (almost) each part is cast with relish and delight. Albert Finney, marvelous, manages, not only to survive, under the weight of his characterization but to create something bold, exquisitely structured, great fun to watch and to hear. Ingrid Bergman won her third Oscar for her missionary looking after little brown babies - I thought she was a highlight indeed but in my modest opinion, Valentina Cortese for \"Day For Night\" deserved it that year, Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates's twin brother, also with a mother fixation and a compelling facial tic. Wendy Hiller was, clearly, having a ball and that, on the screen, is always contagious. Sean Connery and Vanessa Redgrave make a surprisingly hot pair, Lauren Bacall over does it of course but who cares, Jacqueline Bisset is breathtaking, Rachel Roberts a hoot. John Gielgud is John Gielgud and that in itself is a major plus. Colin Blakely does wonders with his moment and Dennis Quilley plays his Italian as if this was a silent movie. Martin Balsam is always fun to watch, no matter the accent. Richard Widmark is splendid in his villainy and Jean Pierre Cassel very moving indeed. The only weak spot in the cast is Michael York. Totally unbelievable. I suspect that \"Murder in The Orient Express\" 33 years old already, will continue delighting audiences for years to come.","user":"giorgiosurbani","rank":[114,127]},{"title":"It Oozes Elegance","rating":10,"date":"7 February 2005","review":"This whodunit story by Dame Agatha is excellent. She has always been my favorite writer of detective fiction. I keep returning to the film version, however, not because of the story but because of the film's sheer elegance and style. It is awash in elegance ... the majestic cinematography; the glamorous clothes; the delightfully eccentric aristocratic characters; the mysterious yet refined musical score. The film is so theatrically regal I'm surprised that it did not feature a representative of British royalty.<br><br>The setting is Europe in the 1930's. The pace is slow and relaxed. And while the dialogue is in English, the film has a deliciously international flavor, with a mix of interesting accents and word pronunciations. Heavy on dialogue, the film never seems overly talky, the result of a clever screenplay and lush visuals. Humor is included in the script usually in the form of tasteful put-downs. Example: an attractive Mrs. Hubbard comments: \"Don't you agree the man must have entered my compartment to gain access to Mr. Ratchett?\" The aging Princess Dragomiroff responds in a deadpan tone: \"I can think of no other reason, madam.\"<br><br>In his portrayal of Hercule Poirot, Albert Finney almost literally disappears into the role, a tribute to convincing makeup and to Finney's adroit acting. His performance is appropriately idiosyncratic, deliciously hammy, and theatrical, every bit as entertaining in this film as Peter Ustinov is in subsequent Christie movies. The rest of the cast has ensemble parts, my favorite being Wendy Hiller whose Princess Dragomiroff comes across as royal, proud, and very eccentric.<br><br>With its snowy landscapes, ornate and cozy interiors, and subdued lighting, \"Murder On The Orient Express\" is an excellent movie to watch on a cold, winter night, snuggled under a blanket or next to a warm fireplace with a cup of cappuccino or a glass of cognac. Just be sure that all knives and daggers in your mansion are out of reach from your staff of servants.","user":"Lechuguilla","rank":[141,161]}]
