[{"title":"Very watchable atypical gangster film","rating":6,"date":"4 December 2017","review":"DirtyMoney is a very understated and simple film that manages to stay true to the Gangster film norms without ever falling foul of its clich√©s.<br><br>Rather than exaggerate the life of an urban criminal with extensive gunplay, car chases and witty one-liners the film takes a serious and considered look at highs and lows of (mostly) victimless crime.<br><br>Those extremes aren't a Goodfellas type romp; the voice-over tells us more than the images, and there's a quiet satisfaction supported by only muted displays of extravagance. Similarly the lows are captured in the expressions of the actors more than their actions, letting the audience empathise rather than be a voyeur.<br><br>This could have made DirtyMoney a great film, something Anthony Welsh's performance deserves. Unfortunately it instead left me detached, observing without participating in the film and its story, and at times confused by the actions and motives of key characters.<br><br>Overall it's worth watching and a fine alternative take on the classic British gangster genre. Just not one to watch a second time.","user":"Cederic","rank":[4,5]}]
