[{"title":"An apauling mess of a movie.","rating":1,"date":"12 September 2018","review":"It was as if a bunch of home-schooled special effects dropouts decided to make a movie but couldn't afford: actors, script writers, costumes, an editor, a director, a producer or even a decent computer - and decided to fill those roles themselves. \nSeriously the most enjoyable part was the credits, in which I'm shocked anyone wanted their name attributed.<br><br>With over 500 - 10 star reviews it's abundantly clear that the makers of this movie have cheated the rating process and those rating should simply be removed so other's don't ruin their evenings with this utter tripe.","user":"rehit-it","rank":[29,31]},{"title":"Most boring movie I ever watched so far","rating":1,"date":"4 September 2018","review":"The alien was a total ripoff of the alien that tried to kill Arnold Schwarzenegger in Predator. Maybe the borrowed the costume.<br><br>One monster had the cheapest costume I have ever seen. It's as if it was a 5th grade class was putting on a play. I can't believe that in this day and age people STILL make movies that are this lousy. Doesn't anyone speak up and say \"Hey, this is total crap, let's stop production after day 2 before we are all laughed at\".<br><br>This movie is rated 1. I would never watch it again and if the great Apocalypse was going to turn this earth into The Walking Dead I would burn this movies cd just so I know that no one tortured me with it.<br><br>The acting was as if they called people on day one and shoved a script into their hands and told them to read. This entire movie was a flop.","user":"nosanta-21409","rank":[77,99]},{"title":"Beyond bad","rating":1,"date":"4 September 2018","review":"I often wonder how a whole cast be so terrible. Ya figure at least one would be passable at least... nope. Lame dialog, nonsensical plot, silly home computer graphics... enough said. Nothing here, move on.","user":"TheGusK","rank":[47,62]}]
