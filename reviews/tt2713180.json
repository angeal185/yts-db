[{"title":"love this movie highly recommend.","rating":9,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"One of my favorite movies. Amazing cast and a lot of hard feeling moments that bring this movie together. There are moments that have you flashing between emotions and you can feel the emotions from the characters.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[44,49]},{"title":"Gritty but unrealistic hocum and very silly final scene.","rating":5,"date":"26 October 2014","review":"OK, lets face it. We are over movies where one American kills 20 Germans who seemingly can't hit the wall of a Barn. They were big in the 1950's, and 1970s, but not any longer.<br><br>Fury is a gritty film, with great productions values, really period vehicles, settings and costume. The acting is good, but it is let down by tow things.<br><br>Clichéd characters. There is the tough commander, the new kid, the slightly crazy guy. There are a lot of clichéd characters here.<br><br>Unrealistic battle scenes. Seriously I just switched off in the last scene. 20 or 30 SS guys with Panzerfasut would have destroyed an immobilied Sherman tank in 5 or 6 minutes. BUT 200 CRACK SS soldiers can't destroy a tank with its tracks off, sitting in the middle of a road????? The tank only has machine guns facing forward, so most of its sides are unprotected. Germans are carrying bazookas, but instead choose to shoot the tank with machine guns, which would not do anything? Seriously, one of the silliest, most unrealistic scenes in any war movie. Really spoilt what could have been a good movie.","user":"barjo-915-203229","rank":[695,881]},{"title":"What was the Point !!","rating":3,"date":"27 October 2014","review":"If you want to know about the war, then watch the amazing 'World At War' documentary series.<br><br>If the point of this film was, as so many other reviews have said, to demonstrate the carnage, pain and suffering or war, then why is there no real context to any of the action.<br><br>Why is Brad Pitt's body in one piece when the Germans explode 2 grenades at his feet, inside his tank.<br><br>Why does a crack SS battalion continually commit suicide by walking in front of the machine guns of the crippled tank (instead of walking round the back) <br><br>Why did the Yanks leave the spare machine gun ammunition on the outside of the tank when preparing the ambush? I know, it was so Brad could look heroic and get shot trying to retrieve it.<br><br>The SS troops fired 2 or 3 RPG type rockets at the tank, caused damage and killed one of the men, then stopped firing them.<br><br>The premise of keeping the crossroads was ridiculous. Anyone could just have walked through the adjacent fields if they wanted to get past.<br><br>This film has pretensions of being a serious movie and the cinematography/soundtrack etc. are very well done, but the whole thing just lacks any reality or validity.","user":"foulds72","rank":[541,720]}]
