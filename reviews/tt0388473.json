[{"title":"A different kind of Christmas story","rating":6,"date":"6 August 2004","review":"At first glance, I wasn't sure if I would like this movie. The \"miracles DO happen on Christmas\" cliché is very boring and I typically don't enjoy movies that employ it, but this is a very different kind of Christmas movie.<br><br>We are given three homeless characters with complex personalities and backgrounds, who are as endearing as they are repellent. They take up the task of caring for a baby they found in the trash, and trying to bring it back to its mother. We learn the secrets that made these people homeless, we learn about the workings of human shame and desperation, and we learn that \"miracles DO happen on Christmas.\" But in the least cheesy way possible!<br><br>The plot is very slow-moving, but still, it is interesting and very carefully laid out. This would be a very compelling live-action movie, but the use of animation adds so much visual interest, particularly the expressive (and sometimes hideous!!) face of Hana, the gangly transvestite. The choice of music is unique and very fitting: the song played during a walking-around-the-city montage is reminiscent of Clockwork Orange.<br><br>Interesting and careful story, complex and realistic story, tremendous visual appeal and excellent music. I guess this movie pretty much has it all!","user":"noisy_mouse","rank":[68,69]},{"title":"A visually stunning third film, worthy of the director","rating":10,"date":"19 February 2004","review":"No spoilers - you just have to see it.  Satoshi Kon continues his directorial success with Tokyo Godfathers.  Like Perfect Blue and Millennium actress, TG wows the watcher immediately with the attention to detail. The scenes are exquisitely painted - when it is snowing you can almost smell it and feel the stillness.  And the characters expressions convey emotions expertly by subtlety or caricature as occasion demands.  Leave behind your Hollywood ideas of what a movie or worse, a cartoon should be.  And then go see his previous two films as well.  Satoshi Kon's films are true works of art.","user":"jwolff-1","rank":[45,49]},{"title":"Sensitive and beautiful","rating":9,"date":"4 September 2005","review":"Having suffered through the painfully pretentious and shallow, pseudo-Lynchian mess of Perfect Blue, I was understandably skeptical about watching another film by Satoshi Kon (I have not yet seen Millennium Actress, but am now quite intrigued to do so). Tokyo Godfathers (a title which at first struck me as belonging most probably to a pseudo-psychological mafia thriller) was not only a pleasant surprise; it was the best anime feature I've seen in many years, probably since Ghost in the Shell, excluding anything by Hayao Miyazaki. Like the classic Grave of the Fireflies, Tokyo Godfathers struck me as unusual in the fact that it draws much from European cinema  English, Irish, German or Italian  while most commercial anime features try to mimic American film-making. But while Grave of the Fireflies was painfully sad and bleak, Tokyo Godfathers is irresistibly charming, and manages to be funny and incredibly touching at once like few anime films  few animated films, at that  ever achieve.<br><br>Tokyo Godfathers is remarkably non-violent, as pacifistic perhaps as Miyazaki's films. You won't find any grand futuristic structures or fantastical creatures here; in fact, the animation may seem crude at first. But the characters are where the film really hits its mark. Kon triumphs, like in his excellent series Paranoia Agent, by not succumbing to the accepted prototypes and standards of how characters should look in an anime film; the lead characters in the film are all gorgeously ugly, in a way that even Miyazaki had not yet dared to do. Even the child character, Miyuki, is chubby, and not cute and beautiful in the way little girls 'should' be, by the unwritten laws of anime. Thus, Kon's characters are believable and true to life; they are three anti-heroes, outcasts from society, each running away from their pasts. Especially charming is Hana (AKA 'Uncle Bag'), the golden-hearted transvestite, who supplies much of the film's comic relief but also some of its most touching moments.<br><br>Tokyo Godfathers  despite some far-fetched but amusing plot twists and coincidences  is at its core a very simple story, a beautiful little story about family, love and friendship. Few anime films are so unpretending; and thus, few anime films manage to be so strong. Watch Tokyo Godfathers; you'll laugh, you'll cry. And believe you me, ten minutes into it you'll forget it was ever animated.","user":"itamarscomix","rank":[36,40]}]
