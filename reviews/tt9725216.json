It's got some interesting information about North to West Africa and beautiful pictures. I will watch this film more than once!","user":"leyama","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Outstanding authentic and funny travel documentary","rating":10,"date":"4 March 2020","review":"Since I myself worked and lived in Africa for 3 years I had a special connection to the experiences and insights the two got during their travels. It's really like that - as an European (German) you definitely got these problems with the adjustment to the african lifestyle. But after some time it's all good. The people are warm and curious.<br><br>For me this is an outstanding authentic and fun travel documentary. A rare one of it's kind. Most others are kind of sugar-coated. If you like it straight in your face - here's your movie. Will definitely watch it again.","user":"chrissirusher","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"A must watch for all would be adventure travellers","rating":10,"date":"25 March 2020","review":"Sit back and enjoy the adventure of two people living their dreams for real - travelling from Germany to Africa in a Landrover just for the hell of it - tears, laughter and memories shared along with stunning scenery and all the trials of such a trip.\nThe filming captures exactly what to expect and is both creative and stunning - showing the good, the bad and the ugly - just sit back and enjoy!","user":"grahamxyzch","rank":[1,1]}]
