[{"title":"Good but not Great Movie","rating":8,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"I went to see this with an open mind as the reviews were mixed. I actually enjoyed the movie. Yes, some parts were slow but this is not Infinity Wars people (the Marvel generation wants an explosion or murder every 2 minutes). I actually found the dad's character as the most believable. His struggles in life and poor decision making was the actual catalyst for most of the stuff that went on. I say go see it for yourself. May not be a date movie but definitely a guy movie for sure.","user":"macinasent","rank":[68,76]},{"title":"Not your typical drug dealer movie.","rating":7,"date":"18 September 2018","review":"I enjoyed most of this film. There were a few slow parts and its just as much a family drama as it is a crime/action flick. I thought newcomer Richie Merritt did a good job. He is likable and I found my self rooting for him throughout the movie. The setting of the film is early to mid 80's Detroit when factories are closing and the city is starting to spiral downward. This is a bit depressing but the city itself is kind of a character in the movie because of this. You understand why young men turn to a life of crime when there are no other ways to make a living. White Boy Rick was more a victim of his surroundings and environment than anything else. I can't recommend that you sprain an ankle running out to see WBR but it is worth seeing.","user":"billgamble","rank":[66,74]},{"title":"Glad I spent the money, despite mediocre reviews.","rating":8,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"Yes, if you expect this to be a Hollywood \"gangster movie\" with distinctly extreme highs and lows in the plot, you'll be extremely disappointed....but if you remember that White Boy Rick is just a human being, and this is a film about human beings struggling, you'll appreciate this film.","user":"jdrubnitz","rank":[68,81]}]
