[{"title":"Needed tighter writing; many of the details were implausible or wrong","rating":3,"date":"21 September 2016","review":"Could have been a good movie. But a movie with a crime plot, cyber and law subplots shouldn't get all the details wrong. Errors included citing the wrong constitutional amendments and using the wrong law enforcement agencies. Although the acting was pretty good, the characters actions were counter-intuitive, thus creating distance between the characters and the audience. As a result, the movie quickly grew implausible and therefore tedious. They needed better technical consultants and tighter writing. Perhaps a little research before finalizing the script would have uncovered the errors. We deserve better.","user":"lowrisk","rank":[64,81]},{"title":"Mildly good, nothing special to be remembered for.","rating":6,"date":"9 September 2016","review":"I never came to the theater with great expectations of this one. It just follows an already known path and delivers nothing special to be remembered for. The acting is on a similar level, maybe the antagonist stood out a bit more than the others, but not by a huge margin.<br><br>The plot was linear and did not offer very much to begin with. It had some illogical things happening too. Felt rushed to me. The ending was unsatisfying and did not provide much to complete the movie.<br><br>Something was missing between the first act of the movie and the second act - the transition was not smooth. The story of the antagonist was given out so lamely that it made exhale more air than usual... It could've been done better. Everything could have been done better, might've ended with an okay movie to spend some time on.<br><br>Unsettling movie. 6/10 (I mainly rate movies from 5 to 10 so this is really low for me)","user":"alexanderbahchevanov1","rank":[63,86]},{"title":"Weak","rating":5,"date":"27 September 2016","review":"It sounds interesting enough: Pierce Brosnan plays an airline tycoon who accidentally befriends the wrong dude, namely one of his IT guys, Patrick who becomes obsessed with becoming a part of his life (or rather obsessed with getting into his daughter Kaitlyn's), and when he tries to get rid off him, this guy turns their smart house against them, and shows them the absolute horrors of what it means to be online all the time. <br><br>It's a story that I've seen million times before, and despite this possibly being the first time I've seen the story done in this era of all smart phones having a camera and everyone on social media (but I'm sure there exist a another movie that has done that before this one), the story itself is predictable and unimaginative enough that it overshadows the updated concept. <br><br>Pierce Brosnan is very good in a really bad movie. I'm not sure what that really means. Usually when an actor is driving a crap vehicle, it only showcases what a great driver the actor can be, but in this case the vehicle was too crappy to actually do that. It evens out for both somewhere in the middle.<br><br>Not the worse movie in the world, just a very weak attempt at an old clich√©.","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[33,44]}]
