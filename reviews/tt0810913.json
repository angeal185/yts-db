[{"title":"Sandler's Career May Never Recover","rating":1,"date":"10 December 2011","review":"I sincerely wish I could erase this film from my memory. I love Adam Sandler, and yes, he's had a couple of bad films but this one is so bad I believe his career might actually end because of it.<br><br>The constant shrieking of Jill is unbearable, and were we really meant to take Sandler's female character seriously? Or was this film only meant to be \"funny\" because Sandler's in drag? I've still not figured that out, and I don't think I'll devote much more time to doing so.<br><br>This film led me to create my IMDb account because if what I've said here can keep even one person from paying to see it then I feel it will have been worth writing.<br><br>Cheers.","user":"prescottcandace","rank":[206,237]},{"title":"Deserves to be Erased from Film History","rating":1,"date":"12 November 2011","review":"I will start by saying that I have enjoyed many Adam Sandler movies and have found him to be a generally funny guy when I've seen him interviewed and when he was on Saturday Night Live.<br><br>I laughed gleefully through Anger Management, Mr. Deeds, Billy Madison, 50 First Dates, and Happy Gilmore. Funny People and Just Go With It were awesome movies! I was brought to tears in Sandler's emotional portrayal in Reign Over Me.<br><br>I have great respect for the man as a comedian and actor. But Jack and Jill is abysmal. The \"jokes\" are not only bizarrely misplaced - THEY ARE NOT FUNNY. I did not hear a single laugh, not even a slight giggle from any audience member in the theater. In fact, almost 1/3 of them walked out before it was over. Those who stayed, openly derided the flick as we all exited the theater in utter disgust and sadness.<br><br>I don't know why Al Pacino was in this movie, his acting made it seem like he was forced at gun point to do this movie. Nick Swardson and Tim Meadows are way too funny to be in such a disaster. Especially given Swardson's stellar performance in Just Go With It.<br><br>This movie is not a flop, its not an \"oops\", its not a mistake - it's a career ending pile of trash. A career ender that started with Sandler's god awful \"Grown Ups\" and climaxes with this revolting hunk of garbage.<br><br>Sorry Adam, it's over.","user":"dekkar5","rank":[373,454]},{"title":"torture","rating":1,"date":"11 November 2011","review":"The only reason I went to see this atrocity was because my nine year old daughter really wanted to see it and I'm able to get through some of these terrible movies (i.e. Zookeeper) because she's having fun throughout the movie. Even though she enjoyed the movie I was counting the minutes until it ended. Every scene, every line every moment of this 'movie' was unfunny, awkward, unrealistic (even for an unrealistic movie) and seriously unentertaining (not a word I know). Just when I thought the movie was over, it makes you sit through these stupid clips of real life twins saying 'funny' things about being a twin. IT LASTS THROUGH TILL THE END OF THE CREDITS! This movie is meant to hurt you for paying to see it. Even worse than Old Dogs....seriously!","user":"jitzcovitz","rank":[256,313]}]
