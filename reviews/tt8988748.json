[{"title":"Just Perfect","rating":10,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"This movie really took me by surprise. From the moment it starts it takes a hold of you and doesn't let you go until the very emotional ending, at which point this reviewer realised he was watching his favourite movie of the year so far (and it's almost November!).<br><br>The way it is filmed and edited is great, proving once again how much more advanced spanish cinema is than anything else on the continent, and that it can more than hold its own against large international studios.<br><br>The photography is beautiful, really capturing the beauty of small town and rural northern Spain, and showing us the very real world this characters inhabit.<br><br>The script is amazing, having you laughing out loud in one moment only to have you biting your lip not to cry in the very next. It's really entertaining and is only supplemented by superb acting from everyone who appears on screen, making you forget you're watching a movie at all. Both of the leads are outstanding and should definitely be at least considered for Goya's this year.<br><br>It's a really poignant coming of age story with a focus on the central brotherly relationship and family in general, so do yourself a favour and watch it already.<br><br>Another recommendation is to watch the original Spanish dub to really feel the way characters interact with each other and how natural they are, which might be lost in the english dub.","user":"ivans536","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"Excelent movie which shows the love between brothers","rating":8,"date":"19 October 2019","review":"Many times the life is too hard to understand when you are so young and you become angry and isolated.

Isolated, introverted and yet fiercely intuitive, he finds himself sentenced to a juvenile detention centre after a string of criminal offences. Twenty-odd attempted escapes later and Héctor is introduced to a rescue dog in need of training. Across an unspecified amount of time, Héctor forms a strong bond with this dog and names him Sheep. Their friendship is abruptly cut short once Héctor learns Sheep has been adopted, and that his job of training him has reached completion. Devested by the loss, he flees from the detention centre and reunites with his brother Ismael (Sánchez) and ailing grandmother Cuca (Cordón) on a spontaneous road trip to locate his estranged companion. What follows is an extraordinarily beautiful film about brotherhood and reconnecting with your past while facing up to life's impending challenges. Seventeen packs two fantastic central performances by relative unknowns Biel Montoro and Nacho Sánchez. Both actors share wonderful chemistry together and their dysfunctional yet discreetly compassionate relationship is at the very heart of the film, driving it forward with bittersweet tenderness and occasional moments of casual humour. Arévalo and Sánchez craft a wonderful screenplay that feels genuinely human and relatable in its approach to sibling dynamics and family ties while not succumbing to overly sentimental territory. Seventeen is a remarkable piece of work that deserves much more recognition. It stands as one of 2019's most heart-warming films and is currently available on Netflix.","user":"rustonreviews","rank":[11,14]}]
