[{"title":"Why do they need an American remake of EVERYTHING?","rating":6,"date":"6 July 2019","review":"It's ok, but the Danish movie is just SO good. Same screenwriter but it's missing the beautiful subtlety of the close ups at hands and eyes that made the acting so special in the Danish one. It's missing Sigur RÃ³s. Not everything should have a remake.","user":"anaac-37893","rank":[123,146]},{"title":"Boring","rating":3,"date":"30 October 2019","review":"Isabel's character is emotionless I think it shows emptiness in the story....Imagine meeting your abandoned child in the day of her wedding. In the same day and in the same place you meet your ex and also you meet the person that took place in your daughter's life. I really believe no one could react as cold as isabel.","user":"josejrez","rank":[21,26]},{"title":"I Liked It!","rating":7,"date":"7 December 2019","review":"I am not sure why folks are trashing this film. Its a fine movie. The acting is stellar. Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams are outstanding and the story is good. I thought the pacing was good with respect to character growth and allowing the story to unfold. I definitely want to see the Danish version now!","user":"missreneb","rank":[15,18]}]
