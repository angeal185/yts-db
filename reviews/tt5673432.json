[{"title":"All fake reviews on here...","rating":1,"date":"3 June 2019","review":"Most of these reviews are fake garbage, this movie isn't terrible but it's definitely not good, least of all 8.4 stars good???? Fake reviews are obvious and I have it one star to try and balance it out. It's really a 4 or 5 star movie but who cares. Don't believe these fake reviews.","user":"ryker2","rank":[75,172]},{"title":"This is bad!","rating":1,"date":"4 August 2019","review":"Don't trust the ratings on this one. So bad acting and story I would gave it a 5. But because it have all those false ratings I will give it a 1.","user":"wempa_82","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Enjoyable","rating":6,"date":"11 June 2019","review":"Honestly it's not the best thing ever, but I found myself enjoying this a lot more than I expected. The re-connection of two high-school friends, and their strange adventures going to a wedding.","user":"Fredrik_Pedersen","rank":[4,10]}]
