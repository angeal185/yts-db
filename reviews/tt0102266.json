[{"title":"they don't make action movies like this anymore...","rating":9,"date":"10 December 2004","review":"In the early 90's, there was a definite, consistent presence in action movies: slow motion cinematography, wild gun-play, and funny one-liners. Granted, there are still some of those today (2004), but it just wasn't the same as back in the day. Now there are so many special effects in the current action films that it drowns out what used to be the great style of a \"popcorn flick\".<br><br>Die Hard paved the way for these type of movies, and some of the offspring of this did well and did not. The Last Boyscout was one that did well. This was a very intelligent and fun action/thriller/buddy-comedy that can still be enjoyed to this day. Tony Scott is the master of under-appreciated action movies in the 90's, such as this and True Romance. <br><br>My suggestion is to get a 6-pack, go rent this movie, sit back and enjoy the ride.","user":"TexasMovieBuff","rank":[127,143]},{"title":"It's violent, it's vulgar....but I still like it.","rating":20,"date":"20 May 1999","review":"The pairing of director Tony Scott (\"Top Gun\"), producer Joel Silver (\"Lethal Weapon\" and \"Die Hard\", among others), and screenwriter Shane Black (\"Lethal Weapon\", \"Long Kiss Goodnight\") led to one of the most brutal action films of it's time. In his review of the film, Roger Ebert gave it three stars, but not without citing it's misogynistic and degrading qualities. True enough, it's not a pretty picture: people are beaten, shot, and maimed in all sorts of ways; women are slapped around and degraded; a 13-year old girl cusses, is cussed at, has a gun pointed at her temple by her own father, and is put in the path of thugs.<br><br>Despite all that, I enjoy watching the film, but not for any of the above qualities. The movie has an energy and a chemistry between the two leads (Willis and Wayans) that is missing from most action films. Shane Black's screenplay is full of hilarious gems (see the \"Quotes\" section.) There's a freeway scene where our heroes attempt to alert someone of a bomb. Wayans pulls out a pen and paper and draws a picture. Willis replied, \"That doesn't look like a bomb; it looks like an apple with lines coming out of it! They're gonna say don't open the briefcase, it's full of fresh fruit!\" Wayans spells out B-O-M, and shows the paper to the person they're after, only to have the person fire a shot at them. Willis replies, \"I meant to tell you: bomb means 'f**k you' in Polish.\" It's a scene that represents the comic timing of the film.<br><br>Of course, the nastiness of the film is what most remember about it. There's a good amount of foul language and an even greater amount of graphic violence (the villain meets a really gruesome end.) And of course, women aren't spared in this one. The relationship between Willis and his estranged wife is one of friction: when he catches his best friend with her, he pulls out a gun and shoots, hitting their wedding photo. And at the end, as the two reunite, he embraces her and whispers profanity in her ear; not the most loving sentiment.<br><br>The bottom line: this isn't really a film for the faint of heart. It's a rough film, as it almost should be. The easily offended might consider something lighter and fluffier. All others might consider giving this film a shot.","user":"Rid.X","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"A genre classic - oft copied, never matched","rating":8,"date":"7 May 1999","review":"Although this film receives a lot of credit for reinvigorating the action/buddy genre movie, the praise is too often misdirected.  For instance, whilst Bruce Willis gives a solid performance as low-life private eye Joe Hallenbeck, we have seen the act a dozen times.  There are remnants of Die Hard's John McClane in every knowing smirk and pained cigarette inhalation.  Equally, Tony Scott's direction is still based on an obsession with placing bright lights behind the actors and turning up the volume of car chases and gunshots.  Jimmy Dix, the faded football hero, is given a suitably comic persona by Damon Wayons and the action sequences are as good as you will find elsewhere in Hollywood.  However, these are not the attractions of the film for me.<br><br>You might think, from what is written above, that I disliked the film but you would be mistaken to think that as I believe it to be an absolute classic of its kind.  I truly think The Last Boy Scout should be used as a teaching tool at film schools the world over.  In spite of its glaring limitations it is a movie that has everything!  The opening scene is a modern movie classic - up there with those of Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Goodfellas.  If there is a film-goer alive whose mouth didn't gape in wonderous amusement at the climax to the opening scene then I am amazed. The plot, as far fetched as it is, provides a perfect vehicle for the key elements that go towards making this the gem of a movie that it is.<br><br>First in the list of key elements is the wonderfully funny dialogue. Shane Black's hallmark of snappy one-liners is all over the sizzling repartee between the two heroes.  Even Hallenbeck's daughter gets a couple of laugh-out-loud lines.  Secondly, the story benefits from the ideal combination of: sport, gambling, violence, comedy, the odd topless dancer, important values of family and friendship, revenge and honour.  Take out the topless dancer and they pretty much all feature in The Godfather!<br><br>The third crucial component for the success of The Last Boy Scout is the perfect casting of the bad guys.  Milo, played to chilling perfection by Taylor Negron, is a bad guy with a difference.  He isn't just a mindless hard man.  His brilliantly annoying habit of calling people by their elongated names is a superb touch (Joe becomes Joseph, Jimmy becomes James and so on), as are his attempts at civility when trying to \"do a formal introduction\" with the kidnapped Hallenbeck.  Other bad guys are fleshed out and distinguished by quirky traits or funny lines.  They are not merely there to make the good guys look good.<br><br>Overall, this film is not a piece of celluloid art.  It is, however, a perfect example of popcorn-friendly entertainment.  It is the sort of movie you imagine the makers would like to see as movie-goers themselves. Without being utterly contemptible or mindlessly low-brow it entertains.  An ideal Saturday night movie to watch with a group of friends.","user":"LukeS","rank":[143,162]}]
