[{"title":"LIFE PURSUITS GONE TERRIBLY WRONG","rating":10,"date":"1 June 2019","review":"While this movie was especially special for me because of the location, it is terribly sad that a loving relationship got destroyed because the couple put their individual goals ahead of their bond with each other. It really pulls on a romantics heart strings. Thus an absolutely great film because it draws you in.","user":"rlsspecial","rank":[0,0]}]
