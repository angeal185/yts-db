[{"title":"It's OK, looks good, effective jump-scares, Macody carries it.","rating":6,"date":"24 November 2017","review":"Synnøve Macody Lund plays the main character, and she does a great job. She has a natural way of acting that I like. I hate that acting- acting that a lot of older generation actors do. I'm gonna sound like a douche-bag saying this, but it doesn't hurt that Macody Lund is very pretty, you see her face a lot, and that's okay. Although what really matters of course, is that she does a good job with the acting. And she does!<br><br>Anywho! She inherits an old house, and she goes there to sell it. And uhm, scary stuff happens, OK?<br><br>Hjemsøkt looks very good, which is no big surprise, considering the director is a photographer. At least he has done some photography work before. He knows that he's doing when it comes to that stuff. The sound design is also well done. Slightly loud sounds at times, but still very good. <br><br>The first half or so of the movie contains a lot of fake scares. Knocking on a door, a door closing, that kind of thing. It just about gets a little annoying, before it more or less stops. It's pretty well paced, and didn't really become boring at all. Also helps that it's fairly short. About an hour, twenty minutes.<br><br>Hjemsøkt is not a bad movie. But it's not the big haunted house movie of the year, either. The story is alright, although I didn't find it extremely exciting. <br><br>With a little more genuine scares, and maybe some more effects and makeup, would help a lot with making this more great than just OK. I liked it, but don't expect a new Insidious or Conjuring.","user":"Finfrosk86","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"Very good acting and interesting story","rating":8,"date":"24 September 2018","review":"Although you can predict the little girl is a ghost from the get-go, finding out what happened to her is still a mystery. Well acted, nice snowy set.","user":"birgit_schuette","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Chilling and beautiful","rating":7,"date":"5 November 2018","review":"Loved the pace and simplicity of this film. The lead actor is a hauntingly beautiful woman that seems to slip effortlessly between enchanting prettiness to psychologically disturbed. If you like your horror films filled with blood and gore this is not for you. If you like thoughtful, slow build, psychological skin tingling then look no further than this icy treat.","user":"matt-france","rank":[3,3]}]
