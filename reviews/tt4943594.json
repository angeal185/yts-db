[{"title":"breathtaking doco with some profound insights","rating":8,"date":"8 October 2015","review":"needs more love. must have been expensive as hell to produce. i particularly liked the \"behind the scenes\" shots, showing how they managed to get such amazing footage of the extreme feats. cameramen dangling on wires being pulled through a forest, or over a waterfall; or helicopters passing over ravines and zooming far out until the subject is a dot on a mountainside. most of those shots, were this a Hollywood production, would have been created on a computer. <br><br>but intimately this is about the people involved. what drives them to take such risks for seemingly no reward. the answers may surprise. the rock-climber mentoring youths who would otherwise be shooting gang- members in drive-bys was particularly touching. \"you get to the summit, there is no summit. it's just flat. and you realize, it's all about the process\" this applies to so much in life. <br><br>watch this inspiring and awe-inspiring documentary","user":"Lao_Che","rank":[12,14]}]
