[{"title":"A mess","rating":4,"date":"10 December 2018","review":"Reading the bright reviews is shocking. The acting is very awkward and flat where the dialogue could have been light and charming. There's no personality and no real grasp or connection the audience can make with the main character due to his monotonous tone. The first-person narrative is laughable. The audio is outright awful at some points. Aside from how it was executed, the plot was interesting-- but again, the acting is a huuge turn off.","user":"tageriadavis","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but","rating":1,"date":"1 November 2019","review":"Movie has an overall score of 4.5 (160 votes). 16 out of 17 reviews are expressing great praise. All were written ON 2 NOVEMBER 2018 by accounts created in NOVEMBER 2018 who have NO OTHER RATINGS.\nAre you kidding me? They didn't even try to be discreet about it.<br><br>And yeah, this movie was utter rubbish. Not even LAUGHABLY bad, just totally terrible. (Admittedly, I didn't finish watching it, but I doubt there was any improvement.) As if a horned up teenager saw American Psycho and thought to himself, I can do something like that, but better and with tits!","user":"fieaoremaolmuire","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Really Love...Just needed more","rating":8,"date":"2 November 2018","review":"Okay..this film is pretty solid...but..I just needed a little bit more. I loved the FIRST and THIRD ACT of the film, however the 2nd act wasa missing something. It seemed to be little rushed and doesn't quite develop naturally. It could be because of the lack of budget or inexperience of writing. The direction of the film was dexterously executed and characters are likeable. I just needed that Act 2 to be stronger, never the less the little indie film is a hidden gem, that I recommend people to check out.","user":"larrytunnelvision","rank":[4,10]}]
