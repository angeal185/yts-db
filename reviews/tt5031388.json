[{"title":"An Insane Ride of Twists.","rating":7,"date":"27 February 2020","review":"A stranger walks into a bar...Not a joke but with a confession to the bar owner Burt who also works for a crime organization, the stranger confesses to the bar owner that he slept with his wife without knowing she was even married, then the insane ride starts! We get to the story progression from each perspective of this weird love triangle.<br><br>A good indie movie which proves that a good entertained doesn't at all require a big budget! The plot is carefully thought and written, the acting is decent from the whole cast, the twists are well placed although I'd have liked to be out of the loop till later in the movie, all added up with a good directing in this tense, fun, enjoyable ride.","user":"Impartial-Critic","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Surprise surprise!","rating":8,"date":"12 February 2020","review":"One really good movie, not a blockbuster of course but nevertheless I actually enjoyed it. Nice surprise. A bit slow at times, a bit naive but overall interesting and worth watching.","user":"windsorenquirer","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Great Indie!","rating":10,"date":"26 January 2020","review":"Really enjoyed this movie. I was hooked during the first big exchange between Burt and Guy and it never let up. The story was unique, which seems to be a rarity these days with all the sequels and remakes. It's refreshing that someone in Hollywood can still have an original idea. I gave it five stars for that fact alone. Buy or rent this movie. You won't be disappointed.","user":"Sub50","rank":[7,18]}]
