[{"title":"Stevens' Big Gamble","rating":11,"date":"11 July 2003","review":"Just as Otto Preminger gambled in the casting of unknown Jean Seaberg in the title role of \"St. Joan,\" so George Stevens similarly took a big risk with Millie Perkins in \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\"<br><br>As the story goes, Stevens saw model Millie on a magazine cover, fell in love with her expressive eyes, and theorized that this unknown would be more effective than an established star to portray Anne. <br><br>Though Perkins had no acting experience, Stevens--at the peak of his career--was confident that he could teach Millie to act, at least for this film.<br><br>Although Audrey Hepburn was very interested in the part (as was Stevens in her) Stevens finally decided that it would be more effective to use a fresh actor--one with whom the public would have no pre-conceptions. (Other successful cases to support his theory being Hurd Hatfield as Dorian Gray and Robert Alda as George Gershwin.)  Still, it was a huge gamble, since Anne was the pivotal role in this major production. <br><br>Well, the results are now history.  For many moviegoers Perkins was just fine.  While some critics easily spotted her reedy inexperience and rather sympathized with her being thrust into a super-professional arena, they conceded that Millie did do a commendable job. <br><br>Unfortunately, Perkins took a lashing from most critics, and her subsequent acting career has been relegated to minor roles in \"B\" films.  Those are the \"breaks,\" though in the fickle film world.<br><br>Yet, with all this, many people still think of Perkins' countenance when they envision of Anne Frank.  So she and Stevens made a lasting impression. <br><br>\nLikewise, for many, this production remains the definitive version of a profoundly touching World War II real-life chronicle.","user":"harry-76","rank":[59,73]},{"title":"No substitute for the real diary","rating":7,"date":"6 April 2013","review":"I just finished reading the diary of Anne Frank and was moved. As you probably already know, Anne Frank was a German-born Dutch Jewish girl who went into hiding with her family and another family during the Holocaust. The majority of the movie takes place in their hiding spot. There are also added post-war scenes at the beginning and end of the movie that Anne of course couldn't have written, because she didn't survive.<br><br>I was curious to see this movie, which I had only seen two scenes of on TV- Anne not throwing away her yellow star because it's a Star of David, and Mr. Van Daan drawing fury for stealing food. Neither scene is from the actual diary. There's the rub- the best parts of this movie are lifted directly from the book, but what's added, changed or left out is no improvement. Anne's diary reads as good as fiction already, so I don't think there was much need to \"dramatize\" it. Some scenes- like the characters confessing their sins on D-Day- come close to sappy, and Anne never really reconciled with her mother. I also wasn't very impressed with the actress playing Anne in this film. By all means, see the movie- but don't see the movie instead of reading the real thing.","user":"gizmomogwai","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"A Story That's Full Of Hope And Yet Still Very Sad","rating":7,"date":"24 April 2010","review":"Throughout the movie, it's the hopefulness that is constantly being expressed that makes this all the more sad to watch - because, of course, we (the viewer) know the hopelessness of the situation; we know how it's going to end.<br><br>The story is based on a stageplay which was in turn based on the actual diary of Anne Frank, whose family (being Jewish) went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Holland in 1942, sharing a very small space with several others. As the title implies, the movie is largely about Anne. We watch her grow up in this claustrophobic setting - starting at age 13 and spending more than two years there until the group was discovered. Starting out as a child with a natural rebellious streak, Anne grows into a young woman, falling in love with a young man sharing the living quarters. Millie Perkins was excellent as young Anne, and I was impressed with Joseph Schildkraut as her father Otto, who was in the end the only survivor. The movie begins and ends with his post-war visit to the place where they were hidden, and his grief at being the only survivor among his family is powerfully portrayed. In general, all the performances in this were quite good, and there was a believable portrayal of the difficulties involved in so many people sharing so little space under such stressful circumstances, and there are a number of very suspenseful moments involved. It's a very moving story.","user":"sddavis63","rank":[12,13]}]
