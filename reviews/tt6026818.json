[{"title":"Emotional & Relevant","rating":10,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"Not only is this visually amazing underwater documentary, but it is also rare sight into the life of a man who was willing to do whatever it takes for the planet. I really enjoyed this film. It's an excellent investigation and raw journalism at it's finest, but it also registers so deeply with me emotionally. I feel like I know Rob Stewart, and I'm friends with the sharks. This one is going in the library, can wait for the blu ray.","user":"catdotscott","rank":[9,14]},{"title":"Really a beautiful movie from a beautiful soul","rating":10,"date":"22 October 2018","review":"Shakwater Extinction is one of the best documentaries where sharks are the victims. Rob, the real life hero who gave his life to save the Sharks for this world and delivers an important message and changes the way you see the oceans. Its underwater photography is breathtaking. Really a Beautiful movie from a beautiful soul. I would also appreciate Rob's parents (Sandy and Brian) and Team Sharkwater who worked tirelessly to complete and release this movie after Rob's death. -Shariq","user":"samriq-29479","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"Exciting, amazing film by Rob Stewart","rating":10,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"This film is so exciting and fascinating.
