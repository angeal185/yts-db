[{"title":"Convoluted","rating":5,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"This movie is convoluted without proper exposition, particularly the characters and plot points early on in the movie never get a proper explanation. The film drags on for too long, it could be 30 minutes shorter and not much would change. The movie's saving grace is definitely Fran Drescher's character, whose down-to-earth, driven attitude is very likeable. The main character is harder to watch, and her motivations are not explained clearly which makes it hard to root for her. The movie tries to make a point in the last few minutes which falls utterly flat.<br><br>Overall, I would say don't watch this unless you are a Fran Drescher fan, because she does get a lot of screen time and delivers a very solid performance. Other than her presence, the film is unremarkable and boring. It drags on for too long, focusing on an untinteresting main character in a plot that is too abstract to be engaging.","user":"bugger-17071","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"Great film! Enjoyed it from beginning to end.","rating":10,"date":"26 September 2019","review":"This was a fantastic film, very good script, an amazing cast; enjoyed Fran Drescher's, Lindy Booth's and Kayla Ewell's delivery of their roles .<br><br>Peter Bogdanovich is a living legend and loved seeing him in this film, perfect for the role. Good dialogues, character development, not a common story. It engages the audience and makes you experience what the characters are going through. Recommended!","user":"JSLopez97","rank":[3,6]}]
