[{"title":"Simple yet Beautiful","rating":7,"date":"5 December 2018","review":"I watched this movie on a Tuesday night, after a long day at work. Sometimes, I believe after a tiring day when you face so many problems on different levels, watching a simple movie where life is easy, people are forgiving and sceneries are warm, is a good way to wrap it up and go to bed with a smile on your face. Although the actors did a great job, some parts of the plot were a little naive and too easy.. Which has nothing to do with the reality of people and life.. Nevertheless I find that these types of movies have another purpose: to calm and sooth the mind, to allow you to feel the rythm and enjoy the music and finally to remember that it is always possible to choose the easy and forgiving way out in life.. It is a matter of choice of what you want to see, to feel, to show and to share..","user":"paligladayan","rank":[50,54]},{"title":"A good movie!","rating":7,"date":"16 November 2018","review":"I like it very much .

A classic love story, with a wonderful story line that hasn't been done 1000 times. It was charming and light hearted yet kept you in the edge of your seat. The story was told in a wonderful way. If you are a sucker for a good love story, this is a it's see.","user":"msqua02","rank":[45,56]}]
