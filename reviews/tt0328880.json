[{"title":"An improbable gem","rating":9,"date":"29 May 2004","review":"I didn't go out of my way to see this film, as it had already been pretty much disregarded by both the critics and the public.  Shame on me.  BROTHER BEAR has many strengths to recommend it, and I hope it eventually finds an audience on video.<br><br>I'll admit a bias: I live in the Yukon Territory, and the story obviously takes place in next-door Alaska (with characters named \"Sitka\", \"Kenai\", and \"Tanana\", it's pretty obvious).  Like many other Disney movies, it takes its inspiration from a traditional legend.  Unlike many other Disney movies, this movie manages to remain respectful to the original legend.<br><br>The messages are wonderful.  That love is an important thing for a real man to learn.  That \"the spirits\" need to be respected.  That vengeance can have a terrible price.  This movie manages to do it (mostly) without resorting to daffy sidekicks and sappy tugs at the heartstrings.  Yes, there's Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas revisiting their \"Bob and Doug Mackenzie\" roles as the two moose, but I didn't find them jarring at all.  The story works.<br><br>So does the animation.  This is a visually beautiful film.  Yes, it's apparent to my (computer pro) eye that Disney's animation unit is making more use of computer techniques.  Mostly, though, you see them used to wonderful effect, like making a realistic snowfall, or moving the point of view through a shot.  The animation style is also very appropriate for the story.  And as a northerner, I loved the many aurora shots; they looked spot-on.<br><br>Not everything in BROTHER BEAR worked for me, unfortunately.  Phil Collins' music for TARZAN was quite good, but it mostly falls flat here (except maybe for \"On My Way\").  A couple of numbers come close to the embarassingly bad category.<br><br>Still, this is nowhere near enough for me to disregard this movie.  I put it above THE LION KING (way above), probably a little ahead of TARZAN, and almost on the same upper-echelon with THE LITTLE MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.","user":"Thunderbuck","rank":[61,67]},{"title":"Outstanding","rating":10,"date":"23 August 2004","review":"Disney's penultimate traditionally animated feature proved to be one of its best. The film is loosely based on the mythology of the native people of the Pacific Northwest. It has many classic mythological elements such as transformations and journeys, both physical and spiritual. It is also unique among Disney films, in having no villain (at least in a tangible sense). <br><br>The movie features great music by Phil Collins and beautiful animation. It also makes novel use of the movie screen by switching to a wider aspect ratio at a certain point in the story.<br><br>The protagonist, the Inuit Kenai, learns the value of his totem, love, when he is transformed into a bear and becomes the traveling companion of the cub, Koda. The film also features the hilarious Canadian moose, Rutt and Tuke (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) for comic relief.<br><br>I would count Brother Bear among my three favorite animated films (along with South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut and Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron). It's also great for the kids. 10/10","user":"pgear83","rank":[44,49]},{"title":"An excellent film utilizing a dying art form - animation by hand is still the best.","rating":8,"date":"21 December 2003","review":"Though I think highly of the new three-dimensional computerized animated films, the traditional hand-drawn stuff just has a different charm. And whatever some people say, traditional animation is not dated. This cartoon's story is interesting, accurately based on real Inuit beliefs. Every component of it is great, and the scene where Koda discovers that Kenai is really a man is beautiful. Not going to give away the happenings behind this powerful, moving scene. The hand-drawn animation is done in the classical style, but the computer graphics are breathtaking. The waterfalls, the mountains, the Aurora Borealis... they're fantastic. The two McKenzie moose are great for comic relief. The characterization is  great, and I like the Inuit priest. The brotherhood is something I can identify with perfectly - my three cousins are exactly the same. The music depends on preference. I think the opening Tina Turner song is OK, nothing special, but the Phil Collins songs are better. It's no Jungle Book, Oliver and Company or Lion King when it comes to the music department. I think Jeremy Suarez (seems familiar in the behind-the-scenes trailer) must be a pretty good actor. Koda's my favorite character in the movie. This cartoon is really great, and I'm torn between it and Finding Nemo for cartoon of the year. It's great entertainment, an interesting story told through a truly great, but dying, art form.","user":"rapt0r_claw-1","rank":[46,52]}]
