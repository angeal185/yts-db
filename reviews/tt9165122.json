[{"title":"Garth Brooks is God's answer for unanswered prayers","rating":10,"date":"20 December 2018","review":"Although the concert took place in the fall season, October 20th, 2018, on a cold, damp and rainy night Garth Brooks and his bandmates brought down the house. But eh, what else would you expect from a Garth Brooks concert? The concert crowd of 84,000 was energizied, and pumped for Garth Brooks and kept chanting \"Let's Go Louder!\", if they were not already singing along on every single note. Rain? What rain? Snow? What snow? The crowd was focussed on Garth's multi-gold hit songs, not the inclimate weather, and they continued to show Garth their love and appreciation.<br><br>Garth did not disappoint, I can't wait for this concert to be released as a Blu Ray version for his loyal fans of which he can definitely include Mrs. Shullivan and I.<br><br>Thanks Garth for providing another evening of pleasureable music<br><br>Garth Brooks for President in 2020!<br><br>A perfect 10 out of 10","user":"Ed-Shullivan","rank":[6,7]}]
