[{"title":"Not as terrifying as its predecessor, but still a fun, gruesome ride.","rating":7,"date":"21 May 2015","review":"I'm a huge fan of the original Wolf Creek. Mick Taylor cemented himself as one of the best horror villains of all time. Yeah I said it. He doesn't wear a mask, he's not invincible, he doesn't have any superpowers; he doesn't need any of that. No, this guy is a hunter. A straight up Australian outback sharpshooter with weapons up the wazoo. Thing is, he hunts tourists. Any poor bastard wandering around the wide open plains of Australia better not cross paths with the guy because he'll kill them in the slowest, most degrading way possible. He thrives on fear and wants to squeeze as much life out of each one of his victims before letting them die. His smirk is chilling, his laugh is sinister. He's a sick sadistic psychopath, and he's absolutely captivating to watch. <br><br>The thing about Wolf Creek is that it focused on these three backpackers who were going to the Wolf Creek Crater or whatever but their car broke down, so some guy in a truck comes by and offers them a lift. Turns out this guy is Mick Taylor, and after a brilliantly tense campfire scene where they're all having a drink and a good laugh, he poisons them and proceeds to do vile things. What made it so terrifying is that we knew these characters. They had chemistry, you believed they were friends, you were on this adventure with them, so when the sh*t starts happening, it gets downright disturbing because you feel for these people.<br><br>In Wolf Creek 2, the focus is almost entirely on Mick Taylor. It's literally just a day in the life of Mick Taylor, which I don't have a problem with at all. But there really isn't a clear protagonist we can root for during a large portion of this movie. At first you think it's a German couple since we follow them around for the first act, until they set up a fire that catches Mick's attention. Then, the guy gets killed. And the girl runs and runs until she reaches the road, and this is where we're introduced to our \"real\" protagonist: Paul. He almost runs her over but quickly stops, lets the girl in his car and hauls ass out of there. But of course Mick catches up, things happen, and it ends up becoming a cat-and-mouse game between Mick and Paul.<br><br>Paul really is a good protagonist though. He's a British tourist who was just driving through the Australian wilderness until he finds the girl in the street, then things start heading south for the guy. Paul is a sympathetic character because he was genuinely just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Even Mick reminds him that he wasn't his primary target, but Paul interfered with his hunting so now he's in the crosshairs. The psychological warfare between Paul and Mick near the end was riveting, and the actor who played Paul did a phenomenal job despite having such little character development to work with. <br><br>It's definitely a fun ride. There are some cheesy moments like Mick riding a horse with the sun going down behind him, but overall it has the same thick, brooding atmosphere as the original Wolf Creek. It's just told from a different perspective. It's the same type of extreme over-the-top sadistic horror as the original so if you don't like that stuff then steer clear. But if you did like the first one and want to see more of Mick Taylor, Wolf Creek 2 will give you exactly that.","user":"lnvicta","rank":[61,67]},{"title":"Not bad (for a sequel)","rating":7,"date":"19 September 2014","review":"It's fair to say that most people believe (quite rightly) that sequels are normally pretty inferior to the original and, in horror terms, it's hard to ever find a sequel that even comes close to its predecessor. I'm not going to say that Wolf Creek 2 surpasses the original, but at least it's watchable (which puts it head and shoulders over 99% of other horror sequels).<br><br>It's about mass murdering psychopath Mick Taylor (once again played brilliantly by John Jarrett) who lives deep in the Australian Outback and has a tendency to slaughter any hapless backpacker who passes through his town of Wolf Creek. And, when I say the film is ABOUT Mick Taylor, I really mean it. The film doesn't ever really focus on his victims. He is definitely the star. Granted, he deserves it â€“ he truly plays the 'nutter' well. However, this does leave us not that bothered about whether his victims live or die, as we never really get to know them half as well as we do him.<br><br>Therefore, we're left learning more about the 'monster' than the 'heroes.' So, if you're not looking for a film where you're going to feel that sympathetic towards the victims, then you'll find what you're looking for right here.<br><br>It's not so 'condensed' as the first Wolf Creek. The original was mainly set in one location (when the murdering finally got going), whereas much of this movie is a cat and mouse style chase across the desert.<br><br>Don't expect much in the way of a story (well, about as much as the next slasher film), but if you're looking to see a really good/creepy performance from a mass-murdering villain then you'll find it here. My only real gripe was the ending, but you'll have to watch the last thirty seconds to see if you agree with me.","user":"bowmanblue","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Good - nothing more, nothing less","rating":6,"date":"22 February 2014","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Wolf Creek. All elements of film making seemed to work, for me. I like realism in films and the sense of isolation in the Australian outback was palpable. After viewing the trailer for Wolf Creek 2 I thought that the film might fall into the Hollywood category. What I was hoping for was another gem.<br><br>John Jarratt returns as serial killer Mick Taylor. He delivers another strong performance. His laugh and hoarse, Aussie voice never falter. He gets totally into character and runs the show. He has too much screen time, however, to make him as scary as he should be. The viewer is given too much knowledge of his whereabouts, I felt.<br><br>The actors who play the tourists are good, notably Ryan Corr, playing well-educated British traveler, Paul. The film doesn't provide much insight into his character which might be the reason why I had little empathy for him, or any of Mick's victims in this film. Towards the end I was routing for the tourists solely because as the viewer we have witnessed the hell their put through. For whatever reason, I really liked the characters in the first film and it was hard to watch them meet their fate.<br><br>The sense of isolation is there but doesn't have the same effect as it did in the first film, probably because there are a few more characters in this film, and other devices used to create action, which made the film appear less chilling and more thrilling.<br><br>I liked that McLean used subtitles for the German couple because I wasn't expecting it. Of course English isn't always going to be a tourists first language and they're not going to speak it for our benefit. Fret not, once the screaming begins you don't have to do a lot of reading.<br><br>Some parts of the film felt a little odd to me at first, and there are a couple of comical sequences. I took it in the movie's stride. Perhaps that was writer number 2, Aaron Sterns, input. I didn't mind. There was enough Mick Taylor sadism to pull me back to the horror film I went in to watch. The setting at the end was a little disappointing because it felt too orchestrated and unlike Mick Taylor. It felt more like a scene from 'Hostel'. <br><br>The first film is a rare beauty, and Wolf Creek 2 is a good sequel - nothing more, nothing less IMO.","user":"mitchw-61-305942","rank":[45,71]}]
