He was fortunate to be ask to play the part of the guidon bearer  ( the black Delta Company Flag ) in the movie, and also to help instruct the actors in how to dress, stand, march ect.  The movie was a masterpiece that covers just how it was for troops state side while the war was raging in Asia .  My son said \" Coppola did a superb  job of following military protocol  to make the film as real as possible \"  The story line is so right on. Coppola has another winner in my books. I thought the movie was very moving, lacking in nothing .<br><br>It was  tragic that Coppola's son was killed in a boating accident while out with Ryan Oneal's son during  the making of this excellent movie.<br><br>As you can tell I'm not a professional writer,  but I just had to say something  about how good this film is","user":"Redbaron-14","rank":[36,43]},{"title":"A terrific , touching , well acted film .","rating":9,"date":"26 July 2007","review":"Being a former drill instructor , I can testify to the fine portrayal of the lead character by Mr. Caan . The entire film is an excellent depiction of the dedicated military man , without the usual condemnation of the military in general , so often found in films made since the Viet Nam conflict . The acting , in general , is superb , making the characters believable and the story touching . It is certainly one of Mr. Caan's finest roles and he is accompanied by a terrific cast who contribute magnificently to the overall effectiveness of the story telling . I have seen this film a number of times and will continue to do so on a periodic basis , because of the subject matter and the acting in it. It is highly recommended !!!","user":"DoubleTee41","rank":[23,27]}]
