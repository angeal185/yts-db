[{"title":"Claude & Roseanna Show Off","rating":7,"date":"10 April 2006","review":"This is another Jean-Claude Van Damme action flick, but a definite notch above many of his other films, at least in production values. The photography and stereo sound are excellent.<br><br>Actually, this is pretty simple stuff and old storyline of a low-key good guy rescuing the girl from local meanies. Here, Van Damme defends Rosanna Arquette and her small kids.<br><br>In another respect, the movie is just another avenue for the two stars to show off their incredible bodies. Neither has ever been shy about doing that and certainly aren't in this movie. My only objection is having one of the kids make a sexual remark, which is done in here. There is no excuse for that.<br><br>Ted Levine, who has turned nice guy in the hit TV series \"Monk,\" is an effective bad guy in here. He played a lot of villains before \"Monk\" came around.<br><br>Anyway, it's fairly low-brow entertainment, but at least it is entertaining and fun to watch.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[47,54]},{"title":"One of Van Damme's better films.","rating":7,"date":"14 January 1999","review":"Nowhere To Run is one of Van Damme's better films. It has a nice storyline and some good acting. The direction is tight and I lked the score also. Not bad, but will probably be overlooked because it's a Van Damme picture.","user":"Peach-2","rank":[30,34]},{"title":"This was one of the best of 1993, no joke.","rating":23,"date":"23 September 1999","review":"Van Damme has a reputation as a kickboxer or an ass kicker and a martial artist.  No one really thinks he can act and the only reason he has a career in the movies is because he can do all those things and because women swoon over him.  Being the quintessential guy, I am pretty much in the category of guys that likes to see him in films that are loaded with kicks to the head and punches to the stomach.  It is a guy thing to want to see guys like Van Damme, Arnold, Sly and Seagal kick some major butt.  But I have to admit that as much as I like some of his films that are action and nothing but, this film really blew me away.  I was completely convinced with the love story and I felt for the characters.  Jean Claude gives his best performance in here.  And the sript being written by Eszetheras is perfect.  This is a film that relies more on character and dialogue than it does kickboxing skills.  And perhaps that alienates die hard Van Damme fans but for the rest of the audience out there this is a great step in the right direction.  I have heard people that love his smashmouth style of film say that this is a more tame Van Damme and they don't like it that much, but when your films only gross about the same amount as a typical Friday the 13th film, it's safe to say that there is room to grow and Nowhere to Run is definitely growth.  The only reason that people didn't go to see it is because it is Van Damme.  But this has so much more to offer than just your typical action flick.  The romance is fresh and Kieran Culkin is excellent as the young tyke who grows attached to Van Damme.  It's just too bad Claude couldn't make more movies like this one because I really think people would warm up to this style of movie from him and eventually his box office appeal would grow.  But as long he continues to make movies like Universal Soldier 2 and Knock Off, he will forever be stuck in that mold.<br><br>Nowhere to Run is a great film and when it came out in 1993, I remember making out my list for the ten best films that year, and yes, this one was on it.  I highly recommend it.  I think you will be surprised.  However, if you are hard core and like to see his films with lots of kicks and blood and cheesy lines from guys like Bolo Yeung, then don't go see this one, it is too much of a movie for you to enjoy.","user":"baumer","rank":[36,43]}]
