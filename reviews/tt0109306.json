[{"title":"Sending Tommy Away So Jessica Can Play","rating":9,"date":"10 September 2007","review":"In its only nomination in the Oscar sweepstakes for 1994 Jessica Lange won for Best Actress in Blue Sky. After watching Blue Sky I can certainly see why.<br><br>Blue Sky is set in the years of the Kennedy Administration and it's plot concerns a dedicated Army Major, Tommy Lee Jones and his family consisting of wife Jessica Lange and daughters Amy Locane and Anna Klump. <br><br>Jones is more than an army officer, he's a nuclear scientist and deeply concerned about the collateral effects of radiation on the population. I well remember the time. President Eisenhower in his second term of office made an unilateral executive decision to stop above ground nuclear testing, but the Russians continued. I well remember Premier Khrushchev in a bit of saber rattling, exploded a one hundred megaton hydrogen bomb.<br><br>Anyway President Kennedy decided at one point to resume nuclear testing to get the Russians back to the bargaining table for a nuclear test ban treaty. That's the background for this story and we all know that the first thaw in the Cold War was that test ban treaty that was ratified during the summer of 1963.<br><br>Anyway Jones is looking to ban it all, writing all kinds of reports that the army isn't taking too seriously and in fact transfers him from California to Alabama where he's told in no uncertain terms by his commander Powers Boothe to cool it. The military wasn't exactly thrilled with what Kennedy was trying to do.<br><br>But Jones has some pressing concerns on the domestic front. Jessica Lange is a lusty woman with needs and her husband isn't doing right by her. She looks like Marilyn Monroe and really does have all the army polishing its brass for her. Including Powers Boothe who sends Jones away so they can play.<br><br>It all ends in disaster, but Jessica summons up a lot more character than we would have first given her credit for to right the situation. It's in those last scenes that Jessica Lange brought home Oscar.<br><br>Young Chris O'Donnell is in the cast as well as Carrie Snodgrass as the son and wife of Boothe and O'Donnell the young man about to go to West Point finds out just what kind of rat his father really is. And Boothe does very well as the rat.<br><br>But in the last twenty minutes of the film Jessica's change in character dominates the film and it's reason enough to check out Blue Sky","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"An Oscar-Winning Role We Almost Missed","rating":27,"date":"27 June 2000","review":"1994 was a year of weak female performances, but Jessica Lange's Oscar-winning turn in \"Blue Sky\" is a real sight to behold.  She stars as the alcoholic wife of a well-to-do military nuclear engineer (Tommy Lee Jones).  Jones knows of a cover-up by the military to keep nuclear testing in Nevada a secret in the early-1960s.  This testing has no visual effect on anything in the environment (thus the name \"Blue Sky\").  Needless to say this is an intriguing film that is somewhat based on true testing which took place in sparsely populated areas of Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico in the late-1950s and early-1960s.  However, this film almost never saw the light of day.  It was produced in 1991, but sat in an Orion Pictures vault for over three years.  The film was finally released to generate revenue for the soon to be disbanded Orion.  No one was ever clear on why the film was not initially released in 1991.  Many speculate that director Tony Richardson's AIDS-related death may have had something to do with the studio's reluctance to release the film.  This is just speculation, there is no proof of that. Its inability to get released is a bit of a mystery though.  I mean a film with Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones should have no trouble being released in my mind.  Anyhow, this is Jessica Lange's greatest role.  Tommy Lee Jones and Powers Boothe also give great supporting turns.  4 out of 5 stars.","user":"tfrizzell","rank":[36,49]},{"title":"Jessica Lange was unbelievable","rating":7,"date":"8 April 2002","review":"The film is about the relationship of husband and wife, their troubles and how they cope with it.  It also had a side plot about underground nuclear testing, which I don't think was that powerful or had that much of an impact for it to carry though as the finale, which also seem to be wrapped up uneventfully.<br><br>But the main story is their troubled relationship, and how through good, bad and worse they get through it with each other's support.  Jessica Lange's performance as an unstable woman was amazing, not over the top in which it would have been typically done, but was portrayed truely and its fine nuance conveyed the subtle change in her mental state.","user":"lingmeister","rank":[21,27]}]
