[{"title":"Howard's film is solid, better than you think","rating":8,"date":"8 August 2005","review":"Ron Howard's action/thriller about two brothers (Baldwin and Russell), who have some differences but need to work together to find out whose causing recent arson fires in their district. THe film is done well, good acting for the most part, brilliant direction, and a decent screenplay. I thought William Baldwin started out the first couple scenes with a bit of a constant smirk on his face, but his acting seemed to improve (or maybe grow on me), he gave a satisfying performance. Meanwhile Russell was solid as well as his older brother who is an old-fashioned bitter fireman who takes too many risks. The female performances were rather average, Jennifer Jason Leigh was decent as Jennifer a girl who helps Brian (Baldwin). Rebecca DeMornay is not so great as Steven (Russel)'s ex-wife. Robert DeNiro was great in his role as a fire department detective trying to solve the case. J.T. Walsh was also decent in his role, which was similar but expanded in F. Gary Gray's THe Negotiator. The best performance of the film came from Scott Glenn who was great as a firefighter known as \"Axe\". I haven't seen Ladder49, so this is my favorite firefighter movie as of now. The script had some problems, as it didn't flow well, but the actors managed to save it although i was particularly upset with one dialogue between jennifer jason leigh and william baldwin which seemed like a complete rip-off of the scene where Michael Corleone and Kay see each other again after Michael is back from Sicily in Godfather part 1. But for the most part the script was average, not bad, but saved by brilliant direction, solid acting and great action. The music was done very well and suited the film, props to Hans Zimmer for yet another great score. The cinematography was also very good, especially in the fire scenes, good job by Mikael Salomon. 8/10","user":"PersianPlaya408","rank":[45,49]},{"title":"Fire. A living, breathing animal.","rating":9,"date":"9 February 2001","review":"When you watch this movie, you'll never look at fire the same way again. In 'Backdraft', fire is portrayed as a vicious animal that breathes and devours. The story revolves around an arson investigation in the city of Chicago where a sibling rivalry is flaring as well between Brian and Stephen McCaffrey. You'll be blown away by Industrial Light &amp; Magic's special effects and Hans Zimmer's dramatic score. Ron Howard put together an incredible, thrill-ride movie with action, drama and romance all rolled in. Do not miss this movie and don't turn your back on a fire, it knows when to strike.","user":"Dash-7","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"burn baby, burn","rating":7,"date":"8 May 2006","review":"It's weird to think that when I went to see \"Home Alone\" in the theaters, \"Backdraft\" was advertised right before the movie came on. The whole thing is a little grimmer than we usually expect from Ron Howard. It focuses on mutually hostile brothers Stephen (Kurt Russell) and Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin), both firefighters in Chicago having to put aside their differences to fight an arson outbreak.<br><br>True, it doesn't really sound like much of a plot, but Howard knows how to keep everything going. Stephen is the sort of guy with a bad attitude whom you can't help but respect. Brian mainly shows that there was once a time when Alec Baldwin's brothers could act. As for the climax, that is really something that is likely to shock you royally. But don't get me wrong. This is a good movie. Maybe not any kind of masterpiece, but worth seeing nevertheless. Above all, it's not a disaster movie (the less said about \"The Towering Inferno\" the better). Also starring Robert DeNiro, Donald Sutherland, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Scott Glenn, Rebecca DeMornay and J.T. Walsh.","user":"lee_eisenberg","rank":[32,36]}]
