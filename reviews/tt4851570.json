[{"title":"It's OK but very predictable.","rating":7,"date":"10 December 2018","review":"Big plus, I watched it all the way through knowing how it would end. The cast were great at their roles, the laughs weren't actually that plentiful. It was like boys from the blackstuff meets Snatch. It's nowhere near worth 10 but worth watching.","user":"apjc","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Are these reviews serious?","rating":3,"date":"25 February 2019","review":"I think that there must be two films, with the same name and same cast?!?<br><br>The cast are likeable enough - some real favourites - but the film is embarrassingly poor. We could imagine the silence at the first showing, post-production, with all cast and crew struggling to think of something positive to say to the director, whilst wondering what damage they'd just done to their careers.<br><br>As for the review comparing this to Snatch - what have you you been drinking? I'd like to try a pint.<br><br>The real mystery is that we watched it through - it was a really lazy, tired, Sunday night though...<br><br>I felt sorry for the cast, who somehow managed to throw themselves into this rubbish whole-heartedly. Pleased for them that this amazingly won a BIFFA for the best feature film. Wonders will never cease.","user":"testerpaultesterpaul","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Gloves should have been left off ...... 2/10 .......!!!!!!!!!!!","rating":2,"date":"13 September 2019","review":"Meh very poor i somehow got through the whole film and i think i had a slight giggle twice , very predictable and a cheesy cheese fest .....!!!!!!!","user":"GT-Lar","rank":[1,1]}]
