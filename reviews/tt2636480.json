[{"title":"Raw and Real","rating":10,"date":"20 August 2018","review":"Ivo Marloh has done a splendid job documenting the World's Longest Horse Race, the Mongol Derby. Having completed this race in 2017, I can honestly say how well this film shows the true challenges of the adventure. The competitors all show grit just to make it to the starting line. Those that actually ride all of the 1000km and cross the finish line in one piece are few and far between. Being able to follow some of these brave men and women along their journey in All the Wild Horses is priceless. I loved the film and how it captured the iron will of Devan Horn, the compassion of Erik Cooper, and the honest horsemanship of Monde Kanyana. Well done Ivo!","user":"rachelannland","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"The worlds toughest horse race from a unique perspective","rating":10,"date":"20 August 2018","review":"Having been fortunate enough to experience this event as member of the crew I can say Ivo Marloh has really captured the spirit of this gruelling race and the stories of the riders, all from the unique perspective of a rider! \nIf you are a rider, adventurer, explorer, sportsperson or traveller make sure you see it!","user":"jameshubbard-79554","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"She rode n injured horse with a broken leg in the race!","rating":1,"date":"5 May 2019","review":"How can an experienced horsewoman not identify that the horse unwilling to go forward has a broken leg? I'm severely disappointed that a horse got extremely injured and had to be put down because this woman wanted to win the race and pushed this injured animal. Disgusting to watch.","user":"stefanieg-71887","rank":[4,5]}]
