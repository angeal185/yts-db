[{"title":"One of the dumbest movies ever","rating":1,"date":"6 October 2018","review":"The minute the girls(mid 30s women) talk to the sheriff, you just know this will be a shiatfest. The sheriff asks the girls for ONE beer, and one of the girls roll her eyes so hard she almost went cock eyed. Then he tells them to avoid the illegal grow ops, because these people are gangster and will kill you, but one stoner chick really thinks it's awesome that somehow she'll get some free weed.

It really feels like a high school film class decided to make a horror movie. Very amateurish. Just dreadful.","user":"certified_training","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"same old","rating":2,"date":"2 October 2018","review":"Predictable as you like.
