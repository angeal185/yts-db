[{"title":"Very interesting look at a few of the unethical MKUltra CIA programs.","rating":8,"date":"8 November 2018","review":"Surprisingly, the famous drug-programs that so usually occupies these is only touched upon here. Look elsewhere for that.<br><br>Some of the reenacted readings are less than ideal, particularly CIA-man(?) at typewriter. You'll see what I mean.<br><br>It certainly didn't need to be 3 Â¾ hours long. The editing was lacking in several areas...<br><br>A lot of time is spent listing names for each portion, that could have just been shown to the viewer all at once, for about 15 seconds, then later, when comparing who was involved with each segment, by highlighting and fading each portrait and name, the inter-involvement could have been more clearly illustrated. Perhaps with diagrams. The narration serving to draw attention to overlap etc, rather than listing, always listing. The same could have been done with the funding sources.\nAs it stands, it's difficult to make sense of any of it.<br><br>Sometimes the documentary will just stop, and there will be echoing audio snippets with eerie visuals for a minute or two. Often things we've already seen &amp; heard. The documentarians were trying to establish some atmosphere or something? An good editor will mold the content in such a way to give the viewer chills and moments of impact, rather than separating the content for substance-less droning. Not well executed, just more time wasted really.<br><br>In the latter half when interviewee (if memory serves, the only one) Peter Breggin is introduced, it's a big breath of fresh air from the established editing formula. Although his ideas &amp; criticism towards classical psychiatry are not properly explored, he does offer a valuable humanist perspective of the callous &amp; absurd CIA-endorsed programs. His full ideas could have been an interesting counterpoint.\nI definitely recommend viewers to look up Breggin's work, even if you disagree with him, if only for a change of perspective from the typical medical practitioner's. Thomas Szasz also comes to mind.<br><br>The narrators (who I understand to be the authors of docu) also take some ridiculous liberties, such as ending sentences with patronising smirky lines like \"see how that works?\"\nThese do not belong in documentaries. When you're taking a break from cringing at the horrific medical experiments you might be lucky enough to cringe at one of these unnecessary lines.<br><br>The black &amp; white aesthetic looks good for the most part, little bits of colour are permitted during specific moments, but I get the sense that the film might have worked better if it were even less enforced. For instance, perhaps during the new location footage?<br><br>Optimally, if somebody with skill in editing were to fanedit this, they could probably achieve great improvements. One of the few cases where a faneditor is given a documentary with much material to work with, to do so. It might just be the first documentary fanedit, unless any commenter would like to enlighten me.<br><br>This may seem like a very critical review, but the good content of the documentary speaks for itself, so I definitely recommend a watch if the subject interests. Perhaps one chapter at a time will be best, however.","user":"falseprophet616","rank":[16,19]},{"title":"A lot to digest.","rating":8,"date":"6 June 2019","review":"If only for the informational value, this is worth viewing. I have watched a few times. The creators have a viewpoint, but everyone does. At least the purpose and intent isn't obscured as much media is today. We keep being hammered and bullied to \"agree and support\" divergent mores and values that may be antithetical to personal and religious beliefs. This divergent viewpoint offered at least is based on historical facts that can be researched.","user":"tfluffykins","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"A historical look into population control...","rating":9,"date":"16 February 2019","review":"This is a long historical documentary on mind control, and ultimately, population control. It gives the viewer an in-depth look into the CIA's MK-Ultra program and it's myriad of sub-projects, all geared towards the goal of controlling the human mind and manipulating populations.\nGranted, it's over 3 hours long, but I found the length necessary to thoroughly learn about the subject from its inception to its conclusion. For the last century, governments have been experimenting with their populations, often without public knowledge or consent, in hopes of finding that single key, data point, or formula that would lead them to ultimately control whole populations of people.\nIt's no surprise today we have social media platforms, based on feed-back loops, which have captured the minds of people like an opioid.\nThis film is good stepping off point for observing the manipulation that occurs today. It almost seems ubiquitous.","user":"bmac-12502","rank":[8,9]}]
