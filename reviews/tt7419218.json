[{"title":"Weak screenplay, boring and predictable plot, awkward acting","rating":24,"date":"24 January 2020","review":"This is very lame martial art fighting movie, and again, some generic underground illegal fighting with no hold bar, bloody and murderous, bet and gamble. But even with some cruelty and killings in the bouts, it still felt lame and boring. Most the actors were either B-level ones, or no acting talent UFC fighter(s). A martial art fighting movie that had been done hundreds of times, this one actually could do without. Only the pretty wife to the leading actor and that Chinese young woman were quite likable, nothing else.","user":"LogicIsEverything","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Great Tribute to Old School Martial Arts Movies","rating":10,"date":"6 February 2020","review":"Really enjoyed this raw and bone-crunching tribute to the likes of Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon! One of those movies you can watch over and over again.","user":"sarahxueren","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"REVIVING ACTION FILMS IN PHILIPPINES ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­","rating":10,"date":"27 September 2018","review":"I am so glad there's a movie like this! I love the cinematography of it! It looks like a hollywood film! Kudos to the director and the casts. I just hope that the PHILIPPINES will support this kind of movies, bringing back the action films in the country. I wanna see the next sequel!","user":"sassy_vamp10","rank":[2,21]}]
