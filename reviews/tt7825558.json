[{"title":"Loved it.","rating":7,"date":"1 March 2020","review":"I really enjoy this movie. I think it bends the horror genre pretty well. It's a great first feature for these directors, especially seeing what they were able to accomplish with a small budget and a fierce determination to get it done. Hopefully we'll see many more from them.","user":"dylanshelby010","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Not your typical horror movie","rating":9,"date":"4 February 2020","review":"First off...I really don't understand the current low IMDB score. Does not do the movie justice at all. Yes it is super indie, but for me that adds more to the charm.<br><br>I don't want to give too much away because this is one of those movies where the less you know the better. I had not heard of this movie before watching it. Man what a great surprise! It does start a bit slow, but when things pick up it is one wild ride. This movie does bend genres, which might turn some people off. It's not necessarily the scariest of movies, but as evident in one of the later scenes that is very obviously intentional. Trust me, just because this movie is different than most things you might have seen does not make it bad. It has a lot to say if you are willing to listen. Definitely worth a watch.","user":"cinema_horror","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Murderous ghost.....or something more human?","rating":7,"date":"19 January 2020","review":"This movie was truly creepy. The first 10 minutes were really boring and I almost turned it off. I am glad I didn't because it really starts to get under your skin after that. You will wonder throughout the movie exactly how many ghosts are there, as it will be hard to determine who is real, who is mentally unstable and who is dead. It was well done with no gore and no jump scares.","user":"wildsparrow16","rank":[11,15]}]
