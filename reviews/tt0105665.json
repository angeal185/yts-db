[{"title":"reflections on the film","rating":12,"date":"12 March 2002","review":"WARNING  SPOILERS!!<br><br>Well I've just gotten the FWWM DVD and am finally able to appreciate the film as it was intended to be seen and heard (or at least as close as possible outside of a theatre).  It's unbelievable, and after watching it a few times I was finally able to understand for myself what Lynch was doing here, and he's right;  intuition is the key;  just pay close attention to what you are seeing and your mind will intuit the rest.  In fact, understanding this film was a truly exciting thing for me.  What Lynch is actually doing here is thrilling.  As much as Lynch would (and myself as well, but...) hate to hear someone give what they consider a definitive explanation for the film, I thought I would give some ideas about some of the most interesting moments.  Any interpretation is viable, of course, but this is how I look at it.<br><br>First, the prologue: To understand the prologue one must understand something about the nature of the evil in this film.  I see the denizens of the Black Lodge as the physical embodiment of the subconscious.  That's what the Red Room is to me, the deepest levels of the subconscious, where there is an understanding going on that rational thought won't allow.  For example, Laura doesn't want to think that Bob is really her father, but deep down she knows (or comes to know in the film).  But Bob is really just the evil that men do, the darkest side of humanity, and he can be inside of anybody.  Since Bob is just a personification of this idea and doesn't literally exist, he really can't be caught, because eradicating Bob (and the other members of the Black Lodge) would be eradicating all the pain and suffering in this world, and that will never happen.<br><br>In the prologue, Chet Desmond and Sam Stanley come across perhaps the most unhelpful town on the planet.  Much has been made of how this place is purposefully the opposite of Twin Peaks, but I don't think that's the point. The unhelpfulness is the result of the town knowing that no matter how many FBI agents are brought in, you can't get rid of what killed Theresa Banks; you can't get rid of violence.  They treat the two with disdain because they realize the fruitlessness of their search.  Lynch emphasizes the strict use of code (Lil) and constantly has characters asking what time it is to give an air of precision, but nothing gets accomplished.  The electricity reference is simply marking the presence of something bad in the area. So, a lot of investigation occurs with nothing being accomplished.  Theresa Banks is dead and will remain so.<br><br>Perhaps the most obscure point in the film is the sequence with David Bowie. To make this short, Cooper's image freezes in the security camera because the members of the Black Lodge have stopped time for a second, also apparently causing a rip in whatever fabric divides this world and the Lodge.  This allows Jeffries to breifly crossover, apparently while the members of the Lodge are having a meeting.  This bizarre meeting with the grandson, Bob, etc.  is happening at the same time Jeffries appears in FBI headquarters.  He says it in voiceover:  \"I've been to one of their meetings\".  The meeting is to choose another victim.  The Man from Another Place is telling Bob to get more Garmonbozia (pain and suffering, which takes the form of creamed corn) for him.  \"With this ring, I thee wed\", he says, talking about Laura.  \"Fell a victim\", says the grandson, also talking about her.  The man in the chair with the beard makes a bizarre hand motion, as if saying \"and so it shall be done\".  Bob and The Man from Another Place are shown walking through the Red Room, on their way out after the meeting, to go get Laura.  The meeting over, the rip closes, and Jeffries goes back to the Lodge.  Keep in mind however that none of this is really literal, although you have to talk about it that way in the context of the scene. It's the film's way of saying that something bad is happening again, someone else is going to be the victim of violence.  The monkey underneath the mask is sort of like a fetus, or like a birth.  They've given birth to this evil which will grow and grow and grow until Laura is murdered, and the garmonbozia is given to The Man from Another Place.  After this, the murderous thirst is quenched, and the monkey reappears, indicating that things are once again calm but will once again grow (this happens at the end of the film). And of course in the series, Madeline dies.<br><br>Some quicker explanations:  Laura talking to Harold, saying \"Fire Walk with Me, ME!!\"  is her talking about her temptation to degrade herself.  \"He says he wants to be me or he'll kill me\".  This is Lynch telling us in an incredibly unique way that the abuse she's had from her father is turning into self abuse.<br><br>The old lady and the grandson are like the gatekeepers of the Black Lodge, allowing one to enter and exit.  In the literal world, they are Laura's very first inclinations that Bob may be her father.  The picture is just saying that she needs to go into her subconscious to find the answer, which she does that night.  \"Don't take the ring\", says Cooper (meaning don't be another victim; do something about your situation).  After Annie appears, Laura walks toward her door.  On the soundtrack you can hear her mom calling Laura, which references the morning after she was murdered and her mom couldn't find her.  She looks out at the stairs;  in about two days, her mom will come up these stairs to find Luara missing.  She is also in the picture looking out the door, meaning she has exited the Black Lodge, or her deepest subconscious, and is back in the rational world, almost.  This is her first realization that things might get really bad soon.<br><br>Anyway, just some observations, but I'm probably running out of words, so I'll stop now.","user":"mfb138","rank":[101,119]},{"title":"Severely under-rated prequel to one of the best TV series ever","rating":10,"date":"16 October 2004","review":"By the time this film was released, critics and TV audiences had already decided its decidedly mediocre box-office fate. The usual network attitude toward anything which demands thought and interpretation assured the cancellation of the series in its second season, and Lynch's departure from the show's director's chair to begin this film project all but sealed the fate of the show. Unfortunately, this same fate determined both the critical and public approach to the film project. <br><br>TP:FWWM is a prequel to the two-season Twin Peaks saga, and (sort of) answers the question 'how and why did Laura Palmer die?'. Fans of the show mostly knew the answers before they saw this film, but to see Laura's life so vividly realized, and to see the TV characters cast into such a different, more harsh, surreal and disturbing light, really invigorates the entire TP phenomenon. FWWM actually inspired me to watch the entire series again (and as of 2004, I am in the process of watching it again). Fans of the series who found themselves disappointed by the final few episodes of the series because they felt it became too bizarre, are likely to find this film more gripping, though they will probably end up as unsatisfied as they were at the onset. Those who found the second season thrillingly experimental are likely to be surprised by the subtlety of and dramatic quality of this film. Those, like me, who approach the film with few tangible expectations might just find themselves, compelled, disturbed, and very entertained. <br><br>The performances are generally very good, but not entirely even. Some TV cast-members, given the vastly expanded possibilities of cinema, really showed their range and depth. Sheryl Lee, MacLachlan, Dana Ashbrook, and Ray Wise were especially impressive. The cinematography is less powerful than the usual Lynchian vision (see Eraserhead, Lost Highway for extreme examples), and is more in keeping with the TV show's straightforward, but moody, photographic approach. The overall production values are, in fact, comparable to those of Mulholland Drive - also originally planned by Lynch as a TV show. Though more subtle than many of Lynch's more extravagant works, TP:FWWM is very successfully manipulative and powerful. <br><br>I ardently appreciate Lynch, considering him one of cinema and performance's greatest contemporary artists. And I am unashamed to state that I believe this to be among his finest works. Many of Lynch's fans love to write interpretations of Lynch himself, as if all of his films are in some way connected beyond the obvious fact that he directed (and more often than not scripted) them. I do not disagree with this approach, but, in my opinion, any such universalizing comments more or less miss the point. Lynch is one of many director's who view film as an art form, not as a craft, nor as a vehicle for specific messages and stories. As Lynch has stated, repeatedly, his films involve a dream-like reality and often attempt to invoke a dream or nightmare state in viewers. Unlike most, however, Lynch succeeds in the purity of his art. His films demand interpretation, engagement and, what's more, demand a different and unique interpretation by most who view them. <br><br>If you are looking for something which can be universally interpreted from TP:FWWM as part of this imagined set of Lynchian themes, I am not the reviewer to give it, look elsewhere. I have too much respect for Lynch's artistry to subject him to my own interpretive explanations. <br><br>If you are looking for a simple story which will clear up the insanity of Twin Peaks, don't bother with FWWM. <br><br>If you are looking, open-mindedly, for an intense, disturbing, and well constructed cinematic experience which creates more questions than it answers, and retains elements of mystery in a fatalistically driven plot environment, you've come to the right place.","user":"mstomaso","rank":[222,277]},{"title":"The Enigma Of Laura Palmer, Uncovered","rating":28,"date":"28 February 2009","review":"David Lynch's prequel to his TV Show 'Twin Peaks' drowns the viewer into the psyche of Laura Palmer, who was a crucial enigma of the series (but then again, 'Twin Peaks' is full of enigmas and riddles). The darkness of the human mind has been a consistent theme in many of Lynch's works. Other more recent examples include 'Mulholland Drive' and 'Inland Empire'. 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' is brutal, stark, graphic and horrifyingly disturbing.<br><br>'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' may not be as technically 'polished' as Lynch's other films and the low budget shows (but is not bothersome at all). Yet, the closeups have a very strong effect as it provides some evidence of fine acting. Sheryl Lee is at the centre of the film and she is astonishingly superb. Someone should give this actress more roles. Ray Wise, Moira Kelly, Kyle Mclachlan and the rest of the supporting cast are of note. The visuals, even though this is during the pre-CGI boom, are mesmerizing. And of course, what would a Lynch film be without symbolism. They are plentiful but I won't give my interpretation as they are best discovered first hand.<br><br>Many feel that the story is inconsistent but to me it all fits well together. Towards the end it is depressing, as the viewer has witnessed all the layers of Laura's agony in detail. It is not a comfortable film to watch. After all, she was just a normal American teenager who has experienced the worst of life and this movie grips the viewer and shows her life breaking into irreparable pieces. Yet, given the heavy theme 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me' is a film worth experiencing, especially for fans of the series and Lynch's other works.","user":"Chrysanthepop","rank":[31,35]}]
