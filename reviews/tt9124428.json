[{"title":"One of the best Turkish movies of all time!","rating":10,"date":"17 December 2018","review":"\"To be champion means to keep running even when you know that you will lose someday.\"<br><br>One of the best Turkish movies of all time, one of the best movies of last decade in the whole world. It is full of emotion getting hold of you all through the movie so much so that you hardly realize when it comes to an end. It keeps you occupied another 2 hours after you leave the movie theater.<br><br>\"Champion\" is tour de force for Turkish film industry and it deserves international recognition. In fact, it can really be very successful abroad, if a good advertising campaign is carried out, at least in countries where Turkish TV serials are already popular.<br><br>It is a story revolving around Bold Pilot, a real life race horse which was very popular in 1990's Turkey. You don't have to be a fan of horses or horse races to enjoy this movie. It is a story of love, hope and solidarity against all odds. A story told in a very touchy way. It is the story of ordinary people who are left behind, but never give up fighting for a better life. It is a story of human beings. It is our story.","user":"Moosty","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"Awesome movie","rating":10,"date":"16 December 2018","review":"Best sports movie of all time in Turkeyüëç\nI gave you 10 points without thinking.","user":"panter_filosu","rank":[21,24]},{"title":"Turkish Secretariat","rating":9,"date":"16 December 2018","review":"Legendary Bold Pilot has his unique character like all legendary winner horses. A horse gave hope millions of people having rough years both financially and morally. A horse hated rain, was weirdly moody that audience went silent for him so he would calm and enter his paddock. A horse caused a great love and gave hope one party of this love who had recrudesced cancer.<br><br>Bold Pilot will make you find the power in you to fight again.","user":"MuzafferBayraktar","rank":[9,10]}]
