[{"title":"THIS is how to make an animated feature!","rating":1,"date":"1 March 2001","review":"When I saw this film at a local cinema, I was expecting a simple child's fare. What I got was a most profound experience.<br><br>A land ruled by magic is brought to a perilous crossroads, and an evil wizard (voiced magnificently by James Earl Jones) seeks to bring about war and chaos. The good wizard Carolinus (voiced by Harry Morgan) seeks help and finds a most unusual ally...a young fantasy game designer in 20th century North America.<br><br>The diologue is intelligent, the action is well-paced, the plot is believable, and the ending will touch your heart. Kids will be drawn by the storyline and the animation. Adults will enjoy the jokes about science and aeronautics of dragons' wings.<br><br>Strongly recommended for the fact that it shows the link between science and spirit. That and the fact that you don't normally hear Larry Storch, Henry Morgan, John Ritter and Victor Buono doing voices for animated films.","user":"Baroque","rank":[45,48]},{"title":"A Lasting Part of my childhood","rating":5,"date":"5 April 2004","review":"The Flight of Dragons. To this day, I still get excited when I hear that title. I remember when I was first introduced to this exceptional cinema work. I wasn't more than 7 or so. For the first time, my family had the pleasure of having cable. It was one of those ancient cable boxes (I'm 17 now, if that clues you in on anything), but it was cable. I was watching the Disney Channel, and my mother was taping The Flight of Dragons. I liked it, but as with many other obsessions of mine, I didn't grow to love this movie until years later. I don't know what it is about this movie that keeps me coming back, time and time again. Is it the storyline? A man, with \"one foot in the realm of magic, the other in the realm of science\". It must have enthralled me, in some way. Dragons, warriors, mythical battles? There's nothing to turn me off there.<br><br>The characters. The plot. I can't put a finger on what turns me on to this movie. However, I believe this is a timeless classic that I will most certainly be showing my kids one day. I hope they will get as much out of it as I did.","user":"CrystalBlueSilver","rank":[34,36]},{"title":"Awesome fantasy movie","rating":9,"date":"24 September 2000","review":"I've seen quite only quite a few fantasy movies and only one involving a dragon. Not one of those movies have the magic that this animated movie has. This isn't just a simple hack and slash adventure that fantasy is too often stereotyped as. This is a deep, mature animated movie, and the characters are well developed. They speak and act naturally, and the knight has one of the better monologues I've ever seen in a movie. There is a deep philosophy hidden in this movie, too. Should Man stay with magic or move on to science? That is the dilemma facing the main character, a scientist who is fighting to save the realm of magic. And there is more than one scene that will touch your heart. This is an excellent animated movie that is mature enough for adults, yet kids of all ages can enjoy it. Rent it or buy it. Just watch it.","user":"pmcollectorboy","rank":[26,29]}]
