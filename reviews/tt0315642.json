[{"title":"Wazir- First learn to learn things!!","rating":10,"date":"8 January 2016","review":"I have waited for many days for this movie to release.. I have also been hearing about this film when it was just written on a paper by Vinod Chopra. and since the i day saw the trailer.It was so gripping with Amitabh Bachchan and Farhan Akhtar playing some serious roles in it. and yes!! Farhan Akhtar cant do anything wrong..he proved this again!! i saw the movie today with very controlled expectations because 2015 was the year of disappointments like Roy and all.. The movie started in a very first shot.. sudden characters introduced..the screenplay,bringing forward the characters and adorable performances by Akhtar and Sir Bachchan.. Amitabh is still one of the most power pack performers in India. 90 minutes of the movie never disappointed me because of the twisted twist in the end!! Surely the movie,as Vidhu Vinod Chopra said earlier that The plot revolves around the rules of the chess..sacrifices,assassinations,authorities and loyalty were its ingredients.. May be Indian audience isn't still prepared for these kind of sharp stories(and i don't expect they will be) Movies like Dilwale and Prdp are regarded as good movies.. and i see no chances Indian Audience gonna improve their perspective for the movies that deserves appreciation and by the way i also have twist in the end for you readers...i.e the title of this review is for Masala movie lovers :) thank you :)","user":"hemantkhanna97","rank":[41,55]},{"title":"A Missed Opportunity","rating":5,"date":"27 February 2016","review":"Wazir is the perfect example of how poor direction, editing can spoil a great script and waste legendary talents. <br><br>Eight things that went wrong with Wazir <br><br>Better Direction – the jump cuts between people talking. Long shots and then suddenly these jump cuts between a conversation. It was as if Bijoy Nambiar was shooting a music video. When the film was more a talky noir where simple quiet shots would have helped higher impact. <br><br>Editing – the at least 10+ scenes of Farhan Akhtar and wife were completely cutting the pace down. The makers thought it would divert our minds to other things but it only made a hotch potch out of the film. There was no chemistry, the background song was bad, no dialogs. Just two people staring at each other every 10 mins of the film. Fail. <br><br>Wazir – The character of Wazir made no sense. Why would a terrorist try to kill Panditji with a theatric character called the Wazir. Why was Wazir hamming so much? Why should they be not clear attempts to kill Panditji rather than spew filmy dialogs? Could have been more believable right. This is the line which Indian cinema needs to cross – either go completely serious or be completely commercial. A middle tone will always alienate everyone. <br><br>Plot points- what was the need to showcase the plot point that Qureshi is a terrorist. They could have easily kept that in the dark adding to an amazing twist in the end. And then the wazir twist would have been even better. <br><br>Dumbing it down – Bollywood still needs to learn that dumbing down cinema to a single idea is not conducive. I mean the masses are not going to see this movie. Its going to be the multiplex audience, who by the way are exposed to better cinema. <br><br>Pace – Why make this for 100 minutes, it's as if the production house was like, lets aim this at 100 minutes and let everything else go for a toss. No sense<br><br>Side Characters – The film was pretty much about AB and FA . The side characters could have played a better role. For example John Abraham could have played the role of putting in some thought into Farhan Akhtar's character. \"Panditji might be paranoid, why are you doing this?\" The sardar character could have also played the role of a voice of reason. Thus, making the twist stronger but no they just came spoke some blabber and went. <br><br>Poor action sequences – the action sequences were bad. Period. <br><br>Overall, a great script wasted away due to poor direction, editing and a need to dumb it down.","user":"kaustubh-rajnish","rank":[22,29]},{"title":"A thriller made better with the performances; a must-watch!","rating":8,"date":"9 January 2016","review":"Had been waiting for this release ever since I watched the first trailer. It was a pleasure watching Farhan in his role as an ATS officer; he did full justice to it. Big B's performance too was mind-blowing as usual. The supporting actors too made the plot more gripping with their convincing performances. Due to my love for literature, I personally thoroughly enjoyed the chess metaphors used in the movie; unlike others, it wasn't just a pointless thriller. Despite some little flaws here and there, I absolutely loved the movie. My first movie of the year was totally worth it and I really hope Bollywood doesn't disappoint the viewers with mindless drama in the days to follow. Cheers to a new year ahead!","user":"vishakha-78488","rank":[18,26]}]
