[{"title":"atashi no review","rating":4,"date":"16 October 2018","review":"The movie clearly showed Jun's inner struggle and I liked how she portrayed it. I also liked how Jun decided to let Haru stay at her place and started taking interest with what Haru shared with them. I only dislike how \"millenial' Tokio is. With all the tweeting and hyped with fame and all. But nonetheless, they still showed such cute friendship formed because of the intention reviving the song they found in an open-reel tape.","user":"xxynxen","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"just ok","rating":4,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"...first, to the other commentator that seems that does not understand the point of the movie: a commemoration of 100 years of a park in Tokyo.\nNo doubt that the director looked for a link in common of to what people does in a park and those things reminds unaltered, never mind the years that have been passing.\nThere s a couple of nice shots of the park (Inokashira); simple, nice all around situations and a sense that some things could be not so real.\nThe director plays with nostalgic and some dreamy (but light) movements and events but nothing to put you in a sad mood.\nIn my opinion, Shota Sometani is not at his best in this one.\nAll in all the movie is a good rendition to this park. A commissioned movie that is well done but nothing more than that.","user":"Hombredelfuturo","rank":[1,1]}]
