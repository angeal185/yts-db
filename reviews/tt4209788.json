[{"title":"Chastain is a knockout","rating":10,"date":"13 May 2018","review":"Molly's Game works as well as it does due to the sheer vitality of Jessica Chastain's performance. As an actor, she isn't the most overt emoter, and she doesn't need to be. She manages to draw an incredible amount of empathy out of her characters, always in control but willing to let the cracks in the armor show. She is one of the most remarkably restrained, yet emotionally potent, actors in Hollywood. She excels at taking these strong, resolute women through hell and back, coming out stronger and more complex while being very aware of the gender dynamics of her characters. Molly Bloom is by necessity steely and crafty, but she is also a human being in a world that oftentimes has no regard for humanity. As Bloom, Chastain is a scorching force of nature with a hell of a wardrobe. It's easy to praise her more dramatic moments later in the film, but watch her every move during her initial rise to power. You want to root for Molly as she begins to learn, as she faces disrespect from her boss, as she gains more and more confidence.<br><br>Chastain and Elba give fiery performances that help the film retain some of its shine as it moves toward its conclusion. Shoutout to Camp, d'Arcy James, and Cera for their small but solid roles. The film overall is a bit too long and does inspire some fatigue, but the story is engaging enough and Chastain is an absolute star. There's nothing particularly remarkable about the way the film is constructed, but it manages to keep you reasonably entertained.","user":"sierralouie","rank":[67,87]},{"title":"Jessica Chastain nails her role","rating":9,"date":"18 January 2018","review":"I don't think Molly Bloom could have been cast any better than with Jessica Chastain... she nailed her role. Oddly enough, she looks similar to the actual Molly Bloom.<br><br>Great film, love the fact this is based on a true story, and what a great story it was. The rest of the cast were great and the directing was decent, although too much back and forth between many timelines.<br><br>8.5 rounded up to 9/10 from me for Chastain's excellent performance.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[91,122]},{"title":"Clinically sharp","rating":7,"date":"14 December 2017","review":"The focus is clear and yet cold and distant unless Idris Elba is on the frame. He is a human with his complexities but without barriers. He is open, accessible. Jessica Chastain is a technical marvel to be admired but it is hard, very hard to warm up to her. I felt I needed to see in her what Idris Elba saw and I could do it with my head but not my heart. In any case, it is a brilliant performance. Aaron Sorkin writes and directs this time with remarkable self confidence. The film, like the script is clinically sharp, surgical actually. I bet it's also a great read. For Aaron Sorkin's fans and I count myself as one, this is a must.","user":"borromeot","rank":[118,162]}]
