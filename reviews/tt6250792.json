[{"title":"Oh dear!","rating":1,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"What an awful movie, story boring, characters are boring, I actually carried on watching this for a while after I'd passed the point when I realised how bad it was, just because I could laugh at the terrible quality(not) of the acting.Boy oh boy this is a stinker!","user":"j-townend","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Can using boring and horrible at the same thing a good way to describe the movie?","rating":1,"date":"9 December 2018","review":"Man oh man, I tell ya. One of the worst \"horror\" movies i ever seen in my life. No story, everything bounced around in the movie, acting was terrible. Time and time again we see how very few low budget movies actually keep you entertained. The amount of laughs and disappointments i had are astronomical. Dont waste your time like i did. Save yourself the trouble if you wanted to get scared, F grade horror, D- thriller at best.","user":"jjdynamic","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"One of the worst HORROR movies.","rating":2,"date":"8 December 2018","review":"Very bad. The only good thing about it is the idea but not performed well, that is, the acting is awful and it also fails in scares. I laughed instead of being scared. Two stars are fair for this.","user":"tidusha","rank":[7,8]}]
