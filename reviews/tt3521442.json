[{"title":"A meditative piece of art that questions the motion in motion picture.","rating":8,"date":"23 January 2015","review":"Sometimes minimalism irks me. Sometimes it gets me. Journey To The West gets me. It offers no discernible dialogue or plot, instead it's a 50 minute meditative art piece wherein Holy Motors' Denis Levant meditates and a monk walks very, very slowly, often in public. Without doing much at all, it's hilarious, infuriating, profound, poetic, and utterly brilliant. I haven't seen any of Tsai Ming-liang's other films yet so I don't have any context but this works on its own. Like Chris Marker with La Jetee before him, Journey To The West questions the motion in motion picture. It questions the ambiguities of life - ideas of motivation, drive, purpose, relief, but also cinematically in the sense of conventional setup and payoffs and journeys. Above all, it's a film that revels in the tranquility of the moment (or not so tranquil), and while it's surreal in mood it feels utterly real, refreshing and revealing of the human condition.<br><br>Granted, the film definitely tests the boundaries of tedium, and if it were any longer I probably wouldn't have tolerated it as much, but instead Ming-liang is restrained and economic with all his dozen or so shots. Scenes like watching the monk climb slowly down a subway staircase for 15 minutes bleeds so much life. It's pure meditative cinema, stripped down but honest. Other shots are almost a case of Where's Wally in finding the monk among the crowd. It's delightfully entertaining and makes you think about cinema can do. Self-aware moments certainly confirm that Ming-liang isn't ignoring the audience. I can't tell whether he's is truly pretentious or laughing at us with this, but it works on so many levels. It holds a tense and quirky atmosphere that's interesting and strangely poignant, yet quietly exuberant. Helps that it's such a rich aesthetic experience with its gorgeous cinematography and dense sound design. I understand why many find the film hallow but this is a rich tapestry for me. <br><br>8/10","user":"Sergeant_Tibbs","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Something a very unique achievement to video document!","rating":7,"date":"14 June 2016","review":"This is nothing like anything I have ever seen before. Quite an interesting film, but not for everyone. Yep, I thought it was boring in the opening, but later I get used to it and began to analyse. A film that has only a concept, but there's no beginning or the ending. However, displaying the film subject in the variety of angles was stunning. Sometimes I was keenly looking for where the subject has gone. At sometime it felt like a lazy afternoon under the shades while bright sunlight was on the other side.<br><br>It was a Taiwan-French co-production and an hour long film that documents a Buddhist monk who has undertaken a slow walk procession in the streets of southern France coast city Marseille which is accompanied by a French actor. It reminded me the recent animation I had seen 'Zootopia', where sloths comes into the scene. Had so much fun, but in not here.<br><br>I don't know what the monk did was called, but definitely it is a fine study material. Like in this modern world where everything is fast and superfast, what it would be like being superslow and how people reacts to it. Actually, many were simply minding their own business, but a few were curiously looking at, like a cultural and/or the religious difference is something to do with it. A cool film, an art film, but not recommended unless you're not looking for the entertainment only.<br><br>7/10","user":"Reno-Rangan","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"More of an art installation than a film","rating":9,"date":"20 January 2019","review":"Tsai Ming-liang has made narrative films, but this is not one of them. Here he and Kang-sheng Lee try to capture the essence of Zen on film. No beginning, no end, no story, no meaning. Just being, and awareness. Total awareness of every step you take on your path. I left the theatre calm and soothed, and carried the feeling with me.<br><br>I admire Lee for his devotion and vulnerability. His slow walk must have required rigorous training and discipline, and application. Only by reaching that Zen state of mind could he descend those stairs the way he did. And walking through the crowded streets of Marseille like that, even though there must have been some security around, took courage.<br><br>This is not a narrative film to consume as entertainment. It is the registration of an event, and it reaches out on a much deeper level.","user":"j-m-d-b","rank":[1,1]}]
