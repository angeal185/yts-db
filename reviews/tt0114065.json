[{"title":"Wonderful stupidity","rating":9,"date":"15 January 2006","review":"A very novel idea, with even more novel details. Watch out for accordians. This is a very well done movie, and it's done so seriously even though it's really a funny movie. It won't help you pass calculus, or balance your checkbook, or even provide you with useful information, but for a wonderful way to spend an hour and a half, this one is well worth watching. It even has some really fine actors, like Rod Steiger and Jill St John. The rest of the cast is equally good, though. You will never be able to look at a trailer park, or a portapotty, in the same way again. This movie also tells you where all that damned packing popcorn comes from, too.","user":"discord43","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Out-rageously funny","rating":8,"date":"18 December 1998","review":"Out There, with its star studded cast, was a fresh relief from the boring old \"Alien with Tentacles\" and \"Alien with Ray Gun\" movies of lately. Independence Day, Alien, Predator, Species.... even Mars Attacks, all have aliens who try to annihilate the Humans. Here, the aliens are trying to... well, CHEAT us, through the Universe Marketing Consortium, by making us join them.<br><br>Outrageously funny, outrageously..... Out There.","user":"sdickson","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Worth the time to see it","rating":7,"date":"14 August 2003","review":"I was flipping through the channels to find something to watch until another show started, and ended up watching the whole second half of this film as it was so clever and different.  I love SF of all kinds, even the really bad stuff, but this was so quirky and fun!  There are so many oddball twists that kept it interesting.  It's not heavy duty or intellectual in any way, but if you're looking for a fun SF flick to kill a Saturday afternoon, I'd say this would be a good choice for you.","user":"cherienb","rank":[9,9]}]
