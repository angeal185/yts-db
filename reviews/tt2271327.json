[{"title":"Modern day film noir . . .","rating":7,"date":"18 August 2014","review":"I stumbled onto Faith in Destiny on Hulu. It hooked me from the beginning. Superbly acted (particularly the two main characters) and beautifully filmed (stark yet stylish), it's the story of a man (Killian) who made bad choices, paid for them, and now attempts to live a better, more examined life. Knowing that a misstep, misspoken word, or momentary lapse in judgment can lead to long-term trouble, he tries to keep a low profile and keep out of trouble. Of course, as expected, trouble slips into the picture – sometimes seen, sometimes not – taking him on a new path. Although the pacing sometimes seemed to drag a bit, I kept watching as I truly came to care about the characters and wanted to know what happens to them.<br><br>A friend of mine once said that in film noir, no one is innocent. In Faith in Destiny, everyone from the main character to the motel clerk has a sordid secret, ulterior motive, or reckless abandon that drags down those standing too close. In that aspect, Faith in Destiny, while not a black and white 50s flick, is classic film noir.","user":"aamurphy57","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Excellent Christian Film","rating":7,"date":"5 September 2018","review":"You've never seen a film about the teachings of Jesus like this one. This story shows what happens to people when they understand the path to Life and then decide not to follow it. The actors were excellent--all of them, including supporting actors such as the highway patrolman and the motel night manager. Good job all around.<br><br>No gore.\nSuggestive sex acts.\nTopless nudity.\nBible verses.","user":"beorhhouse","rank":[0,2]}]
