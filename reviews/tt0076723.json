[{"title":"Hilarious, oddly influential dark sports comedy","rating":27,"date":"27 July 2001","review":"Mostly hated by critics on its release, as much for its cynical viewpoint as its relentless profanity, \"Slap Shot\" has since become something of a cult classic.<br><br>Set in the low-rent world of minor-league hockey, the movie follows the efforts of player-coach Reggie Dunlop (Paul Newman) to turn around the Charlestown Chiefs' final, losing season in a dying Pennsylvania steel town. Reggie is not above using a dirty trick or two to manipulate his teammates or psych out opposing players, and cheerfully gets physical when he has to. Even Reggie recoils in disgust, however, when his tightwad manager (Strother Martin) brings in the Hanson Brothers, three thick-lensed, thicker-headed goons who are more interested in fighting than playing Reggie's brand of \"old-time hockey\".<br><br>When it becomes apparent that the hometown crowd loves the Hanson's rough and bloody style,  Reggie decides to go with the flow, and to fire up his other players concocts the story that, if they can win the championship, the owner will be able to sell the franchise to a group of rich retirees in Florida.  To do that, though, they will have to get past an opposing squad specially stocked with the league's most notorious goons...<br><br>A sometimes uneasy blend of slapstick and kitchen-sink realism , \"Slap Shot\" has some pertinent things to say about the American worship of success at all costs, and (long before the rise of the WWF) our fascination with violent sports.  Echos of its gritty style can be seen not only in many later sporting films, such as \"Bull Durham\" and \"Major League\", but even in the wave of British movies in which characters fight to hold onto their lives after the collapse of hometown industry, such as \"The Full Monty\" and \"Brassed Off\".<br><br>The film really shines as a straight comedy, though, delivering some classic characters and set pieces: virtually every appearance of the Hansons; a clueless, toupee-wearing sportscaster (Andrew Duncan); the team's tiny Quebecker goalie (Yvon Barrette), and Newman himself, in one of his personal favorite roles.  The females fare less well, although Jennifer Warren stands out as Dunlop's long-suffering, estranged wife.<br><br>Note: in the VHS version, the background music has been replaced by an inferior, generic soundtrack.  The DVD version, with the original music, is preferable.","user":"ggh6","rank":[85,88]},{"title":"Old-time hockey at its finest!!","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2000","review":"I remember the first time I saw SLAP SHOT; I laughed so hard that I thought I was going to puke.  The best thing about this movie is that all the banter between the players, the attitudes, and the jokes are ALL TRUE!  I worked in the locker rooms for a minor-league hockey team  and I saw every character in this movie:  the aging veterans, the eccentric goalie, the lazy pretty-boy, the young players looking for a chance, etc.  It is so true to life and accurate, moreso than any other sports related movie out there.  And having all the actors do their own skating is a big plus also.  I really can't find a fault with this flick.<br><br>And for my most favorite part of the movie?  No question it is Moe Wanchuck! I have yet to find a character in any movie that everytime he open's his mouth, I go into hysterics.  Along with Chunk from THE GOONIES and The Dude from THE BIG LEBOWSKI, Moe is up there towards the top of my list of favorite characters in any movie I have ever seen.<br><br>You know you have a classic film when the topic of SLAP SHOT comes up with your friends, or even people you have just met, and you spend hours reciting all your favorite quotes, trying to out-do each other.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie so you can be part of the fun!","user":"adamshame","rank":[74,83]},{"title":"The Movie That Started It All","rating":10,"date":"20 February 2008","review":"When you look back at all the outrageous sports comedies this is probably one of the first. It has set a new standard for comedy across many movies. With Paul Newman in here he kind of gives this movie a soul. Maybe not a great one, still something is in here. Lately there have been many sports comedies such as Dodgeball, Balls of Fury and many of Will Ferrell's movies. Yet none of them, except maybe Dodgeball have reached the originality and such witty lines from Slap Shot. I think this movie really has something more to it than just the comedy. It actually displays the faults in hockey and professional sports in general. It really shows that to many owners that the idea of having a team is like a cool new toy. All kids eventually get bored with toys and give them away or just throw them in the trash. This is exactly what we see in Slap Shot with the owner, she just plays with all their lives and can just make them a simple tax write-off. It also shows the desperation of the players. Paul Newman talks about going out with style about as soon as hears scout are at the game he quickly goes back to the team's brutal and dirty tactics (This made out to be a hilarious scene). The difference between this and other sports comedies is that it actually has a lot of realistic situations ( THough sometimes exaggerated). I would definitely recommend this.","user":"alexkolokotronis","rank":[31,33]}]
