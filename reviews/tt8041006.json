[{"title":"Potential Missed","rating":3,"date":"7 November 2018","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of these Christmas movies. They're cheesy yet lovely and always have a happy ending. Really for me they're a form of escapism. But this one is so disjointed and awkward. The story line is off and nothing makes much sense and the blatant miscommunication of the two main characters becomes quickly annoying. I won't even start on the best friend. I really wanted to like it more but, simply put, I just didn't. I was disappointed.","user":"kiwijws","rank":[42,48]},{"title":"Slowwwwww","rating":4,"date":"7 November 2018","review":"Very slow and boring movie!

Please watch this movie.","user":"thendalbro","rank":[27,35]}]
