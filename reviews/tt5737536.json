[{"title":"How to make a bad B grade movie with an A grade cast......","rating":1,"date":"25 May 2018","review":"Is it possible to take a group of A-list actors and make a really really awful B grade movie? Well yes, yes it is and in my opinion Future World is it. <br><br>This flicks screenplay, I suspect quite intentionally, tries to pay homage to late 70's dystopian films such as Mad Max and cheesy but watchable 80's sci fi like Cherry 2000. Regrettably, however, this film is more sacrilege than homage. <br><br>Future World simply fails to appreciate and understand the mechanics of what made these earlier films work. Things like fleshed out characterisations, an interesting, engaging story and decent narrative. <br><br>Suffice to say, I'd rather revisit the original films, than waste my time on this clumsy facsimile. 1/10 from me.","user":"s3276169","rank":[193,222]},{"title":"How do movies like this get greenlit?","rating":25,"date":"25 May 2018","review":"I am truly baffled as to how anyone would read the script for this film and think it was a worthwhile endeavor. I understand film financiers tend to not read scripts when making a decision to back a film instead going by which A-listers are attached, but honestly, even just on behalf of the cast - why? <br><br>All the familiar post apocalyptic film tropes are in this dreck: Disparate tribes, complete with of course ultra violent factions Vs. peaceful faction, plenty of post apocalyptic man-leather, gnarly dirt bikes, a sexy android, and somehow - plenty of drugs(?) &amp; a functional nightclub(?)<br><br>As someone who adores anything post-apocalyptic, who's probably seen every film of that genre, I can state with authority, this isn't even passable entertainment at 3am when you can't sleep.","user":"MongoLloyd","rank":[76,90]},{"title":"A 5th grader could have presented a better screenplay and cinematography.","rating":3,"date":"26 May 2018","review":"I really wanted to like this film, and give it a fair chance with such a great cast (although I feel this was Milla Jovovich's worst acting to date), but it failed. <br><br>The score was annoying start to finish. The washed out, dim and faded cinematography was the worst I've seen. The directing was ok in some areas, terrible in others - especially the cheesy fade-out/fad-ins. The writing was all over the place and I'm shocked that with 19 producers attached to this project, not once questioned the convoluted screenplay with major plot issues and roller coaster scenes. How difficult was it to alter the fact that Prince walked for days to the drug den with an injured Ash, then days later the bikers all show up? Don't get me started on Ash and Rosie's little ridiculous session in the cell.<br><br>This film did have its short lived entertaining moments, especially with Snoop Dogg and the post credits scene and some decent location visuals, but it was still an embarrassment to the films it was trying to play homage to. <br><br>A very generous 3/10 from me.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[100,121]}]
