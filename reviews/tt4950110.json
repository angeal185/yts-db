[{"title":"Missing the point of the movie","rating":8,"date":"16 February 2017","review":"Atheists out there slam this movie because they think this movie is all about Christianity and cashing in on this tragedy. While yes it has Christian overtones. Rachel Scott was a Christian this was her belief and people need to respect her religion. For Atheists to slam this movie proves they don't get the point to this movie. Recently I watched a Anne Frank documentary at the beginning the director of the talks about Anne which directly Applies to Rachel Scott \"The World will never know who was lost or what was lost when these kids were murdered there future was shut down for them but if we imagine what we lost we might belong with those who directly experienced this event more deeply and more humbly\" Rachel Scott was a beautiful human being, if everybody was like her the world would be a much better place may she RIP.","user":"zacharykieler","rank":[41,71]},{"title":"wow!","rating":8,"date":"20 February 2017","review":"so, I never really cry at movies...but for this one I did. Wow. What an amazing story and it is so heartbreaking that it is real. I have seen my fair share of Christian movies and yes some of them are terrible and cheesy but this movie, wow. The acting is great and the story and the message is great!! This amazing young women lived her life for God and I loved that it showed that she wasn't perfect, that she back-slipped a lot but she changed. I love the heart of the movie and I believe that all the actors in it wanted to do the girl's story justice and I will always love this movie! There are some great Christian movies out there people and this is one of them!","user":"snperera","rank":[32,57]},{"title":"Don't miss this one!","rating":9,"date":"13 March 2017","review":"This movie was very well done. Great story and the fact that it is a true story makes it much better. It brought me back to my high school days. Rachel was a great soul who helped everyone who came in her path. I don't understand the controversy or how some say it was exploited. This is her story and she was a Christian. That's all. In her own words, \"Love and compassion can start a chain reaction.\" Highly recommended.","user":"cjase22007","rank":[29,52]}]
