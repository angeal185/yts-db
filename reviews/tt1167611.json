[{"title":"Ruthlessly human","rating":10,"date":"24 April 2018","review":"Basically, I watched the movie out of curiosity about the performance of Luca Marinelli, who is becoming one of the most admired actors of Italy.\nIt turned out to be a really captivating story, thanks to the impressive, merciless realism of every single aspect of the setting. As a matter of fact the movie shows a perfect representation of the outskirts' most tragic aspects and human weakness in general. This, as well as the charachters' convincing portrayals, makes the movie exceptionally involving and touching.\nDefinitely inappropriate if you're looking for some light-hearted entertainment, but absolutely recommended.","user":"rennacacciapuoti","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Modern neorealism","rating":9,"date":"20 April 2019","review":"Claudio Caligari's third (and last) work highlights an evolution of the harsh realism of Amore Tossico.Despite dealing with drug addiction now the majestic performances by Borghi and Marinelli provide the psychological insights that are the main quality of the movie.Drug Is unavoidably responsible for the development and the tragic end of their friendship.","user":"giocata","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"As harsh as beautiful","rating":9,"date":"1 June 2018","review":"This is a majestically crafted movie who tells a really difficult story in the best way possible.\nIs the kind of movie that prints their mark over the viewer, impossible to walk out from the cinema without feeling a bit different.\nThe story is pretty intense, show a part of italy often forgotten and try to answer to the question \"how can they live this way?\"","user":"Lievalle","rank":[4,4]}]
