[{"title":"You will need to suspend your disbelief that this movie is interesting to watch it.","rating":3,"date":"16 September 2013","review":"About a woman who disappears after attending a party at a writer's house. The police begin an investigation and later the woman turns up dead. Their attention is on the writer. Shortly after, the woman's sister shows up; the exact \"twin\" of her sister. The writer and his actress daughter offer the woman lodgings at their house for the duration of her stay. The woman accepts. The rest of the movie is about the tension and attraction between the writer and the woman because they are suspicious of each other. As well, later on, some interplay and tension between the mysterious and provocative house guest and the writer's actress daughter who seems easily influenced, \"sexually\" anyway.<br><br>This claustrophobic story takes place mostly indoors and for the most part in the writer's house --and car. It's all talk, and no action. No one gets punched, shot, stabbed, or even f!!cked. Almost 2 hours of \"conversation drama\" I'm calling it. I suppose this could work if the conversation was interesting. Perhaps witty and funny. Alas, no. This is a movie, I believe, that is best watched in \"15 minute dosages\" like a serial soap opera. More than that and you may periodically have to check your heart to see if it's still beating. Yes, dull. Very dull. The \"twist\" of this movie that's supposed to make it innovative and interesting, I guess, is that the plot, as I described it above, is also something the writer has written. So his fictional story is actually happening with him in it. --Or is it? Who knows, who cares.

I will confess that I don't normally watch independent movies and have no idea about the director's previous work. I wasn't expecting much. The shots, lighting and environment were pretty good, the editing was good too. Considering the limited budget and that they made this movie in 22 days I think the movie is pretty good. But having said that if I judge this movie neutrally I would say it's an average plus. The plot resolves around a death of a pretty (and lost?) girl. The whole plot resolves around this and sometimes becomes too boring and lagging. The director has tried hard to make this like an art movie but sometimes the artistic expressions don't make any sense. There is some nudity and sex in the movie but they are neither erotic, not do their presence contribute to the movie in any way so I don't see the point of having those. It feels like they just wanted some skin in the movie. Still the movie is enjoyable. The major complain I have about this movie is that it does not give you a satisfactory ending or a proper ending with answers. I really dislike open ended movies that leave the conclusion to the viewers and if you are like me you will not like the ending too.","user":"russell_anam","rank":[30,38]},{"title":"'The Character is the Plot.'","rating":8,"date":"23 December 2013","review":"Mike Figgis continues to move in his own inimitable fashion creating films that require concentration, patience, and some indulgences from the viewer, but films that in the end are like wonderful paintings to hang in a gallery for repeated exposure and admiration. Figgis wrote, directed, composed the musical score, edited, and performed the cinematography for this puzzling work: it works very well if your mind is sharpened and up to a challenge. <br><br>Socialite Martin (Sebastian Koch) is an accomplished writer of cinema and theatre who now teaches his trade to film school students. Fifteen years ago his wife disappeared after an argument, has not been seen or heard from since, and Martin has been left to singly raise his daughter Sarah (Rebecca Night) who aspires to be an actress like her mother. At her 25th birthday party, Martin encounters the mysterious Angelique (Lotte Verbeek) who is found dead the next morning. An investigation by the police leads to Martin being the prime suspect and with the arrival of Angelique's twin sister Therese, who comes to London regarding her sister's death, and with whom Martin has a fascination, comes even more questions concerning their brief fling. The are subplots galore: the entire film is being written as we see it and the director of Martin's film (Eoin Macken) is obsessed with Martin's daughter Sarah who also becomes physically involved with Therese. If all this sounds confusing it is meant to be: Martin's creative ploy is the concept that the character is the plot – and while it is puzzling at times, the manner in which it plays out is absolutely masterful. <br><br>Other actors in the supporting cast include Julian Sands, Lachlan Nieboer, Frances de la Tour and Kenneth Cranham. Every aspect of this film is creative – split screens, naming of scenes, strange photographic images, and interplaying story lines that somehow connect. This is a tough film but deserves the attention of those who love art films. The only problem is the level of sound of the spoken lines – it needs subtitles despite being n English, but none are available. <br><br>Grady Harp","user":"gradyharp","rank":[11,14]}]
