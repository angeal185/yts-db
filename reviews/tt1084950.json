[{"title":"Performances Outpace Story","rating":6,"date":"4 October 2008","review":"In every actor's career there comes a moment where the critics and audiences rally around jumping for joy about how they've just witnessed a breakthrough performance. As stunning as these performances are, the term \"breakthrough\" always felt a little out of place to me since it's only on rare occasions the actor in question is relatively new. Most times they are people who have been pounding the boards and scraping the screen for years. In those terms, the breakthrough is nothing more than a large group of people seeing that actor in a new light for the first time, mostly in something they never imagined before. Now the newly colored spotlight falls on Anne Hathaway and her powerful turn as Kym in Rachel's Getting Married.<br><br>The film is a slice of life piece detailing a small space of time, only a few days, where Kym returns home from a rehab clinic just in time for her sister Rachel's wedding. Anyone who has ever taken part in arranging a wedding, especially one taking place in the family home, knows the extreme stress already present, so toss a young, partially unstable girl into the mix and top it off with a nice coating of family denial and dark skeletons in the hallway closet, then you get the full picture of this film. Relationships are strained, ties pulled so tight and taut they could snap and still they try to work it out through screaming, laughing and crying (not necessarily in that order). After all, it's about a wedding, who's not happy at those? Before giving Anne her due credit, let me shed some light on someone most people won't know off the top of their heads. Rosemarie DeWitt plays the title role of Rachel and she does it with the utmost tenderness and subtlety. What she brings across is the inherent hatred, resentment and unending compassion sisters can feel for each other, even through the worst of storms. With a film more comfortable in the category of \"ensemble piece\", Rosemarie is the catalyst and pushes the energy along, changing and charging every one of her scenes. But the light shines brightest on Anne Hathaway as Kym, the ex-junkie, ex-alcoholic, ex-return rehab patient bordering on becoming an ex-family member. Audiences claim this as a breakthrough performance because they fell in love with Anne in The Princess Diaries movies, Ella Enchanted and the wonderfully wicked The Devil Wears Prada. Yet what they might not remember is she's played rougher, tougher roles in Havoc and Brokeback Mountain, showing the more mature and adult side of her skills. So I wasn't all that shocked to witness the brilliance she brought to this film, but I will celebrate it all the same. Anne jumps in and exposes a vulnerability, a cavern of pain and lost love, which drives the emotional core of the picture. From opening credits to the closing moment, she is the elephant in the room everyone must deal with and the magical point is this is the first time where the audience can begin to empathize with the elephant and not the onlookers. I can't end the acting portion of this review without bringing up Bill Irwin and Debra Winger as well. Bill plays her father and churns out a tenderness only an accomplished actor such as himself could generate. There are such small moments, such tiny fractures in his facade which allow you to peer into the heart of a man trying to choose between his greatest love and his greatest loss. On the other side, Debra Winger plays her mother, who has chosen to block out the pain in her past and skate by the rest of her life, allowing the blackness and hurt to fester and suffocate any chance at a real connection with her daughters. As you can read, the acting on display here is sensational and will undoubtedly be remembered during awards season.<br><br>As a total film, I'm not sure the story reaches the same heights. A lot of great scenes and spectacular moments are created, but the story lacks cohesion. A particular subplot about the family and its deep love for music is mentioned and referred to over and over, but never fully explained or explored, which weighs down later scenes during the wedding celebration and the overlong musical sequences. During most of the musical moments, all I really wanted was to get back to the story, back to the family and to Kym. Also, the connection between Rosemarie and her soon-to-be husband Sydney (played by Tunde Adebimpe) never quite comes across. There is a wonderful moment during their wedding vows, but it could have been helped even more if their relationship had been more centered earlier on.<br><br>On the directing front, Jonathan Demme, with the assistance of a touchingly tender script from Jenny Lumet, helps craft a reality we can all believe in, a home we can all feel we've been to before. Much of this intimacy and nuance came from the free form style of camera movement, with the actors never knowing where and when the camera was going to appear on them. Everyone was basically playing everything from the moment he yelled action, so there were emotional surprises around every pan of the camera. That technique gave the movie a certain level of improv or even documentary feeling, like the audience was the most silent of voyeurs.<br><br>Recommendation: A powerful series of moments, filled with terrific acting, that don't quite come together as a film. Certainly has great value to witness, but the theater experience might not be necessary. Also, this really is meant for those viewers not afraid to open themselves up to it.","user":"goldwriting","rank":[191,252]},{"title":"It helps if you've been an addict yourself.","rating":10,"date":"27 February 2009","review":"Even though Roger Ebert recommended it, I felt nervous about seeing this film, nervous enough that I nearly walked out to go see the safer \"Milk\" instead. I'm glad I stayed. \"Milk\" has had more acclaim and will be seen by far more people. Which is a shame, because \"Rachel Getting Married\" is an excellent film.<br><br>Ten thoughts:<br><br>1. I'm bewildered that so many commenter's were so annoyed at the camera work and editing. Frankly, I didn't think the camera work was sloppy, shaky or spontaneous at all, but rather plot-driven, flowing and really authentic. It was done that way with clear purpose: to be your eyes and ears as if you were a guest yourself, in those rooms, at those moments, with those people, even at (especially at!) the moments that made you squirm.<br><br>Do you and I glide through rooms like Peter Pan? Heck no, we bob, weave, and turn our heads like football players constantly, whether we're aware of it or not. From the moment that Kym walks up the driveway and through the back door, we have the role of eavesdroppers, seeing and hearing things we shouldn't. A conventional style would have put safe distance between ourselves and the actors, and that's clearly not what the director wanted.<br><br>Yet as Mr. Ebert himself noted, there was one pivotal scene, featuring Debra Winger, that was shot in a solid, conventional manner. Which scene? Why that one? Why her character? What psychological things would a rock-steady camera convey there that a hand-held camera wouldn't? <br><br>2. Hi, my name is Keith and I'm a recovering addict and boy, until I saw this film, I never realized how totally full of myself I was. There, I just proved it by using the pronoun \"I\" four times in one sentence. Anybody nodding their head out there? (wave so I can see you) Being an addict (in or out of recovery) is like living in a hall of mirrors: you can never get away from yourself.<br><br>3. That said, there were a couple of times when Kym DID manage to join the others and DID manage to enjoy herself. And I was darned proud of her. She didn't even need a cigarette. And no, I'm not talking about the sex scene.<br><br>4. Rachel is getting married, yet she didn't even get to star in her own film! No wonder she's heading to Hawaii. You've got to admit she was right in what she said to her dad. The closing scene was so telling.<br><br>5. Why is it that the other person's family (in this case the groom's) always seems so much nicer than our own? His family was adorable! No skeletons in their closets, no sir.<br><br>6. Besides the stepmother, who was the sanest character in the entire film? The poodle! She even got a credit! <br><br>7. LOVED the music! Gosh, it was like being at the Winnipeg Folk Festival. Hopefully there's a CD soundtrack available.<br><br>8. The actress who played Rachel and the actor who played the best man look SO familiar! Yet I don't recognize their names at all. Awfully good though.<br><br>9. At the end of the film, is Kym leaving her home, or is she going there? Ergo, is rehab her real home now? Where can she go from here? <br><br>10. To all you Kyms out there, you have value, and you ARE worthy. Bless your every small step. Keep coming back, ye hear?","user":"threedogz","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Calling a SPADE a SPADE","rating":3,"date":"30 November 2008","review":"Ten minutes into watching this movie I was thinking: how much longer will this last? This film sort of reminded me of the time my neighbor brought their daughter's wedding video over and, to my wife's embarrassment, I fast forwarded thru the ceremony, in front of them. By that ten minute timeframe I was already thinking how this is like the worst possible wedding video experience you could have ever lived thru - combining the bad wedding video with the pre dinner and all the other new age wedding experiences that have developed in the years since I attended my first wedding, at the age of 6 when I was the ring bearer at my cousin's wedding. During the pre dinner scene I just wanted to hit the fast forward button and get to the drug addict sister's speech -a bit of crappy standup that quickly turned into the very flat climax of the scene - which I already figured was going to be her chance to embarrass herself and her family while ostracizing everyone else.<br><br>The hand held camera work, changing film quality and grain, and the MTV hectic editing style totally removed any possibility that I might have been immersed in the \"film experience\", that thing that films are designed to do. Plus the story line was way too flawed, like how is it only the ex-addict daughter realizes the mother shouldn't have left a known drug addict to babysit a child (BIG), or, how come the daughter ends up with a split lip from a smack down with her mother but the mom doesn't get even a bruise from the daughter's Mike Tyson punch to her kisser (MINOR) during a scene where the mother erupts into complete anger while telling her daughter she killed her brother. Here's my take: cold and indifferent mom who had long lost any maternal feelings to her children was already having an affair with her soon to be new husband and left drug addict daughter with son while she snuck off for a quickie, tellingly shown in her priority to leave the wedding to take care of her husband's travel arrangements in the face of her daughter's clearly expressed need for some motherly interaction.<br><br>The PC attendance to the Diversity detail was too obvious and annoyingly in your face, leaving me to contemplate what Diverse element may have been excluded, and leaving me with the impression that I had just seen a bad film about a wedding that should have made number 1 on one of those TV reality shows about the world's most horribly designed theme weddings.<br><br>As to the acting, Rachel, the soon to be husband, real dad and mom, step mom and dad, and all of the other supporting actors and actresses were all played quite well, to the point where one would expect that all of those people were probably just like that in real life. Anne Hathaway's performance was just as good though it didn't leave me believing anything other than that she was an actress playing a role, which was probably more because of the writing than anything else. I sort of had the feeling that Lumet idea for character development for this role didn't go beyond what would happen at a wedding where one of the daughters was a drug addict who had previously killed her brother.<br><br>What would have made this film good would have been if it were a documentary, a real documentary, not a film, falling incredibly short of attempting to be . . .","user":"mrblimp","rank":[101,138]}]
