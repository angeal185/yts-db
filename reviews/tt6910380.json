[{"title":"A Tribute","rating":6,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"Scripted as a look back, in a musical stage play sort of way, at the life of Tyisha Miller who died while slightly comatose sitting in a car w/a gun in her lap. As she suddenly became alert she supposedly reached for the gun in her lap which resulted in several officers outside the car firing nearly 24 rounds into the car a dozen of which hit her. I once faced a similar situation while traveling the country I would sometimes sleep in my vehicle at rest stops. I also had a gun in plain view. I too was awakened at night w/bright lights shinning into my car and several police w/guns drawn. The problem is your awakening consciousness cannot process the voices &amp; you are blinded by the lights so you don't know. Police protect themselves first, e.g. a person with a knife 30 to 50' away is an easy target for at least half a dozen high caliber at lower torso disabling shots before they have gone 10' yet they aim higher to kill.","user":"westsideschl","rank":[1,1]}]
