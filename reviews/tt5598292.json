[{"title":"A Generic Endeavour for A Horror Buff","rating":5,"date":"11 May 2019","review":"\"Polaroid\" is an arguably good-looking, all-the-clich√©s-rehashing mainstream paranormal horror flick, which offers some entertainment and cheap teen scares.<br><br>For my 930th horror film \"Polaroid\" makes a painfully average entry in the list. The good things here are as follows: decent acting, alright characters, some okay scare sequences, itsy bitsy twisty plot etc., etc. But, the good things become not-so-good things when You've seen them a hundred times before. The characters and the plot come from an uninspired, unoriginal script, it's quite predictable and the twists have little to no impact. The scares are disappointingly whack, except for two or three creative sequences. It's just... not a wholesome movie at all. The concept itself is cool &amp; there's potential in it, but the writer chose to give in to all the Hollywood-ish ways instead of trying to stand out. The cinematography's cold and smokey, not a lot of complaints there. What else... The original score is there and it works, but it's as uninspirined as the plot.<br><br>Objectivily, it's definitely a 5/10, subjectively I'd want to give it less. I do recommend this to anyone who's not calling himself a horror fan &amp; to all the teens that need a late night light horror flick, \"Polaroid\" makes a decent pg-13 rated horror. All in all, a disappointing expierence. I hope Lars Klevberg does a better job on \"Child's Play\", I really do.","user":"TwistedContent","rank":[41,52]},{"title":"You've seen it all before... but done better.","rating":5,"date":"11 May 2019","review":"So Polaroid (2019) was actually shot two years ago and intended to be a big screen release but has been suffering from years worth of delays (rarely a good sign). Last year Netflix was supposed to be picking it up... until those plans were also scrapped (uh oh). It has, however, received an international release and has just hit Amazon.<br><br>So is it any good and worth the wait? Unfortunately, it's very average and, had this received a big theatrical release by now, it would probably have been as well received as Slender Man and Ouija were... so not well at all.<br><br>It's almost as if the studio wanted a horror film, hired a writer, told them to watch The Ring and Final Destination 3 for inspiration, and then write the quickest script they could. Completely predictable, undeveloped characters, mostly off-screen PG-13 deaths with characters walking around in the dark... you've seen it all before but done much better.<br><br>But don't get me wrong, Polaroid isn't a terrible horror film to pass the time, it just ultimately falls under the category of being another very predictable teen supernatural horror that brings NOTHING new or exciting to the table. Surprisingly it's actually not a remake of a Japanese horror film - so kudos for that - but it still feels very derivative and doesn't stand out from the crowd of films of this type. You can be as unoriginal as you want, but you've still got to excite your audience...<br><br>One thing I really did like was the cinematography and the directing. Norwegian director Lars Klevberg does a fine job with the script he has to work with and I look forward to seeing what he does with the upcoming Child's Play remake. I also liked the cameo from Grace Zabriskie (The Grudge, Child's Play 2) and the Monster Man himself Javier Botet is always great. The young cast - mostly unknowns - were decent despite weak and typical characters.<br><br>Overall, a 5/10.","user":"Slasher_Guy","rank":[30,39]},{"title":"How did this get so many good reviews?!","rating":3,"date":"11 May 2019","review":"I swear I've already seen this movie... at least 50 times. It's like the writers used a common horror movie tropes manual when writing this. If you've already seen movies about cursed objects that kill off the attractive group of friends one by one then you won't get anything new from this movie. It stays right in the box.","user":"heather_lynn_brown21","rank":[53,81]}]
