[{"title":"Two words... PLUS ULTRA!!!!","rating":10,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"Amazing movie, must see for any MHA fan! Only (ONLY) thing I wish they would have done is include more backstory for All Might. I would have love to see his childhood, teenage years, and more of his college days... But maybe they're saving that for the manga or more movies.","user":"ColtPython82","rank":[36,41]},{"title":"Loved It!!!","rating":10,"date":"1 October 2018","review":"I loved every bit of this movie, it was a very enjoyable time in the theatre. I loved seeing all my favorite characters and the story was strong, which was the best part. So often anime movies are made and they're just filler for the show but I felt this movies was a treat for all the true fans. I want to see it again so bad, just so good.","user":"lisa-honeyplease","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"Oh my....","rating":10,"date":"26 September 2018","review":"The hype for this movie was a bit much for me but it was for a damn good reason. My Hero Academia two heroes proves that the superhero genre is nowhere near dead. A great addition to a beloved anime. This will be talked about for years to come. PLUS ULTRA!!!!","user":"cruzchristopher","rank":[19,25]}]
