[{"title":"The Legend of Halloween Jack: Being a tad generous here","rating":3,"date":"13 October 2018","review":"The Legend of Halloween Jack is a British horror movie that tells the story of a serial killer who returns from the grave after being killed by vigilantes. Brought back as scarecrow.............for some reason, he sets about getting revenge.<br><br>Though the cinematography is strong enough, the lack of budget is demonstrated everywhere else. From the weak cast to the shoddy sfx it's a masterclass of amateur film making.<br><br>Though the killer looks okay his presence is ruined by cutaway/poor deaths and the fact we've seen that very same appearance before. Erm, why was he a scarecrow again?<br><br>The plot also is heavily recycled, there is very little in the way of originality here and though it's not the worst of its ilk that I've seen it's still a mess.<br><br>I've seen a fair few of Andrew Jones movies now and don't believe off the top of my head that I've seen a good one. This shows signs of competence, but only dashes.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Script is better than you'd imagine<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Opening credits are bafflingly irrelevant and poorly thought out<br><br>Laughable blood sfx<br><br>Crappy kills<br><br>CGI graves, really?<br><br>Moronic horror trope finale<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>Blood packs are expensive<br><br>Sticking a pencil in a guys butthole isn't gay<br><br>Seeing a person in a halloween costume at a halloween party will cause mass panic","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"I gave it a 1 because the world would be better without it","rating":1,"date":"10 December 2018","review":"Not sure where to begin here. I believe the problem is with the sound quality of this movie and editing. It just makes no sense. Some actors seem to have American accents others, Lord knows what. There is no continuity. The storyline is all over the place and for some insane reason, they keep cutting to this weird lame band.\nI'm glad I watched it because now I know what a good movie is, anything other than this; except The Room.","user":"pacylpse-201-70836","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"semi-remake of Dark Night of the Scarecrow","rating":5,"date":"7 October 2018","review":"Reminded me a lot of that film with other elements from Halloween, My Bloody Valentine and Nightmare on Elm Street thrown in. So hardly a thumbs up for originality but it did have a pretty good atmosphere and style. The best aspect of the movie is Jack himself. These slasher movies live or die on the killer and the scarecrow design of this one is very cool. At times you root for him because some of the characters are pretty annoying. 5/10","user":"michaeldorris-72070","rank":[11,15]}]
