[{"title":"A Significant Film.","rating":10,"date":"3 October 2017","review":"I had the great pleasure of seeing \"To Hell and Back: The Kane Hodder Story\" at its grand premier in Lexington, Ky.<br><br>Anyone who is a fan of Horror films knows his name and his accomplishments; the film, gives fans rare insight into who the man is. There are many great moments in the film, including talking points by some of the biggest names in horror and it is clear the amount of respect he has in the field. He is the best in the business at what he does. <br><br>The musical score is very well done and it definitely adds depth to pivotal scenes in the movie. The filmmaker Derek Dennis Herbert does a marvelous job of allowing Kane to tell his own story, which is exactly the purpose of the movie. <br><br>There are moments in the film which will absolutely move you, and I won't give those away, but I fully expect you will be left with a newfound respect for Kane Hodder as a human being, and he is an exceptional one. <br><br>Aside from the respect I have for Kane Hodder, the most important thing I must mention about this film, is the way it treats the topic of bullying. It is going to be an incredibly powerful moment when you discover that one of your heroes, and perhaps one of the most intimidating people of all-time was a victim of bullying, and was able to overcome it through strength and courage.<br><br>Kane Hodder could become one of the most powerful voices against bullying in the world, and as someone who has worked with young people in the past, I truly hope to see him continue the cause. <br><br>Jason McDaniel","user":"Jason915","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Surprisingly deep and compassionate.","rating":10,"date":"16 June 2018","review":"This is a surprisingly good movie. Kane Hodder is a very funny, compassionate all around awesome human being.<br><br>The stories he tells are the main force of this film. Starting with a tale of being bullied, through long, sometimes graphically excruciating accounts of a terrible full body burn stunt accident and onto the legends that made him the most iconic actor to take on the famous role of Jason Voorhees in some of the later Friday the 13th movies. The worst part was the incompetent doctors who almost killed him because they did not know what they were doing.<br><br>The film is full of great interviews with fellow horror icons Robert Englund, Cassandra 'Elvira' Peterson, Bruce Campbell, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, directors Adam Rifkin, Sean S. Cunningham, Adam Green, makeup artists, tattooists, old friends and family member.<br><br>This is honestly one of the most thoroughly researched documentaries I've seen in a long time. According to the Q&amp;A I attended with director Derek Dennis Herbert, they had thirty nine hours of footage with Kane alone.<br><br>They were even able to get Kane to revisit the San Francisco Burn Unit that saved his life over 40 years ago. This is not a fluffy nostalgic puff piece about a horror movie actor. There is real emotional healing in those scenes. I was considering sharing a trailer for some of the PTSD facebook groups I belonged to, but I don't think a trigger warning would be enough to prepare some of the members for the endless scenes of hardcore movie violence.<br><br>I enjoyed horror movies as a teenager a lot. But I've had to walk out of horror movies in more recent years because of my PTSD. This film is unexpected, and I wish there was more that I could do to help it get the attention and praise it deserves.<br><br>It does get a bit long towards the end, especially for a theatrical film, but I still have to give it my highest recommendation.<br><br>So Sayeth the King of Funny Faces.","user":"kire1975","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Well worth watching...","rating":8,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"I'm not a horror movie fan at all. Just don't like that genre of movies. But I sat down and watched this documentary and really enjoyed it. Kane loves his fans and loves what he does no question about it. His story is pretty amazing.","user":"brett-76260","rank":[1,1]}]
