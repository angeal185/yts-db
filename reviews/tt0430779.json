[{"title":"What's all the fuss? This is a fine movie.","rating":8,"date":"26 September 2006","review":"It's strange how people are reacting to this movie. I'm not sure what they're expecting. This is simply a fine, fun movie for the 4 to 10 year old set. I brought a group of kids with me that were in that age group and they all loved it. They were cheering at the end. As a parent I also found it quite enjoyable. It's no \"Shrek\" I suppose, but few movies are. This is just a fine animated film with a good plot, a good moral, and no bad language. Some reviewers are upset because some things don't make sense - like whether there could be lights on Wrigley field, or whether \"Seabiscut\" was around at the time this movie was supposed to take place? Please. Who cares? Certainly the kids don't. What more could you want in a fun animated flick for children? Take your kids to see it and enjoy.","user":"mbritt1216","rank":[45,56]},{"title":"For Love Of The Game...","rating":6,"date":"15 September 2006","review":"Yankee Irving (Jake T. Austin) was born to New York fans with a love of baseball. His hero, of course, is the iconic Babe Ruth(Brian Dennehy). His biggest problem is that he can't actually play. Things are still pretty cool for him, though, because his dad works at Yankee Stadium and, just about anytime he wants, Yankee can imagine himself batting in a major league game.<br><br>After what looks like his final game, Yankee finds an old baseball under a wrecked car. He takes it home and soon finds that it can speak only to him and be heard only by him. (Yes, it's a stretch, but hang on.} The ball, named Screwy (Rob Reiner) is as done with baseball as Yankee, having begun and ended his career on a foul. They both find that baseball is not done with them, however, when they discover that the Babe's legendary bat, Darlin' (Whoopi Goldberg), is missing and presumed stolen. Now with the World Series and Mr. Irving's job on the line, Yankee and Screwy begin a wild journey to Chicago to make things right again.<br><br>This movie, while it seems typical on the surface, is not. It's not just a sports movie, a buddy movie, or a road trip movie, but all those things, and a little more. Make no mistake, there is a target market. Baseball fans will definitely dig it. I'm not really a fan--I played in high school, and we never won. But baseball, while prominent to the plot, is one of the skins wrapped around the substance; at its heart is a story about the importance of family and persistence, making it a nice tribute to the Reeves. A few surprises abound, such as Yankee's exposure to a Negro Leauge team, who are front and center to teach the kid how to bat. Arguably, the best part of the film.<br><br>While the general flow of the script is pedestrian, the acting, presentation, and overall look are enough to hold the interest of most movie lovers. The characters have great, well, character, and that helps to put it over. Even William H. Macy's take on villainous Chicago pitcher Lefty MacGinnis is goofy enough to be lovable. At the bottom line, there's nothing wildly innovative, but there is an entertaining film. You'll have a good enough time, even if you hate baseball.","user":"Cel_Stacker","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Great Movie","rating":9,"date":"15 September 2006","review":"Great story. Makes you laugh often and makes you cry sometimes (well, maybe the most sentimental of us). Brings the warm feeling of old-days-baseball. I am not big fan of the game but still loved the mood of the picture. Nicely drawn characters. Was pleasantly surprised to see good computer-animation that is actually Not coming from Pixar. You recognize the actual actors behind the characters not only by voice but their look as well, which is always fun. Richard Kind is carbon copy of himself. I would change the title as it doesn't reflect main idea of the animation, but other than that excellent movie all around. Both of my children (5 and 8 years old), my wife and me loved it.","user":"gzinger","rank":[29,41]}]
