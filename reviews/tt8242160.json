[{"title":"A road trip as picturesque as insubstantial","rating":4,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"This film is based on sumptuous landscapes of Saharan Africa, between Morocco and Mali. A wonderful and picturesque road trip aboard an improbable 4L, a mythical French car of the 60s. Otherwise, the film is rather insubstantial with dialogues and characters with little interest, although the subject (i.e. a road trip between friends) is theoretically enticing. As a synthesis: 4 of 10 thanks to the landscapes and the mythical 4L.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[17,31]},{"title":"nice movie with talented actors","rating":8,"date":"6 July 2019","review":"It,s a surprisingly nice movie.the goal of the movie is completely right a road trip between friends. While there were a few boring moments but still a nice movie The movie was done in a completely different manner and a more comercial movie maybe with a bigger Budget the movie would have been more epic more like a adventure movie.Jean Reno did a great job but this is not his typical action thriller or goofy comedy. The rest of the supporting cast also good.The plot development was weak but it,s still a nice movie to enjoy on DVD or television.most spanish and non spanish speaking can enjoy this movie about friendship and so much more.Jean Reno is a very talented actors","user":"danpolko","rank":[24,48]},{"title":"A great movie","rating":9,"date":"19 July 2019","review":"I assumed be crap as Netflix usually is.
