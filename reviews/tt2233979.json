It's like the spheres of Dante's hell, skipping like a futon from sphere to sphere. I also learn that the equation priest plus nun means baby from hell... Exorcisms there are but not like the mainstream ones. Some freaky moments, but not to bad to digest.summasummarun is I sit with more questions than answer when I leave this one. It's barely recommendable-","user":"ops-52535","rank":[20,29]},{"title":"Unique spin on the Exorcism genre but...","rating":7,"date":"2 November 2018","review":"Very unique spin on the Exorcism genre but you'll have to wait until the 3rd act (the reveal) for you to really appreciate it the film on a whole. It's well acted, very atmospheric, but the it's pretty slow until you get to the finale. It relied too heavily on the twist at the end and that wasn't enough to carry the entire film.<br><br>Take Sixth Sense of example. The big twist is what made that movie awesome, but even without the twist it's still a good entertaining film. That's all that needed to happen Welcome to Mercy, because they had everything else going for it. Just wish they would have spent more time developing the first 2/3 of the story as well as the did the end, then this could have made it's way up the ranks of exorcism classics. Missed opportunity here. But again, very unique take on it. I commend the writer for that.","user":"stephenherman","rank":[18,26]}]
