[{"title":"Carrie VS Jason, my favorite underrated flick Lar Park-Lincoln is the best of this film","rating":10,"date":"24 September 2017","review":"Carrie VS Jason my all time favorite film in the franchise it is my number five favorite Jason film in Friday the 13th. I just love this movie to death. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. Lar Park-Lincoln was excellent as Tina Shepard she is my all time final girl in the Friday the 13th movies she is great and excellent I love this film to death. Kane Hodder was the best Jason Voorhees in my opinion he was excellent, he played a menacing character as well. John Carl Buechler designed a great Jason costume and the music score for Jason was excellent. <br><br>I love Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood is the best one in the series in my opinion it is way better movie then all 4 Carrie movies. In Stephen King's Carrie movie we have a character Carrie White when she is pushed to far she kills everyone with her telekinetic powers in her school and goes on a revenge. They were three movies about that character telling the same story with the different versions. I am just tired of Carrie movies so the writers make a character Tina that is a good person in which she accidentally release Jason Voorhees (Kane Hodder) from his prison in which Tommy chained him in previous installment.<br><br>This one is unique because there's actually development given to its heroine, Tina, and how she gradually learns the extent of her powers. As a horror movie, there's little to no suspense because we know where Jason is at all times: he just moves from decimating one person to decimating another. The final showdown is pretty bad-ass, though.<br><br>This movie to me is awesome and excellent because of Lar Park-Lincoln as Tina Shepard and Kane Hodder as Jason Voorhees. I love this movie it is my number one favorite film in Friday the 13th movies and it is in my top 5 best one's Friday the 13th films.<br><br>The director was John Carl Buechler who made an excellent job directing the seventh installment the problem with the film was with MPAA ratings, the MPAA where assholes this movie is the most uncut film in horror film history I ever saw. I want to see the uncut version of this film like any else fans want's to see. All the gory and blood was cut out because of MPAA assholes. <br><br>I love the music composer for this film by Harry Manfredini and Fred Mollin. I love the theme song for Tina The New Blood by Fred Mollin I have heard that soundtrack so many times. I love the soundtracks that they used for this film: Essence of You by Eye Eye really my favorite song for this film. Dream Girl by FM, Magic (In Your Eyes) by FM they are good songs for this film.<br><br>I love the new cast in this movie I love this girl Susan Jennifer Sullivan as Melissa to death she was evil but really great hot sexy girl that was killed from Jason. I liked Kevin Blair as Nick I thought he was good. I like Jennifer Banko as\nYoung Tina Shepard she di d a good job. I like that girl Robin (Elizabeth Kaitan) who was so kind that we see liking her a cat. It was really awful that she was killed by Jason. I love Susan Blu as Mrs. Amanda Shepard she was excellent mom I love her in this movie. <br><br>I really miss this kind a films today I just got whole Blu-ray collection of Friday the 13th movies and I wanted to see this movie Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives so damn much whole summer I wished this movies to have in my Blu-ray collection. I love Jason movies and this one is the one I will still watch.<br><br>Director John Carl Buechler sees similarities between Tina and Alice Johnson, the protagonist of A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. \"Both films are about heroines who take on special powers which they use to fight the monster. In The New Blood, Tina's able to fully harness her telekinetic powers by the end of the film and she uses the powers to defeat Jason which is what happened, more or less, in The Dream Master.<br><br>Buechler was disappointed that the film did not explore Tina's powers more, Composer Fred Mollin came up with theme music for Tina \"because she was a psychic.<br><br>This movie is the best but so underrated and cut out which got rating x and the movie was cut. It is in my top 5 favorite Friday the 13th films and this movie get's my favorite Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 I love this movie to death not that much as I love Jason Lives.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[89,104]},{"title":"Jason meets his match... again.","rating":5,"date":"19 January 2005","review":"Jason has met his match before, going down two-nil to Tommy Jarvis. However, this one is different! Her name is Carrie, but for some reason she uses the name Tina Shepard.<br><br>Camp Crystal Lake has been operating peacefully for years, ever since Tommy Jarvis chained Jason to the bottom of the lake. But, you see, in horror movies, any peace is bound to be interrupted eventually. Enter Tina Shephard. Years ago the Shephard family was on vacation at Crystal Lake, when Tina's father drowned under some bizarre circumstances. At the age of 17, Tina and her mother return to Crystal Lake with Tina's psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. Dr. Crews isn't what he seems, he is obviously more interested in exploiting Tina's psychic abilities rather than helping her. This isn't very important, because it isn't very long before Tina accidentally releases Jason from what should have been his watery-grave...<br><br>Yeah, this is your average slasher movie. All the characters are obvious stereotypes. Except for the sci-fi nerd sporting a mullet. I can honestly say I've never seen that before. Tina Shephard is basically a re-work of Carrie from... 'Carrie', but she is the films saving grace. Jason against a psychic made for a nice showdown. Other than that, I'm still wondering why people keeping going to Crystal Lake, only to be surprised when maniac wearing a hockey mask tries to kill them.<br><br>Apparently this was heavily censored. Kane Hodder makes a good Jason, and there are kills aplenty, but not much gore. Oh well, it had a nice musical score if that makes up for anything...<br><br>Not too bad entry in the series - 5/10","user":"AwesomeWolf","rank":[34,46]},{"title":"My favorite of this Franchise!!!","rating":10,"date":"9 May 2019","review":"Friday the 13th Part 7: The New Blood has always been one of my favorite Friday the 13th movies. The kills are awesome, definitely NOT a slow burner horror movie, this film is highly entertaining and there's so many victims in this film that receives gruesome and violent deaths from hockey mask killer, Jason Voorhees. Aside from multiple bloody deaths in this awesome movie, There is the protagonist of the film, Tina Shepherd, who is gifted with the ability of telekinesis (the ability to move objects and see the future using the power of the mind), telekinetic powers was also the main focus of the main character in the novel and films of 'Carrie'. Basically Friday the 13th Part 7 is Carrie White vs. Jason Voorhees. Very cool concept for this film!. Some of the acting wasnt impressive but I'm not gonna hound about that as much because after all it IS an 80s slasher flick. Bottom line, Friday the 13th Part 7 is an enjoyable horror slasher film on it's own but doesnt connect much with the other 6 films or the films that were made after this one. But my suggestion is, if you like cheesy campy 80s slasher flicks, and/or are a fan of Jason Voorhees...then definitely give this a watch! As for me this is my favorite of the Friday the 13th series and receives a strong 10 out of 10 rating from me!!.","user":"jpasols","rank":[9,10]}]
