[{"title":"Did anyone notice this interesting prop?","rating":7,"date":"16 September 2006","review":"Two things - one: this film is nowhere near as bad as some say. Of course, that doesn't make it good, but I enjoyed it.<br><br>Second - the prop used to show the strength of communications signal when the first scout explores the cave system is in fact a silver Korg guitar tuner! Not worth mentioning usually except that it is shown in close up several times during this sequence, with the row of red lights normally used to show how close to the note the guitar string is representing here the strength of the signal from the first scout diver...<br><br>You can freeze the DVD on one of the closeups to see the words \"Cents\" and \"Hz\" and the note names E A D G B E written on the tuner. Classic.<br><br>Now that's what I call cheap props for an expensive film. Incidentally, the Korg tuners are very good - at tuning guitars.","user":"ultrabastard","rank":[47,48]},{"title":"\"Pitch Black\" underground","rating":6,"date":"2 January 2006","review":"Truth is, that's all one needs to say about this low-budget suspenser about a group of spelunkers and scientists following a mysterious passage deep into the earth, long hidden beneath an ancient church in Romania. They quickly run into malformed creatures that exist only in the darkness, and get picked off one by one as they race to find a way out. The creatures are not as scary as the ones in \"Pitch Black\" or even \"The Relic.\" There is a much better movie buried here (pun intended) involving some very tense and exciting sequences as the spelunkers work their way through various caves and passageways and waterways, and climb up and down steep rock walls. But the clichéd monster movie keeps getting in the way. And in the end, it doesn't help that each character is a walking cliché seemingly right out of \"The Core.\" I would gladly watch \"The Cave\" a second time, but only for the cave exploration scenes. The ending has a nice, slightly twisty touch.","user":"xredgarnetx","rank":[49,58]},{"title":"Into The Nether World","rating":26,"date":"26 August 2005","review":"What differentiates \"The Cave\" from other horror films is the setting. The plot takes place mostly in a large cave, some of which is underwater.<br><br>By far, the best element of this film is the underground scenery. The sets are realistic, with spaces and formations that one might see in certain large caverns. And, the film nicely conveys a sense of vertical scale, as we watch cavers climb rock walls, and explore huge rooms with towering ceilings.<br><br>The problem here is that the film's director is so committed to an action plot that the camera rarely stays in one scene long enough for the viewer to have a sense of place. We thus forgo the thrill that an underground environment could provide. There's no feeling of amazement, no claustrophobia from tight crawlways, no real fear of any kind. The film's fast pace, combined with characters we barely know and care nothing about, thus dilutes the intended suspense.<br><br>The cinematography is flashy and very technical. The lighting is appropriately subdued with interesting colors and unusual camera angles. The background music is somewhat intrusive. Dialogue is weak. And the actors, who appear to be in their twenties, are all photogenic, straight out of central casting. The monsters, what we see of them, seem slightly hokey.<br><br>Overall, \"The Cave\" will appeal to viewers who like horror films set in unusual environments, wherein the pace is super fast, and there is a ton of action. Viewers looking for a credible story will need to exit the cave ... quickly.","user":"Lechuguilla","rank":[161,206]}]
