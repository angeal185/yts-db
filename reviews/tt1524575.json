[{"title":"Decent and Underrated Horror Film","rating":6,"date":"7 July 2016","review":"In Los Angeles, Angela Holmes (Olivia Dudley) is a happy young woman, pride and joy of her father Colonel Roger Holmes (Dougray Scott) and in love with her boyfriend Peter \"Pete\" Smith (John Patrick Amedori). On her birthday party, she cuts her hand and Roger and Peter take her to the hospital. When she returns home, she has a seizure and they drive her back to the hospital. Then Angela is discharged but she pulls the wheel of the taxi causing a serious accident. She returns in coma to the hospital. Forty days later, she has no response and Father Oscar Lozano (Michael Peña) convinces Roger to unplug the life support system. Out of the blue, she awakes in perfect health. Soon Angela shows signs of demoniac possession and the Vatican sends Cardinal Bruun (Peter Andersson) to perform an exorcism to save her soul. Will there be time to save her body?<br><br>\"The Vatican Tapes\" is a decent and underrated horror film, one of the best about exorcism. The plot is based on Catholic beliefs but is engaging. Most of the cast is excellent and has good performances; maybe only Michael Peña has an inexpressive performance. The conclusion has an open end maybe with the intention of a sequel. But in general, \"The Vatican Tapes\" is satisfactory with an appropriate use of Handycam or surveillance video. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Exorcistas do Vaticano\" (Exorcists from the Vatican\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"Certainly not the worst movie about possession like some want to make us believe","rating":7,"date":"20 October 2015","review":"Here we go again with the negative reviewers. I wonder what's wrong with those people? You are not going to tell me that this is the worst horror movie you ever saw, because then you talk a lot of bull... Okay it's not the best movie about possession or exorcism but it sure ain't the worst one. You can not compare it with The Exorcist because that movie was one of the first one about that subject and for that time it had everyone on the tip of their chair. Linda Blair will probably remain the best actress as a possessed person but it doesn't mean that other actors can't play that role. I thought Olivia Taylor Dudley did a good job with her performance. Looking innocent and then pure evil, to me it all looked real, and that's what's it all about with movies like this one. I surely was entertained and I saw hundreds of worse horror movies then The Vatican Tapes. Don't believe the haters here because they don't know what they are talking about.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[42,58]},{"title":"Yes, indeed, another Exorcism movie","rating":7,"date":"12 October 2015","review":"I don't know if there is a name for someone who really enjoys watching exorcism movies, but I'm that person. I watch them all and I've never regretted seeing any of them. I could probably write a script for one; they really don't vary that much, but there is usually a little something that makes each one stand apart.<br><br>The score of 7 that I'm giving this one is ranking it with all other exorcism movies, and I've never seen one that I would rank below 4. Actually, my score would be a 6 and 1/2 if I could give that.<br><br>(SPOILER ALERT) Let's look at some of the tried and true elements in this one: The Vatican is concerned and sends a Cardinal to investigate; a kindly local priest is present; a beautiful girl is possessed; an evil bird or two makes its presence known; the possessed girl causes one or more people to maim or kill; the unexpected happens during the exorcism.<br><br>It's that last part about the actual exorcism that gets some high points from me. When's the last time you saw the guy performing the exorcism holding a knife to the girl's throat, pulling a chain around her neck to kill her? This Cardinal could care less about the girl's health because he realizes this is just not any demonic possession--this girl is possessed by the Anti-Christ itself, and that's something that shakes the Vatican to its core. Major demonic activity during the exorcism--what's not to like? Contrary to some other reviews, I liked the photography, I thought it very good. The acting was also pretty good, and the possessed girl really did a fine job of projecting a crazy demon persona. Michael Pena was good as the kindly priest; he's really only an average actor, but you can't help but like him in any part.<br><br>Djimon Hounsou plays only a small role back at the Vatican. It's a shame he was not the one to travel to America to perform the exorcism. The last scenes are of Michael Pena in the Vatican talking to Hounsou. Looks like Pena has been recruited to be second in command of the huge archival collection of \"the Devil's work on earth.\" Just before they get on the elevator, Hounsou turns and says to Pena: \"Come and see.\" Now that rang a familiar bell from Sunday School days. In the book of Revelations one of the Four Beasts says in a voice of thunder: \"Come and See.\" Coincidence? I think not.","user":"cliometrician","rank":[15,19]}]
