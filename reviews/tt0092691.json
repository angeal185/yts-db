[{"title":"A beautifully filmed surrealist journey into arabic mythology","rating":28,"date":"28 September 1998","review":"Unusual and violent activity is observed on the surface of the sun during an eclipse.

He will learn many things about his father's life that will bring him to the brink of insanity.<br><br>Directed by Jamil Dehlavi and filmed on location in Turkey, the cinematography of this film is so gorgeous you could watch it with the sound off. The plot isn't so important as the powerful symbology of the imagery (for example, the eclipse is represented by a skull covering the sun). It must be said that the director does very little to explain the many references to the mythology. But this isn't a weakness as it sent me on my own quest to find out more about it.<br><br>Not for the impatient viewer looking for a cheap thrill, but definitely recommended for the serious viewer seeking a heightened adventure into the surreal.","user":"admiral-4","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"Sufi Horror","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2006","review":"This movie had the honor of being the world's first and only Islamic horror movie. Horror films I've seen from Pakistan and other Muslim countries were little more than rip-offs of Western horror. But this one delves into Islamic mysticism. We are taken into the world of the Djinn (spirits) and Shaytan (devils). Quotes from the Qur'an and Sufi poet / master Jallaludin Rumi and \"dhikr\" (rememberence / chants) by Bilal the Muezzin change the total feel of this movie to one that, unlike Western horror movies, owes nothing to the Christian tradition. There were some flaws. Some of the symbolism got a little strange and obscure, and baffling inserts made some of the editing a bit amateurish. But all in all its a good movie. Perhaps some other director will make a movie that shows the essence of Islamic spirituality.","user":"dawoudkringle","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"A beautifully filmed surrealist journey into Arabic mythology","rating":28,"date":"28 September 1998","review":"Unusual and violent activity is observed on the surface of the sun during an eclipse.
