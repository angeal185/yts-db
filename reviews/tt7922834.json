[{"title":"Pure Comedy!","rating":6,"date":"6 October 2018","review":"This film's so COMICALLY bad with the OTT acting, awful script and stereotypical portrayal of lifetime characters. Don't watch this unless you get a cold and need to take medication. As someone who once said, comedy's the best medicine. Yeah you hear me right, this film is pure comedy. I do feel very sorry for Linsey though. Since she's on Days now, I hope she won't have to do piece of junk like this again.","user":"ac56192","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Please watch","rating":6,"date":"7 October 2018","review":"This movie is so ridiculous that it's actually funny. It's soooooooooo bad but you wanna see it until the end. Im not sure if I don't like it because it's so bad or if I like it because it is absurd and pure comedy.","user":"mrslathan09","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"I hope this was meant to be a comedy","rating":10,"date":"15 October 2018","review":"Well for starters He looks nothing like a model lol and U can tell his skin is jacked but for every close up his face is photoshopped. Funniest thing on Netflix. The acting is super lifetime-ish but a tad worse","user":"aporcha","rank":[3,3]}]
