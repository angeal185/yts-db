[{"title":"Terrible film","rating":1,"date":"25 August 2018","review":"It's like a bad kids TV show, it's aspires to low budget. Bad on all levels. If you are five and have never seen a a film or TV programme you will love this, everyone else give it a miss.","user":"garethreeves-94317","rank":[16,30]},{"title":"English classical style movie.","rating":3,"date":"3 August 2019","review":"Simple story line, instant well predictable ending. Most actors don't bother to actually act (Ella-Rae Smith, Fabienne Piolini-Castle, and Alhaji Fofana actually did a good job). Home made visual effects. Only watch this if you like 60's style cinema.","user":"dan-ilya","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Sci-fi teen fun film for families","rating":7,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"High concept British comedy sci-fi film with gorgeous teen cast, set to be stars of the future. They are a terrific team on screen and so watchable.<br><br>Great music and a snappy script from Roland Moore take us through an enjoyable ride with some really surprisingly heart touching moment.<br><br>Cameo roles of faces known and others rising make this an easy to enjoy family film, connecting predominantly with young teens but charming all ages.","user":"littlenorthernlight","rank":[7,16]}]
