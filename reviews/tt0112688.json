[{"title":"Lee's most underrated film, without a doubt","rating":14,"date":"14 April 2001","review":"It angers me how overlooked this film is.  <br><br>It is not an easy film.  It is bleak and at times very off-putting. Actually, if you are a thinking, caring person, this is movie is overall heart-breaking.<br><br>But it is brilliant and, for the person who truly tries to understand it, a compelling, insightful look at the problems killing black America today. The only reason for the film's lack of recognition I can imagine is that its subject matter had been examined a number of times before.  But the inescapable fact is that this one of the best examinations of the subject matter there has been on screen - on par with \"Boyz N The Hood\".<br><br>And it is FAR from uncreative.  In fact, on one level, it is not a \"hood\" movie, but a whodunit.  The mystery aspect of the plot is very interesting. But there are other, more important layers.  It is the story of the confusion and crisis of a young man's life.  Most importantly, it is a brutal look at drugs, guns, and life in the projects.  It is a movie asking why so many young black men are dying in the streets.<br><br>The lead character Strike has a stomach problem.  It might be an ulcer or something like that.  I believe it is a metaphor.  Just as heat represented racial tension in Lee's masterpiece \"Do The Right Thing\", Strike's sickness represents the illnesses plaguing the ghetto: drugs, guns, liquor.<br><br>Like DTRT, this film looks at community.  The mothers, the cops, the young people, the kids, the men trying to make a living - there is eloquent commentary in \"Clockers\" on the situations of all.  In Spike's movies, paying a little attention is rewarding.  A good essay could be written on what I call the Spike Summarization technique.  This is when Spike compresses a serious debate or concern in the black community into a few expressive moments of action or dialogue.  There are better examples in other movies, but it manifests in \"Clockers\" a few times.  A bunch of kids are sitting in front of Rodney's (Delroy Lindo) shop; one of the kids is rapping while the others pay attention.  The two sides to the coin: we feel the artistry and skill of the moment, the continuation of a rich tradition of oral art; we're also struck by the cruelty and coldness in the kid's violent lyrics, and we think about where that comes from.<br><br>Stylistically, this movie is a huge success.  The cinematography is amazing, and I wonder what must be wrong with my tastes when I'm floored by a film like this and find visually bland a more oft-praised classic.  The projects become blinding panoramas, landscapes which add tons of meaning to the poignant ending (I won't reveal it here).  The sound is great; many films of this nature use hip hop in the soundtrack to produce certain effects, but \"Clockers\" does it in a more methodical way which jars some people, but contributes to the film's meaning.<br><br>I could say more about the film, but I encourage you to just see it, along with the rest of Spike's oeuvre.  He's not a perfect filmmaker, and some of his best films are marred by elements that don't work, but I feel his consistency in terms of delivering brilliance is not below most of the cinema's most celebrated auteurs.","user":"chikejeffers","rank":[45,51]},{"title":"A good moral tale about drugs and NYC","rating":19,"date":"19 November 2001","review":"Strike (Phifer) works as a drug runner (clocker) in a NY ghetto for dealer Rodney (Delroy Lindo). When someone kills one of Rodney's enemies Detective Klein (Keitel) investigates. Strike's brother Victor (Washington) confesses but suspicion points to Strike. Klein suspects that Victor is covering for his brother and begins to put the heat on Strike for more information.<br><br>The main plot is a form of crime thriller, with Keitel playing the cop trying to uncover the truth behind the murder. However the plot is not what this film is about - this is basically a film about the effects on drugs on the NY ghettos. Strike is the \"average black man\", while his protégé, Tyrone (Peewee Love) is \"black youth\". The film tries to show the forces placed on them by their situation, their role models and the few options they have in life. Rodney represents the draw of selling drugs, of quick money while policemen Andre (Keith David) and Klein represent his conscience trying to get him to do the right thing - Andre and Tyrone's mother (Regina Taylor) particularly doing right by your own community.<br><br>The message is at times forced, Keitel's sequence towards the end is very clever cinematically but feels a bit like a sermon, but at other times we're allowed to work it out ourselves. Strike is not judged but allowed to be pulled by the situation around him, his sickness representing the sickness of his situation. Through him we see the pressures that are on him to act like his peers and the bad role-models he has in his life. In Shorty we see the same things affect the next generation and, while his aping of Strike is clumsy, you again see how the lack of good role-models reduces the options for an otherwise intelligent kid. The best thing about the comparison of Lindo and Keitel is that neither is judged - both are allowed to show themselves as appealing, Lindo appears as a parent, almost seeking the best for all his workers and Keitel is allowed to be an honest cop with a good moral code. However both are also seen in a bad light, Lindo brings out the violence, pressure and treachery of his character - a man who is really out for himself while the way Keitel pressures Strike is seen as bad as Rodney's pressure and reveals a racist angry streak within himself. We are left wondering how anyone can survive between the two.<br><br>Phifer is good as Strike and manages to avoid just doing a ghetto-movie type of performance, he makes you believe that he is trapped in a no-win situation. Isaiah Washington gives another in a string of strong performances as the honest man trying to get by. Lindo is great as drug dealer Rodney, mixing paternal aspirations with moments of sudden viciousness. Keitel and John Turturro act below their station and aren't given much to work with, Keitel especially doesn't always manage to carry the moral core of the story without preaching. Two small roles of interest are Tom Byrd as Errol who has plays the fallen dealer with AIDS, however not enough is explained about his character, also Michael Imperioli (better known as Chris in The Sopranos) plays bent cop Jo-Jo. Peewee Love stands out as Shorty/Shorty, sucked into a world that lacks choice.<br><br>The film looks great, the whole thing has a bright colourful sheen on it that is very attractive to look at. Combined with Lee's stylish director it makes for a beautiful film - although some scenes are shot differently and on different stock, to make a point, although I'm not sure what that point is. The music is as good as most of Lee's movies, a mix of soul and hip hop, it is better than many ghetto films that just assume that the hip hop is all that's needed to help the mood.<br><br>This is a good example of the lack of options that exist in the ghetto and, besides some very obvious preaching, it makes it's point without shouting it at the audience. The only failing is that Lee bottles it near the end, delivering a sentimental ending of hope that is unfortunately not the truth in many cases.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[27,31]},{"title":"Lee's most mature work","rating":27,"date":"27 May 1999","review":"In 1995 I considered Spike Lee's gritty CLOCKERS one of the year's best films; recently I spotted its video in a clearance bin and picked it up. Upon re-viewing, I am struck again by its complexity.  It is the first urban drama to depict inner-city race relations with the intricacy such a pervasive cultural issue demands.  On the surface it resembles a whodunit, but its main concern is how drugs and violence contaminate entire communities, dramatized in the collapse of one African-American youth's life.  (He chokes up blood the way some of us sweat.)  This process is observed by a predominantly white police force that makes hollow attempts to keep order, and refuses to intervene with the community's gradual decline.<br><br>Instead of characters with overt prejudices and plain racial allegiances-characters that are sterile symbols of bigotry rather than credible humans guilty of it-Lee gives us characters of casual racism. Most representative of this is Harvey Keitel's Rocco Klein, a white detective who cannot understand the culture surrounding him, which is a culture of narcotics, violence, and black-on-black crime.  On his beat, drugs are less a problem than a lifestyle, murder resolves the tiniest of disagreements, and young mothers valiantly but vainly battle the influence young dealers have on their sons.  Klein views the inner-city with contempt, but deep down he knows all the whores and dealers are human beings, too.<br><br>Klein is introduced at the scene of a homicide, where the police handle the gruesome death with a clinical sense of detachment, cracking bad jokes and asking the bloodied corpse questions.  Is it just a job, or is it racism? For Klein, it's both: he needs the gallows humor to psychologically deal with this culture of depravity.  What's fascinating about CLOCKERS is Lee's willingness-and guts-to present Klein, despite his prejudice, as the film's hero.  Lee understands that casual racism is simply endemic and inescapable in American culture.  What he appreciates is Klein's ability to transcend his own prejudice and finally do the right thing.","user":"Eric-84","rank":[14,15]}]
