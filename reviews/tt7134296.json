[{"title":"My Review Of \"Crisis Hotline\"","rating":4,"date":"14 July 2019","review":"I love seeing gay representation in horror and sci-fi. Being gay myself I often wondered when a positive show of LGBTQ diversity was going to finally take hold in the only genres I like. We have made strides, and there is plenty of representation behind the camera and with onscreen talent. There's still work to be done when it comes to strong characters and storylines.<br><br>Now, that being said, I was slightly disappointed with \"Crisis Hotline\". Meant to bring some gay flavor to the thriller genre, similar to \"The Call\", Mark Shwab's film is greater in concept than it is in execution. I liked what he has done here as a psychological drama, but as a horror thriller - no.<br><br>The story creates a a situation which starts out building suspense, however that suspense never reaches a peak, it doesn't crash down into a thrill ride, all the supposed horror happens off screen, and what we are left with is a Logo channel version of a Lifetime movie. Which is cool if you're into that but I need actual horror in my horror movie.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Old theme no surprise","rating":4,"date":"25 December 2019","review":"The story is very common that an unfortunate encounter of a teen met bad guys. But it's not the worst, those gay teenage actors make me feel just pick up from gay bars then act. They do have the gay look but not professional actors for sure.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"how to creep out of the socalled locker","rating":2,"date":"12 June 2019","review":"This is a weird film on the gay subject, with all its psychological ups and downs to try to live a life at the sideline of the cocalled correct way of life. the basic storyline is based on the busy working people at a emergency call center for lgbtq individuals in deep crisis or have questions to ask. the idea is not original, but as a subject to make a film on its promising,<br><br>but the makers and actors of this flick just fails, and fails a lot. its so monotonous in its story telling,that you start wondering why people choose this way of life that hurts so much.if its a pro lgbtq movie, well then its a failure.<br><br>the grumpy old man is not homophobic, not at all, but to make a flick that busts out extremely good movies like''torch song triology'' or recently made '' tucked'' they all need to practice more, and the story and plot must not be as nerdylike as its in this film. ill put this in the dumping bucket, better luck next time.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[3,21]}]
