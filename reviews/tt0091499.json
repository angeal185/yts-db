[{"title":"\"Who made Who?\"","rating":30,"date":"30 August 2002","review":"For those of us who like Maximum Overdrive, we are apparently in the minority. I view it as a funny and entertaining, B-grade action/sci-fi flick. There's mass destruction and tons of carnage as everything on-screen is blown to bits...plus it's got Emilio Estevez. What's better than that? The movie does require major suspension of disbelief as some of the story elements don't work (for example: the honeymooner's car works just fine, but every other machine on earth, from lawn-mowers, electric knives, trucks, and even steam-rollers, go haywire). But then again, this movie is all about fun. The best part of the movie (besides Emilio) is that no one is shown any sympathy...not even kids; in one stand-out scene, a steam-roller comes out of nowhere and completely squashes this innocent kid. Maximum Overdrive is a cool and outrageous cult classic that Stephen King should be proud of. Sadly, I feel that King will never direct again.<br><br>Note for genre buffs: C.H.U.D. alumni Frankie Faison and J.C. Quinn star in the movie. King himself also cameos as the ATM guy.","user":"Backlash007","rank":[98,109]},{"title":"just for fun","rating":15,"date":"15 July 1999","review":"Yes its stupid, yes its dumb, yes its whatever negative word you might wanna say, but if you want silly action, this is for you.  After a comet passes over earth it leaves some of its demonic haze surrounding the planet. This particular haze takes control of machines, making them deadly killers (for whatever reason).  A group of people trying to stay alive hold up at the Dixie Boy truck stop.  Some dumb enough to stray from the inside get knocked off, others devise a plan to escape someplace where they can wait out the possession of the comet.  Its not the most complex of plots of course, but if you like watching stuff get blown up or people hit by cars or trucks, or watching little leaguers getting neatly pressed by steamrollers, this delivers. (Yes, really, a steamroller).","user":"mcfly-31","rank":[66,75]},{"title":"HOORAH, STEAM ROLLER!!!!","rating":14,"date":"14 June 2003","review":"Get sick of movies with intricate plots, outstanding acting, and multiple Academy Award nominations?  Then go grab Maximum Overdrive!  90 minutes of mindless truck attacks, rocket launchers and A STEAM ROLLER RUNNING OVER A LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER!!!  Now, most readers are probably thinking that this is a pretty sick review, but keep in mind that this is A MOVIE. Not real life. Even with all of this in mind, I think it is fair to say that Stephen King did a fair job with the directing.  It's by no means fantastic, but it is far better done than most Cult Classic, B-flicks.  Happy watching!","user":"BSchin2188","rank":[57,65]}]
