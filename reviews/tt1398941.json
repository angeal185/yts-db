[{"title":"The Big Two: Wanted, Dead or Alive","rating":9,"date":"21 September 2009","review":"The sixth DVD project from Warner Bros's DC Animated Universe unit, \"Superman/Batman: Public Enemies\" is a fun, socially-conscious adaptation of the six-part comic book story/graphic novel by writer Jeph Loeb and artists Ed McGuinness and Dexter Vines. Sure, it's short (67 minutes) and not to the letter (no continuity-oriented sidebars), but it's action-packed coolness.<br><br>America's plagued with crime, economic despair and war, making it easy for unethical corporate shark Lex Luthor (Clancy Brown, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" ) to run for and win the White House. There, he initiates that meta-humans and costumed crime-fighters serve the U.S. government, but the Big Two, optimistic Kryptonian boy scout Superman (Tim Daly, \"Private Practice\") and brooding urban detective Batman (Kevin Conroy, \"Dynasty\") rightfully feel he's full of it (including the \"sh\"). That gives the mastermind reason to frame the Man of Steel with the murder of \"reformed\" Kryptonite-powered cyborg Metallo (John C McGingley, \"Scrubs\"), marking him a wanted criminal and Bats as an accessory. As the Big Two fight both friends and foes, there's a huge chunk of Kryptonite headed towards Earth. The stakes are very high.<br><br>With a script by Stan Berkowitz (\"Justice League: The Animated Series\"), director Sam Liu (\"Jackie Chan Adventures\", \"The Batman\") gives \"Public Enemies\" the blockbuster-with-a-brain treatment, a fashion used in previous DC animated projects. Reprising their roles from the heroes' solo shows, Conroy and Daly are great, emphasizing their characters's differences on how to mete out justice. Brown, also doing a reprisal, nearly counters with their heroism with his callous insanity. The standard but lively animation interestingly echoes the art by McGuinness and Vines.<br><br>The other voice actors are competent: CCH Pounder (\"The Shield\") replaying government liaison Amanda Waller from \"League\"; Xander Berkeley (\"Shanghai Noon\", \"Year One\") as the noble Captain Atom and Richard Chavira (\"Desperate Housewives\") as his volatile counterpart Major Force. It's weird hearing Allison Mack (\"Smallville\") as Power Girl, due to the character'sÂ…well, you know, but she's durable in the role, even with a subtle, but funny sexual gag, validating the PG-13 rating.<br><br>\"Public Enemies\" should be on every DC Comics fan's wanted DVD's list.","user":"madbandit20002000","rank":[34,43]},{"title":"Fluid animation, fast paced action, falls short in story","rating":7,"date":"23 September 2009","review":"Mixed feelings followed after i first watched this extremely short(compared to other DC animated movies) adaptation of the Jeph Loeb Superman/batman graphic novel. For starters, there was the running time. At a mere 67 minutes(6 of which goes into the opening and closing credits sequences) this film's story disappointed me in many aspects.<br><br>First there was the story. In a time of severe economic downturn and financial crisis, the United States turn in desperation to one man, Lex Luthor, and elects him president in hopes that his vast resources can turn things around for the better. With Luthor now in power, the country returns to a state of peace. That is until the a gigantic meteorite composed entirely of Kryptonite is discovered to be on a collision course with earth. President Luthor wastes no time in capitalizing on this opportunity and, through devious manipulation and media propaganda, gets Superman branded as a criminal. A One billion dollar bounty is declared on the Man of Steel which draws not only a vast array of villains looking to cash in on the bounty, but other superheroes either convinced that Superman as gone rogue. Teaming up with Batman, the two must work together if they are to save the world, clear their names and uncover Luthor's sinister hidden agenda.<br><br>Story sounds great doesn't it? Sadly it plays out nothing like an epic tale that i was expecting, but rather like a three episode story arc of the Justice League TV series(not that Justice league was a bad show. It was great, but having a TV series styled story in a movie where the ante is expected to be upped, is really disappointing). What could have been a clever metaphor for the social and political problems that USA has recently faced soon descends into a familiar and almost formulaic narrative style. This movie just had so much potential to expound on more of the underlying themes, which sadly, it did not.<br><br>\"Familiar and formulaic\", thankfully does not extend into the artwork. THe character designs follow the original graphic novel's art by Ed McGuinness rather closely. Whether you like it or not, every character look like they went through a couple hundred protein shakes and body building regimes. Even Powergirl looks buff and bulging with muscles. The CGI backgrounds look stunning with muted tones that make them look like painted artwork at times, But it clashes very very obviously with the lesser detailed and more brightly colored characters and vehicles. On a side note, the CGI of the vehicles are extremely bad and look no better than the primitive CGI employed for \"The Zeta Project\"(the Batman Beyond spin off).<br><br>Speaking of the characters, This show is clearly for the long time fans since all the characters are presented already in \"full view\" with hardly an attempt at further character development.. There is no tension between Superman or Batman, no indication of any differing ideals or methods. From the start, they seem like best buds already which makes the whole \"unlikely team up\" part(not to mention the climax where the unlikely duo come to really respect each other) a little redundant.<br><br>Despite these shortcomings, what really justifies the price of this show is the action and animation. Sure the animation is a little stiff in the more conversation-heavy scenes, but it transits to a very fluid animation style during the numerous fight scenes which boasts an exceptionally high frame rate. Fresh from directing Marvel animation's \"Hulk Vs\", Sam Liu(the Director)manages to bring out the most in every action sequence; fast paced, relentless and brutal. Every one of those scenes look almost cinematic in feel and epic in scope thanks to some great shot angles coupled with dynamic framing and story-boarding. The grand, adrenaline pumping score by Christopher Drake compliments the movie perfectly.<br><br>On a certain level, i enjoyed Superman/Batman:Public enemies very much. The animation and action surpassed the standard direct-to-video animated movie. The character interplay by veteran voice actors Kevin Conroy and Tim Daley(reprising their respective roles of Batman and Superman from the animated series)is very well scripted with a couple of witty one liners here and there. <br><br>If you like your superhero movie big on action and don't mind one that comes up short in the story aspect, then Superman/Batman: Public enemies is for you. Also highly recommended to fans of the various DC animated series.","user":"xamtaro","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"Lethal Weapon With Capes","rating":7,"date":"20 March 2010","review":"PLOT: When America falls into a series of unfortunate events, it finds salvation in the most unlikely man of all, Lex Luthor. Now President of the United States, Luthor appears to have reformed and the USA has benefited from his administration turning the country's problems around. Only Superman, Luthor's life long arch enemy, doubts the sincerity of the 'new and improved' Lex. When Luthor calls on Superman to discuss collaborating on stopping an approaching asteroid that is basically one big ball of Kryptonite, it turns out to be a trap to frame Superman for a crime he didn't commit and pass it off as the Kryptonite asteroid affecting his psychology and then putting a reward on Superman's head - wanted dead or alive. Determined not to give up, Superman joins forces with Batman to thwart Luthor and save the Earth, a task made all the more difficult thanks to the heroes Luthor has dispatched to get in the way of the two men long hailed as The World's Finest.<br><br>The biggest criticism one can attribute to this animated feature, which is based on the Loeb/McGuinesss miniseries of the same name (the first in a stretch of stories they collaborated on) is that it removes what actually made their original graphic novel so special: the internal monologues in which Superman and Batman compare, contrast, and critique one another. That is where much of the heart and soul of the original book stemmed from. Superman and Batman are without argument the two most famous heroes of the DC Universe, and their alliance is among the best known 'odd couple' pairings in comics. Theirs is a very difficult dynamic to do properly, two sides of the same coin, the light and dark sides of justice, and has been mishandled more than once over the years as Batman's popularity grew while Superman's popularity sporadically waned, resulting in more than a few unpleasant instances of Superman being forced to step aside so that Batman can look cool, regardless of whether or not it made sense from a storytelling stand point. The Public Enemies monologues, by far, is among the very best examinations of these two iconic heroes and the unlikely friendship between them. As the \"history of\" documentary that examines their history together itself explains, the key to writing good Superman/Batman stories lies in rooting out why these two very different heroes need each other, and not fixating on the things that would drive them apart. While the basic bulk of the plot is the same, the loss of the internal monologues was truly unfortunate.<br><br>As for the feature itself, despite the loss of those monologues among a few other bits and scenes, it is still an entertaining diversion which can be best described as \"Lethal Weapon With Capes\". With animation that looks like it was ripped straight from the book, Superman and Batman go on their adventure, they kick ass, they take names, and exchange witty banter with one another in between action scenes. Kevin Conroy, Tim Daly and Clancy Brown reprise their roles from the DCAU, along with CCH Pounder returning as Amanda Waller (from JLU), and they all deliver strong performances, as usual, as do the other actors. After the embarrassment that was \"Brainiac Attacks\" it is especially nice to hear Daly reprise the Superman role with stronger material (no disrespect intended towards George Newbern, who replaced Daly for Justice League/JLU, as Newbern himself turned out to be a solid Superman once he found his footing). \"Public Enemies\" also features some of the best animated fight scenes for Superman ever drawn, from battling Metallo, to fighting off an army of bad guys, to dealing blows with fellow heroes such as Captains Atom and Marvel, to the final clash with the Kryptonite suit powered Lex Luthor. Batman himself doesn't slouch on the battle field either.<br><br>Overall rating: 7 out of 10","user":"DarthBill","rank":[5,5]}]
