[{"title":"Worth the watch for sure","rating":8,"date":"25 November 2018","review":"Randomly stumbled across this one and very happy I did . Beautiful and sad story but also thought provoking. Subtitled well and tells the story smoothly and did not drag on. Recommend it if your interested in the true upbringing in China pre 70s and why so many migrated to America , was it smart move?","user":"chutneypicklesonrye","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Amazing what some people do to come to America","rating":7,"date":"11 September 2017","review":"9/11/17. Unless you are a Native American, everyone came from somewhere else to get to America. And, it wasn't just getting a ticket on some ship or plane to get here either. Yau King Eng, the director's father, takes the viewer on his perilous journey from China to Macau and onward to the U.S., as he fled from Communist China. This documentary is worth watching because most Americans today take for granted what some have risk their lives to be a part of.","user":"bettycjung","rank":[0,0]}]
