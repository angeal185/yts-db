[{"title":"Brown noise mountain lights","rating":20,"date":"20 April 2014","review":"This is another found footage movie, this time the footage comes from a camera which has been dropped out of a UFO where aliens are torturing someone with a dentists drill. Luckily the camera has survived several days of use without recharge and being punted out of a flying saucer from near-orbit. The aliens are mad to throw away a camera that reliable in my opinion.<br><br>So the movie has shown you the ending within the first few minutes. The family themselves are bland and uninteresting but there are some funny moments and I mean funny as in badly done. Witness the argument that explodes out of nowhere in the car when they suddenly decide they are lost.<br><br>\"I didn't make the mountains! They go up and they go down!\" That's just the kind of thing people say to each other during car arguments isn't it? Not as funny as the way the aliens flat-pack their victims during abduction though. What a ridiculous effect.<br><br>When the aliens do show up it causes the camera to malfunction in a convenient way that shows you very little and instead gives you a blast of annoyingly loud noise to make you jump and some annoying jittery images of rubber alien masks to go with it.","user":"sebpopcorn","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"Although it lacks some originality, it's awfully well made.","rating":7,"date":"10 April 2014","review":"\"Alien Abduction\" is an example of a so-called 'found footage' movie. In other words, much, if not all the film is supposedly real and was filmed by victims of some sort of supernatural event. The best example was the hugely successful film The Blair Witch Project—a film that cost practically nothing to make and which earned many, many millions of dollars. It's odd, but I have seen very few such films, though I thought the Norwegian film \"Trollhunter\" was absolutely brilliant and is a real must-see. <br><br>When I looked through some of the reviews for this film on IMDb, I noticed that they were a mixed bag. Some really liked it but several didn't and complained that the genre is over-saturated and other films like \"Alien Abduction\" have already been made. I would agree with this sentiment, as although found footage films can be wonderful, after you've seen a couple, the well starts to run dry. Because of this, no matter how good Alien Abduction is, for many it's an example of too many and too late to care. If, however, you've not been exposed to these sorts of movies, then \"Alien Abduction\" is certainly worth your time. <br><br>The film is set around Brown Mountain in North Carolina—a place where many actual reports of glowing lights have been reported by many. Because of this Alien Abduction has an advantage because weird sightings have been reported in this area for years. Interestingly, I actually lived a couple hours from there and NEVER heard about such stories while I lived in North Carolinabut when I checked online, there were many, many reports. I am VERY dubious about all this, but apparently many people do believe aliens might be involved.<br><br>The story concerns a family that is going camping around Brown Mountain. They seem very ordinary in most ways—and this was a positive thing. Because they seemed just like other families in most ways, it made the supposed found footage more believable. The only oddity is that the youngest child supposedly was autistic and loved to film EVERYTHING—and that is supposedly how we got all this footage.<br><br>While the family has seen some weird lights, the enormity of the problem doesn't sink in until they happen upon about a dozen cars all abandoned— with doors open and belongings scattered everywhere. While searching through these vehicles, the men in the family are set upon by aliens; you know--the Roswell types you so often have seen in films. But, being a found footage film, you only catch tiny glimpses and it's all very hard to make out. What isn't hard to make out is that Dad disappears— taken by these creatures. Soon, the rest of the family is running for their lives and the aliens seem content at picking them off one at a time.<br><br>So is the film any good? Yes. I think it was constructed very well. I loved the music—it was probably the best thing about the film and really helped build the tension. Additionally, the acting was believable and I liked the footage seen at the very end of the video camera being tossed out of the spaceship (which, by the way, was also used at the beginning). All in all, a tense and exciting film in a glutted genre. <br><br>By the way, if you do watch, don't turn off the credits as you'll get to see what appear to be interviews with folks who have seen these strange lights at Brown Mountain—though, interestingly, none of these people have claimed to have seen aliens.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[42,63]},{"title":"Movie was pretty good and worth watching for alien fans","rating":6,"date":"3 September 2014","review":"Just watched the movie and i thought it was pretty cool for an alien abduction movie. I can't understand why some of these people are giving it such bad reviews. If you don't like alien movies then don't watch it. I bet you could ask these same people giving bad reviews, what alien movies do they like and they prob can't mention any. @IndieDavid says in his pathetic review that the camera lasts for several days on one battery, well the movie only goes for one 1 day and 1 night and the child charges the camera at night. So Indiedavid didn't even watch the movie he just wants to turn people off a movie he has never even bothered to watch.. I am pretty harsh on all movies so 6/10 is pretty good review for me.","user":"bradleyd6","rank":[26,37]}]
