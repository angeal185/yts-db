[{"title":"8.8 yeah sure","rating":2,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"If not fake ratings what do we get fake ratings.... this movie is awful the special effects acting and the way it was filmed is complete amateur.... why the fake rating... once more","user":"kaefab","rank":[59,63]},{"title":"Amateurville Horror","rating":1,"date":"30 September 2018","review":"I tried; I couldn't. This film is craptastic; so craptastitc, in fact, that try as I might, I could not keep my attention on it. Tumblr memes won. Actually, paint drying would have won out over 'Ghost Source Zero'. The film is so disjointed that it was hard to distill a narrative from the jumbled mess of poorly constructed visual refuse vomited across my screen. I can't even say it was a good first try. Nope... I'm trying to find something redeeming, or at least something nice to say about the film. There isn't. I've seen far better high-school media production class projects. Avoid at all costs.","user":"troy-boulton","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Dear mother of God....","rating":1,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"That's one and a half hour that I'll never get back. I'm lying, no human beeng can not watch this ''movie'' for more than 10 minutes. Real waste of time.","user":"kullortoragh","rank":[12,15]}]
