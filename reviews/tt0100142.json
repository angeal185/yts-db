[{"title":"Ironically sad and funny","rating":4,"date":"4 September 1999","review":"This film is a brilliant talkfest, with the decline of the New York WASP social setting a major point.  It's set on a couple weeks during the Christmas season, with Tom Townsend being invited to a party, much by chance, by Nick and his friends.  He doesn't \"belong\", but everyone likes him, some more than others.  He does seem rather odd, with his socialist ideas, and his anti-party attitude.  What develops is an odd relationship between Tom and Nick, as well as between Tom and a girl named Audrey.<br><br>  Christopher Eigmann, as Nick, is a stand out in this cast.  He is cynical, pessimistic, yet probably the smartest one in the group.  He spouts of dialogue with conviction and care.<br><br>  What makes this film work is the slight sadness we feel at the disintegration of this class, without having ever been part of it. <br><br>\n  Some people will find it boring.  It doesn't have the prerequisite number of explosions for the action fans, and not much does happen.  But the way this film is executed, where dialogue is the key, makes this film one of the ten best of 1990.","user":"Arkaan","rank":[34,36]},{"title":"A great and unique film for this genre","rating":10,"date":"9 August 1999","review":"Whit Stillman's movies are dialogue driven, which is not everyone's cup of tea. This is the first of a trilogy, all of which take a slice of life of young people coming of age, but in the cusp of a dying culture, with a new order and new responsibilities baring down on them. Here it's the prep and prom culture of New York's Upper East Side, sometime in the 70's. The participants dutifully go through the rights of Christmas Balls and 'orgy' week, act sophisticated, and generally do things and say things which are expected of them. An outsider, Tom, with radical social and intellectual ideas, enters their midst and becomes a catalyst of change here as a romance develops with Audrey. Tom, idealistic, insensitive and naive is embraced by Audrey, emotionally more mature but more vulnerable, accepting his sometimes preposterous social and literary speculation as a sign of substance in comparison to the increasingly jaded and cynical world of her preppy friends. A friendship develops also between Tom and Nick, the most cynical and pessimistic, but also the most aware and responsible, of the group. The conversations are lively and filled with insights into character and maturity. Nothing much happens in this film, but the intricate interplay of characters, dialogue and ambiance make for a fascinating and penetrating look at these young people's lives. It unfolds like a ballet. This is a fine film which doesn't rely on angst or melodrama-- and maintains a humor, poignancy and charm which makes it a rare achievement for the genre. Stillman's other two films in the trilogy are also highly recommended.","user":"lotus49","rank":[41,44]},{"title":"Of Austen, debs, Fourier, games, and the allure of Serena Slocum","rating":8,"date":"8 February 1999","review":"Centering on the lives of wealthy, well-educated young women \"coming out\" as debutantes and on the equally wealthy, well-educated young men who attend deb parties as the girls' escorts, Whit Stillman's feature directing debut sparkles with incredible dialogue that always wavers between savage wit and heartfelt poignancy.  Few who have seen the picture will forget its hilarious dissections of New York social classes, its elegant sense of vocabulary, or its caustic self-awareness.  The thing I enjoy the most about Metropolitan (and the two subsequent films Stillman has made), however, is the verisimilitude with which the characters are rendered.  I grew up far from the money and privilege of Metropolitan's inhabitants, but I could so easily relate to their fears, desires, and insecurities -- because Stillman never forgets to keep these kids human.","user":"pooch-8","rank":[28,30]}]
