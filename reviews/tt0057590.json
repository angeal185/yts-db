[{"title":"Lyric beauty, bawdy humor and adventure set to celluloid and music.","rating":30,"date":"30 August 1999","review":"In 1963 two of the most important productions in the history of movie making were released.  The first was: \"Cleopatra\" with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, a cast as long as the Manhattan telephone directory and a budget bigger than the combined egos of the stars.  \"Cleopatra\" was a total disaster.  It has no redeeming quality that I know of.  It is therefore important for embodying in one film, nearly everything that you can do wrong in making a movie.  It is a movie that you must see if you are ever to understand what a truly good film really is.  The second was: \"Tom Jones\" with Albert Finney and Susannah York, shot with rented equipment and costumes on the streets of London with a supporting cast of brilliant British ensemble players and extras who stood-in just to get in a film. Tom Jones is simply one of the best motion pictures of all time, for my money, The Best from Literature.<br><br>John Osborne who wrote the screen play produced a marvelous vehicle, but the genius of \"Tom Jones\" is Tony Richardson.  He moves the actors and the story about the screen with a bawdy grace and earthy gentility that paints action and raucous laughter and beauty across one another with an even hand.  It is a glimpse of antiquity so close and real that we can nearly touch it, and it makes us want to.  (Though to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure we'd care for the smell of it.)<br><br>\"Tom Jones\" is a low budget, low tech, high quality film that must win the award for the \"Most with the Least.\"  The photography is beautiful, not because it used a dozen half million dollar cameras, it is beautiful because it is good photography.  The acting wins out, and casts of thousands would only serve to clutter the stage.   See this film whenever, wherever and as often as you possibly can.","user":"H.J.","rank":[72,86]},{"title":"Wonderful, even 37 years later","rating":9,"date":"4 January 2004","review":"This was a great film in its time, and is still a great one today. Well-directed, well-acted, well-shot, great soundtrack, and based on a splendid literary vehicle.   <br><br>It's frustrating to see so much uninformed voting and so many uninformed remarks on this otherwise wonderful site; I guess its inevitable since anyone can post anything.  But I would like to point out that Tom Jones did not sleep with his mother as erroneously alleged, and that Albert Finney, 26 or 27 years old at the time of shooting this film, clearly did not look too old for his part.<br><br>I haven't read the book(s), but from the film it's obvious that Dickens was much indebted to Fielding, using his amazing invention as a convoluted plot model (and perhaps a character-naming model) for many of his works.<br><br>Go rent this film after seeing Finney in the currently playing Big Fish -- it's great to see him do so well in such very different films made in different millenia, nearly a full professional lifetime apart.","user":"kadar","rank":[79,102]},{"title":"One of the greatest farces of all time","rating":29,"date":"29 April 2000","review":"Tome Jones came out of the wonderful 60's when all the stuffy conventions of British theater, film and music were turned upside down. I first saw this film while stationed in Wiltshire in the Royal Air Force, and having grown up in the industrial West Riding of Yorkshire, my eyes had only recently been opened to the staggering beauty of the English countryside. <br><br>\nTom Jones represented that unspoiled English countryside to me. I could smell the hay, the wildflowers and the livestock.  Never mind that unless you were rich it was serf labor, I saw England through a wonderful fantasy of a film.  The action never stopped.  This movie was just hilarious from beginning to end. No glossing over the crude realities of country life - this was a period when the poor folk shared their hovels with the chickens and other small animals, when sex was raw, albeit punished on Sundays, and when the local gentry had their way with the wenches. <br><br>\nRarely has there been such a belly laugh of a movie.  Laugh until the tears roll down your face.","user":"eunice-4","rank":[55,70]}]
