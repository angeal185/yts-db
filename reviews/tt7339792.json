[{"title":"Unbroken by the Overly Critical","rating":10,"date":"15 September 2018","review":"What makes a great film based on a true story? In my opinion, the film is great if it follows the actual story and doesn't deviate from the course that someone actually lived. Louis Zamperini is a man whose story shaped much of my teenage years and continues to influence the man I am becoming. I learned a lot of lessons from his stories. That nothing in life is ever too hard to overcome. That resiliency, faith, courage, and strength can get you through anything. That forgiveness can set you free from a dark past. And above all else, God is in control of everything and uses everything for our good, yes, even our pain. I know that not everyone believes in God, and many reject His existence. But the story Unbroken is incomplete without God in it. I, like so many others, felt empty after the first Unbroken film in 2014. While the movie was mostly accurate, it left out so many important details. The last half of Zamperini's story is summed up in a sad two sentences at the end of the film and God was swept under the rug. So once again, I like so many others felt utterly relieved when it was announced that a sequel was in the works to finish the story. I am proud to say that this movie exceeded my expectations and finished a story that much needed to be told. While what happened to Zamperini in the war was a terrible and unforgettable story, his time after the war was much darker. Louis Zamperini went from being a man unable to be broken by his captors to a survivor haunted by nightmares that leave him reduced to an alcoholic. But it is such a beautiful moment both in the book and in the movie to see Louis lay all his burdens down at the alter and become an entirely different man, free from all his pain. Again, I know that not everyone believes in God, but it was undoubtedly God that freed Louis from his own war. You cannot remove God and faith from this story and have a good movie. I feel that this movie did justice to Zamperini and his legacy.","user":"nathanb-martin","rank":[62,92]},{"title":"There's nothing like a good true-life story!","rating":10,"date":"15 September 2018","review":"Before you pooh-pooh movies about a person's life changing moment, see the continuing (Unbroken) true story of one man's journey from WWII prisoner of war to healing and wholeness. This 2nd movie abut Zamperini's life story was even better than the first. The quality of production, storyline consistency and acting was perfect. It's an emotional movie for sure and some of the struggles Zamperini lived through were unknown to me. While this is a movie that is family friendly, it contains a powerful message.","user":"coastdaze","rank":[36,64]},{"title":"A Review by an Atheist","rating":10,"date":"6 January 2019","review":"The avg. IMDB star rating for this movie is suffering due to the older audience this movie appeals to. I've seen perfectly grammatically correct reviews praising this movie, frankly raving about it, yet they only gave the movie 3 or so stars. I think some older folks are new to IMDB and don't understand how its star rating system works. 10 stars is good and 1 star is bad.<br><br>Anyway, the detail in the PTSD depiction was amazingly accurate and Samuel Hunt is an exceptional actor. I loved this movie for the accuracy in that. I understand the disappointment one Christian expressed over the minor coverage of what changed Zamperini's mind, convincing him to stop hating and blaming God, but to instead trust Him. As an atheist, I certainly didn't mind the short treatment of this, but I will point out that Pure Flix has gotten lots of heat for dedicating full movies to trying to persuade atheists. They've probably learned not to do that. Even another IMDB reviewer didn't like how preachy this movie still is, as though the aim should be for Christian studios to make movies that are indistinguishable from those of secular studios. I certainly don't expect that.<br><br>Another reviewer dedicated their entire review of this movie to insulting Pure Flix for its previous movies which were dedicated to persuading atheists. Some atheists think movies where an atheist is a villain should never exist, even if atheists are also good guys in the same movie. So I'll grant that you Christians were quite mature about Monty Python movies, Carrie, the Shawshank Redemption, and many of Universal's recent anti-Christian movies like the highly fictionalized Boy Erased, but I just don't think many atheists are quite ready to return that favor to you. Sorry. :-/","user":"rdnyscott","rank":[15,24]}]
