[{"title":"What a hoot! This might be Arnie's best, even though Jamie Lee almost steals the show.","rating":8,"date":"3 January 2001","review":"I had forgotten how funny this film is.  From the very start it begins to laugh at itself and the entire genre, with great audacity.  Every single scene is worth watching and I am still giggling about many of them.  (Well, ok, the camera angle on the scene with terrorist-as-missile is a teensy bit overdone.) <br><br>I delayed renting it again because I remembered the Jamie-Lee-as-prostitute scene was difficult to sit through--her predicament is just so embarrassing. But this time I discovered it is probably my favorite scene. She is just a scream (and surprisingly erotic), while her underplayed klutziness throughout is hysterical, right down to the tango at the end.  Especially in contrast to her husband's ridiculously effortless physical skills and unruffled cool.  The only time he loses it, and hilariously so, is with Bill Paxton. (And I love that she gets her own back for Arnie's sleazy trick.  A woman who packs a punch.) <br><br>Even the excellent special effects are pure humor.  They are just huge enough to be ridiculous, and yet never seem overblown--and this with a nuclear explosion and a Harrier on an urban rampage.  This film is a work of genius.  How an action/espionage/romance spoof could deliver such outrageous tongue-in-cheek and yet never feel like corn, slap or déjà vu is a mystery to me.  <br><br>I give this 8/10 for being relentlessly entertaining, at a very high level.  And the acting is top notch all around.","user":"scaevola","rank":[61,68]},{"title":"Pure Arnie. Big, loud, and hilarious","rating":8,"date":"10 September 2004","review":"Once again, Arnie and Cameron team up to deliver a terrific action film.<br><br>Arnie stars as a secret agent posing as a computer salesman. Not even his wife knows his true identity and since he is always busy she decides to have a little excitement and hooks up with a nitwit posing as a secret agent! In the mean while, in trying to get her back, Arnie gets his family inadvertently pushed into a plot, by terrorists to nuke the USA! Preposterous? Yes! Hilarious? YES!!!<br><br>The resulting film has Arnie chasing motorcycles on horseback through hotels all the way to \"borrowing\" Harrier jets from the military. And, of course, getting his wife and daughter back.<br><br>Packed with awesome action scenes and some really terrific hilarious moments this is what an action movie should be. Not too serious and not too pointless. 8/10<br><br>Rated R: violence and profanity","user":"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","rank":[114,142]},{"title":"This is how an action movie should be like!","rating":10,"date":"15 July 2004","review":"Biggest problem with most action movies is that they take themselves way too serious. \"True Lies\" is mainly fun and entertaining and on top of that, the action is top class!<br><br>Finally a movie of which I can say: \"Budget well spend!\" The action really jumps off the screen but it never feels overdone or forced, which is thanks to action-director veteran James Cameron. He should stick to directing action movies like this, the Terminator movies and \"Aliens\". Please no more movies like \"Titanic\"! (not that it was a VERY bad movie) Stick to were your talent lies.<br><br>The movie can be described as an American James Bond, meaning that everything is bigger and I'm not just talking about Arnie's chest. Just like the James Bond movies, it doesn't take itself seriously without making itself ridiculous.<br><br>Many people seem to have problems with the whole \"wife side track, story-line\" I guess I'm one of the few that doesn't mind it at all and actually find it an extra addition to the story.<br><br>The movie has everything a good action movie need: A believable action hero, explosions, chases, gun fights, a stereotype villain and a high entertainment value.<br><br>I wish more action movies like this would be made.<br><br>10/10<br><br>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","user":"Boba_Fett1138","rank":[208,266]}]
