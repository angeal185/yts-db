[{"title":"Lovable","rating":9,"date":"2 February 2019","review":"I've been wanting to watch this film for a long time now. I needed something to watch desperately this Friday evening and it got released on Prime.<br><br>I've randomly found Charlene's Xanga back in the day and was so instantly drawn into everything about her. She's very witty, honest, and original. She had this natural beauty inside and out and I've been a fan girl since.<br><br>I enjoyed everything about this film. They sure know how to make light of dark situations. I love the dark humor and the music in the film. I definitely believe in platonic friendships and how they can help save people. Throughly enjoyed John Hawkes and Melissa Leo, perfect castings and characters for the story. I'm just shocked I didn't start sobbing.<br><br>I hope Charlene continues acting. Such a raw exhilarating talent.","user":"huyenchu","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Great take on a hard topic to tackle, yet not a great film","rating":7,"date":"23 April 2019","review":"Viewers should know first and foremost that this film gets right at the heart of some topics that many find uncomfortable to even think of, let alone watch played out on screen for 80 mins. It is a (pleasantly) surprisingly frank depiction of sex in general, with a focus on specific inclinations/complulsions/hangups/etc relative to the addictive aspects of sex.<br><br>And that enough so that there was no future of international release or promos on late-night US tv. No chance of great stardom or adulation. But they did it anyway, and did it honestly, such that it (according to a similarly-afflicted friend) really speaks to the heart of the issue and how actual humans deal with it.<br><br>But, due praise given, the narrative was somewhat disjointed in presentation and the final cut a resultant disappointment to me. Not in the least because I think they poorly utilized the brilliant John Hawkes (and, yes, apologies for elevating the male role in a film that's not about him). For that matter, I found the equally brilliant Melissa Leo underutilized as well (also, not about her, I know).<br><br>While I endlessly applaud Ms. deGuzman's honesty and sheer courage to bring such a personal role to the screen as she did, I must be honest and say it did not, ultimately, work out that well.<br><br>Honest assessment is a 6/10, but I think such boldness and effort demands an extra star.<br><br>With any luck, Ms. deGuzman will be back soon with another film more complementary of her talents, and of the talents of those around her.","user":"jamesalmos","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Refreshing","rating":9,"date":"6 February 2019","review":"I was sceptical about the movie before watching it, I thought a serious matter like sex addiction could not be seen in a fun way. The movie actually proved me wrong and even though I would have liked to see a bit more of psychological depth to understand the whole love and sex addiction concept better, the take on this was quite innovative and optimist in a way. Loved Charlene's performance, the movie pushed me to research more about the actress and once I found out that the script is based on her real life experience, I can now see how authentic it is.","user":"giuseppef","rank":[3,3]}]
