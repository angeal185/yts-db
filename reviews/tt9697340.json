The film centers on David Shepard (Bryan G. Thompson) who works for Harris Corp a government special ops contractor. They are in competition with Blackstone and XRC. They are being pushed out so they pay one group to kill the other in what was a minor plot point.<br><br>David loses his wife in what appeared to be an accidental alien autopsy explosion. Alien DNA has used on humans to prevent disease and now they want them all dead. This is David's job, who is reluctant to kill innocent people.<br><br>The film takes bad to a new low level. The acting and dialogue were a laugh as was the CG explosions.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[1,2]}]
