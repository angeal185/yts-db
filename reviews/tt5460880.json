[{"title":"Why the Hate?","rating":7,"date":"5 December 2018","review":"I am stunned by some of the negative reviews - someone actually wrote they did not laugh once. All I can assume is they must have been watching a different movie.<br><br>While there were some cliched moments and I could have predicted some parts, I really enjoyed this movie. All of the main characters were extremely likable and I found myself rooting for them. There were many moments, while understated, that were absolutely hilarious - No cheap laughs at the expense of the characters.<br><br>One last thing, and I hope I'm not overstepping as a heterosexual, but I thought the gay relationship between Paul and Erasmus was treated with respect and not demeaned in any way. I'm not sure how often this occurs, but I would guess not often enough (I hope I'm wrong).","user":"guidegoldblatt","rank":[53,55]},{"title":"We can't have a kid - we are Kids!!","rating":10,"date":"23 November 2018","review":"This is a really funny movie. This isn't a portrayal of a regular gay couple, it is a whimsical view of a well to do gay couple that are 2 big ole kids themselves. They are out of touch with \"all the little people\". The sparring is kind of over the top, but at the same time- just right on the mark. Give it a chance, you'll love it by the end. My fave part is the 2nd parent/teacher conference, right after the Kid's class speech.","user":"davemerino","rank":[22,24]},{"title":"Paul Rudd never lets me down","rating":10,"date":"26 November 2018","review":"I hadn't heard of this movie until it was released on HBO. I had to watch it because of my love, Paul Rudd. The entire movie had me laughing out loud while my husband was trying to sleep. I couldn't contain myself. I'll definitely watch this again soon.","user":"mimi-77111","rank":[16,17]}]
