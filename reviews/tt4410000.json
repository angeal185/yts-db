[{"title":"Unexpectedly hilarious .","rating":8,"date":"8 September 2018","review":"Took my Garanddsons to see this movie. They told me at the cinema it had been out 3 weeks, but I'd never heard of it and probably wouldn't have bothered to go if I'd read some of the reviews . As there were only 6 of us at the showing I was doubtful . But I was pleasantly surprised and laughed til I cried , something I haven't done since Hitel Transylvania 2. There were some sad moments and probably s bit scary for little ones , but only at the point where the social worker (an alien in disguise) turned into a monster. But she was soon overcome . Brilliant on the whole !","user":"lovingganma","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"amusing comedy for kids","rating":7,"date":"22 November 2018","review":"Obviously a low budget film - but a good one. It turns a boy-meets-alien story into a witty knockabout comedy, that passes by in a breeze. My kids laughed a lot and i had a smile on my face over the entire running time. Of course the animation is far away from Disney, Pixar &amp; Co, but i wonder how their movies would look, if they were made with a budget of only 5 mio instead of 100 mio dollar. My respect to all the small production companies in the world.","user":"janinerau","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Not too shabby","rating":7,"date":"26 February 2019","review":"I don't understand the hate it was entertaining and touching","user":"kbsmokajc","rank":[8,9]}]
