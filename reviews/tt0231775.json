[{"title":"Rock rolls","rating":7,"date":"28 February 2001","review":"Chris Rock stars in this remake of Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (itself a remake of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr. Jordan), a comedy about a man who dies before his time, before he can realize his dreams, and his adventures in his new (albeit temporary) body. In the Beatty version, the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then-Los Angeles Rams. In Rock's hipper version, our lead character is a struggling young - and decidedly low-talent - standup comedian.<br><br>It's very funny to see the razor-sharp Rock playing a bad comedian. It's kind of like seeing Tom Hanks play a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non-amateur night. But every time he tries out his material, he's booed off the stage lustily - so much so that his nickname becomes \"Booie.\" His jokes are lame, his delivery painful. In short, Lance is everything that the real Chris Rock isn't.<br><br>\nLance is also a bike messenger, and he's riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when BAM! He's hit by a truck. Ok, so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel (Eugene Levy), but hey, he was going to get hit anyway. No dice, it appears Lance isn't due in Heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the \"manager\" of Heaven, reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not-quite-dead Mr. Barton. Trouble is, the body they find is of a greedy, old white man. Turns out this fella (a Mr. Wellington) owns all kinds of things - he's the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will turn things around. <br><br>But of course, while in the body of the affluent Mr. Wellington, Lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker (Regina King). We males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body, but try winning one over while you're an dumpy, old white guy! And it's even worse when she's not impressed by your money.  <br><br>This is Rock's first shot at a lead role, and in my opinion he performs admirably. There's still a lot of the standup comedian in him - and, of course, if he ever wants to get diverse roles, he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script - but this isn't really a bad thing. Rock's personality - his drive, his delivery, his demeanor, and his passion - are what fuel this film. He's clearly having a lot of fun in the role, and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him.","user":"dfranzen70","rank":[16,19]},{"title":"Needs some help","rating":7,"date":"3 March 2001","review":"This movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better.  The last one, Heaven Can Wait, was great, I suggest you see that one.  This one is not so great.  The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today.  However, I don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie.  It plays like some really bad \"B\" movie where people sound like they are in some bad TV sit-com.  The situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie.  It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad.  I don't know how they could release this movie like that.  Anyway, the last part isn't to bad, so wait for the video and see it then.","user":"tomrito","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"A total snore","rating":5,"date":"30 July 2001","review":"We rented it and I wasn't expecting much in the first place. . It just looked like it would be another one of the endless comedies that come out every year.  This one should not have been on the big screen, nor should it have gone straight to video.  It was horrible!!  I like Chris Rock, his stand up is hilarious, and I loved him as Nat X on Saturday Night Live, and he was good in New Jack City.  But if he's going to be an actor, then do some acting. .not that it was bad, but the material was terrible.<br><br>The story was as predictable as can be. . The worst parts were when they tried to get the audience emotionally involved, they tried to get us to care about these characters.  WTF?  We don't want \"Steel Magnolias\" or \"Beaches\", we want Chris Rock to be funny!  He wasn't. . it was LAME.  Common sense would dictate that we, the audience, should see rock as the white man, and hear him as the white man, doing the stand up.  THAT would have been funny. <br><br>\nAnyway, this was pretty damn bad.  5/10 at best.. NOT funny, just a waste of time, but thank god it was pretty short.","user":"Pigface1","rank":[9,15]}]
