[{"title":"Different Christmas movie","rating":10,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"I really enjoyed the fact that there were different story lines and that it wasn't the typical \"business woman from the city goes back to her small home town and meets the farmer\"","user":"emilieswane-65462","rank":[103,138]},{"title":"Cmon guys","rating":10,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"So cute, why does everyone expect Netflix movies to be Oscar worthy! I mean seriously lighten up. It's a fun lighthearted teenage version of love actually. So sweet, good acting, and good storyline. Just a fun Christmas movie. Don't listen to the Debbie downers..","user":"erica-785-692529","rank":[144,199]},{"title":"Cute. Cliche. Christmas. Three C that makes a great RomCom","rating":8,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I saw this one on Netflix. I haven't been much for RomComs before but i thought I'll give it a chance. I don't regret a second! Sure. It's cliche but RomComs are supposed to be. I hope you'll give it a chance.","user":"andrewss-37477","rank":[48,67]}]
