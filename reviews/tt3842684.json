[{"title":"Strange but not captivating","rating":6,"date":"12 February 2020","review":"Had I not read the synopsis, I guess I would have stopped watching after a very short time since the movie looks like two already boring movies interleaved. It is watchable. But it is not appealing. Characters are unlikable, especially the Chinese ones. Production is standard quality for an American movie (not sure it is American though). The central idea could have led to something more interesting than having two mostly unrelated storylines going on. Watch it if you have nothing else to do, or watch it while you do some chores like ironing, washing dishes.","user":"in-imdb-1","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Mildy Interesting","rating":3,"date":"5 April 2020","review":"I watched this because I like Boyd Holbrook, but there isn't much here to see. Parallel lives maybe ? Kindred spirits on opposite sides of the world ? Who even knows ? I have to wonder how movies like this get made, could it have been more interesting on paper ? Lots of questions, no real answers, kept watching to see where it was going and then it was just over. Ultimately a bore.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"The worse movie I've seen","rating":2,"date":"7 February 2020","review":"The worse movie I've ever seen on my life, it's a waste of time really doesn't worth for watching","user":"Bushra-36072","rank":[2,10]}]
