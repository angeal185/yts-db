[{"title":"Signs you should look for before you waste an hour and a half:","rating":1,"date":"27 February 2019","review":"1. All the 9's and 10's reviews are made by people with only 1 (one) review ever, this one. (Family and friends much?)\n2. The reviewers have User -Id's like; blabla-134543 and: whatever-2343 and such.\n3. There are typically 29 reviews in total, and they are all nines and tens.\n4. When you have a gut feeling that the movie is horrible, most of the time it is.\n5. There are washed up \"stars\" in it, maybe one ore two.\n6. If Ron Jeremy is in it: Avoid!<br><br>It is quite sad really, I used to rely on IMDB and its reviewers to at least give me a hint if I would give a movie a couple of hours of my life...Lesson learned.<br><br>All in all I'm sure the filmmakers and actors in this movie had fun making this, and I wish them all the luck in getting their money-investment back, because I really hope they didn't put their homes or cars as collateral to raise the 200$ it must have cost to make this movie.<br><br>Wrote this out of humanity for people wanting one hour and fortyseven minutes filled with joy other than that embarrassing feeling you'll get watching this.<br><br>No, Malcolm McDowell and Gilbert Gottfried can't save this sinking ship.<br><br>Low on budget, low on talent.","user":"chinaski2019","rank":[41,55]},{"title":"Appalling","rating":1,"date":"2 March 2019","review":"This movie has Ron Jeremy in it. That should tell you all that you need to know about this lowbrow garbage film.\nPathetically cheap attempt at monster design- they are like Halloween costumes.\nCrappy acting, and obnoxious characters...I would be embarrassed to be in this film. I don't know who this could possibly be made for, but I couldn't finish watching it.\nI was sucked in by the shocking amount of positive user reviews here. After giving this movie a try, these reviews are either fake or must be left by people who likely love spoof movies that feature Carmen Electra- like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans. This is the same type of film. Beware.","user":"umimelectric","rank":[28,38]},{"title":"When you're on drugs...","rating":1,"date":"25 March 2019","review":"...and so are the people who financed this garbage for this infantile mess with more fake reviews than any other film. I started watching and then realized it's the stupidest thing ever to be produced onto a film reel. wow. 1/10","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[17,22]}]
