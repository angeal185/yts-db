[{"title":"Really good movie","rating":10,"date":"2 March 2019","review":"I thought this movie was very well done, for it's budget. JCVD said they only had 30 people on the crew rather than 300 like a normal big budget movie. So for what it's worth the movie was done very well IMO. It's not your typical JCVD movie with all his spin kicks and stuff. Instead he's a junky soldier with PSTD but trying to make a meager living. The story is more about these kids in MS-13 being used by the drug lord to run drugs around the city. JCVD gets caught up with the boys when they get in trouble and all hell breaks loose. JCVD isn't really a figher in this but more of a solder trained with guns.<br><br>The acting was great, the car chase scene was intense. It's a drama that grows on you. Drama with action. I think JCVD has risen to a new level in acting on this movie.. His crew members, The main MS-13 guy and the boys did an excellent job too. I watched the movie yesterday and going to watch it again today. This movie really grows on you.","user":"ryan-59722","rank":[43,64]},{"title":"Wasted potential","rating":8,"date":"3 March 2019","review":"The beginning of the movie was really promising. Casting was great, people who were cast as the gang members were amazing, David Casta√±eda did an amazing job portraying Rincon. JCVD l, even though he didn't appear much in the first half, did a great job as well.\nThe biggest problem was the camera man. Almost every shot was shaky and after a while, you couldn't ignore it anymore. I do understand that the budget was very low, but it's not hard to shoot scenes with steady camera.\nAlso Elijah Rodriguez, in my opinion, was missing emotions needed in certain scenes.\nThe ending wasn't that great as well. They could make it a little longer or add a few scenes. A little more action couldn't hurt too\nHowever, considering how low the budget was, they did a good job with the movie.","user":"mikkiparker","rank":[23,33]},{"title":"Good news. A solid Van Damme flick in 2019.","rating":7,"date":"2 March 2019","review":"As a long time JCVD fan, from time to time I look up to see what he has coming out later in the year. I've been waiting to check out We Die Young since I found out about it last year. Since I grew up 20 minutes from Washington D.C. (not far from where the film takes place) I was extra curious about this one. Although not the actionfest I was originally hoping for, it turned out to be a surprisingly good film. Solid directing and acting make this one of the better Van Damme movies of the last decade. Nothing revolutionary, but an entertaining \"day in the life\" of a teenage gang member who suddenly tries to get his little brother out of the gang life.\nThe films main character is a teenage drug runner for the MS13 gang in a D.C. neighborhood. The same day he is making the biggest \"package\" run of his life, some gang members decide to \"jump in\" his little brother. Deciding he doesn't want that life for his little brother, they try to take off, and things get hectic from there on out. Van Damme is a former marine, who was injured and lost his ability to speak (yes, Van Damme has no dialog in the film) and is now a junkie who buys from (and eventually helps) our teenage lead. Don't let that deter you, JCVD is in the whole movie, it follows both characters over the 24 hour period in which the film takes place.\nThere isn't a single martial arts fight, but there is a good amount of violence from beatings, stabbings and shootouts. Van Damme gives a solid performance, especially for no dialog. If you just enjoy gang films it's worth giving it a watch. If you like JCVD movies than definitely check this one out, it's one of this best films in years.","user":"bcbell79","rank":[25,39]}]
