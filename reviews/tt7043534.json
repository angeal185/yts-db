He is CIA working in South East Asia going after organ traffickers. When a member of his crew is killed (Seagal didn't take the shot) the CIA breaks up the group and wants to reassign them. Instead, a bunch of them resign and form their own private group to go after the bad guys.<br><br>This was bad, even by Seagal standards. Seagal has a bromance in real life with Putin. In this film, he spouts off about the government within the government (Deep State conspiracy theory) and that the CIA obstructs justice. His new group just so happens is armed with a bazooka, just in case the bad guys come at them with a military styled helicopter in downtown Manila. Segal had a fight scene with distorted moves. He doesn't do any high kicks but manages a knee to the groin. He b*tch slaps a guy and blood splatters out of his face. PLOT SPOILER- when he finally shoots him in the head, not only is there blood at the exit wound behind his head but a huge batch of blood where his back was located.<br><br>Casting call consisted of not being able to act better than Seagal to show him up. It was tough but they managed to get bad actors and write them horribly clich√© lines with an equally bad soundtrack. What was with the Spanish guitar background music for the Philippines?<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Pole dancer.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Another trash movie","rating":1,"date":"22 October 2019","review":"Worst movie of his entire career, since 2003., this guy has become a joke and transform himself into the cookie monster, he can t run, or fight, he should retire for good.
