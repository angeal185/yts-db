[{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"12 November 2018","review":"This was a terrible waste of my sunday evening. I couldn't even finish this movie. The acting is terrible. The movie is boring and uneventful. I would never recommend this movie.","user":"colsbo","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Fun Watch!","rating":5,"date":"4 January 2019","review":"This is a really solid and an entertaining watch, especially if you love combat/action like myself.<br><br>I throughly loved how the meat of action and plot happened in one location. It allows for the story to be simple, honest and unique.<br><br>Bonus points for Kevin Nash (I grew up watching and being a fan of WCW/WWE so it was pretty dope to see him in it #WolfPack).<br><br>Again, solid work and a fun watch, check it out ðŸ’¯","user":"frankoakleythethird","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Trash","rating":1,"date":"11 November 2018","review":"This is the worst written move I have ever seen. Don't waste your money or time to watch it. I spent $ 1.79 I should have just thrown it in the trash.","user":"wallaceroger","rank":[5,8]}]
