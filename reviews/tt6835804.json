Have plenty of cliches and try to focus on the ingenuity and warmth of the Â´60s to tell the story. Do not know if it can work on other scenario.\nThe story let you a bit in sadness; you know what the plot shows occurs a plenty in real life; I mean, for a reason or other sometimes you cannot bring or tell what is inside you and the relations just pass or you let it go and the Life continues...\nThe actors seem that they can play the instruments but the acting is not spot on. The girl is more convincing than her partners.\nThe movie is not a 10 points movie like the other commentators have been noting.\nI checked what they watch and they never watched a Cinema film so they observations are from a sided point of view.","user":"Hombredelfuturo","rank":[0,0]}]
