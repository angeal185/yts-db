[{"title":"Mediocre at best","rating":1,"date":"19 January 2019","review":"The life of Rodrigo Bueno, while not precisely special, was at least interesting. This movie is neither. It feels cheap, rushed and more like a sunday soap opera. There is no depth in the characters, many important aspects of his psychological makeup are ignored and the end result is just a wikipedia article turned into images. All acting is mediocre and there was no effort made to depict the sweat, the noise, the passion and the voracious crowd at every live presentation. Not a good tribute to \"el\nPotro\".","user":"darkhorizon72","rank":[4,9]},{"title":"Good movie","rating":7,"date":"5 January 2019","review":"Good movie, to see the biography of Rodrigo, \"el potro cordobes\". Talk about the history of this artist, where you can see how he became famous. Greetings.","user":"maxser-47139","rank":[4,13]}]
