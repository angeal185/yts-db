[{"title":"There isn't any island...","rating":3,"date":"3 August 2003","review":"A long time ago on now 'pay-only' forums, I used to discuss  animation...I don't recall discussing plague dogs (though Watership  Down was discussed at length), though now having seen the film a few  times, I realize that this is in so many ways a theoretical example of  what animation could be. Had I not actually seen Plague Dogs, I would  have gathered no film like this actually existed. Perhaps it's  something like the researchers who first discovered the naked mole rat,  finding something that in all probability shouldn't exist, but  seems--at least theoretically--possible.   Plague Dogs is an animated film simply telling a great story without a  single limitation placed upon it because it belongs to a genre. For  this very reason, it has never been reissued in the US so if you want  to see it, it might be worthwhile investing in a region free VCR that  plays PAL.  I've never read the book, but the film takes a stance that would be  difficult were it done as an animated film, live action or any other  possible way. In the end, I'm not sure it matters whether it is about  animals or not. Hope persists in bleakness, memories (love and loyalty)  outweigh the present, and innocence is shattered by a world more bitter  than a dozen R rated movies. Dumbo perhaps perceived the world given to  us in Plague Dogs, but finds an all too easy solution. Plague Dogs has  no solution other than to live...even in death.   The balance between the two strong dog personalities is perfect. Rowf  is both a hardened cynic, yet his spirit and willingness to fight  carries the film. Snitter, who strangely leads the duo, is idealistic,  yet emotionally and psychologically crippled. But strangely, I'm  reminded of Aldous Huxley who once said that in a world of insanity,  perhaps those who are crazy are the most sane. Snitter's remarks,  though clearly irrational often feel more right than the actual choices  left to the poor dogs. When Snitter settles in his old home next to the  fire (all an illusion), one really wishes he could stay there.  These delusional episodes are often aimed right at the heart. Snitter  is an immediately sympathetic character who makes his point from the  beginning of the film: to find a new master. Snitter knows his persuers  are not masters, he in fact defends masters to the very end. It is a  crippling blow to anyone who's loved an animal, has children, or had  any other responsibility to the innocent. There's no one there to tell  Snitter that masters and man are the same. That those who hunt him  would probably just as readily give him a home. It's fate that's put  him on this road and there's no way out.  As much as Watership Down is a good film, Plague Dogs is a great film.  A once in a decade film. Perhaps the only thing like it is Grave of  Fireflies. I can't think of a single western animated film that comes  close except perhaps those early wild wanderings by Walt when he still  believed that 'love is a song that never ends' and that animation could  be a medium for everyone. Haha! Like that once, now abandoned hope,  snitter's last line cries out 'there isn't any island!' Plague Dogs is  just that fleeting hope, now crushed, never to be repeated in cinema.  Miyazaki may perhaps give animation a grand treatment that is well  deserved, yet even Mononoke is not so brave as to do what Plague Dogs  did. A Wonderful yet tragic film for so many reasons.","user":"Snufkin","rank":[77,80]},{"title":"Tragic","rating":10,"date":"17 November 2004","review":"Martin Rosen's second animated film is a powerful piece, which is based on Richard Adams novel of the same name. The Plague Dogs is a very rare example of a film in the animation genre which strives for realism in the grittiest of senses. As far away from fluffy Disney films as one could imagine, this is a disturbing account of the hardships of two dogs who escape from an animal testing lab. The perceived haven of the real world soon turns out to be anything like Rowf and Snitter had hoped. However the friendship that is built through out the film between the two dogs and a rogue fox whom they meet, is touching and at times heartbreaking. To delve much further into the story would be to spoil certain aspects of the film, so that shall be left down to the viewer to discover.<br><br>Suffice to say, the main strength of Plague Dogs is paradoxically the reason the film has found itself in obscurity. To this date the original, 'uncut', version has not been released on any small screen formats (not to my knowledge at least). This strength is the bravery with which Rosen tackles the story. Resulting from this is a down beat film that isn't suitable for, nor is it likely to interest most, children. This is more than likely the reason it never found the success of Rosen's previous feature, Watership Down. <br><br>In short, this film deserves to be released in its full splendor and embraced by a whole new generation of film lovers. Anyone with a heart that isn't made of stone will get the appeal of this wonderful film.","user":"the_naked_airplane","rank":[63,66]},{"title":"I hugged my puppy","rating":10,"date":"13 April 2005","review":"A perfect film. Strong characters, wonderful animation; a rarity. It manages to be real; it actually CAPTURES the totality of its components without catering to any audience. <br><br>It's a difficult film to watch. You suffer alongside, vicariously. The hardships portrayed here are viciously painful. You'll hug your pets tight and be glad they wound up as your pets.<br><br>This movie is very special - considering the content, it could have easily been pandering and preachy. It manages to go so far beyond anything you've ever experienced. It's quite an achievement on every level.<br><br>It won't leave you happy, but it will affect you permanently. It is emotional, but never manipulative. It's a tragic and unrecognized masterpiece.","user":"fox_tabatha","rank":[74,79]}]
