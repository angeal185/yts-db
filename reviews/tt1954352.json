[{"title":"More then Lacrosse!","rating":10,"date":"21 May 2012","review":"I seen this film described as a, \"David vs Goliath\" event; Small team vs Big team = Small team wins! That's it in a nutshell, but It's so much more then that! Sure lacrosse is in our blood and our families played for centuries - and that alone is enough to bring tears to peoples eyes when they watch this on the big screen - but the imagery and language of our people in a medium that will touch so much people - makes me proud!<br><br>This new awareness of haudenosaunee people in popular media is way past due! When's the last time you seen a native even in a sitcom let alone a Haudenosaunee? You may know about the Cree, Navajo, Seminole, Cherokee, and Apache, but how many people know about the Haudenosaunee (a.k.a. Iroquois) league of nations? I love how this film incorporates subtle facts about the Haudenosaunee and doesn't miss expressing our sovereignty!<br><br>For those of you who play lacrosse and especially the younger ones getting into the game - this movie is for you! Your eyes might tear up and you may get so excited you want to cheer along - but you'll walk out of the theater more knowledgeable and more importantly - INSPIRED!!<br><br>Ni√°:wen / Thank you to the actors, production team, and everyone involved - what a great experience!","user":"knobsworth","rank":[32,39]},{"title":"Great heart warming movie about family, community, relationships, history and sports.","rating":10,"date":"3 June 2012","review":"My husband, my cousin and I really loved this movie. Being native we especially enjoyed the cultural aspects that we know so well. The music was very familiar to us. We are happy that all people will have a chance to enjoy the wonderful story, fabulous acting, and beautiful scenery. This is definitely a feel good movie for all. I am looking forward to buying it when it comes out on DVD. I would show it to my class. There are so many things that they could learn from this movie. I am also sure that my students and all movie goers can relate to the relationships and other aspects of the story. I hope everyone goes to see this movie. There is something for everyone to enjoy. Enjoy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","user":"trtn-387-854440","rank":[26,32]},{"title":"It Follows \"The Formula\" ...BUT","rating":10,"date":"12 October 2012","review":"\"Crooked Arrows\" is one of those movies that even if you know almost nothing about the sport of Lacrosse you get involved in the game so much so that you might just find yourself yelling at the screen and that is part of \"The Formula\" that works so very well for movies about sports.<br><br>BUT <br><br>If you start watching this movie thinking that \"The Formula\" is all there is to it, get prepared for a BIG Wake-up call.<br><br>This movie has managed to twist Native culture, Traditions, History and even Language all together so expertly that you are not only being entertained but being educated at the same time.<br><br>Saying that this movie is an emotional roller coaster would be akin to saying that Tecumseh was a great warrior. Both are major understatements.<br><br>I'm not going to give anything away here because I really believe that potential viewers should just watch and ENJOY this movie from start to finish without knowing more than what is in the synopsis.<br><br>Probably the biggest compliment I can pay the movie is by saying, \"I'm Dave Furlotte and I'm a Crooked Arrow.\"","user":"davidfurlotte","rank":[14,18]}]
