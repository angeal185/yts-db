[{"title":"Another Movie to add to the Pile of Movies I Love that Everyone Hates","rating":8,"date":"8 September 2016","review":"Louis Drax is an accident-prone nine year old. Having endured eight near-death accidents throughout his life, according to cat years, he would be on his last and is fully aware that he may never grow up before his time comes to an end. With this knowledge and history behind him, he finds himself in a coma after falling off the edge of a cliff, and the circumstances of which are left a vague mystery to be uncovered, including the related disappearance of his father. Was it an accident? Or was it something more? Amidst all this, his doctor becomes entranced with his mother, despite mysterious warnings to the contrary, and he finds himself in an unconscious journey of discovery with a creepy creature.<br><br>Tonally the movie is all over the place, which can make it feel a little uneven, but at the same time I felt it kind of worked. The movie opens with a montage of Louis' life told from a black comedy angle. Obviously what happens to him isn't exactly nice, but it's played for laughs. If you don't like black comedy, this opening sequence will turn you off immediately. This soon gives way to melancholy when the tragedy unfolds, which is about as much of a stark contrast as you can get. There's also some freakier moments revolving around the creature, a typically romantic tone between Pascal and Natalie, and in it's penultimate moments it shifts more into thriller territory. However, I never felt this was jarring at all. Every shift in tone suited the scenes perfectly, and evolved organically from one to the other.<br><br>It's central driving force is the mystery surrounding the circumstances of his fall, which inevitably culminates in a twist or two as the movie's finale approaches. The big twist isn't so much of a twist as it is a slow evolution over the course of the movie. It's not just signposted, it's actively developed as we go along and learn more and more about the characters and their own stories. The way this all comes to light can be a little hard to swallow, and doesn't take the time to explain itself, namely telepathy and the ability to talk to the dead. This is where the more fantastical elements of the movie come to the forefront, but due to the various shifts in tones, I didn't find this too much of a leap. It was obviously not attempting to be even remotely realistic. I just wish they gave some kind of explanation for it rather than just briskly moving on. There is another minor twist as well though, and I'll confess that did throw me for a loop, but I won't spoil that.<br><br>Aiden Longworth, Jamie Dornan, and Sarah Gadon do really well in their major roles, without particularly breaking any new ground. Dornan in particular seems a bit bland in most of his appearances, but I'm not sure whether that's down to him or what he was given to work with. It wasn't too much of a distraction either way. However the real stars are some of the more supporting actors. Oliver Platt and Barbara Hershey really tear up their limited screen time as Dr. Perez and Louis' grandmother respectively. And of course Aaron Paul does what he does best. The chemistry he shares with Longworth goes a long way to developing their father-son relationship and leads to one of the movie's most heartbreaking scenes. Again though, I couldn't shake the feeling that Paul was cast for his ability to cry on demand. I'm not saying it's a bad thing; I love seeing Aaron Paul cry in movies, as he's always so genuine with it, but I fear he's getting a little typecast and may be relying on it too much (not in this movie, just in general).<br><br>The big thing that drew me to the movie in the first place though was the visual quality, and while it's not quite as I expected, I can't say that I'm disappointed. Almost the entire movie is bathed in a dreamy glow, both the moments in dream or flashback, and the current events. It generally gave a very ethereal quality to everything. There was some differentiation between dreams/flashbacks and real life though and that was largely thanks to the colour pallet, particularly early on. Louis' happier moments are awash with golds and reds and other warm colours, while the more melancholic present day scenes had a cold, blue hue. The scenes with the creature also seemed to have a subtle hint of green to them as well.<br><br>Louis Drax is certain to be another one of those movies I put on the pile of 'movies I love that everyone else hates', but I don't care. It's story is intriguing with interesting developments as it goes along, despite it's missteps and shifts in tone, the character work is a good attempt even if it doesn't always land the mark, and it's visual appearance is a feast for the eyes even if it isn't particularly innovative or creative. I give Louis Drax a very good 8/10, but also acknowledge it's not a movie that will suit everyone's tastes. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I was also open to and prepared for something a bit off-the-wall.","user":"PyroSikTh","rank":[66,87]},{"title":"A unique, interesting and subversive amalgamation of genres that suffers from some narrative issues and tonal fluctuations.","rating":7,"date":"7 September 2016","review":"'The 9th Life Of Louis Drax' is the latest film directed by Alexandre Aja, who is most known for his 'The Hills Have Eyes' remake and the recent Daniel Radcliffe vehicle 'Horns'. This movie is fairly hard to describe, as it is a mixture of several genres that features a few twists and turns that I don't want to spoil. The basics of the plot revolves around the eponymous Louis Drax, a nine year-old boy who suffers a near-fatal fall and is left in a coma, and the doctor assigned to his case. I really liked it, despite the fact that it is flawed and by no means perfect, so I can't understand the relatively negative critical reception; I found it to be unique, subversive, interesting and emotionally-powerful.<br><br>The flick does wildly fluctuate in tone throughout its run-time, a flaw which does lend it some unpredictability and therefore can sometimes work to its advantage. One moment it is light and comedic, the next it is dark and gloomy; it is at times a comedy, a quirky indie-film, a family drama, a surrealist fantasy, a mystery 'whodunit', a more traditional horror and a psychological thriller. I found this amalgamation of genres to be intriguing, as I was never quite sure where the story was going to go. I also mostly appreciated the tonal shifts which, aside from sometimes feeling clumsy and out-of-place, made for a subversive yet cohesive piece that was much more unique than it may first have seemed. What doesn't work to the film's advantage however, is its constant changes in perspective. These were often jarring and felt undisciplined; it is hard to determine who the protagonist is, Louis Drax or Doctor Pascal. The fact that the story flipped between their two perspectives is fine, but the execution is fumbling and chaotic at best – the two aren't split equally, and thus it begins to seem out-of-place when the swap happens. In the same vein, some of the surreal elements bleed a little too closely into the portrayed reality – it is sometimes unclear what is fantastical and what is real. This is isn't a huge issue, and it often works to the flick's advantage, but can feel inconsistent in its portrayal and almost 'cheats' the audience at points.<br><br>The final act relies on a central conceit that requires quite a big leap in logic, leading to an aftertaste of mild confusion. I understand where they were coming from, a number of little details earlier in the picture attempted to establish it, but it isn't set up properly and becomes a little unbelievable. In the moment it works though and I thought it was a nice way of cleaning things up, I just wish they had planted the seed for it better so that it is easier to get on-board with. The actual conclusion feels a little flat in places, too, with some specific revelations not having the impact they should; these plot-lines could've done with a little extra moment to compound and punctuate them properly. Other than those issues, I found all of the twists and turns to work well; some of them were more expected than others, but all of them felt plausible and earned. The film does a good job of making sense to both a first and second time viewer, with scenes showing just enough to perpetuate the 'red herrings' the first time but still remain competent the second once the whole picture has been revealed. By the time the final act rolled around, I'll admit I was gripped and on the edge of my seat – I truly wanted to know what was going to happen. When the revelations are made, I thought that they were mostly satisfying and appropriately surprising – aside from the couple of issues with the consequences not being 'driven home' fully.<br><br>The performances are all good, though Jamie Dornan's character can sometimes be quite boring and is played very by-the-numbers. Oliver Platt, Sarah Gadon and Aiden Longworth are all notably great too, while Aaron Paul is downright fantastic in a complex role. A scene towards the end of the flick nearly brought me to tears, it was incredibly emotional and helped by Paul's perfect performance. It really affected me, more so than expected, and I cannot give the movie enough praise for tugging at my heart-strings – a rare feat for a film. The writing is mostly decent, though there are some obviously bad lines – both in their construction, repetition and generic nature – as well as the occasional exposition dump and leap in logic. The direction was superb, a number of unique shots helped to add to the flick's quirky nature. The feature is framed cleanly, the edits are smooth and the blocking varies healthily. The fantastical elements are handled very well, with practical and digital effects being used in tandem, and the pacing was pretty taut– though it feels a little longer than it should on the whole.<br><br>Overall, I think 'The 9th Life Of Louis Drax' is an entertaining and well-made film. It's subversive, surprising, engaging, interesting, emotionally-powerful, unique and fun; it also has some great performances. It does suffer from occasional tonal and structural issues, narrative leaps in logic and some weak writing, but I still liked the feature despite the fact that it is far from perfect: 7/10","user":"Pjtaylor-96-138044","rank":[45,64]},{"title":"Not that bad","rating":8,"date":"22 May 2017","review":"I was not expecting to like this film, but it wasn't actually that bad.
