[{"title":"Gets better with time","rating":7,"date":"15 April 2008","review":"First of all - this is not a meaningful movie. But it wasn't meant to be. I hate it when I hear critics slam a movie mainly because it doesn't fit into their favorite \"Type\" of movie. Some movies are made to sit through wincing - leaving you sore emotionally and some are light silly goofball creations that wont change the world, but sure are nice to just zone out with. <br><br>This movie will never turn Roger Ebert's crank...its silly and goofy and irrelevant....Its also over time revealing itself to have been at the time...subversive. This movie has a lot of little things about it that are becoming more relevant as the years wear on... <br><br>When this first came out I thought \"An alright movie with catchy songs\" This was before I myself got involved in the Music industry. After living through three bands and two contracts over ten years I would like to say this movie isn't as unrealistic as you may think. It is still a spoof, but close enough to reality to warrant another look. Originally waved away as being pure fluff I now find this movie creepily prophetic. <br><br>Since this movie was made we have witnessed the fall out of bands like Back street boys the breakdown of pop-stars like Brittany Spears and a slew of young actors &amp; actresses separated from family &amp; friends whose entire personalities have been written and designed by stylists and are seen battling like some weird \"Fashionista\" roman gladiators under the tutelage of sycophants and managers.<br><br>Media/pop culture, with its out of control emphasis on looks and weight over talent and personality, have resulted in actual government legislation regarding model weights and rampant anorexia amongst young starlets. <br><br>Musically there has been a huge increase in management interference (listen to Pink's first album regarding the pressures placed on a young singer to conform to a label's Vision) dictating how the artists shall look and act. If it hadn't been for the internet download revolution of Lime wire and such I think the Music industry would have happily continued to control what consumers were ALLOWED to buy and ALLOWED to see...<br><br>This movie was also made prior to the outing of \"gay\" boy band members Stephen Gately, Lance Bassit, Jordan Knight but the top selling song for the Boy Band \"Du Jour\" in this movie is the most homo-suggestive song I've ever heard. (Is it really called \"In Through Your Back Door\"?)<br><br>After all this fallout, the world of Josie &amp; the Pussycats seems much less stupid to me.<br><br>Again...Not deep, but possibly prophetic...and fun to watch Just don't expect to feel moved. Its popcorn at its best - light and salty, not really a meal...its a snack and as that type of movie...shouldn't't be judged solely for its nutritional value... I'd rate it a 7","user":"tea-16","rank":[30,33]},{"title":"Guilty Pleasure","rating":12,"date":"12 April 2001","review":"Do not go to this movie expecting anything that's logical or realistic. It is a purely fun film with a rocking soundtrack.<br><br>Viewers who would most appreciate this would be the ones who have at least a vague memory of the television cartoon series because there are a lot of jokes and references that might go over one's head otherwise--not to say that kids wouldn't enjoy it as well, because they will.<br><br>There's a lot going on in this film.  So much happens so fast, but that is intentional.  It is highly visual, and the style almost seems like a cross between Steven Soderbergh and Tim Burton, of course with a lot more pink and glitter.  The images literally pop out at you at times.  And while the plot is somewhat contrived, you might not mind too much because it speaks so clearly to our current culture.<br><br>The parody of Boy Bands and Pop-Star Girls is dead-on and that's why this is such a guilty pleasure.  You can appreciate how they are made fun of and enjoy the characterizations at the same time.  And all the performances are first rate--from the cameo performances by Breckin Myer and Seth Green as members of the Boy Band \"Dujour\", to leads Rachel Leigh Cook and Tara Reid as Josie and Melody, to the supporting players, particularly Alan Cumming and Parker Posey as the record executives.  Also look for cameos by Carson Daly and Ken \"Babyface\" Edmonds.<br><br>Rosario Dawson as Valerie makes quite an impression.  Her strong but anxious portrayal helps set up the classic conflict of female friendship vs. \"diva-like\" fame--a conflict we've seen played out over and over again in many VH-1 \"Behind the Music\" episodes.<br><br>All in all, this is a film you'll enjoy upon first viewing and maybe even more with repeated viewings.  If anything, you'll be dancing out of the aisles as you head home.","user":"mazdp","rank":[33,41]},{"title":"Movie has a bold message, executed with brilliant humor","rating":10,"date":"30 March 2005","review":"This is a movie that satirizes today's pop culture, and does a brilliant job of it. The cast and musical score are excellent and all of its jokes are funny and well placed. People say that the movie becomes what it is making fun of. Well, isn't that the idea? The movie is packed with about a billion logos appearing everywhere you look in the background, and a scene with an audience of cardboard cut-out celebrities. These are there to add to the atmosphere of the film. This movie is very strong, very well done, and has a real sense of humor. To top it off, it's led by a band with music that's so good you can't even tell they're not real. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. I'd recommend buying the soundtrack as well.","user":"tmillen04","rank":[59,80]}]
