[{"title":"Well-crafted, suspenseful movie with fine acting","rating":8,"date":"3 August 2000","review":"This movie was a well-crafted thriller in the Hitchcock style; I really wish I had not seen any of the trailers prior to viewing this movie, because some of the suspense that would normally have built up during the first hour was spoiled by knowledge gained from the trailer.  To be fair, the trailer doesn't spoil everything (thank goodness), but it spoils enough to make the first hour seem a little slow in the build-up.<br><br>Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific in her role of the housewife and mother now facing an empty nest, as her daughter heads off to college.  Robert Zemeckis does a fine job of building suspense and keeping the audience just a little off-balance (in spite of the spoilers in the trailers); in combination with Pfeiffer's acting, one is never quite sure whether Claire Spencer is deranged, possessed, or calculating.  While Harrison Ford does his usual fine job of acting, as the obsessive, genius husband living in the shadow of his super-genius father, it is Pfeiffer who, of the two, has the most screen time and who therefore carries the film.<br><br>My only other complaint (besides the spoilers in the trailers) has to do with a minor bit of casting. While I think Wendy Crewson is a fine actress, I have to question casting her as the wife of one of Dr. Spencer's colleagues, given that she so recently appeared as Harrison Ford's wife in Air Force One... seeing Ford and Crewson together on screen again was a distraction that brought me out of the film, at a point when I should have been getting more absorbed into the film.  But it is a minor point.<br><br>Overall, the movie kept me in suspense virtually throughout it's entirety, and the final 30 minutes were gripping.  At several points toward the end, I thought for sure I knew what was going to happen, only to be surprised by a sudden twist or unexpected turn.  And, the film does have its humorous moments as well; Diane Scarwid helps to lighten things up as Claire's somewhat ditzy friend Jody, and Zemeckis has some fun with some of the backdrops in the quaint New England towns (a Vermont town named Adamant? And the name of the curio shop is \"The Sleeping Dog\", as in \"Let sleeping dogs lie.\")<br><br>Rating: 8 out of 10","user":"doug_burton","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Scary, spooky, in a way that reminds me of days gone by.","rating":7,"date":"2 August 2000","review":"Oh man!! What a fun movie! Without giving too much away, it's a ghost movie. The plot wasn't anything to write home about, it's been done about 100 times before, but it was just done better than it has been in recent memory. Seems that movies try to over-do everything lately with special effects, gore, music and violence. Not here... I kept thinking that they had taken a step back and returned to what makes movies spooky. It's not a computer generated demon, or a high intensity soundtrack; it's a creaky door, it's a reflection in the glass, it's that feeling when you know you just pushed that chair in a minute ago and now it's away from the table again. That's what makes people uneasy, that's what makes them check their closets and sleep with the hall light on when they go home.<br><br>The most notable difference in the movie was the silence. I'd guess that about 50% of the movie was completely silent except for breathing, footsteps, creaking doors... wonderful. Seems that lately the powers-that-be just have to fit every second of the soundtrack into the movie (seems they should since now-a-days there's commercials for the soundtrack separate from the movie in many cases) in order to boost the spooky level... it rarely works. The silence in the movie just added to that tension in your shoulders and made you slowly edge up on your seat.<br><br>If I had to pick anything to complain about, it'd be the weak foreshadowing of two events, I don't want to give anything away, but you'll know when you see it. It's like they gave up on trying to write them into the plot. They may as well have put a subtitle on the screen (or a \"Pop Up Video\" bubble) that told you that what they were saying was important. For my wife and I, it gave a bit away about how the movie was likely to end.<br><br>Michelle Pfeiffer was really good, I'd guess she was in almost every single shot in the film, so anything but a great performance would have shown. I'm not normally one to judge actors performances, but there's some credit to be given to someone who can act that scared using only her eyes. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets a nod at the academy for this one.","user":"bob.lindell","rank":[109,129]},{"title":"A classic thriller","rating":25,"date":"25 June 2001","review":"Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star in this chilling film full of twists, suspense and deceit. Directed by award-winning Robert Zemeckis, What Lies Beneath tells the terrifying story of a husband's dreadful secret that should have remained in the past.<br><br>Set in a modern day country town, during autumn, sets the very eerie scene for where the apparently, happily married couple Claire Spencer (Pfeiffer) and Norman Spencer (Ford) encounter paranormal illusions and the truth about Norman's affair with a younger woman whom he murdered.<br><br>Zemeckis has done very well in making the movie a classic thriller, as well as keeping the audience in suspense. He has done this with the use of the very many clich√©s of a thriller. He heightens the tensions throughout the movie by gradually lowering the camera, creating a very claustrophobic atmosphere which works in harmony with the terrifying, jumpy music.<br><br>The acting in the movie is of the highest quality and Pfeiffer is admired for her superb performance, which creates a strong sense of vulnerability to the role and entices the audience. The casting of Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford as a married couple is very convincing and genuinely believable.<br><br>What Lies Beneath is a very frightening and scary movie with all the traits of a classic thriller. With the excellent casting of Pfeiffer and Ford, along with Zemeckis's excellent techniques of terrifying the audience, it is truly a great film.","user":"thomsoj9","rank":[27,30]}]
