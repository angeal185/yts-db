[{"title":"A decent horror movie","rating":6,"date":"3 March 2019","review":"This horror movie is set in Indonesia and has both English and Indonesian dialogue, with subtitles where needed.\nIt's no better or worst than most other movies of this genre. In fact in my opinion probably a bit better than most.\nThe worst criticism I can give it, is that the women and girls in it wear the daggiest clothes out, even Kelly Brook.\nBut it will keep you entertained with the normal scares and suspense.","user":"tonymarchei","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Amber Alert","rating":3,"date":"14 February 2019","review":"The film takes place in Indonesia. Randy's parents swan dive off of balconies as if they ate a lot of the brown acid. Odd things happen to the family as they see things and appear in danger. Mom (Kelly Brock) plays Nancy Drew to discover what her husband won't tell her...it is Santet, black magic.<br><br>The acting was rather bad, especially the shouting matches between the parents. Horror consisted of a woman with dark circles under their eyes attack people. The license plate they showed us for a second as if significant: B 1421 IN.\nBe one. For to win? Is this some sort of Indonesian Free Mason thing like \"2B1ASK1.\"<br><br>Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity. So why is Kelly Brook in this again? She doesn't even pretend like she is going to shower.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Don't waste your time on this one.","rating":3,"date":"16 February 2019","review":"Well I guess I have the honor to write the first review for this movie. Not that there is much to write about it, or at least nothing positive. I got drawn to watch this movie by the poster, that looked a bit creepy. Santet (or Black Magic) starts with the statement that it is based on a true story. After watching it I can already tell you this is a complete lie. The story could have been something if you replace all the actors by others as the acting was just terrible. Not only from Kelly Brook but also from the rest of the cast. You constantly have the feeling they took some random people from the streets to come play in a movie, it's just awful. Kelly Brook can't act, that's just a fact. The sound editor should also look for another job. The only thing that can pass for something else than mediocre is the evil spirit. All the rest is just garbage.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[4,8]}]
