[{"title":"Bad remake of Hand that rocks the cradle","rating":2,"date":"2 August 2019","review":"The story line is dumb from the beginning.\nYouve loss two babies in the past. You meet a woman in a parking lot and invite her to lunch that same day, then you invite her to move in w you and be your midwife?.....No background check, no credentials, nothing? And we're supposed to believe you're a lawyer?<br><br>Sara is cautious enough not to be on social media, but overshares with a stranger and takes provocative selfies with this woman you hardly know? Why is she so trusting?<br><br>And they never shut the Midwife down when she starts asking too much. I just dont get it.","user":"andreatodman","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Slightly annoying dialog","rating":4,"date":"3 September 2019","review":"A woman invites a midwife to stay with her to help her with a natural birth. Who has a home birth anyway? If you get over this, there is an average Lifetime movie with a midwife as the wacko.<br><br>Faults: The dialogue sounds bimboish sometimes.<br><br>Not a must watch for sure.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Don't do it!","rating":1,"date":"17 February 2019","review":"You will be extremely upset with yourself if you waste your time watching this movie. The plot is ridiculous...IE: would you trust a total stranger to deliver your baby in your home, by choice and after having had 2 prior miscarriages? Well if your answer is yes, then you should watch it. LOL It's basically a VERY BAD rehashed version of \"the Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" ...VERY BAD!","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[3,4]}]
