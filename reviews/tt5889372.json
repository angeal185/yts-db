Great movie for family movie night!","user":"caleighfchilders","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Good for a kids movie üëç","rating":8,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"PBS Kids is one of the few show providers that I trust when it comes to children's content. This movie was great from my six year old's perspective, and I enjoyed it too.\nThe Odd Squad uses math and science to help solve problems, with their usual dose of silliness, and some bonus bigger name adult tv stars in this movie.\nThis movie wasn't made for adults, and that shows, but I don't think that is a bad thing. My kids enjoyed it, there was nothing bad in it, and it had a happy ending.","user":"jamdesk","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Terrible animations, teaches kids bad habits, and not very exciting","rating":1,"date":"2 August 2018","review":"First of all, I would like to say that this movie actually made me throw up. Either that or all of the honey i ate. Anyways, I really get angry because all of the girls look like guys and it's always really confusing. Secondly, due to the awful animations and child-like plotline, I can only assume this movie was made for children, but it teaches them bad habits, such as violence. At one point, one of the guys (whose name I don't know because I was drifting off to sleep 98% of the movie) hit a bumblebee... or bunny... or stuffed animal... or something, with a shield. After my son had finished watching this movie, he immediately went outside to brutally attack a bird in our backyard. How he caught the bird is beyond me, but this movie can do some real bad things to you and your children, so I wasn't too surprised. Finally, the animations are PURE TRASH. If you see the movie, prepare to not see anything remotely realistic. If you were to take away my eyesight, I could probably still understand as much as I saw, maybe more. I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone of any ages, as it is mind-meltingly dumb and confusing.\nThat is all.","user":"brianhuwel","rank":[1,35]}]
