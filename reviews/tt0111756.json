[{"title":"Very enjoyable film","rating":4,"date":"4 June 2004","review":"I've done extensive reading and research on Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and this era. With that as a start, let me continue.<br><br>The roles of Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan Earp were well-cast and portrayed. The actors bore reasonable physical resemblance to the real men. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday was superb; I thought his portrayal was more accurate than that of Val Kilmer in \"Tombstone\", his personality and his appearance.... although with friends, Doc Holliday was a pretty affable gentleman.<br><br>The story was a nice story, although there were significant problems with some of the historical accuracy. First, Morgan and Virgil were NOT shot on the same night... actually 3 months apart. Things like that bother me when seeing a supposedly historically accurate film. But what I considered the weakest part of this movie (and \"Tombstone\" as well) was the very incomplete and weak buildup to the gunfight. There was so much more that happened, so much that affected the relationship between the good guys and the bad, so much missing that both films almost made the fight look like a spur of the moment battle... which is far from factual. What many people don't realize is that Bat Masterson spent time in Tombstone during this era, although not directly involved in the \"action\"; also, Luke Short was a major ally of Wyatt's throughout this time.<br><br>I very much liked that Wyatt's young life was shown... his time as town constable, his marriage to Urilla Sutherland, her death and his resulting devastation, his pony stealing in Arkansas... all things that most folks never realized.<br><br>I would very much liked to have seen more of Wyatt's revenge ride and subsequent deaths and scattering of the Clanton gang. Also, the absence of any sequence involving the robbery of the Benson stage and the killing of Bud Philpot and Peter Roehrig is regrettable, as this was a major factor leading to the battle. Also, as a result of the stage robbery, we should have seen a sequence regarding Wyatt's agreement with Ike about turning in the robbers. Finally, how Behan backed out on his deal with Wyatt regarding the sheriff's office... a major factor in the animosity between the two men.<br><br>Yes... there are many other missing historical incidents that would have made the film more accurate and real.<br><br>Anyone who has an interest in this era should see the film. If you're not a stickler like I am for total historical accuracy, you should enjoy the film.","user":"DocHollidayIV","rank":[123,150]},{"title":"Kasdan's epic Western proved absorbing","rating":7,"date":"21 April 2006","review":"\"Law and Order\" (1932), a film starring Walter Huston and Harry Carey, had blazed the Earp screen trail with a brave version of the 0. K. Corral happenings, although the true-life characters were never named \"Frontier Marshal\" (1939) starring Randolph Scott and \"Wichita\" (1955) with Joel McCrea also told the story <br><br>To most modern cinema-goers, however, the Corral incident and the confused events and motivations which led to it have been best served by four films, John Ford's \"My Darling Clementine\" (1946), John Sturges' \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,\" (1957), Sturges' \"Hour of the Gun\" (1967), and George P. Cosmatos' \"Tombstone\" (1993). But the question has yet to be solved: should the American West be depicted on the screen as it actually was, or should it continue to be a form of mythology? <br><br>Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorful Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each other<br><br>In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gambler Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignity Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealist Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosis<br><br>In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchief He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best moments His character has his own form of ability Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosis Kilmer, in \"Tombstone,\" never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degree <br><br>Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need arise The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurys The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the Corral<br><br>Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film \"Tombstone\" does not even touch While \"Tombstone\" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's \"Wyatt Earp\" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyondThe film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old age <br><br>The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well told But we always remember Ford's \"My Darling Clementine\" for its other qualitiesfor the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the way This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magic<br><br>\"My Daring Clementine\" was a film of touchesFonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors dance<br><br>Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriage Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous \"Westerners\" of all time...","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[46,54]},{"title":"Overly long and deliberate but a fine story","rating":21,"date":"21 December 2003","review":"Wyatt grows up a young man who loves the law.  When his wife dies early in their marriage he goes off the rails and becomes a drunk and a thief. When he is offered a chance at redemption he takes it and becomes a deputy. His legend spreads and he is offered the chance to be the deputy for Dodge City. He has great success but is removed from the job for being too brutal. When his replacement is killed as the law falls away in Dodge, Wyatt returns before moving on to Tombstone but finds his initial run-in with the Clantonhas left harbouring resentments.<br><br>When I saw this in the cinema, it was hassled by the fact that another, more multiplex-friendly version of the story had just been released shortly before.  Viewed separately years later it fares better without the comparison to Tombstone, which is, in fairness, more of a fun bang-bang affair, although now it struggles because Costner's reputation is not even at the level it was when this film was released.  The plot is good and is supposedly a true telling of the legend, although the film is careful to pepper the running time with hints that stories get changed with the telling.<br><br>The very honest and respectful telling of the story means that it gets told in a very deliberate and careful manner.  This means on one hand that we get a good picture over Wyatt's life as opposed to the events in Tombstone, however it also means that the film itself is a little dull and overlong. It is overly deliberate and doesn't flow as well as it should - flowing more like syrup than water at times.  Where some three-hour running times fly by, here it does feel like at least three hours - not always a good thing! The filling out of the characters doesn't always work either - I knew more about Wyatt but I didn't understand his character much more, also I was surprised that I was none the wiser about why he and Doc became friends considering how long was spent with them.  A big failing of the film is that it assumes the status of an epic rather than earning the status.  What I mean by this is that it tries too hard to be an epic - with constant sweeping music where it didn't need it.  I still thing the film has an epic sweep to it, but it didn't need the cinematic tricks to achieve it; in fact, it could have down played it and let the sweep of the film do it for itself.<br><br>The cast is pretty good and also pretty deep.  Costner may not be seen as a star anymore but that doesn't mean he can't act and can't hold the attention.  He is a reasonable Wyatt but he suffers from being too deliberate and too shut off at times. I understand he needed to do it for the character but it contributes to the film feeling slow.  The other brothers are played well by Madsen, Ashby and Andrews.  Maybe it is because of Costner's drab Wyatt, but Quaid really lightens things up as Doc Holliday.  His colourful character stands out easily against the old west types.  The support cast is deep and includes faces such as Hackman, Fahey, Harmon, Pullman, Sizemore, Rossellini, Williams and O'Hara.<br><br>Overall this is a film that requires patience - if you prefer your films to contain action more than story then Tombstone may be more for you - but, for all it's failings, this is still a solid western and a good telling of the legend with more emphasis on background than action and fluidity.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[42,49]}]
