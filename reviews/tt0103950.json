[{"title":"Totally ridiculous, totally entertaining!","rating":8,"date":"20 June 2001","review":"I think this was the first \"true\" Jackie Chan movie I've seen...I was blown away by the stunts and fighting, but wow, this is ridiculous!  I love it!!!! It's very bizarre, and really colorful.  More or less, it's \"Under Siege,\" but with Wong Jing's typical \"anything goes\" goofiness!  A lot of people I know hate this, but I absolute adore this live-action cartoon...I guess you just have to be of a certain type to enjoy it...and oh yeh, it has the finest selection of great-looking women I've ever seen in one film!","user":"rutt13-1","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Two thumbs up, and hunting you down in the city, like a City Hunter","rating":7,"date":"15 June 2008","review":"I like this film. I was already familiar with the City Hunter animé, which to be honest is even more risqué than this Wong Jing offering.<br><br>Jackie Chan is hilarious, but in a slightly different way to his usual comedy persona. You have to remember when you watch this film, that you're watching a live action cartoon. This will allow you to take this film with a pinch of salt, and in so-doing you will not take it too seriously.<br><br>There is plenty of action in this film, kung-fu included, mostly because Jackie Chan plays Ryu Saeba. The fighting is terrific, and once again hilarious, as you see big, mean baddies reduced to comical fighting roles, rather than the more serious bleeding, and sweating, then dying roles.<br><br>Chingmy Yau is in this film, looking gorgeous, as usual. She is given more license than most women in Wong Jing films to be independent, and not to be a hot idiot, but essentially, she remains a hot idiot.<br><br>I particularly enjoyed the nod to Bruce Lee in this film, when Chan is forced to fight two massive bad guys in a cinema.<br><br>Overall, this is a fun film. Chan fans will enjoy it. City Hunter fans will enjoy it. Wong Jing fans will enjoy it. Non-fans of the aforementioned may not enjoy it, and women's lib chicks will find it insulting and degrading to women, but to be honest, they need to get a life and get into the goddamn kitchen to make me something to eat!","user":"thomas-hardcastle-2","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Jackie Chan As A Comic-Strip Private Eye","rating":25,"date":"25 May 1999","review":"Jackie Chan plays a womanizing private eye known as City Hunter in this Wong Jing directed movie.  The movie is played for surreal laughs part of the time.  But with Wong Jing at the helm of this comic strip of a movie, that is no surprise.  When you watch this movie, you realize that Jackie Chan knows how to pick stories and direct himself better than anyone else.<br><br>I saw this movie on the Media Arts DVD released in April, 1999.  The Japanese manufactured DVD has subtitles in 8 languages, including English and Spanish.  The aspect ratio is 2.35 and the image quality is very fine.","user":"gerrytwo","rank":[9,10]}]
