[{"title":"Christopher Lee considers Jinnah his BEST work to date","rating":10,"date":"6 January 2003","review":"Best work under wraps - Christopher Lee <br><br>Christopher Lee may be starring in the forth-coming Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Star Wars: Episode II, but the lack of distribution for his 1998 film Jinnah continues to be a source of frustration for the actor.<br><br>\nLee who plays the title role of Mohammed Ali Jinnah  who founded the nation of Pakistan in 1947  shot the film on location there over a ten-week period in 1997 amid significant controversy (including attempts to have him arrested and deported). Since then, however, the film has never had a proper theatrical release and the ongoing potential for controversy could well be the reason. <br><br>At a special screening of Jinnah at the Barbican, Lee told Empire Online that he has been informed that distributors are afraid to show the film, fearing the possibility of terrorist repercussions from Muslim Fundamentalists. He was keen to point out, though, that this would be an unlikely reaction: <br><br>\"[Jinnah] is the antithesis of that. It is the story of a remarkable man: a husband, a father and a brother who founded a nation. It has absolutely nothing to do with Fundamentalism,\" said Lee, adding that the film was not a political movie and had\"played in Pakistan for a couple of months to packed houses and there was not one dissenting voice.\" <br><br>Lee did hit out at the portrayal of Jinnah in Richard Attenborough's Oscar-winning movie Gandhi, however, telling Empire Online: \"The presentation of him in the film Gandhi was on the level of distortion. It was wildly inaccurate.\" Despite his long career, which includes over 200 screen credits, Lee considers Jinnah to be his best work to date. <br><br>\"I'm very proud of this picture, and it should be shown,\" he said. \"It must be shown. But what can we do about people who, I'm told, are afraid to show it?\" <br><br>Source : Empire Online UK","user":"megacool","rank":[49,56]},{"title":"The man himself","rating":16,"date":"16 November 2004","review":"I tried to do as much research on the man, Mr. Ali jinnah, before i wrote this review. and even though i was not very well versed with the history of Pakistan, (in fact i wasn't even sure where Pakistan was exactly before seeing this movie), what i found was a series of reports by great biographers and historians, who have instead of being factual have decided to be emotional to the point of being ridiculously biased. i still, do not, know the reason why jinnah was hated by so many, because frankly no one seems to be able to prove a valid point, its all just bickering and bitterness. <br><br>However, i have gained respect for the man, in his unflinchingness, and \"man of steel\" attitude, a man who would bow to no one, and would never stoop below his standards and principles, if that made him cold and calculated, fine, at least he had fiber. Mountbatten is quoted as saying about Jinnah; \"...That son of a Bit--, could turn you to stone with one look...\" sounds like he was scared?<br><br>but its much easier to praise a movie like \"gandhi\" whose hero is such a simple case study, perfect in his nature and morals..etc etc... thats not a very hard case to sell, no wonder people liked it, it appealed to their sensibilities. Jinnah, may have been a man of steel, cold, unflinching, calculated, but how much do we really know of the man? we have on one hand reports by British journalists like Mr. Payne, whose \"eyewitness\" was just a bunch of idle thoughts and gut feelings with no real substance, but tainted by the inherent fear of the man (Jinnah), and on the other hand by embittered Indian writers who saw this man break up their country for an ideology they could never even hope to understand. <br><br>Jinnah was much deeper, i believe, a man who refused treatment for chronic tuberculosis, cause he believed that the Moslem's would never get their homeland, if he was viewed as weak, therefore he kept on going, steadfast, strong, like a locomotive, and in the end he died for it. No one knows the real Jinnah, but many have formed opinions based on 'stories' with no real truth behind them.<br><br>i read a excerpt from an article written by an Indian author, who wrote that in a rally held in 1930's, Jinnah was giving a speech in English and almost no one in the predominantly Hindi speaking crowd understood what he was saying, but when a British journalist queried a bystander on this he replied; \"Its Mohammed Ali Jinnah, we trust him, whatever he says is right\"<br><br>i don't think a man described in an unkind and biased history, as something close to Hitler, would command such respect and admiration from his people. He was, passionate, unflinching, upright, in short... a Great Man. <br><br>Matthew Davison New Jersey.","user":"matt-982","rank":[82,98]},{"title":"moving and informative","rating":9,"date":"12 June 2002","review":"While I can't comment on the absolute historical accuracy, this film certainly taught me a lot more about the founding of Pakistan and explained many things I had wondered about in the conflict. Christopher Lee's excellent performance goes a long way towards making Jinnah a sympathetic character despite the controversial decisions he takes; I would say that this is some of his finest acting and I found the final scenes very moving indeed.<br><br>The flashback technique works well most of the time, although it's not always clear where some scenes are set (England, India, Pakistan or the imagination). This device packs a lot more information into scenes between the characters than a more realistic timeline would and sets the questions of the founding of Pakistan in the context of ongoing conflicts rather than leaving it as historical curiosity. The cinematography is excellent and you wouldn't know this wasn't a Hollywood film except for the thought-provoking treatment and lack of easy answers. One to look out for.","user":"marypcb","rank":[41,47]}]
