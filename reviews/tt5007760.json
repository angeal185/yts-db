[{"title":"Really really bad in a cheesy way","rating":4,"date":"13 August 2019","review":"I have no idea why this movie got several really good reviews other than to think that they must have been written by friends of the filmmaker. This film is poorly written, there are a number of scenes where the camera is literally just following the main actor who is just a very ordinary guy and absolutely nothing to look. I don't know what all that set up was all about because there was just absolutely nothing in the way of a pay off, the story was lame, there was not much there and the ending was unsatisfying. I would not recommend this film.","user":"latinfineart","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"No Plot, No Story, Zero Suspense","rating":1,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"Ok, the actor playing the Private investigator is good, as is Sia. Unfortunately this matters not at all as the movie has no plot, no suspense, no story just dull scene after tiresome scene. Really, it's not that I did not take to the plot, THERE IS NO PLOT!!!!!","user":"binkywireless","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"One of the best Australian movies!","rating":10,"date":"2 July 2019","review":"Another amazing film created by the one and only Nathan Hill! Not only did I enjoy watching this film, but I enjoyed it more being a part of it! It's a great honor and I'm so thankful to be one of the actresses. To work with such a renowned Australian producer, director and fellow actor is a blessing. Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of this film! My family and friends love it too... the drama, suspense, thrill and excitement. It'll bring you to the edge of your seat, and the final scene will make you sweat. It's a must see!","user":"jessicajaneborg","rank":[6,9]}]
