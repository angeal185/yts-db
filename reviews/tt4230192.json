[{"title":"The Generators will be here tomorrow","rating":4,"date":"1 August 2017","review":"The film is introduced as if it is going to be a found footage film. It is not, just poorly framed and shot. A group of students from Miskatonic University (HP Lovecraft \"Re-animator\" fictional university) decide to film inside the haunted Goodwin house that had three \"witches\". PLOT SPOILER: Individuals become possessed for a short period and attack another in the group.<br><br>The film stars Madeleine Heil who will be appearing in \"Clowntergeist\" a film whose name I just love. I will give Madeleine credit, who poured her heart out into this film. Unfortunately the special effects didn't go beyond black and white film footage and contact lenses. The film attempted a few light moments that didn't work. The dialogue needed improvement and the off and on random possession didn't pan out. The film actually got more boring during the climax scenes when you realize, \"this is it.\" Guide: No sex or nudity. I don't recall any swearing","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Worst Director Ever","rating":1,"date":"8 February 2017","review":"The Plot.<br><br>A group of film students from Miskatonic University venture into an old Victorian house with a grisly past to shoot a last-minute thesis, but the discovery of a mysterious book called the Necronomicon brings production to a deadly halt when they awaken the spirits of three vengeful witches. <br><br>What a bunch of hooey.<br><br>How this clown got someone to give him money to direct this piece of garbage is beyond me. He's untalented.<br><br>The script is a total derivative rip off of every movie ever made in this genre.<br><br>The acting is below amateurish.<br><br>But the REAL problem is this horrible director. He really should be homeless living on the street. Please stop the madness and don't fund this clown. He has no talent.","user":"arfdawg-1","rank":[7,16]},{"title":"Not a Lovecraft film","rating":1,"date":"19 March 2018","review":"REEL NIGHTMARE: BOOK OF WITCHCRAFT is another dead-headed indie horror flick centred around the subject of witchcraft. For whatever reason, this is a film chock-full of Lovecraft references in terms of character and place names, but otherwise it has no connection to the Cthulhu Mythos (worse luck). It's a dreadfully bad film which looks much older than it really is and is routinely cheesy, dull, and badly acted. Just the usual, then.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[2,3]}]
