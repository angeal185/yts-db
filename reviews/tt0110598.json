[{"title":"Incredibly Moving Performance by Toni Collette","rating":10,"date":"13 June 2001","review":"Where do you go and to whom do you turn, when it's time to emerge from adolescence and get on with your life, but you find yourself incapacitated from having had your self esteem methodically peeled away year after miserable year by a brutal father who has convinced you that you're worth less than a piece of garbage a dog wouldn't touch?  That's the story of Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette), a young woman who, along with her brothers and sisters, has been mercilessly and ceaselessly denigrated and publicly humiliated by her father, Bill Heslop (Bill Hunter), seemingly since the day she was born, in `Muriel's Wedding,' directed by P.J. Hogan.  Bill Heslop is a local councilman in the less-than-thriving city of Porpoise Point, Australia.  In the eyes of those who don't know him, he's a great man, a hero even; and he's definitely a legend in his own mind.  But in his own home he doles out psychological abuse relentlessly-- and the sad thing is, he does it seemingly without realizing what he's doing.  Muriel, out of school, but so unsure of herself that she's unable to wrench herself free of the dominating Mr. Heslop, escapes into a world of ABBA songs and daydreams of her own wedding, which she perceives as being the ultimate reward-- the thing that will finally bring her happiness and give her life meaning.<br><br>Not surprisingly, Muriel has some problems to work out before she can even think of making a change that will turn her life around.  Her lack of self esteem has rendered her socially inept, overweight, slow witted and incapable of making a decision.  And as far as the wedding that will change everything-- well, Muriel has no boyfriend, never has had one, and there are certainly no prospects on the horizon.  Her dream of being ABBA's `Dancing Queen,' is about as remote as pigs that can fly.  Muriel does have friends, however; four girls she knows from school, one of whom just got married, into whose lives she basically imposes herself in a last ditch effort to find acceptance any way she can.  Then one night, even they tell her not to come around them anymore, that she is an embarrassment.  And for Muriel, it's the final straw that drives her to do something desperate.  Something that will ultimately change her life forever.<br><br>That it is billed as an `Hilarious comedy about friends, fun and unexpected surprises' and `Hysterically funny,' makes you wonder about the marketing machinery of the entertainment industry.  Is it a funny movie?  Yes, it is; just as life is often funny, even when it's at it's worst.  Hilarious?  Yes. All of which seems contradictory to the story that is at the heart of the film.  And yet, it's those very contradictions, those same multi-layered complexities of which life is made, that makes this such a wonderful movie. On one hand, Bill Heslop is one of the most despicable characters you'll ever encounter in a film; and on the other, Muriel is one of the most sympathetic.  The humor of this film is derived from the natural and very real situations in which the characters find themselves.  And just as there is something within us all that at times allows us to laugh at the misfortunes of others (perhaps occasionally born of a `better you than me' mentality), there are things you're going to laugh at in this film.  But as you sit back and watch as one misery upon another is heaped upon Muriel, you'd have to be either an unfeeling person or a sociopath not to be crying at least on the inside, even if you're laughing on the outside.  There are times when you just want to reach out to Muriel and let her know that one way or another, everything is going to be okay.<br><br>Toni Collette (in her second film) gives an incredibly moving performance as Muriel, making her about as real as a character can get.  She conveys so much through her body language and facial expressions alone, that you can feel the torment and the turmoil she keeps bottled up and buried deep within herself, without ever having to hear her speak a word.  Anyone who's ever known even a moment of misfortune in their life will be able to relate to her.  Unwittingly, she wears her feelings on her sleeve; not that she wants to, but when your cup of adversity finally overflows, it's going to show. And it takes a special actor to play a character like this and make her so convincing, without taking it over the top or into the gray planes of melodrama.  And Collette is that actor.  She's perfect in this role, and she had to be for this film to work.  Anything less than a perfect counterpoint to the character of Bill Heslop would've quickly derailed this project, and the humor alone wouldn't have done the job.  All of the tricks, jokes and funny lines in the world wouldn't have been enough to overcome that very real sense of loathing Bill Hunter brings to the role of Heslop.<br><br>The supporting cast includes Rachel Griffiths (Rhonda), Sophie Lee (Tania), Rosalind Hammond (Cheryl), Belinda Jarrett (Janine), Pippa Grandison (Nicole), Jeanie Drynan (exceptionally effective as Betty, Muriel's mother) and Daniel Lapaine (David).  In one of the most uplifting scenes you're ever likely to see in a movie, Muriel and Rhonda lip-sync to ABBA's `Waterloo,' which in the screenplay probably came across as something fun but rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things.  But on the screen, it becomes a moment that is absolutely transporting.  And that's the magic of `Muriel's Wedding.'  It takes you into the dark, but never allows you to languish there; ultimately, it takes you into the light, and when it does, it's brighter than anything you could imagine.  I rate this one 10/10.","user":"jhclues","rank":[102,110]},{"title":"So Much...Better...Than Advertised!","rating":10,"date":"20 May 2003","review":"You gotta love the Hollywood marketing hacks.  \"Outrageously funny...you'll stand up and.....cheer!\"  Did they even watch the movie? Or was this a cynical ploy to try to make \"Muriel's Wedding\" into a more commercially viable film?<br><br>Either way, the marketing for this great little movie deserves an award for Most Misleading. In misrepresenting \"Muriel,\" they reduced it to a fun \"chick flick\" in the minds of people who hadn't yet seen it. It's so much better than that.<br><br>A few years back, my then-girlfriend begged for this on one of our trips to Blockbuster, so I gave in, resigned to a night of gritting my teeth through a silly, formula-written, semi-feminist movie about a couple girls who have fun while getting even with their boyfriends or finally landing the big job or whatever the ending was gonna be.<br><br>Well, I was FLOORED by what \"Muriel's Wedding\" was, as well as what it wasn't.<br><br>The film is profoundly psychological and satirical. The person who sees Muriel, powerfully played by Toni Collette, and cannot empathize with her is a heartless, brainless schmuck indeed. Collette's performance and writer/director PJ Hogan's screenplay take Muriel through pretty much the whole range of emotion. Much of this emotion is negative, and it's really painful (but beautiful) to watch at several points. To watch Muriel's harrowing journey toward self-acceptance is to relive painful moments in your past, whether you are a man or a woman.<br><br>\"Muriel\" is also FULL of satire. It has a lot to say about marriage and family life, and little of it is good, although I believe it leaves plenty of room for redemption for Muriel and her abusive father (well-played by Bill Hunter).<br><br>\"Muriel's Wedding\" isn't a perfect movie, though it's pretty damned close. The scenes of Rhonda's and Muriel's life in Sydney, in particular, seem rather episodic, without strong threads to bind them. But this is almost quibbling with a great, great film.<br><br>That's the way \"Muriel's Wedding\" is. It affords you no escape, if that's what you are looking for. I think that's why most people are so p***ed off about it. They want to be entertained, not depressed by a film that has to do with real life. Well, I can't be too hard on these folks. It's really the marketing department's fault for their false advertising.<br><br>But if you want to see a very powerful film and are willing be really touched by a it, then see \"Muriel's Wedding.\"","user":"ATOBrian","rank":[83,90]},{"title":"a glorious celebration of freedom","rating":10,"date":"24 June 2004","review":"i still remember joining the neighbors to go to the movies to see a new Australian film that noone knew much about, except that it featured the music of abba...just as i still remember walking out of the cinema aglow with such immense joy.<br><br>this is a wonderful film, that begins with a shy, needy, shrinking-violet girl and ends with a strong, honest woman aware of her own power to change and control the world around her. this film is full of laughs, full of smiles and, towards the crescendo of the last few minutes even full of tears. one can't help but want to stand up and cheer, or dance, or both, as muriel escapes everything that her 'life' has pushed on her and rides into the sunset, with such happiness radiating from her face.<br><br>\"you're terrible, muriel...\" she is, and you can't help but love her for it. see this movie!","user":"maialindale","rank":[53,60]}]
