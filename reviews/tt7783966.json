[{"title":"Excellent","rating":10,"date":"26 January 2019","review":"First and foremost, the best stories are told for further conversations. This movie definitely meets this goal. Being a high school senior at the time of the Challenger Disaster, Christa Mcauliffe was definitely America's sweetheart, teachers were a big part of my life and I had a high interest in seeing this movie.\nThe movie tells the story of courageous candor with the contrast of the lack there of. The main character, a NASA engineer showed an incredible passion for what he believed and took all the steps he could to hinder the flight to space. Incredible historical set with the smallest details of the 80's.\nMy husband and I thougholy enjoyed it and the long conversations afterwards...our measurement for a great movie.","user":"erika_lenk","rank":[22,30]},{"title":"Fantastic!","rating":10,"date":"29 January 2019","review":"Really enjoyed this movie-a solid production. I remember that day vividly. Now I have perspective on what the engineers who tried to stop the launch went through.

Was very interesting. So sad that the voices of these engineers was not heard to avoid the inevitable explosion.\nThe movie is family friendly without any offensive dialogue or scenes. I wish I had done a little more research before watching, so some questions I had would be answered.\nWas a low budget film, but done very well-music, scenery and actors very authentic. So glad I watched.","user":"kevnbren","rank":[7,8]}]
