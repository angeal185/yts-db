[{"title":"What a missed Opportunity","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2019","review":"Well, the only GOOD news is, hopefully one day someone will take the helm and do a truly comprehensive documentary about \"Alien\". This is NOT it. \"Alien\" certainly deserves it. While this documentary may include some existential and interesting contributions not before stated it certainly lacks in giving credit where credit is due. Alien is an artistic endeavor and unfortunately leaves out a whole lot of artists involved. Where was Ron Cobb (set design) and Mobius (costume, and ship design). Oh, no. Those were all RIDLEY's ideas (according to the documentary). And what about POST PRODUCTION? Ben Burtt is mentioned ONCE and NO mention at all about music and this is what really amazed me, NO MENTION about editorial. If you are a true \"Alien\" fan then you will have heard MOST of what is in this already. Give it a pass and hope for somebody later to pick up and carry the torch.","user":"Huud","rank":[59,79]},{"title":"I want to go back to the old freezerinos after seeing this documentary","rating":4,"date":"4 September 2019","review":"Imagine the horror of a feminist dissection of the movie in which one of the speakers condescendingly infers that the creators of the movie were actually making a subconscious statement about oppressive patriarchal society without even knowing!<br><br>Imagine the audacity it takes to say that artist like Scott, O'Bannon and Giger were actually unaware of their own creative process and subconsciously succumbed to their male guilt.<br><br>The decision that this angle is relevant to this movie was wrong and it made the documentary naive, shallow and obtuse. No wonder Ridley Scott wanted nothing to do with it.<br><br>Shame really, I liked the bit about Francis Bacon.","user":"Last Man","rank":[70,97]},{"title":"Pretentious muck","rating":1,"date":"1 September 2019","review":"Every Alien documentary you ever seen before, only now more pretentious with demented femanists making insane points about a film they don't understand. No, Ash isn't a misogynist, if Kane had been left in charge, Ash would have ignored his authority just as he did Ripley. Not because he hated women, sigh, but because he wanted the alien onboard. He'd have killed Parker as well given half the chance, not because he was racist, but because..? Anyone? That's right, he was protecting the alien! It said, crew expendable, his mission. Not crew expendable, especially the women. Great film, terrible documentary. The bits that actually deal with the film, you've seen before and the new stuff, you don't want to see.","user":"stirtonproductions","rank":[73,103]}]
