Watch it because it's proof that a lot of IMDBers are really full of crap pawns that care more about peoples' opinions of their opinions than they do about whether or not the movie is actually any good. Stupid sheep. This was very emotional, GREAT characterization, awesome photography, and extremely convincing dialogues. I'm from the ATL, trust me this is pretty accurate. This flick really does a fabulous job portraying what some folks struggle with overcoming stereotypes, growing up, and finding their place in their world. If you appreciate an honest review then go see this sucker - otherwise you probably didn't even read this far.","user":"squarefanatic","rank":[61,70]},{"title":"ATL is a great movie","rating":21,"date":"21 July 2006","review":"ATL is a great movie for all involved in it i think that it is very underrated movie. They thought that it was going to be a movie in the vein of boys in the hood with it's social commentary about the state of black people in todays world, but it just ain't that movie. ATL dosen't have long speeches about African American culture from people drinking 40's and playing dominos. ATL dosen't subscribe to HOOD stereyotypes in fact no one in this movie is ever shown Drinking Beer or Smoking weed, sure ANT deals drugs but you don't see people ever smoke it. it's a movie that isn't about images but about the problems that the characters face that are real to life. the people have problems like what to do after high school and looking out for your family and friends. The actors in this moie are well cast the actors seem to really know their characters, and most of all TI is perfect in this movie he has a great energy that helps fits the movie to a T","user":"Papasmurf4325","rank":[35,39]}]
