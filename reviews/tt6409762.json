[{"title":"Better than it should be","rating":7,"date":"4 July 2018","review":"I wasn't expecting too much from this movie, but it ended up being better than than it should be. I was entertained from start to finish. For it's budget this film is extremely well done. <br><br>The monster scenes are done right, you mostly just get glimpses of the monster which seems like a good choice on the director's part. Sure, occasionally the characters make irrational decisions and some random coincidences occur but otherwise the plotting is tight. This movie ended up bring more fun than I thought it would be be and the people involved did a great job of making the most of their apparently modest budget. <br><br>Recommended to fans of bigfoot-esque, monster in the woods type of movies. (If you are someone who only enjoys movies with budgets of $300 million and higher you might want to skip this one.)","user":"Sawyer-4815162342","rank":[50,68]},{"title":"I've Seen Worse","rating":5,"date":"8 March 2019","review":"This flick is about a man who takes his girlfriend into the woods for a camping trip. He proposes and she is snatched by bigfoot. He spends a year in a psych ward after the incident because saying bigfoot took your girl is, well, crazy. When he gets out he has to make a decision. Should he leave things as the are or should he find out what really happened? His choice is the latter.<br><br>Lower budgeted film. Not much of a plot or special effects going on. I thought the main character did a decent job with his role but this isn't a film that I'm likely to remember. It isn't awful but it isn't great.","user":"Foutainoflife","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Bigfoot","rating":6,"date":"3 July 2018","review":"Low budget movie but rather done well. Acting was decent and revolved around the Bigfoot legend and on the angle that these things are not shy ape-like creatures and cuddly teddy bears but predators as was described by old Native American folklore. Kept me entertained well enough tonight.","user":"siriusly1986","rank":[26,38]}]
