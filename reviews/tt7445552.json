[{"title":"You Call this a Movie","rating":20,"date":"20 July 2018","review":"My ten year old son can come up with better script, better acting and better smart phone camera recording. I don't even know why this garbage is labeled as a movie! It should be on YouTube and labeled as mature camera testers. I've seen pronos with better plots and better acting. What a waste of space on IMDb.","user":"jamesfirass","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"Not as it sounds","rating":2,"date":"30 April 2018","review":"ARMENIAN HAUNTING sounds potentially interesting with that title but you soon realise that, like A GIRL WALKS HOME ALONE AT NIGHT, this is actually an American movie with an ethnic Armenian cast and crew. The story is low key and extremely limited in terms of budget, involving a young woman who delves into a familial mystery and soon finds herself being haunted in the present. The whole thing is very, very slow and let down by some rubbish post-production editing effects, such as having the video sway on the screen. The bit with the vomiting of the plastic bugs is also quite embarrassing.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"Worst movie of 2018","rating":1,"date":"8 November 2018","review":"This is shame for Armenian community...the producer is making fun of genocide...
