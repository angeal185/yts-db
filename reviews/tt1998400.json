[{"title":"I NEED MY SPACE","rating":6,"date":"28 August 2018","review":"Maia (Ione Butler) is a model who wants to remake herself. She trust herself to Frankie (Laura Martin-Simpson) a photographer who takes her to her secluded home own by the Shellys. Frankie is compulsively meticulous. She has desires for Maia who she convinces to spend the weekend.<br><br>Maia is having issue with her husband and says, \"I need my space.\" We know what that means guys. Meanwhile there is a subplot of a man (Jake Maskall) talking to a transgender looking psychologist (Caroline Burns Cooke) about life and love. He is apparently connected to one of the two women, but we don't know who or how.<br><br>The film consists mostly of Frankie attempting to seduce Maia, interrupted by a guy talking to a shrink. The production awkwardly comes together at the end.<br><br>The acting was fair. The story didn't move. I didn't really care about any of the characters. I enjoyed watching Frankie putting everything back in its place after Maia moved it an inch...and the fact she sleeps nude.<br><br>A mediocre Indie stye rental.<br><br>Parental Guide: F-bomb F/F sex nudity (Laura Martin-Simpson, Ione Butler)","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Mediocre at best...","rating":4,"date":"21 September 2013","review":"One of the biggest problems with this movie is that none of the characters are likable. It begins with Franky (who suffers from a serious case of OCD) and Maia driving out to Franky's house where most of the movie takes place. Franky is a photographer and Maia, her subject for the weekend. The movie is spliced between scenes of Franky and Maia getting to know one another and of a man and his therapist, discussing whether he is violent and how miserable he is because his marriage is unraveling. You aren't sure how these two sets of characters are connected until the final scene. <br><br>Overall it feels very disjointed. I gave it four stars because there was some interesting character development on the part of Franky, it was just unfortunate that there seemed to be little that was redeeming in any of the characters. I thought Laura-Martin Simpson did a decent job as Franky...who is meant to be off-putting.","user":"Taylor95","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"ENDING WAS A COMPLETE TRIP","rating":7,"date":"20 December 2019","review":"NOT SURE WHO WAS WITH WHO BUT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING","user":"tamyabonet2","rank":[1,1]}]
