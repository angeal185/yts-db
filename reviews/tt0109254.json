[{"title":"Very weak","rating":5,"date":"30 March 2018","review":"I don't know what I expected when I started watching this movie, but I was definitely let down by miles. First of all the dialogue is so bad and cheese, that it sometimes physically hurt to watch. The killing in this movie just takes away from the comedy , and believe me there is loads of killing it. Another negative factor is, that for some unexplainable reason someone thought it was a good idea to make every flame in this movie a bright blue colour, which sometimes really hurts while watching in a dark room. That being said there are some scenes that I found genuinely funny, although most of the time this was unintentional like in action scenes or scenes that where supposed to be serious and dramatic.","user":"max-frank","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Pretty weak","rating":5,"date":"1 January 2007","review":"Watched this for the first time last night, and was pretty disappointed (was on a triple bill with BHC 1 &amp; 2 on Bravo, great way to ring in the New Year!).<br><br>Not overly funny, the villains were pretty weak, which is odd as John Saxon is usually pretty good as a bad guy, and Tim Carhart was great as Eddie Willows on CSI. Seemed very forced at times, and definitely lacked the Foley-Rosewood-Taggart chemistry that made the first two films so successful. Hector Elizondo is no replacement for John Ashton. The return of Bronson Pinchot as \"Serge\" was painful to watch.<br><br>5 out of 10, based more on Eddie Murphy's performance than anything else.","user":"gibbog","rank":[29,43]},{"title":"Better Than Given Credit For","rating":7,"date":"26 May 2014","review":"Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy), while investigating a car theft ring, comes across something much bigger than that: the same men who shot his boss are running a counterfeit money ring out of a theme park in Los Angeles.<br><br>This film generally gets a bad rap, being accused of being the worst in the series. Even director John Landis has distanced himself, saying that Murphy was going through a rough time in his life and was not giving it everything he had. These may be fair comments, but the film is still better than given credit for.<br><br>Maybe not as funny as the first two, and maybe Murphy is more toned down, but there is still plenty of fun here from Bronson Pichot and others... not to mention an overall decent script. Even just trying to identify the director cameos is a fun game.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[18,25]}]
