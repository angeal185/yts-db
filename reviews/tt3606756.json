[{"title":"Definitely not as good as the first Incredibles movie","rating":6,"date":"10 November 2018","review":"Good: The animation for this movie was excellent just like most other Pixar movies, it was funny (especially Jack Jack) and I really liked the action sequences throughout the movie. I liked that the movie showed that parenting (when done right) can be heroic.<br><br>Bad: I thought this film has quite a few problems, the biggest problem was that the ending was pretty predictable, I could see it coming. Also, there was a feminism theme with Helen which was okay but at times it seemed to shove it in my face and it got to be annoying. There seemed to be a little too much going on in the movie and a few too many characters.<br><br>I'm glad I saw the movie, I just don't think I would see it again anytime soon.","user":"Ajk2386","rank":[188,255]},{"title":"Surprisingly overhated","rating":9,"date":"31 March 2019","review":"While I understand the disappointment, this was NOT a bad film. It isn't as good as the first one, but I think it holds up pretty well! There's lots of fun to be had watching this from the animation to the humor, and there are still some touching scenes that show there is heart put into this film. I recommend seeing CinemaWins \"Everything GREAT about Incredibles 2\" if you want to see why this film is still pretty decent. Only somewhat weak spot in my opinion was the main villain who was somewhat predictable, but man the animation at times truly is \"Incredible\" (pun intended)!<br><br>Go see it! It was well worth my time and I enjoyed it, so I'm surprised to see it get all these 1 star reviews. Far from Pixar's best but still a good flick. I know you can't please everyone but I think this movie is terribliy overhated. That's just my opinion at least. 9 stars out of 10!","user":"Reckno64","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"Incredibles 2 is... Exciting and Acceptable.","rating":7,"date":"2 October 2018","review":"'Incredibles 2' was probably the most anticipated movie of the year; it's hard to believe it's made 14 years since the first original. So obviously everyone was more than ready for this.<br><br>The film does come through when it comes to entertaining action and comedy, with Jack-Jack, Bob, and Edna providing most of the biggest laughs. The plot is interesting, because we've got to know what happened to the Parr family. As far as the supervillain mystery, it's acceptable and somewhat entertaining, but a bit predictable and generic. The final criticism I have is that Edna definitely deserved more screen time.<br><br>That being said, it is still an entertaining movie and not at all \"painful\" to watch.<br><br>In conclusion, 'Incredibles 2' is funny, exciting, and really worth a viewing.","user":"NarniaIsAwesome","rank":[59,82]}]
