[{"title":"unoriginal and unfunny","rating":4,"date":"30 June 2017","review":"This is 'Weekend at Bernies', with much less budget. I wanted to like this, but for the most part, it was just not funny. To sum up: four friends are at a wedding in Australia, when one is killed, they are told to return the body to England, in one piece, or they will be toast. Of course things don't go smoothly. There are many elements of this movie that appear in 'Death at a Funeral': corpses, drugs and lost bodies being but three. The script is no deeper than that! I think I laughed twice, the rest of the time I was cringing at the appalling script. I managed to watch the entire movie, although I was nearly tempted at the 36 minute mark to switch off. There is nothing original about the movie, it seems a blatant, low-budget attempt to copy the aforementioned movies. It falls short of both. It's not un-watchable, if you are easily pleased.","user":"makka-00955","rank":[18,26]},{"title":"Awful. Just awful.","rating":1,"date":"9 September 2018","review":"I like comedy's, I like a big range of films and I like low budget films, I wanted to like this film but it was terrible. I switched it off after 40 mins. I couldn't deal with how poor and cringey the script was. The jokes were so bad, not even Christmas cracker worthy. I think a 5 year old could've wrote a better script and had more intelligent comedy. <br><br>Honestly, if you don't fancy wasting your time, do not bother with this movie.","user":"garyc46","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"Stupid but watchable","rating":6,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"I'm not going to say there is anything smart about this movie.<br><br>It's a dumb, gross out movie of a type that thinks missing out on a threesome is automatically funny.<br><br>But I still watched it. I like stupid movies. It's fine for something to watch when you need a good no-brainer but I would watch it on a weekday, do not make it your Friday movie.<br><br>Watch it a little drunk.","user":"nathanielqwilson","rank":[2,3]}]
