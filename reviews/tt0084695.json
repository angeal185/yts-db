[{"title":"don't ya just hate party-crashers.","rating":7,"date":"25 July 2005","review":"Totally unpretentious '80's slasher is a cheesy, but fun ride.<br><br>Some lovely young ladies decide to throw a get together, only to have some loonie with a drill stop in to kill them all.<br><br>Slumber Party Massacre is a slasher fan's guilty pleasure with a pretty silly edge to it! One might just gather that from the DVD cover or poster for this film. It takes the predictable elements of the \"splatter\" film and with a complete lack of seriousness has a ton of fun with them. It makes sense considering that this film was originally written to be a slasher parody, and frankly still works well as a parody. The acting, directing, and special FX are all B-grade stuff, but overall that helps rather than henders the mood of the film.<br><br>At any rate, this film is strictly a good-time party kinda film, certainly nothing to be taken serious, but just enjoyed for it's humor (both intended and unintended) with the horror genre.<br><br>*** out of ****","user":"Nightman85","rank":[29,37]},{"title":"I didn't expect it to be so good","rating":8,"date":"26 August 2000","review":"I bought this because it was cheap and had 'massacre' in the title. What I didn't know is that this is a really tense movie. While not quite scary, it does have very suspenseful scenes, and the killer is classic! It's not filled with nudity like I had expected, and the killings are pretty gruesome. I'd recommend it to any slasher fan.","user":"Ivan Ravenous","rank":[37,50]},{"title":"A true '80s slasher film!","rating":9,"date":"11 March 2005","review":"This is definitely a true '80s slasher film! Since \"Slumber Party Massacre\" was released in 1982, you can say this may have been one of the films to create the '80s cheesy/slasher films...which is great! It is your basic '80 horror film; slumber party, drinking, comedic moments...and of course, the escaped maniac who is on his way to the party! Keep an eye out for Brinke Stevens as Linda, as this was one of her first roles. This is definitely a popcorn flick; so just sit back, &amp; enjoy yourself. Also, the late Robin Stille was one of the leads in this film. She appeared in a few other '80s horror films, &amp; is truly missed!","user":"SleepawayCampFan","rank":[25,33]}]
