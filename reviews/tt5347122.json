[{"title":"A surprisingly good independent film. The lead role has high potential.","rating":7,"date":"9 June 2019","review":"\"A Young Man With High Potential\" (7)ðŸŒ ðŸŒ ðŸŒ ðŸŒ ðŸŒ ðŸŒ ðŸŒ \nI truly only watched this film because it had no reviews on IMDb and with hundreds of movies at my disposal to choose from I hate to waste time so a competent review to me is priceless.\nRight away this film gets the ball rolling within the first 5 minutes the pace doesn't drag and every scene is relevant to the story. A small cast you can count on one hand but the acting is quite good, especially from the lead role who was superb. The whole film is basically shot in a modern one bedroom apartment but they have enough scenes outside and other places to keep you from getting claustrophobic. The videography was clean and the angles were refreshing the camera never seemed to be out of place and it really told the story from the best perspective.\nYou may be reminded a bit of other films that are based along the same premise but this flick really stands out by creating a character that's complex while simultaneously being relatable or familiar of someone just like him filled with anger and empathy.\nA very good film from start to finish the ending was on point and really stuck the landing. I definitely recommend this film it may just surprise you.","user":"tkaine3","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"How to review this strange affair?","rating":3,"date":"18 June 2019","review":"I find this quite a difficult film to review as it is well produced and well acted but just leaves me cold. Yes I understand it is a study on how a sexual situation can spiral out of control and the title is a reference to what most lawyers would say in court when a rape case is presented as has been the situation recently in America with the preppy college attacks but the overtly gory and perverse nature of the film does not really make this a good film for me just more of the usual torture porn and degradation of women which is all too prevalent these days!<br><br>It also I illustrates the way a lot of young men are retreating into their homes in front of a computer and living a virtual sex lifestyle; so yes it does have a few things to say but I cannot in all honesty give it much above a 3/10 as it left me cold and was quite uncomfortable to watch at many points but I guess the intelligentsia will say this is a good thing and why the movie is so good. Not me, I do not buy into all style over content descriptions that this movie has garnered.<br><br>If you want to be thoroughly depressed and disgusted then yes by all means watch this film but do not expect to come out with any good feelings. In this day and age it is already depressing enough, I want to come out of the cinema with hope for the future and elevated at having watched something either entertaining, profound or interesting and this is really none of those!","user":"omendata","rank":[10,17]},{"title":"good indie film that didn't really have slow parts","rating":6,"date":"28 August 2019","review":"Pt me interested the whole time and the main characters transition throughout was chilling and very real.<br><br>6.2","user":"natcalgary","rank":[5,7]}]
