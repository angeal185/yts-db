[{"title":"Sometimes you gotta just make up your own movie","rating":21,"date":"21 June 2009","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that as any kind of exploitation movie this is a complete failure. The beautiful Sondra Currie (older sister to Cherie and Marie Currie of the 70's girl group \"The Runaways\") does have a nice long nude shower scene, but even this is intercut with a strange flashback from her character's childhood (that's just what viewers who are trying to get turned on want to see!) and a couple bizarre shots of the drain and the shower head, which seems to be a distracting and irrelevant homage to Hitchcock, all finally culminating in a bizarro shot where her mother's face appears to her in the shower head! This sequence where they manage to hamhandedly squander the considerable entertainment value of Currie's boobs is unfortunately pretty typical of the rest of the movie. About halfway through I started making up my own movie about a sexy grown daughter (Currie)who comes to a small New Mexico town seeking out the father who abandoned her as a child. When she finds him, she sexually seduces and then proceeds to completely destroy his life, revealing to him only at the end that she is actually his daughter. Now THAT would have made a great 70's exploitation flick! <br><br>Unfortunately, THIS movie goes off on several rather boring tangents where after meeting her father, the girl gets involved with a local Mexican art dealer and uses him in a plot to get revenge on her father and his girlfriend, a local librarian. This actual movie unfortunately just isn't very good. On the plus side, this was produced by the great 70's character actor George \"Buck\" Flowers and he appears in a small role as a clerk. And did I mention that Sondra Currie gets naked?","user":"lazarillo","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"Not seducing anybody","rating":2,"date":"23 February 2006","review":"This crummie little story is of a daughter's attempted revenge over the father who abandoned her. The plot line is not original- but then perhaps it seemed more so in 1971. The execution is woeful.<br><br>Frankly, it is just dire. Do not be fooled by the sensational title or indeed the DVD packaging. This effort by Chris Warfield suffers from a weak plot line, zero characterisation from Sondra Currie and (on the version I have seen) a very poor digital transfer- indeed just one above bootleg.<br><br>It is certainly not a piece of seventies softcore (if that is what you think the title suggests), and I would rate it \"PG\" and not \"18\". I'd use the DVD as a drinks coaster instead ....","user":"John_Mclaren","rank":[24,37]},{"title":"sandra currie seduced me (metaphorically speaking)","rating":25,"date":"25 September 2011","review":"i have a thing for seventies and eighties b movies, and i have a thing for sandra currie. so i can't be rational about this film. i was debating whether i should give it an eight (my baseline for a \"good\" movie) or go as high as a nine. so i decided not to submit a numerical rating at all. rating films on a numerical basis is as stupid as scoring women on a one to ten scale. (as far as i am concerned, sandra is an infinity.) sure, the cinematography and art direction are \"subpar\" when compared with what can be found in a major studio film from the same period. they might even be said to be lacking when compared with the tech credits of the average seventies INDIE film. but i found the cinematography and art direction to be delightfully cheesy........ \"teenage seductress\" has a story that keeps your attention. (it maintained my interest, at any rate.) and it has sandra. so if you are into seventies exploitation flix and sandra currie, i would definitely recommend this film to you.","user":"jonbecker03","rank":[8,14]}]
