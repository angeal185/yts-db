[{"title":"Strange movie that could be worth your time","rating":6,"date":"13 January 2019","review":"I seen this movie once before and thought it was okay, so I decided to re-watch the movie and saw it was a bit better.<br><br>The plot's rather simple. Two men find out that a company their boss was investing in doesn't exist and goes to investigate further. The people behind the company find that out and the two men see there was more to bargain for. Like the title suggests, no one appears whom they appear to be, including the situation the two men are both in.<br><br>Honestly, its just a movie. Entertaining for starters. Don't get me wrong, its a slow burn for sure. But in the end, give this a little time and effort to watch, and judge it for yourself.","user":"TheBrooklynCrippler","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"not good","rating":3,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"This was a cheap flick of american political and police intrigues at its worst. the story and most of the acting are lame,the socalled wise man appears like a bikini demon, and the whole plot is swallowed up by itself.\nthis was a bad written review,but so are also this film product, the smoke screen makes sense fade away.so behold,stay away from this film itll save you from wasting your precious time of life. not recommended","user":"ops-52535","rank":[2,6]}]
