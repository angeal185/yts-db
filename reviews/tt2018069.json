Usual cliches, usual horror tropes, average cast, average performances, average effects and average degree of originality.<br><br>The whole thing is therefore just so, average! It's watchable stuff in fact the concept behind the movie is fairly interesting but the creators don't think outside the box and instead play it safe making a generic Hollywood style horror.<br><br>I'd never recommend this, not because it's bad but because it's just so unremarkable.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Couple of good ideas<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Everything is just so average<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>I didn't know that Emma Gonzalez was an actor!<br><br>Each year Thomas Mann looks goofier","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"not scary but not bad either","rating":6,"date":"27 July 2018","review":"This is more a story about loss and coping, so the drama component is stronger than horror. It's really not bad for its kind and deserves credit for avoiding jump scares. Could be watched if you aren't expecting something truly scary.","user":"Laiath","rank":[33,45]},{"title":"Slow","rating":5,"date":"1 August 2018","review":"'Our House' is not the worst movie I've seen but it certainly isn't the most exciting. The first half feels like nothing more than a sad family story. The second half throws in a few scares, but really not much else. Pretty much all of the horror aspects of the film could be condensed into a two minute short. Kinda slow, nothing revolutionary, and very average. It's not that's it's bad, it's just not good either.","user":"mikedegroot","rank":[18,25]}]
