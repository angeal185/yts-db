[{"title":"Great Movie....Great Cast...A lot better than expected!","rating":9,"date":"9 November 2003","review":"This is a great movie and michael J. Fox does excellent in this role! This is the movie that marked the beginning of the career of christina vidal, although some others may not agree I thought she did great. As the little tough girl from the streets of brooklyn she does an excellent job. This movie is something I bought after seeing this on HBO and to me is a classic. This is definitley worth a look and I give it 4 1/2 to 5 out of 5 stars. One thing to know about this movie. Don't think about it. JUST WATCH!","user":"XsWeEtLiLGiRL90x","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"What Can I say.....","rating":19,"date":"19 October 2002","review":"except this movie was great! It was funny and the acting was great! Michael J Fox was awesome.....and for Christina Vidal's first performance she didn't do too bad either! I would definitely  recommend this movie to any Michael J Fox fans or anyone just looking for a good laugh!","user":"sixersgurl91","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Very enjoyable movie.","rating":10,"date":"25 August 2000","review":"I've always enjoyed Michael J. Fox in \"Family Ties\" and this film is perfect entertainment for fans of that show.<br><br>Along with Fox, we have the cute, talented Christina Vidal Who for some reason we don't see anymore. She is perfectly poised in her scenes with Fox. And quite wonderful as we see her transform from a street-smart toughie, into this warm-hearted little girl.<br><br>All in all, great family entertainment with a great ending and a lot of good laughs. 3 out of 4 stars.","user":"mariposa-9","rank":[7,8]}]
