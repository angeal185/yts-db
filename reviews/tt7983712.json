[{"title":"LOL.","rating":3,"date":"5 December 2019","review":"It could've been a nice movie if not for a lot of issues.\nActing is ok...\nDialog is cheesy and fake\nno blood ever,\nEnemies are so dumb, in the 90s FPS games had bots on easy level smarter than what they have here\nSoldiers(the team) don't know how to move properly, how to engage and I am wondering if any of them ever held a gun. They moved around worse than 7 years old kids playing war. Nothing about what was shown can be anywhere real. It's LOL bad!\nAnything from uniform to clothing to vehicles to weapons - all wrong or fake.\nCould've been a comedy with a bit different dialog. Maybe if someone dub it, it could be a great comedy<br><br>The whole thing is just so fake, it makes good camera work and an ok script look bad. I mean, there is low budget and there's bad job by the directors who couldn't direct simple things.","user":"smilegel","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"not bad","rating":6,"date":"2 December 2019","review":"Simple storyline, TERRORISTS versus the WORLD scenario, I like how diversified the characters are, the Russian lady Sniper is one example., plus for that<br><br>overall, not bad if you're looking for a good action movie. just don't mind much the Terrorists dialogue too much.","user":"lifelinespublishing","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Review","rating":7,"date":"5 April 2020","review":"Colb, warms a donut with a piece of glowing metal. Fresh from the wreckage, A powder room had fallen from the top of the ship and landed next to Colbs skinny boat (Colbs plan had been to be moved by the things aroud him). It was the gas engine that was keeping a green flower floating in an exact path inside the powder room. Ounce the ocean water siezed the engine, the flower immediately shot over and into Colbs mouth like a bumb moving towards the donut table at a funeral.","user":"catpantry","rank":[2,2]}]
