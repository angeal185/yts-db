[{"title":"And now something completely different","rating":8,"date":"24 January 2019","review":"I've been waching american movies for 30+ years and i'm sick an tierd of their propaganda. This movie is something new and refreshing. For those who are saying that this is russian propaganda, they are right...So what...at least it's from different angle.","user":"borkes1980","rank":[168,248]},{"title":"Good Russian War Movie","rating":10,"date":"6 October 2019","review":"There was a lot to like about this film. Granted, it didn't look as good as a big money Hollywood studio movie like Fury, but it did look quite good. I'd say it was on par with the better US independent films. The cast was good - looked good great and acted well. Props and wardrobe were excellent. I must admit, I like these Russian films better dubbed than subtitled, and the dubbing was good along with the voice acting. I'd say the CGI was quite good - I watched it on a pad which probably helped, but I thought the tank battle sequences looked good, though not as good as live action special effects. Still good enough to carry the story. As for the story, interesting and fact based, but unlikely in Its totally. Then again, not much more unlikely than Fury, which I also liked but found a bit fantastic.<br><br>So that's my take - a good war flick if that's your cup of tea.","user":"joenadenicek","rank":[33,46]},{"title":"Unexpectedly good action movie","rating":10,"date":"22 February 2019","review":"This is an 80's type action movie with modern special effects. Generally, I am sceptical about Russian movies, they are mostly art house types. This one is an exception though. Everyone who loves a good action with heroes who has no superpowers but are supercool would enjoy it. I loved it. Nowadays it is rare for me to say that, but I really loved it. Please watch it in a theater or on a great screen: cinematics are awesome.","user":"deangelised","rank":[64,97]}]
