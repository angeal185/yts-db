[{"title":"14th Century revenge slasher","rating":4,"date":"14 August 2019","review":"This wasn't actually too bad, a girl having to go through a lot and then being accused of being a witch.\nThis all happens in an isolated village in the middle of a Welsh forest. The girl then learns some stuff about herbalism because a plague is going round the area.\nIf you think there can't be diversity in 14th century isolated villages in Wales, you are wrong. An extremely young merchant from far away, Africa? also just happens to stumble around this isolated, plagued area in the early middle ages. How he ended up there is anyone's guess, considering the scene did not advance the film at all, I guess it needed to be shoehorned in in order to get funding.<br><br>All in all it isn't quite up to scratch, but it is good enough to enjoy. Lots of clichees, priest is dodgy, and a big revenge ending that teaches us that we shouldn't judge someone.They call her a witch but she actually isn't. I gave it 4 because it entertained me and didn't feel like a waste of time.","user":"ncoleby","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Cleansing","rating":1,"date":"25 August 2019","review":"Absolutely diabolical .waste of money.didn't go into enough details about characters in the movie","user":"pugwash-59874","rank":[8,14]},{"title":"waste of time","rating":1,"date":"7 December 2019","review":"The movie is a waste of time, boring, absolutely no sense plot, not even a horror film.","user":"akratosmc","rank":[1,1]}]
