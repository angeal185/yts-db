[{"title":"Working executive girl","rating":7,"date":"5 August 2005","review":"Never having seen this film, we decided to take a chance with it. We were quite surprised to learn this Hollywood film is based on a French one, \"L'associe\", written for the screen by Jean Claude Carriere and based on Jenaro Prieto's novel \"El Socio\". Daniel Petrie, its director is working with Nick Thiel's adaptation, which appears to have been a vehicle for its star, Whoopi Goldberg.<br><br>Some comments have compared this movie with \"Working Girl\", a film that also dealt with a smart woman working in the financial world, one of the themes in \"The Associate\". We are introduced to an intelligent woman, Laurel Ayers, who happens to have three things going against her, she is black, a woman, and is intelligent enough to merit a promotion in the Wall Street firm she works for. Unfortunately, it comes as no surprise that Laurel is passed and her co-worker, Frank, gets the good job and becomes her boss.<br><br>The film is mildly funny, as Laurel goes to make a name for herself by creating a \"silent\" partner, Mr. Cutty, who is never seen. The financial world is all in a frenzy to meet him, and the hilarious appearance at the Plaza Hotel, instead of making things clear, contributes to his myth.<br><br>Ms. Goldberg is delightful to watch. Dianne Wiest makes an impressive appearance as the loyal Sally, who is an under appreciated woman. Timothy Daly is perfect as the egotistical Frank. The supporting cast is good. Bebe Neuwirth, Eli Wallach, Austin Pendelton, and a funny Lanie Kazan as a financial gossip writer.<br><br>While the film is predictable, it offers some funny moments.","user":"jotix100","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"Fun movie","rating":10,"date":"30 June 2005","review":"I gave this movie a 10 not because it's perfect, not because it's the best movie I've seen, but because the way it made me feel when I watched it. I love Whoopi and she does a great job in this movie, as she does on any other movie she made. Her personality just shines. I used to think that \"actors\" can really learn any role and they can be whoever they were needed to be. But Whoopi fits this role perfectly. I couldn't have thought of a better actress to fit the character.<br><br>The movie is funny. The bad guy always gets it and it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit clich√©, but isn't that how we all want it to end? This is a perfect screening for the stay-at-home moms or housewives.","user":"eastern_fate","rank":[30,34]},{"title":"Underrated.","rating":10,"date":"8 June 2002","review":"Too many people/reviews comment negatively on this movie and so, even though I would normally not post my comments on this site, I felt the need to create some *balance* here. This movie is well done, honest, and we ALL need more American movies that sway away from the usual \"man-saves-world\" trend. Credit to Whoopi and the other actors for choosing these roles. Acted well. It just plain _worked_. It's obvious that I am not too spiffy at this movie-critic role (duh), but as a 16 year old teenager who is unfamiliar with all the movie-jargan yet knows very well when she sees an underrated movie, I tell anyone reading this to watch this movie. And to those who don't think very highly of it, slap yourselves across the face and directly compare the quality of THIS to some of the more popular titles out there... I personally think that 'The Associate' would be better and deserves a much higher rating.","user":"lanina6667","rank":[34,41]}]
