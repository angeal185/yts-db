[{"title":"\"My father told me to fight duels.\"","rating":11,"date":"11 April 2003","review":"This film (and its companion piece The Four Musketeers) is the finest adaptation of the Dumas classic.  It perfectly captures the blend of romance, adventure, and comedy inherent in the novel.  There is some modification for modern viewers, but the spirit and attitude of the era is preserved.<br><br>Michael York gives one of his best performances as the young, naive D'Artagnan.  He appears to be a bit of a bumbling idiot at first; but, one soon learns that a keen brain lies behind that bumbling exterior.  This portrayal was criticized by another filmmaker, who adapted another of Dumas' tales.  Judging by how far that director strayed from Dumas, it's understandable how he missed noting that Dumas portrayed D'Artagnan in the same manner at the beginning of the novel.  D'Artagnan grows with his experiences and becomes a leader of men by the end of the novel; one who has confounded Cardinal Richelieu at every turn and preserved the honor of his Queen and country.<br><br>Oliver Reed was perfectly cast as Athos, the melancholy drunkard.  Athos is a man who has endured great pain and betrayal in his life and finds his only pleasure in drinking and brawling.  He is the wise counsel to the young D'Artagnan, and the mysterious side to the Musketeer triangle.<br><br>Frank Finlay, a wonderful character actor, brings a wonderful, arrogant bluster to Porthos; a gentleman, a braggart, and a fool.  Finlay also has a nice turn as the jeweler O'Reilly, showcasing his versatility.<br><br>Richard Chamberlain is Aramis, the future priest and great lover.  Aramis gives an air of spiritual devotion, while romancing his mistresses.  Like many clergy of the upper classes, he sees no conflict in these attitudes, or his profession as a soldier.  Chamberlain brings great subtlety to Aramis. His part is not as big as the other two, but he says much with body language and attitude.  He more than holds his own with the stage-trained Brits.<br><br>Charlton Heston brings a deep menace to Richelieu, quite the opposite of his previous heroes.  He shows the devious nature of the Cardinal, and the intelligence of a man who knows he has lost, but will have other battles down the line.<br><br>Faye Dunaway is the beautiful and vicious Milady.  She is the deadliest of D'Artagnan's adversaries; she charms with her beauty and grace, as she prepares her dagger unseen.<br><br>Christopher Lee is D'Artagnan's rival, Rochefort.  Lee is always good, even when the film isn't.  Luckily, this film is up to his abilities.  His cool demeanor is backed by a strong sword arm.<br><br>The cast is rounded out by fine character performances from Roy Kinnear as Planchet, Jean-Pierre Cassel as King Louis XIII, Geraldine Chaplain as Anne of Austria, and Spike Milligan as M. Bonacieux.  Raquel Welch gives a surprisingly deft turn in the comic role of Constance.<br><br>There is plenty of action, romance, drama, and fun for fans of each.  The sum of those parts results in a classic that outshines all other attempts at Dumas.  It is a swashbuckler to rival any Errol Flynn movie, a romance equal to a Merchant-Ivory production, and a comedy to rival Monty Python.<br><br>Forget Gene Kelly, the Ritz Brothers, and Charlie Sheen and company.  These are the true Musketeers.","user":"grendelkhan","rank":[67,72]},{"title":"Best Dumas Adaptation is Spectacular Romp...","rating":30,"date":"30 January 2004","review":"THE THREE MUSKETEERS, Richard Lester's comic take of the oft-filmed Dumas adventure story, is not only terrific escapist fare with a brilliant cast, but stands as the most faithful adaptation of the Musketeer saga.<br><br>\nThe very length of the novel, with it's many plot twists, had resulted in various truncated adaptations over the years, with MGM's 1948 all-star production the only previous attempt to film more than the first half of the book. Lester, however, backed by producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind, and Wolfdieter von Stein, and working from a unrepentantly bawdy script by legendary scribe George MacDonald Fraser, tackled the novel head-on, with extraordinary results. <br><br>The novel's hero, young master swordsman D'Artagnan (portrayed by Michael York at his most boyish), is clearly the product of an impoverished Gascon household, unable to read or write, but filled with dreams of heroism in the elite Musketeers, and \"fighting frequent duels\". Quickly embarrassed by the smoothly villainous Rochefort (Christopher Lee), and ridiculed by the mysterious Milady de Winter, the lad reaches Paris with a broken sword, but his idealism undimmed. With a borrowed sword, he then blunders into a series of challenges from the three title characters, emotionally scarred alcoholic Athos (Oliver Reed), comic buffoon Porthos (Frank Finlay), and dandified ladies' man/priest wannabe Aramis (Richard Chamberlain). When the Cardinal's Guard attempts to arrest the four as Athos and D'Artagnan begin their duel, the Gascon displays such extraordinary skill with a sword that he is happily welcomed into the band of rogues, who help him procure a servant (the wonderfully comic Roy Kinnear) and lodgings at the home of an old reprobate (Spike Milligan) and his beautiful, if klutzy young wife (Raquel Welch, in her finest comic role), who the boy immediately lusts after. The four friends then embark on a series of hilarious, swashbuckling escapades.<br><br>Meanwhile, intrigue runs rampant in the Court; the Queen (Geraldine Chaplin) carries on a clandestine affair with the British Prime Minister, the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward), under the oblivious eye of her husband, Louis XIII (Jean-Pierre Cassel), while evil Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston, who is marvelous, 'against type') plots to publicly embarrass her, and reveal her involvement, thus provoking a war with England, and the elimination of France's Protestant faction. The object of betrayal is a multi-jeweled necklace, a gift from Louis, given by the Queen to Buckingham, with two jewels stolen during a tryst by the Cardinal's agent, Milady de Winter. The task of recovering of the necklace, and replacing the missing jewels, is given to D'Artagnan and his Musketeer allies, who 'sacrifice' themselves to help the Gascon reach England.<br><br>Climaxing in a wild free-for-all at a Royal Ball, love triumphs, Richelieu is temporarily thwarted, Milady swears revenge against  D'Artagnan, and he becomes a full-fledged Musketeer, joining his love and three recovered friends to celebrate. <br><br>This constitutes only the FIRST half of the novel and movie, and the filmmakers decided to end the picture at this point, releasing a sequel, THE FOUR MUSKETEERS, a year later, which would cover the darker remainder of the story. While it was a wise decision, no one had informed the cast that they were, in fact, making two movies, and not one, at the time of filming, and the stars quickly filed suit against the Salkinds. After a brief but highly publicized court case, the cast were compensated, and the second, equally enjoyable MUSKETEER film was released.<br><br>THE THREE MUSKETEERS (and it's sequel, THE FOUR MUSKETEERS) were triumphs for Lester, the Salkinds, and the matchless ensemble of actors. The films have achieved legendary status, over the years, and taken together, stand, today, as one of the finest comic adventures ever made.<br><br>If your experience of the tale is only the more recent Disney version, do yourself a favor, and catch the Lester films. You won't be disappointed!","user":"cariart","rank":[58,65]},{"title":"The best Three Musketeers ever.","rating":10,"date":"3 November 2004","review":"This film, and its sequel (filmed concurrently) is by far the best movie version of the Dumas novel ever produced. The cast is excellent. The sets and costumes are marvelous. The swordplay (and there is much) is possible some of the most realistic ever filmed. And it's the only Musketeer movie I am aware of in which the Musketeers actually use muskets. Authenticity seems to have been very important to the producers, as well as staying true to the novel.<br><br>Sadly a film like this wouldn't be made these days. First off the fighting would be \"punched-up\" with a lot of wire work. And of course Hollywood would change the story to eliminate much of the \"sleeping around\" characters do (today's movie heroes in this type of movie aren't usually sexually active). They would also provide some creative story editing so that a certain character who dies in the novel would survive so as to supply the requisite happy ending. Fortunately for us this version does not suffer that kind of revisionism.<br><br>If you're a fan of Dumas or just looking for a fun film with lots of realistic sword fighting then you won't want to miss this.","user":"mvario","rank":[64,76]}]
