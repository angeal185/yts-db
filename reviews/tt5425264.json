[{"title":"Ok movie but...","rating":6,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"This is one of those movies that the sound editor thought that hearing the music and background noises was more important than hearing the dialogue.","user":"ascerb","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Another Masterpiece!","rating":10,"date":"6 January 2018","review":"Favorite fantasy animation film of all time! everything was perfect from Warriors Dawn to Throne of Elves. I'm inlove with this film the characters, the animation, everything. Don't care about the negative comments. This animation was a gem really hoping we can get another sequel of this.","user":"bjingtan","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"very good but not excellent","rating":10,"date":"20 August 2016","review":"I have to admit that after years of watching Hollywood style cartoon, this Chinese Made animation movie really catches my eye! It has very clear story-line; characters with different personalities; villain with brain and good strategy; beautiful designs and eye catching high quality pictures.<br><br>The only negative thing for this movie is the copyright problem with the game operator, so the movie maker had deleted many characters, only keep the very few of them.<br><br>If you are simply an animation movie fan, do not miss this Great Movie! It will not let you down. Watch it with your Kids!","user":"huangxian","rank":[17,33]}]
