[{"title":"Horrid","rating":28,"date":"28 February 2020","review":"The plot sounds funny and interesting, but the reality cannot be further away from this. The script is just horrid. The first segment is already ridiculous, with the guy speaking and behaving in the strangest way. The second one is not good either. Basically the dialog in the film is just unrealistic, as people don't talk like this! The worst thing is that none of the characters are likable. I couldn't wait for this film to end.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Our capacities","rating":10,"date":"3 March 2020","review":"Lines for this film were randomly selected from Titanic (1997). And they wanted to extract lines from (one scene) the most unimportant portion of the film. They actually chose a deleated portion. It was where rose was allowed to have noting on her mind she didnt want there (they filmed her sleeping). That's why sunday girl is a silent film you cant enjoy because your restricted humans.","user":"catpantry","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Could have been funny - -","rating":7,"date":"15 March 2020","review":"<ul><li>- but unfortunately all the humor in the first half of this story is lost in the second half as our lead girl melts into a state of emotionalism. Her 4 boyfriend break-ups are litehearted humor. When number 5 becomes central this story becomes serious and I was left wondering what was the directors intentions in making this movie.</li></ul><br><br>Visually it is pleasant and colorful. Alot of thought went into the settings.","user":"cekadah","rank":[0,0]}]
