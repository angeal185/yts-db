[{"title":"Cute little Indy","rating":5,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"As a low-budget Indy, Rink is relatively competently constructed and works quite well. Nothing in the film is exceptional, but the film is certainly watchable. The characters are often endearing - if overdrawn even for a quirky comedy - and the dialogue has enough spark to carry a plot in which not a great deal happens. This is a camped- up snapshot of American suburbia and its functional dysfunctionals that lacks finesse but has its charms. Timing could be tightened up, and some of the sequences compacted and/or removed, but as the work of a young crew, this team shows some promise. None of the acting is stellar, but Zach Honer is one to watch for possible future character roles that call for an awkward, quirky yet appealing type; along with Ann Keen, he is probably one of the best cast leads.","user":"troy-boulton","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"5 January 2020","review":"I watched the whole thing to be sure.
