[{"title":"The very likable Son of Bigfoot","rating":7,"date":"24 November 2017","review":"Being a huge animation fan and really liking the idea, 'The Son of Bigfoot' had enough to make me want to see it. Seeing it, it may not be among the best films whether animated or not ever (nor did it intend to be) and is not perfect but it achieves very well at what it set out to do and doesn't try to be any more than it actually is, clearly knowing what it wanted to be and who to aim it at.<br><br>'The Son of Bigfoot' is perfect for younger children, who are very likely to love it, while older children should also find a lot to like. Adults or the most demanding are likely to find faults and find it easier to criticise, but 'The Son of Bigfoot' does make a real effort to include something for everybody of all ages and to me it succeeded in that. It is easy to criticise it, it is formulaic, it is derivative, some of the pace is a bit too hectic and the villain is rather one-dimensional and neither threatening or interesting (almost silly and actually not really needed).<br><br>The very sensitive may object to the use of certain words not usually found in a family film and perhaps also to the Japanese businessmen joke, wasn't myself by it all that much.<br><br>However, while not up to the same level as the best films of the major animation studios, 'The Son of Bigfoot' has a lot going for it. The animation is great, it's colourful, beautiful and rich in background and character detail and character designs that move naturally and don't look creepy. The music fits nicely and has an infectious and bubbly vibe.<br><br>Writing is also not bad at all, there is some nice wry humour and amusing jokes, without resorting to toilet humour, and just as many sweet, without being over-sentimental, and charming moments. Really liked the themes that the story touches upon, the father and son relationship is beautifully handled and has a lot of heart and it is not hard at all to root for an outsider, especially if you yourself were treated like one.<br><br>Of the characters only the villain underwhelms, the others are very engaging while the voice acting achieves a good balance of fun and sweet without going over-the-top in either extreme.<br><br>In short, very likable and worth the time as long as one knows what to expect. 7/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"Very likable movie","rating":29,"date":"29 December 2018","review":"This European production does not have the huge budget of the leading American studios, and the story is coherent but not sophisticated. However, the animation looks good, the character design works well and the film has heart and is fun to watch. Also, I enjoyed the theme of father-son bonding, which is something we don't get a lot of lately.","user":"alv790","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Better than anticipated...","rating":6,"date":"9 June 2018","review":"My son wanted to watch this movie, so we went to watch it. And with it now seen, I must admit that I was actually surprised with the outcome of this movie, because it turned out to be better than I had anticipated.<br><br>While \"The Son of Bigfoot\" hardly is an innovative animated movie, it still offers fun and entertainment from start till end.<br><br>The storyline was fun, albeit a bit generic and predictable.<br><br>The characters in \"The Son of Bigfoot\" were funny and nicely detailed, and there were a bunch of hilarious situations throughout the course of the story. This, naturally, added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.<br><br>The voice acting in the movie was quite good and really helped the movie along nicely. And with this being an animated movie, the voice acting is crucial.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[5,6]}]
