[{"title":"continuing Paramount's streak of atmospheric gems!","rating":26,"date":"26 October 2004","review":"During the late seventies and early eighties, Paramount Pictures began a streak of quality horror films paralleled only by the Universal Films of the thirties and forties. Exemplified by the Friday the 13th series, My Bloody Valentine, Silver Bullet, April Fools Day, Tourist Trap, and many others, these films, though headed by diverse directors, presented a singular atmospheric moodiness, attained through a mandated set of production techniques. As a result Paramount was able to consistently release films that seemed vaguely familiar in a comforting way, yet dealt with a wide variety of unique subject matters within the expansive slasher genre. <br><br>Tourist Trap evokes the carnival imagery of Tobe Hooper's The Funhouse, yet brings it within the guidelines of the Paramount Films from this era. The dark settings and unsettling mannequins and masks lend a scary non-human atmosphere to the film that belies it PG rating. The acting is consistently solid as can expected from Paramount films from this era. The characters are even likable, making their deaths all the more tragic and shocking when they inevitably occur, a rarity in the films of competing studios such as New World or Vestron during the same era, where deaths are treated as a comic or joyful event. Under-appreciated in its day, and nearly forgotten now, this film has truly withstood the test of time and has become a classic in the eyes of those who are lucky enough to revisit it. Do yourself a favor and pay a visit to this incredible \"Tourist Trap\".","user":"aerosmithandwesson","rank":[34,36]},{"title":"Watch it with the lights out if you dare!","rating":8,"date":"9 November 2004","review":"Although widely under appreciated, \"Tourist Trap\" is still a notable and worthwhile entry into the horror genre. The first film directed by David Schmoeller (of Puppet Master fame). Pino Donaggio's score is nothing short of amazing; elevating the film to a whole other level in terms of both tension and atmosphere. Connors delivers a deliciously over the top performance as Mr. Slausen; the other actors are all competent considering that this is a low budget flick. For being close to 26 years old, the film has stood up extremely well - a creepy back woods setting, decent effects, and few hidden surprises in the script; it's worthwhile viewing for any horror enthusiast. A definite cult classic! My grade 8/10.","user":"Vancity_Film_Fanatic","rank":[41,45]},{"title":"Weird and memorable","rating":3,"date":"3 June 2004","review":"This is an old movie and probably doesn't hold up well for younger audiences, but it still deserves credit for it's weird atmosphere/ideas, especially on such a low budget. Scares in the best way, by tapping into dark psychological fears. Anyone can throw something at you on a screen to make you jump or show a decapitation in all it's grue in close-up, but this one takes it's time and works its way under your skin, trying to push you into the same state of madness as all the characters in it are taken to. And unlike horror movies of today, the lead characters are vulnerable and human, not smart-assed and invincible.<br><br>Along the way you get one of Pino Donaggio's best scores ever, an over-wrought swirl of strings and sighing women that perfectly compliments his other scores of the era (Carrie, Pirannah, Dressed To Kill, The Howling and Body Double). There are, of course, mannequins, Tanja Roberts with dark hair in a tube top with big boobs, Chuck Conners wearing masks and talking like Harvey Fierstein(he did such a good job I didn't believe it wasn't two people!), an almost unwatchable suffocation scene and enough warped moments to give you nightmares for awhile.<br><br>The DVD is a surprisingly stunning transfer with an OK commentary track by the director, who's other films didn't impress me much. This is a one of a kind flick. \"My brother doesn't want her to see meee...do you know why?...do YOU know why? (singing) He's afraid she'll beee attracted to meee...heh heh hehhhh...\"","user":"TonyDood","rank":[19,20]}]
