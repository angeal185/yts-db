[{"title":"I so get it","rating":8,"date":"26 February 2017","review":"I read earlier user reviews, but I'm not sure the message is what people think. The LA Times review was more accurate. I stuck through the grueling gauntlet of self-inflicted catastrophes that Eden goes through. This movie is more about self determination and gut wrenching perseverance than about tragedy. In fact, the end says it all (no spoilers). I'm recommending it. Watch the big blockbusters if you like, but this says more about the human experience than most movies, but it's a ride down a gloomy street at first...","user":"zeekol","rank":[16,25]},{"title":"Don't even bother to watch","rating":3,"date":"24 February 2017","review":"When the movie started, by the way everything was going, it seemed like it'd be a worthwhile watch but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. Most of the background of the story was left for the viewers to assume . Even after the movie finished , i was still wondering 'what's her freaking problem?'. Her fianc√© seemed fine for a loving partner. It would have been a lot better if Eden would have figured out her problem of commitment at least in the end. The movie was like it started and ended on the same very page .<br><br>You should only watch this if you are having a hard time quitting drinking.","user":"kushagrasonkar-952-803821","rank":[13,20]},{"title":"good film with interesting female lead","rating":10,"date":"28 March 2017","review":"This is a compelling film. While yes it is dark, I hardly think that merits a negative review. It shows a women struggling after a traumatic event. I recommend watching it. Breeda Wool offers a strong performance as the lead character Eden. It's refreshing to a see a film that allows a woman to go through and look like sh*t the entire movie. Kudos!","user":"zeimichelle","rank":[6,8]}]
