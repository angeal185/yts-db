Don't be afraid of the gay jokes, they lead to some funny moments and even funnier stories.","user":"lopaka_tanu","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Great but...","rating":10,"date":"17 October 2018","review":"Whoever edited sound for this special needs to be fired! Ron White is hilarious as always but it sounds like Ron is using a boom mic while each and every audience member is hooked up with a lav mic. (Imagine you're watching a tv show and as soon as it goes to commercial, the audio becomes twice as loud to get your attention.)\nThat's what happens every few seconds when the crowd laughs. (Audience volume goes from a 5 to 10)\nNormal volume when Ron is talking then audience laughter goes way too high!!\nRon White is hilarious as it is, there's no need for the unnatural volume with the laugh audio. \nOther than the audio, I recommend this","user":"jason-15620","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"Pretty funny!","rating":8,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"I liked it. Not as funny as \"A little unprofessional\" but still very good. The Golden Corral bit was hilarious.","user":"caleb-english","rank":[5,7]}]
