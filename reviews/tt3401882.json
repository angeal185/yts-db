[{"title":"Ignore the critics","rating":8,"date":"3 October 2017","review":"Highly suggest if you want a good laugh. The movie was funny and really good. It wasn't meant to be serious at all and I think that all the people crying about it are 60 year old single old farts who don't know what humour is. It's not meant to be realistic at all if it's a comedy movie for entertainment. It's not a damn documentary. <br><br>Tired of all these \"critics\" who act as if only Oscae nominated movies that are inspiring and touch your heart can be considered good. This was a great watch.","user":"Alileos","rank":[57,80]},{"title":"there are laughs to be had","rating":6,"date":"1 November 2017","review":"This silly comedy actually had some laughs. It's the last day of school and seniors are pulling pranks. Tough guy teacher, Strickland, goes nuts and trashes his class room. Another teacher, Campbell, witnesses the whole thing and rats Strickland out to keep his job. So Strickland challenges him to a fight after school. Campbell does funny things to get out of it like bribing a student, planting drugs. And he has his daughter's talent show to attend, in which they perform to a Big Sean song with some raunchy lyrics. That was quite funny with the looks from the audience. They fight, but the fight saves their jobs in a way.<br><br>FINAL VERDICT: Had some good scenes, worth watching.","user":"MLDinTN","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"This movie is not that good but at the same time very enjoyable","rating":8,"date":"20 June 2017","review":"First of all I want to say that I don't get all of the hate this movie is getting. This movie does try too hard to be funny and it isn't that funny to be honest, but I had a very fun time watching this movie, going in to it with absolutely no expectations. I got to say for m this movie isn't a waste of time and it isn't a waste of money.","user":"benrandomz","rank":[34,51]}]
