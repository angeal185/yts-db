[{"title":"Dinky-di Animated Romp","rating":8,"date":"24 October 2017","review":"I'm astonished at the number of poor reviews here - what a bunch of party-poops! <br><br>Clearly all the good Aussie fun passed over their dour heads - or they were fussing so much over the movie's departure from the ethos of the original series that they couldn't let themselves appreciate it for what it is.<br><br>This is a high-quality animated film sporting a star-studded cast of some of Australia's most famous voices clearly having great fun portraying many of our iconic creatures. The script makes no pretense of sticking to reality or even logic and good luck to them! No child watching it will have any problem with it's inconsistencies, so why should the adults?<br><br>Even the blue of the wombat's vehicle being left- hand drive is kinda funny when you think about it. A classic escape from an Australian classic.","user":"gus-186-777813","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"it's nothing like the original show","rating":1,"date":"1 October 2015","review":"i grew up watching \"The Adventures of Blinky Bill Animated series\" and this movie does not follow the the narrative of the original animated series, it has none of the original voice actors and made in a \"pixarish\" cg animation style, there is nothing wrong with cg though i would have love to see the nostalgia cartoon animation,the story for this movie felt like finding nemo with koalas,<br><br>it's OK as a kids movie though it also sucks that every kids show is moving away from stop motion and cartoon animation to cg, everything looks like a Disney film.<br><br>i'm just an Australian teenager that watched blinky bill with family","user":"rynotaank","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Very watchable and good Aussie family fun","rating":8,"date":"3 October 2015","review":"I had a pretty good time with Blinky Bill:The Movie; and I'm not a big animation feature watcher! I am also 10 times the age of the target audience, but that said; there are lots of sight gags and zippy one liners to amuse parents, grandparents and anybody else who wants a light and breezy 90 minutes of local entertainment. I don't have any baggage about the original material, and unlike other reviewers I was not averse to the proliferation of Aussie lingo that was performed with great relish and I think a bit of a wink! <br><br>The cast is great; although every time Bill senior spoke I could have sworn it was Michael Caton; so quintessentially Caton esque was Richard Roxburgh's delivery, and Richard is of course one of our leading stage and screen thespians. Ryan Kwanten immersed himself in the title role, and Deborah Mailman and especially David Wenham are great supporting players here. The Kath and Kim Emus played by Toni Collette were fun as was Barry Humphries. They're all good! It's just loads of fun; a sweet, but not overly taxing storyline; a good versus evil tale with danger and chase sequences all set in the Australian bush and outback. Beautifully scored, animated and directed, I surprised myself at how enjoyable it was. Overly ocker? Too bloody right it was!","user":"david-rector-85092","rank":[7,11]}]
