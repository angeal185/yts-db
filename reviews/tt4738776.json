[{"title":"Great Movie About Women Friendahips","rating":10,"date":"22 December 2018","review":"This is a beautiful movie about women being friends and supporting each other as they demand what they deserve in life. Is it cheesey? As heck. Does it pass the Bechdel Test? I'm pretty sure that it does not. But it's a movie by, about, and for women that shows it's absolutely possible to be a feminist and still be girly, want a boyfriend, and enjoy sex. We need 200 more movies like this made yesterday.","user":"errinnicholas","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"Cute, and True, Too","rating":7,"date":"8 April 2018","review":"I think Heather Graham did a great job with this film, mainly because it captures the ambivalence that so many women live and cope with. Even beautiful, successful, sexy women have self-doubt and problems with men. What I found amusing and fascinating was how the so-called \"consciousness raising\" in this film differed from the kind I was part of in the 60's and 70's. This film shows women taking control of themselves and their lives with much more fun, flare, and flashiness. I also think Graham did a great job of weaving the stories of the three friends throughout the film. This also made the film so much about the importance of female friendships in our lives. \nOverall, it turned out to be much better than I thought it would. It's a film that's fun and insightful, too.","user":"Moviegoer19","rank":[17,27]},{"title":"Very enjoyable,funny, sexy movie !!!","rating":7,"date":"5 March 2018","review":"As first reviewer for this movie, I have to say that I really enjoyed it, it has all the elements for a nice romantic comedy, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend a lovely, funny, sexy time.","user":"tizipapa","rank":[18,33]}]
