[{"title":"Good Enough","rating":5,"date":"9 November 2018","review":"A classic manga based live action that didn't manage to leave its mark. The story was interesting at first and the boy was an entertaining character, funny and adorable. His love story with the girl was a bit awkward at first, but it got better. Then there was the cliche ending that kind of ruined this one for me.\nOther than that, the performances were good and the settings well managed. So, 5 out of 10.","user":"pennyelenabooks","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"love the manga & anime, but not this live action","rating":5,"date":"22 February 2020","review":"I'm the fans of Robico's original manga &amp; anime. How many times I read the manga, I really love the story &amp; everything.Like I say in my Kimi Ni Todoke live action's review before. They want to pack everything from the 13 vol manga in this nearly 2 hour movie. It will be impossible. Should use Ore Monogatari style. Just focus on the main plot, forget all the subplot. It will be messed up with not enough space. Love-hate.","user":"fluffset","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Sweet story","rating":10,"date":"8 March 2019","review":"Really enjoyed this wasn't expecting too wouldn't be a Japanese manga without a few tears the ending is what i hoped for","user":"joanne-78049","rank":[0,0]}]
