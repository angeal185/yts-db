[{"title":"A modern day horror tale","rating":10,"date":"29 April 2019","review":"'What will people say' isn't any easy movie. It'll make you fall in love with Nisha, root for her, enjoy life with her and when all her freedom is curtailed you will cry for her, feel disturbed , haunted and by the end of the movie , like Nisha ,you too will crave for her freedom, wish to be broken from the shackles that her parents have imposed on her, pray to run away as far as possible and to live life to the fullest . Maria Mozhdah as Nisha perfectly embodies the life of thousands of girls in India and Pakistan who are forced to play along the whims and fancies of their parents. Their voices are muted, actions are restricted and in the end they become mere puppets in the hands of their parent who live the way the society wants them to. When Mirza tells Nisha \" you mean everything to me\" his everything matters less than his society's opinions. He is happy to lock up his daughter,mentally abuse her and take away her freedom if that is what the society wants. It isn't Nisha but 'what will people say' that means everything to him.<br><br>This Norwegian piece of art is a must watch for its raw emotions, gripping story line and gorgeous frames. The movie will stay deep with you, haunt you and in the end remind you of how far ahead we are of freedom.","user":"kannan_here","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Thank you Iram for telling what is happening behind the doors","rating":10,"date":"1 September 2019","review":"I wish I had the guts and courage to talk about what happens to me as a girl in Iran.\nThank you Iram Hag for this movie.","user":"nilookohan","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Thrilling Father and Daughter Fracas","rating":10,"date":"31 October 2017","review":"\"You mean everything to me,\" Mirza tells his teenage daughter Nisha. Apparently \"everything\" is far less important than what others might say, for Mirza cares deeply about such opinions. When it is discovered that Nisha sneaks out the window at night, adopts Western ways and is not the compliant and traditional Pakistani daughter she appears, Mirza goes ballistic. Nisha is as stubborn as her father though and manages to outsmart him at first, but there is little sympathy from other relatives. They encourage Mirza's firm hand. Nisha's smart phone is chucked into the snow, freedoms are drastically curtailed and Nisha is threatened with a one-way ticket to Islamabad. Sooner or later father or daughter, or both, must break. <br><br>I thought I knew where this film was going, but it went deeper than I thought it would and in different directions. The story is fantastic and thrilling; dead ends become glimmers of light (and the other way around), characters are torn apart by the choices they make and there are intriguing glimpses into the Norse and Pakistani ways of life. The director is a natural. She controls mood like a sorceress; sound is contrasted with silence, close-ups reveal the glimmer of flames in the eyes of characters and scenes flow seamlessly into each other. The acting is not flawless, but thoroughly convincing. The ending scene will stay with me, hopefully forever. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.","user":"Raven-1969","rank":[29,40]}]
