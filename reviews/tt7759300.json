[{"title":"a gorgeous debut film - must see","rating":10,"date":"26 November 2019","review":"This film is stunning. A quiet piece, weaving through different periods of time seamlessly, it captures the volatility and tenderness of two people genuinely trying to make their love work, even as it is falling apart. I smiled all the way through it, even as my heart broke for them. The cinematography is stunning, it's effortlessly directed (by first-time director, Tom Cullen, who has an excellent command of both visual and emotional language) and beautifully acted. Tatiana Maslany is superb, and Jay Duplass does some of his best work. Couldn't recommend more highly.","user":"dannyduncombe1","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"An emotional rollercoaster","rating":10,"date":"26 November 2019","review":"A truly beautifully film.

The acting performances felt real and I really believed their relationships. It beautiful to look at and paced really well. Tom has done a great job weaving the story and making something that feels authentic and heartbreaking and beautiful. I loved it","user":"ben-mcgregor1","rank":[8,13]}]
