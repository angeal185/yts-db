This movie is powerfull and emotional and gives a complete image of this time (1926-1929) and position of women. A film about perseverance and romance.","user":"jclangenberg","rank":[30,36]},{"title":"More attention on women in History","rating":8,"date":"7 March 2019","review":"This is a very good movie to shine more light in women in history, from whom you have never heard before. Excellent acting even in smaller parts.\nAlthough the film is a bit long, you are eager to know how the story ends. I enjoyed the music,the picture quality and the acting.","user":"rahngerhard","rank":[11,16]},{"title":"very meaningful true story","rating":9,"date":"5 March 2019","review":"Aside from the current 6.9 rating, I hope it gets much higher rating, the story itself is already amazing, there is depth in this story, bring the viewer's view of how a women become an outstanding musician conductor and characteristic itself is very reasoned. yeah, maybe there might be some subtle scene there can be improved, but i couldn't find any, i just find that the actor, the story, the lightning and the dramatic moment is well composed and serves its purpose.After finished watching it, it strengthen my point of views, everything serve a purpose but, there must be a beneficial meaning behind it which lead us to eternal success, i think most of us tends to give up because reality make us live in fear, but it is because life is about suffering so why not try to enjoy it and live in a meaningful ways of live.ðŸ˜‚","user":"vincent_lin","rank":[8,11]}]
