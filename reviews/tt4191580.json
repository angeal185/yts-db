[{"title":"Quite predictable, yet still funny-ish","rating":7,"date":"25 August 2016","review":"After watching this film and seeing both sides of the argument. I was left (again) on the fence but a little bit to the good side. A pretty interesting purge parody movie, about a family moving to Beverly Hills during the purge and then getting ransacked.<br><br>Obviously people will argue that this film is \"racist\", as per usual, and to some extent it kind of is, and obviously during the purge, everyone wants to kill them. But because its a comedy film, we should take everything as satire with a pinch of salt. From my point of view, its a funny comedy that made me laugh quite a lot, and i see no downside apart from the alleged \"racism\". This means, its not for everyone.<br><br>But at the end of the day, my words to you are: If your easily offended, don't watch it. If your not, then why not give it a shot?","user":"gpoposki","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Awesome comedy","rating":9,"date":"3 April 2016","review":"Meet The Blacks is a very funny comedy! I was a little pessimistic at first, I was afraid it would be too stereotypical but it had me in tears from beginning to end. It's a great parody of the movie The Purge (which I also loved by the way). The story: Carl Black moves his family to Beverly Hills thinking there's no annual purge there (a night where anybody can get away with murder); Shout out to Mike Epps, Lil Duval and Bresh Webb who are shining in this film! I did not really know Lil Duval but his role is hilarious! A lot of comedy legends are also appearing: Charlie Murphy, Paul Mooney...even Snoop Dogg is in it! Great job for a low-budget and independent film! I recommend anyone who wants a good laugh to go see it!","user":"lauraalbouy","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Tired of people complaining about Parody's","rating":10,"date":"6 April 2016","review":"At this point if you are still trying to break down a parody movie from every angle and inspect it then you are wasting your time. Parody movies are literally designed to not be a good movie. The only thing it's for is to make you laugh. Everyone knows this so why every time a new one is made people expect more? Honestly these type of movies are for people who like to laugh and usually don't care how it turns out. I understand some of you may feel if it's a theatrical release then it should be at least worth the money but it's very hard to please everyone when it comes to music and art and it has always come down to a preference thing. I am giving this a 10 out of 10 because it made me laugh the whole time and that's all these movies are made for. I expected nothing else from it and I got nothing else from it.There was no great story line or amazing actors just good Ole parody humor.","user":"CoolKid23","rank":[1,1]}]
