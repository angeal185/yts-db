[{"title":"Classic among Big-Headed Monsters","rating":13,"date":"13 April 2000","review":"One of the five sci-fi's I remember every single detail of from my earliest days as a fan. For the genre, I think it's considerably above average. The moor is nicely atmospheric. There's one of every character in the book: the good guy, the bad guy, the local sheriff, the lovely damsel, her father the old professor, etc. The scene where we're looking for the first time through the window of the ship and the visitor peeks out from the other side is easily as good as the three-fingered-hand-on-the-shoulder in War of the Worlds. Nice \"character\" to the visitor, for whom, like Karloff's Frankenstein, we end up feeling some empathy .","user":"clearwrite","rank":[38,40]},{"title":"Mildly Entertaining and Historically Important","rating":8,"date":"11 October 2010","review":"If this film had come out in the mid-50's, it could be dismissed as another low-budget, silly outer space invasion movie. However this movie appears to have been the first of such space invasion movies. It opened in March of 1951. Later that year came the openings of \"The Thing from Another Planet\" and \"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\" Two other 1951 films, \"When Worlds Collide\" and \"Superman and the Mole Men\" have some space invader elements, but don't quite qualify for the genre.<br><br>The fact that it was shot in six days on a budget of $43,000 makes it more amazing. Compare that to \"The Thing From Another World\" ($1.6 million) or the \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\" ($1.2 million). While none of the technical aspects come near those two movies, the movie does have an interesting style and look that foreshadows the 1953 classic \"Invaders From Mars\" and even has elements from \"Invasino of the Body Snatchers\".<br><br>The movie is a little ambiguous about whether we are dealing with unfriendly (a la \"The Thing\")or friendly aliens (a la \"The Day\"). It seems a bit schizophrenic here with an alien that can be scary in one scene and downright adorable in another. Not having any prior such movies to really go by, the writers seem unsure in which direction to go.<br><br>Robert Clark is fine in the lead as a newspaper reporter. Margaret Field (Sally Field's mother) is good as the female love interest. William Schallert (Uncle Martin or Papo on \"The Patty Duke Show) stands out as a surprisingly creepy scientific assistant. <br><br>What really carries the film is Edgar Ulmer's energetic direction. Ulmer (\"Black Cat\" \"The Strange Woman\" and \"Detour\")always keeps the viewer on their toes, inserting off-beat and unexpected material in nearly every scene. <br><br>It is a must for film history buffs and others will find it engagingly silly.","user":"jayraskin1","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"A Shoestring Budgetter.","rating":18,"date":"18 June 2004","review":"A shoestring budgetter directed by Edgar Ulmer. One of the first (if not the first) alien invasion films.  The little alien, a child-like being with a big, solemn face, is known to Scottish villagers as 'the bogey' and strikes mortal terror into their hearts with his HypnoRay, a laserlike beam which reduces them to easily programmable zomboids. His motives are unclear throughout the film until a hypnoidal Dr. Mears 'spills the beans' near its end.  Strong points: eerie atmosphere, production design; moody 'film noir' photography, engaging music score and interesting story.  Weak points:  muddled script(more plotholes than a Stephen King cemetry); stilted dialogue and wooden acting.  Recommended only for diehard 1950s sci-fi fans(like myself)- this film is both a joy and a disappointment.","user":"Whizzer-2","rank":[31,35]}]
