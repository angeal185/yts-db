[{"title":"More holes in the plot than a Swiss cheese","rating":4,"date":"1 January 2016","review":"If you want a serious heist movie with decent acting and script then forget this load of nonsense but if you just want a movie with decent action scenes that provides entertainment then it will fit the bill. De Nero apart the acting is awful with Bautista the worst of a bad bunch trying to play a tough guy but just comes across as the dumbest criminal you could imagine. Police act against orders, patrol officers suddenly take on the role of FBI and any cop who has watched hostage movies would not fall for the old hostage criminal switch to get away. People are suddenly transported across America in minutes and the whole plan by Morgan relies on too many variables going his way for it to be taken seriously. My advice would be forget trying to make sense of the plot as it makes no sense just enjoy the action scenes and tick off as another movie watched.","user":"igstevensons","rank":[22,28]},{"title":"Good story and acting","rating":8,"date":"31 January 2019","review":"Great performances performances by DeNiro, Morgan and Bautista.<br><br>I feel some parts needed a little more 'oomph' as it felt dragged out a bit - a directing issue perhaps, by novice director Scott Mann, but forgivable seeing this was his 2nd full length feature film.<br><br>The screenplay could've used some tweaking, but the story itself was great - both by novice writer Stephen C.

I may be biased 'cause De Niro has always been my favourite actor, but I believe he accepted this role because it is indeed a nice variation on the theme. It may seem the \"same\" gangster stuff with his moves and faces we all know well, but it is also different, deeper, wider. And, it delivers a nice message. So, De Niro is surely not one of those actors who have to accept any role just to survive. He can select what to do, and if at the beginning of the movie I thought \"why did you accept to do once again an over-the-top sort of gangster which you did 10000 times and adds nothing more to your repertoire?\", now I am sure that he accepted this role because he believed in it, as I do now too. All other actors were also very good, specially Jeffrey Dean Morgan, whom I do not mean to reduce to a \"mix of Javier Bardem and Bruce Willis\", but he does indeed remember me of both. This is not a masterpiece and it does not shake the art of Cinema, but it is a very nice movie which flows fast and does not leave you empty.","user":"altersaege","rank":[63,100]}]
