[{"title":"Honest review of Winterskin","rating":3,"date":"23 June 2019","review":"Winterskin is a low budget horror flick out of the UK. I am a fan of low budget horror movies but this one is really not worth the watch. The whole production is subpar but what really drags this movie down is the annoying dialogue and piss-poor acting. It's hard to tell if it's the actor's are ruining the dialogue or the dialogue is making the actors sound amateurish. The fake accents are cringe-worthy bad, and that added to the fact that the film is so dialogue heavy only makes it worse. If you took a drink every time that Ol Agnes obnoxiously says \"child\", you'd be passed out drunk within the first half hour (and maybe that wouldn't be such a bad thing).<br><br>The story itself is kind of original and unique but there's a strange shift in the tone about halfway through where everything grinds to a halt and the story becomes complete back and forth dialogue between the two characters and it turns monotonous.<br><br>The few effects that are used aren't horrible, but the fake blood looks and flies like dark red water, with a whole 64oz Big Gulp cup of blood spewing from each bullet wound. I realize that it's a horror movie, but that's not how that works at all.<br><br>Without going into any details, the ending is pretty weak and not worth the tedious ride. I honestly can't even recommend this one to the hardcore horror fans out there, as watching this one felt more like a chore because of the grinding dialogue and the fact that there are much better low budget offerings out there. Skip it. 3/10","user":"mikedegroot","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"My Review Of \"Winterskin\"","rating":7,"date":"9 June 2019","review":"\"Winterskin\" is a throwback to classic creature horror, blending folklore with ethereal, whimsy and nightmare. It is reminiscent of the atmosphere and character drama found in 80's anthology series such as \"Tales From The Darkside\". There is an almost \"home entertainment\" quality, that despite the film's flaws, makes \"Winterskin\" captivating and entertaining.<br><br>The story is a straightforward concept with an almost wildness survival aspect, fitting somewhere between The Donner Party and Windego. It keeps with the microbudget, indie horror feel. The cast is great at bringing these doomed characters to life. And, even though the more minial dialog stumbles, there is a lot of theatrical, twisted juiciness written in \"Winterskin\" that plays with both amusement and gothic elements, adding to this bizarre and chilling tale.<br><br>The special effects on display in \"Winterskin\" is excellent. The gruesome and macabre nature of the \"skinless\" is disturbing, reminding me of Frank in \"Hellraiser\". There are a couple of exploding blood bag effects that tease a more 3-dimensional, graphic novel style, which despite the intent, come off as hokey. Beyond that the horror elements are great, placing this indie horror above the expected dreg. Pair that with nostalgia inducing cinematography and a total 80's music score, and \"Winterskin\" is a definite one to watch.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[7,16]},{"title":"The boring, the terrible and the misleading.","rating":1,"date":"13 February 2020","review":"Hateful eight, this is not. Wow. Just hatefully terrible. Where to begin? The hero is a joke. This guy couldn't stop a squirrel let alone a human being. He spends half the movie making stupid decision after stupid decision all while whining like a baby. He couldn't even overpower an old woman. Being crazy doesn't give anyone supernatural strength so why couldn't he stop \"old Agnes?\" This movie is only 1:24 in length but it felt like 2:30. Then there's the triple-shot double barreled shotgun. O__o No joke. And a repeater that had to be reloaded after each shot which was absolutely baffling. Oh, plus there's the cover art on Amazon Prime. Showing a person holding an assault shotgun, with a sidearm strapped to their leg, while creatures not even close to resembling the skinned people in the film break in through the window. Absolutely egregious false advertising.","user":"proverbs_1-974-441276","rank":[1,1]}]
