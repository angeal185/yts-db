[{"title":"Definitely worth watching for horror film fans.","rating":7,"date":"17 April 2020","review":"If you like the Clive Barker Horror films Hellraiser and Nightbreed, you will definitely like this film. The film is just over an hour and is pretty fast paced. Robert Davi is a favorite actor of mine and has had cameo roles in great cult films like Die Hard and Predator 2. He also starred in the third Maniac Cop film. He is definitely the best actor in the film and his acting is still good as ever.<br><br><br><br>The movie is about a mysterious person called simply: The Dealer. Once your wish is made he chants an incantation sealing the deal. After the wish comes true(it always does), a portal opens and drags you physically into hell to be butchered by a creature called the Pigster.\nThe movie is about a group of teens making a deal and some ending up in the hands of the Pigster.<br><br>\nThe movie has okay special-effects. The background music is also top-notch. I have no doubt there will be more Pigster films later on. Overall 7/10 decent time-pass film.","user":"Vivekmaru45","rank":[0,0]}]
