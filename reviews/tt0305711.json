[{"title":"This movie is......","rating":7,"date":"22 June 2006","review":"a teen movie. I enjoyed it because well I'm a teen. The comedy could have been better, but there were some funny moments, like when Tom was attacked by the pigeons, and when Tom and Peter were fighting. It was pretty predictable, but I am a fan of corny romantic comedies, and if you are, you will want to see this movie. it is a heartwarming film that any Ashton or Brittany fan will want to see. It does not reflect the best work of anyone but it is enjoyable none the less. Final review: A cheesy, not that great movie, with an enjoyable plot and a nice cast.<br><br>Rent it but don't rush out and buy it","user":"RainInRivendell","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"funny","rating":7,"date":"19 August 2006","review":"OK, the story wasn't brilliant, and the ending was predictable. There wasn't anything really amazing about this movie. But, I loved it. A lot. It made me laugh, a lot and thats all I really care about. Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher were great together, they made a really good pair. I'm not a huge Ashton fan, but I do think he is funny, and this was probably the best movie I've seen out of the ones I've seen him in. Same with Brittany Murphy, although I really haven't seen much of her stuff. Like I said, the story is simple and predictable, but if you don't care about that kind of stuff then I'd recommend for a few laughs, nothing more, nothing less. =]","user":"xtimetowastexx","rank":[33,46]},{"title":"cute. that's all","rating":28,"date":"28 December 2007","review":"The much reviled 'romanntic comedy' genre always takes the form of a) meet cute b) fall \"in love,\" c) get into a fight, and d) reunite at the last minute after a music montage. For these reasons it receives heaps of scorn. But there's a range of romantic comedies, and really any frame of this is preferable to something like \"Just Friends.\" The travel footage is very nice. But as always with the genre it defaults to unimaginative clich√©s as when in France they make room for lots of french-bashing. Really... the French are kind until they meet a jackass like Kutcher's character. And the cause of it all (Kutcher likes sports) is introduced to his wife about twelve seconds before the plot point needs to be utilized.<br><br>In the end, Kutcher is declaring his undying love for whatsherface for no clearer reason than he's young and the young are prone to cavalier promises about forever because they sampled so little of it. Which means they're not any further than where they started. But what did you expect from a romantic comedy?<br><br>If I remember correctly, the movies \"Caffe America\" exterior is actually the only gay bar in Venice.","user":"onepotato2","rank":[4,4]}]
