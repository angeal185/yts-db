[{"title":"Interesting and will likely watch other movie adaptations of the books in the series.","rating":3,"date":"15 April 2020","review":"I enjoyed the movie. The incidental music did not cause me to want to scream which was a pleasant surprise. There were enough characters to keep me alert, figuring out the possibilities. There were no doppelg√§ngers among the cast. If it is necessary for two or more characters to look alike to support the storyline that's okay-but if its a thing the casting director has, no thanks.<br><br>I read the \"factual goofs\" after watching the movie, thankfully. I entirely disagree with with two of them and a third is misrepresented. I know of no other way to dispute them. In the hopes of making your isolation/streaming experience a little different see if you agree.","user":"lyntanstanley","rank":[1,1]}]
