[{"title":"A great techno thriller of the 90s","rating":10,"date":"24 July 2018","review":"\"The Net\" is a great movie, still very watchable to this day.\nThe story line can get confusing, but that is where Rewatching comes in. \nSome movies are like that, you have to Rewatch to understand the plot fully.<br><br>Even though the technology compared to today seems stale back then, it still somehow works out because technology is constantly becoming advanced.<br><br>We see \"Angela Bennett\"'s life go into turmoil after getting her hands on computer information. We see that she is a clever tech nerd, but is very naive on the social aspect which resulted in her almost getting killed on holiday.<br><br>\"The Net\" is a fast-paced riveting hi-tech thriller. Sandra Bullock carries the entire movie on her back very well. She is a strong main lead and the supporting characters are also very good in their roles. I'd say the only other main character is \"Jack Devlin\" (Played by Jeremy Northam) he is also good in his role.<br><br>\"The Net\" is a cat and mouse game/clear my name/bring justice type of thriller. I would put this next to another brilliant movie of this genre - \"AntiTrust\", although it is not as well known as \"The Net\" it is just as good.","user":"nadinesalakovv","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"'The Fugitive' Meets AOL","rating":6,"date":"30 December 2012","review":"Nostalgia may play a large part of my positive feelings towards this film as I watched it repeatedly on video with my younger sister as a teen. Back then \"the net\" was a new and largely undiscovered frontier, and this film romanticized hackers and the seemingly mysterious world wide web.<br><br>I would liken this to a less ambitious version of 'The Fugitive', a film that released two years prior (and by most accounts a superior thriller). Much of what happens in the course of this film is standard fare, but it is presented with a semblance of realism and never seems to hit any lulls or real snags in rhythm despite the frenetic pacing. The plot isn't entirely plausible or devoid of clich√©s, but it remains interesting from start to finish, and Bullock carries the role well.<br><br>There are scattered scenes that show astute directing on the part of Irwin Winkler, though some of the secondary characters give uneven performances. However, Bullock does an admirable service at depicting a frumpy insular woman uncomfortable with her own sexuality and outer beauty. Her character is both resourceful and vulnerable at once, and it's a fresh pace to see a female lead with some layers to peel back in a genre dominated by men. Dennis Miller is very likable in his role, and ably acts the part with a more downplayed version of his real life persona. He was my favorite character by far and brought a lot of warmth to the role.<br><br>I'm usually very critical of any movies I see, and am generally turned off by standard Hollywood fodder, but there is a certain charm to 'The Net' that I can't deny. I liked it in '95, and I like it again almost twenty years later. Like visiting an old friend, there's a familiarity to it that is so hopelessly 90's and so reminiscent of a bygone era--the inception of the internet age--that it carries a certain weight to me unmatched by the multitude of forgettable popcorn thrillers of the decade.","user":"The_Centurion","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Gripping thriller or goofy time capsule?","rating":8,"date":"23 August 2015","review":"I like \"The Net.\" I first saw it back in 1996, on VHS probably. We probably didn't have the Internet yet, or it was very new to us. So this was all very exciting, but scary too. There was a great sense of fear around identity theft. In 2015, we are such internexhibitionists with social media and twitter that people become lax and then their private sex-text photos get shared with billions of people. <br><br>The Net is a good thriller with an excellent title that is elevated by the charisma of star Sandra Bullock (still a star in 2015, amazing). Bullock is an incredible role model as a female hero: she is smart, funny, feminine and likable. The main issue for The Net over the years has been the march of time itself. Thrillers require a certain immediacy and immersion, and the mentioning of goofy out of date technological jargon risks dragging you out of the moment. As a period piece, or a time capsule, The Net is perfect, but does it still work as it did for audiences in 1995?<br><br>Luckily, the Net is not really about technology, its about the nature of identity in a bureaucracy, explored through the lens of technology, with the interweb as a weapon, and those issues are still relatable, and a movie like The Net serves as a good reminder of how trusting we have become of our internet privacy.","user":"Ben_Cheshire","rank":[18,22]}]
