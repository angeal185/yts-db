[{"title":"A lush budget guilty pleasure","rating":17,"date":"17 December 2001","review":"Paul Newman is doing his angry young man thing here, and Joanne Woodward is wonderful as she goes from rebellious rich brat to shrewish, slutty harridan.  It's beautifully filmed with lots of sumptuous sets  and it's obvious that a good part of the budget went to costumes.  If you like movies with boozy, unhappy rich people who do little more than snipe at each other, you've got to see \"From the Terrace.\"","user":"mcbee-1","rank":[25,27]},{"title":"A smart, heavy-going family melodrama,...","rating":7,"date":"26 June 2005","review":"Although based on a John O'Hara novel, \"From the Terrace\" is another 'Young Philadelphians': a smart, heavy-going family melodrama, set from the late forties to the late fifties, with Newman as an angry young opportunist from Philadelphia <br><br>Again the moral (which undoubted1y attracted him) is that the drive for wealth and power corrupts innocence and love Here there's more of a motivation, the old reliable one: his father hates him... He tells his cold, nasty father (Leon Ames), \"All I ever wanted was to be friends with you,\" then defiantly rejects the family's fairly substantial steel mill He wants moreto make $5 million by age forty, to be better than his old man<br><br>On his way up the cynical path to Wall Street, he ignores his marriage, driving his once-sweet wife (Woodward) to bitchery and into the bed of an old flame He works intensively to become a high financier, but suddenly realizes how empty his life is; unlike Tony Lawrence (\"The Young Philadelphians\"), he drops out completely, leaving his failed marriage and flourishing career to marry a wholesome small-town woman<br><br>Newman battles valiantly with incredible soap opera contrivances, crises and inflated dialog, but he loses He's worst in his scenes with the decent young woman (Ina Balin), because the relationship is improbable, their talk about love is slow, and he's not convincing as the shy, gentle lover We've seen him earlier as sexually confident and aggressive, and besides, Newman is not very good at expressing tenderness <br><br>He's excellent at the beginning, indicating bitterness toward his father with contemptuous facial expressions, although here, as elsewhere, his tendency to show tension or self-absorption by blinking and looking away during conversations is overdone<br><br>But with Woodward, he and the film really come to life During their first meetings, as he comes on strong and she resists, the antagonism, flavored with overtones of desperate sexuality, reminds us of \"The Long, Hot Summer.\" Then, in their marriage, the roles are reversed: he becomes immersed in business, and she becomes sexually frustrated, creating a highly-charged tension between them <br><br>There's a beautifully acted scene near the end when, like Maggie the Cat, she pathetically flaunts her sexuality at him and he merely sits there with a world-weary look Ironically, Woodward make the wife so vital and pathetic that it's hard to accept her as a bitch, and the ending makes little sense...","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[38,43]},{"title":"My Newman Fandom Started Here","rating":8,"date":"6 March 2004","review":"Paul Newman has many more famous roles...but for some reason, this is one of my all time favorite movies of his. It comes on the Love Stories, AMC, or TCM cable channels every here and now...or you could just buy it like I did.<br><br>He's nice, determined, well-meaning Alfred Eaton, who starts off with lofty, wealthy ideas about what is important in life...the right woman, the right career, the right friends...and showing them all how important he can be when he has them. Ultimately, he learns that what is important is only what feels right to him alone.<br><br>I love his story of personal discovery as much as his love affair story with Natalie. Alfred and Natalie have this beautiful scene where they are saying goodbye, they're barely touching, but it's the most painfully romantic thing to see.<br><br>Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward have some excellent scenes in this movie also with real good comeback dialogue. He's the hardworking, decent man and she's the desperate-to-impress and just plain desperate society wife. She self-righteously and hurtfully accuses him of adultery with a girl with no guts when she's been sleeping with her ex-fiancee all along. She actually calls her lover and arranges a tryst while her husband is in the room!!!! She has guts!!!! Unbeknownst to her, Alfred has exhaustingly if unaffectedly (if you can look unaffected and disgusted at the same time, that is) done his best to makes her invisible in the room, but she probably just becomes invisible without any real effort on his part to make her so by that point. Their voices just have the most impactful tones...especially when they get to play off of each other. I can play their final scene over and over again where she says she won't give him a divorce and he says,\"Any further communication between you and me will be through legal channels.\" He has the most genuine smile on that handsome face in that moment than through the entire movie!!!!!<br><br>This movie is actually pretty long, but not a moment is wasted. It all comes together in the end when Alfred finally chooses what he actually wants instead of what he's supposed to want.<br><br>Maybe it's because it's so subtle and not at all like a \"movie\" that it seems to be largely overlooked by everyone except me and 20 other people. Paul Newman is one fine, naturally classy actor, I say.","user":"tracee","rank":[18,19]}]
