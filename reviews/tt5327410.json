[{"title":"Touching, understated","rating":7,"date":"6 March 2019","review":"A simple movie, but not necessarily predictable (the main twist in the plot I didn't see coming). This film deserves a high rating: it's not high drama, but instead is beautifully understated. I enjoyed the acting as none of the characters were incomprehensibly evil, overly emotional or crazy. They were just simple caring people in an unusual situation. Some aspects of the plot were a little unbelievable, but it didn't spoil the overall story which is a positive message of love for our fellow human, and compassion. So many films are about romantic love or defending the family or other selfish methods of preserving our own genes. This film reaches something about how it is to empathise with someone else, and how love doesn't have to be selfish or even logical, but is just how we are. Yep, can be considered a family movie, but I feel that denegrates what is actually a well filmed, nicely acted and simple but beautiful story. Yup, I cried. And as a late 40s ex military, it wasn't cos of something pathetic and superficial, but because of something touching and profound. I recommend this to everyone over 16 (younger people can watch and enjoy it but probably will find it difficult sympathising with a protagonist who is much older, dealing with meeting his daughter for the first time in 20 years).","user":"uberdonkey6","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"WHAT A CHARMING and DELIGHTFUL MOVIE","rating":8,"date":"7 September 2019","review":"With all of the violence and excessive sex in today's movies, it was so wonderful to watch a movie that had none of that, but instead has depth and warmth. One Last Thing is one of the sweetest and tenderest movie I have seen in years. I wasn't expecting something so touching from a movie that wasn't highly rated. Big mistake by those that rated it. I don't even remember seeing it advertised at the movies. But I am glad that Netflix picked it up. Kudos to the writers and to the actors. Well done.","user":"anitalansing-40-581915","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Very beautiful!","rating":10,"date":"31 August 2019","review":"I loved all the actors and actresses! Very heartfelt.
