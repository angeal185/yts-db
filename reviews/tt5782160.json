[{"title":"Really bad","rating":24,"date":"24 December 2018","review":"It makes no sense whatsoever, just a bunch of random scenes stuck together that don't even seem to belong together. This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen! Glad I didn't pay to see it. Don't waste your time!","user":"Dave_douell","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Entirely lame","rating":1,"date":"25 November 2018","review":"No, this isn't the excellent Thai horror flick about a photographer who finds himself haunted by a spirit manifesting in his photographs; it's not even the lacklustre American remake of that film. No, this is a cheap indie thriller told entirely through close-up conversation scenes between non-actors, and it's as boring as they come. A girl is being stalked by a photographer, with some mild supernatural elements to the story to mix things up a bit, but it's entirely lame and slow, with nothing of interest happening at any point.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Yikes this is bad","rating":3,"date":"20 January 2020","review":"It's the cheapo Oculus with the siblings who watched a mirror ghost take over their daddy and kill both parents but the brother is locked up for the crimes. Years later the brother is released to successful sister but the ghost in the mirror is still there. It is so bad that I won't insult all the movies it rips off by listing them. (Sorry Oculus)","user":"killercharm","rank":[0,0]}]
