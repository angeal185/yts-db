Who are all these others? No Duff, Slash, Izzy? Not even Matt on drums? Axl does what he does but the magic is nowhere to bee seen. This lineup has as much stage presence as Disturbed. I miss the days of Live at the Roxy right through to the Tokyo Dome. Do yourself a favour and just Youtube the original stuff.","user":"trebornotlimah","rank":[3,5]}]
