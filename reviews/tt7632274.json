Maybe minus 3.","rating":1,"date":"29 January 2020","review":"As I write this , Red-handed (this title makes no sense) has a 3 star average here and that is being way too generous. This is garbage, boring, stupid, and some of the worst acting ever, I mean reading off of cue cards bad. This is not a horror movie, a thriller, not even a tiny bit suspenseful, and the actors seem to be competing for who can be the most wooden. I can understand Michael Madsen acting in this, he has no career, but I like Michael Biehn and he not only acts in this but had a hand in the production. WHY, Michael, Why ? Madsen's son Christian stars in this and I doubt he'll have his father's career (I'm not sure if that is a good\nthing or bad). Worst acting in the movie hands down goes to Owen Burke , playing one of the 3 brothers, who don't look even a little alike. His acting was so bad it was unreal, as if just off camera someone were holding a loved one hostage and he was forced to read his lines in one take. The whole thing looks like it was shot in a week. Not even so bad it's funny. One of those movies where you feel embarrassed for everyone involved.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Can only give 3 out of 10","rating":3,"date":"19 January 2020","review":"As agreed, slow a lot of the time, and only in last 10 mins is it interesting. Not a horror/thriller, more like a drama/psychological<br><br>Puzzled me at the end though? The women were integral to the story, but what happened to them at the end? They didn't tie that one up???","user":"enquries_2","rank":[2,4]}]
