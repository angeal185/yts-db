[{"title":"Awesome!","rating":12,"date":"12 April 2018","review":"Bjarke Ingels indeed is one of the most talented architects in the nowadays ever changing world. In this film, we could really his serene yet powerful prospect that he would give to the world with some of the most tauting yet also the most beautiful environmentally friendly futuristic man-made structures which set forth the modern day civilization of living and working spheres all around us in either the big cities or countryside. His designs are all unique, his ideas all down to earth practical but at the same time, aesthetically eye-appealing. This Danish architect is an architect without borders. He is like a stork, bring beautiful babies all over the world. <br><br>It's a pity that we couldn't understand when he spoke in Danish. It also omitted some incident that caused his minor concussion that worried him quite a bit. Also, it seemed to me that most of the time when he relocated to New York, he somehow became a lonely person without normal family life. His wife later showed up in the end, did him a quick bowtie job in the limo by referring to a \"How to\" video from Youtube. <br><br>I am not quite sure about the design that he'd put in Hualien, Taiwan later, that design is sure Gotham ugly and ghost-like repelling, building on an doomed earthquake belt on the east coast of that island. All his other future projects are looking pretty good.","user":"LogicIsEverything","rank":[2,5]}]
