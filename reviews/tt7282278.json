[{"title":"A tedious journey","rating":3,"date":"10 March 2019","review":"\"What the heck is going on in this movie?!\" is what I kept asking myself throughout this film, and I am still asking. Supposedly this film has to be seen twice to really get it. I submit that there's not that much to get.<br><br>Nothing happens in this film. The twist ending that explains everything does not save it. A mystery needs to have something interesting happening as it unfolds, and this film is just endless dialogue with no action. Silly contests pass for story milestones. Unlikable characters pass for story development.<br><br>A good puzzle movie is an interesting story that turns out to have another level completely. (Think about The Sixth Sense: The kid sees dead people throughout the whole movie, then it turns out something else has been happening right in front of us.) This is a boring story that has a convenient explanation. Even if the second viewing is more interesting, is it really worth sitting through the first viewing? For a good low-budget puzzle movie, see Blood Punch (2014).<br><br>Props to Nicholas Tucci who convincingly portrays Richard as a rich frat boy douchebag.","user":"moviefansme","rank":[35,51]},{"title":"What a fun ride","rating":9,"date":"27 May 2019","review":"Where do I even begin... this film was erotic, weird, thrilling, creepy, suspenseful, sexual, provocative and I could go on. I loved the creepy \"brother\". He played weird so incredibly well. The cast was only 4 people which you don't realize because this is such a terrific film. It wasn't until towards the end that it really hit. I loved the way this film was shot, the acting was exceptional and it had a wonderful story. This film did it for me. I'm glad to give this film a big thumbs up.","user":"craig-ahrens","rank":[17,26]},{"title":"Ex Machina without the robot","rating":3,"date":"11 March 2019","review":"What the heck is this movie about?! Nothing happens, it's all about the twist at the end, and that's not enough to save it.
