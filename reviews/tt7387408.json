[{"title":"The best of the bunch","rating":9,"date":"15 October 2017","review":"Having seen all the shorts and the new movie I have to say that this is the most 'Blade Runner' of the 4. It may only be 5 Min's long but for those 5 Min's I felt like was watching a deleted scene from the original. It has the right gritty noir feel to it. Mr Bautista is coming on leaps and bounds with his acting career, big thumbs up here.","user":"kurgan_uk","rank":[25,26]},{"title":"A pretty interesting prequel","rating":11,"date":"11 October 2017","review":"The short film \"2048: Nowhere to Run\" shows how Sapper Morton (Dave Bautista) draws the attention from the police. Actually those who watch the film \"Blade Runner 2049\" might get confused about Sapper Morton, who appears at the start of \"Blade Runner 2049\". And this short just provides the answer.","user":"TheBigSick","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Really good!","rating":6,"date":"5 September 2018","review":"Yes, this was really good and it leaves you wanting more. Dave Bautista gives a great performance here and the cinematography is lovely. The set looked great too for what it was. For these five minutes you are in this universe.","user":"logicproreviews","rank":[2,2]}]
