[{"title":"Be warned this film contains acting!","rating":10,"date":"28 April 2018","review":"I was intrigued by the title so thought give it a go. disappointingly there were no special effects, explosions or alien monsters just a simple story relayed to us by actors of all things,because of all this it will not qualify for any awards other than my own lowly opinion.\nI laughed I cried, became angry and gave it the accolade of the best film I have seen for a long time, whatever tosh other people may say about this tale I enjoyed it, so lets have some more films with a story to tell without the bangs and bloodbaths","user":"jakits","rank":[395,427]},{"title":"You all should be proud.","rating":10,"date":"5 May 2018","review":"This is a message to everyone involved in this film. I hope you check your reviews on IMDB. As you look back on your careers I hope you consider this film one of your highlights. You did a fabulous job. Great sets, fabulous writing, spot on hair and costumes! I was enthralled by your acting and direction. A great night out at the movies. Thank you all.","user":"thefern-62996","rank":[231,252]},{"title":"Not Guernsey!","rating":9,"date":"3 May 2018","review":"I declare a vested interest as I am a Guernseyman who has lived here all my life. The film is very entertaining, well acted and interesting. I recommend it as a love story with a Guernsey historic background that is reasonably accurate. Sadly the film was not shot in Guernsey for various reasons and although the scenery is lovely to look at it's not as beautiful as our Island. Come and visit Guernsey and enjoy our Island.","user":"mike-vaudin","rank":[306,343]}]
