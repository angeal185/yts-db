[{"title":"Disappointing","rating":1,"date":"9 January 2018","review":"Build up, build up, build up, then . . . .. NOTHING!\nWhat is the sense in making a camcorder movie that shows nothing in the end? In the ending sequence, you can't make heads or tails of anything in the light though the images of whatever is in there is transmitted to video. If you want to watch a movie for only its scare value without ever finding out what is scaring people, this stupid movie is for you!","user":"carolynnorton","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Sad Excuse of an Alien Movie.","rating":2,"date":"9 April 2020","review":"What start out as a chance that could led to something which can remotely described as an idea ends up as a complete fail. In what looks like a recorded documentary of a sister seeking her lost brother who went to investigate aliens existence in a remote deserted area in Mexico, ends up being scenes of the girl running around and other scenes of her fiend at home cooking dinner or something!<br><br>No idea what the filmmakers intended but this is a wasted effort at best! We don't get to know or see anything new...we don't see any aliens, we don't see any UFOs, we only see a flickering light and it's mirrored effect in the sky, such a disappointment.","user":"Impartial-Critic","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Waste of time","rating":1,"date":"31 October 2017","review":"This film could have been made in a 20 minute short and it was the worst lost footage film I've ever seen.Also the film was very frustrating at times because just as you thought you were about to catch a glimpse of something for gods sake anything! There was nothing and thats exactly how this terrible movie ends.","user":"davidreynolds-18137","rank":[14,17]}]
