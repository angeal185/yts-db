[{"title":"Incredible","rating":10,"date":"11 February 2004","review":"For a comedy that got trashed in reviews and rediculed by movie-goers, I find this movie to be incredibly funny. The first time I saw the movie was in the theater at which time I laughed at the \"obvious\" laugh-parts, but it was not until I had seen it another two or three times before I picked up on the absolutely hysterical dialogue, terriffic comedy styles of the various supporting characters, and the sheer brilliance and irony the script presents. If you know anything about history, this movie becomes instantly funny. If you are a fan of almost Simpsons-style \"random\" humor, this film is instantly funny. Never be turned off by the first glance of this film. If you dismiss it as \"poor comedy\" you will be missing out.","user":"sneakymcgrew","rank":[66,81]},{"title":"Funny","rating":30,"date":"30 May 2004","review":"I'm from Montana and had to study Lewis and Clark. Almost Heroes is great it makes fun of all the details from their journey. Down to Sacajawea and the waterfall passage. My favorite quote is at the start of the movie when Hunt says \"If you wanted a tracker why didn't you choose William Clark?\" and Edwards responds \"Don't you think I tried that.\" If anyone likes Chris Farley they will enjoy this film. Some people says his comedy wasn't a physical as before. Did those people watch this movie. How about the eagle scene or at the party. Or how about the bar scene or the dentist. At the start of the movie his is dragged on stage to be hung. Some people on this board probably don't like Chris Farley. Or maybe they don't like Matthew Perry. That however shouldn't mean they should hate every movie with them.<br><br>9/10","user":"seanholland85","rank":[26,31]},{"title":"'Almost' Perfect!","rating":9,"date":"9 May 2004","review":"ALMOST HEROES was without a doubt one of the funniest movies of 1998. It was also one of those rare comedies that are almost perfect. After seeing it several times now, I still feel it could have been perfect if not for two things. The first being that despite the movie being very well edited, there are times when it seems that there was some serious cutting down for a PG-13 rating.  <br><br>The second thing keeping this movie from being perfect is just like with OLD SCHOOL, there are some attempts at humor in the movie that seem out of place in a movie like this. Sadly, this was Chris Farley's last movie. Nearly seven years after his death, it is still hard to believe he's gone. He was in my opinion, the funniest guy ever!","user":"jellyneckr","rank":[29,36]}]
