[{"title":"Needs Work","rating":19,"date":"19 October 2011","review":"A group of porn filmmakers are systematically attacked by two children on the set of a remote shoot.<br><br>We have actress Kristina Klebe here, and a whole lot of unknowns in the woods being preyed upon by \"kids\" (more like young adults) who think they are Hansel and Gretel. It fails on many levels. The first, and most obvious, was not using kids to play the kids.<br><br>The porn aspect is done decently, including a nice parody of the \"Big Sausage Pizza\" series of films. But I am not really sure why they had to be porn stars. It could have been any random group of people -- the only difference here being that we have a sex scene. But the porn is not central to the plot like (the much better) \"One Eyed Monster\".<br><br>There probably is no reason to see this one. People in the woods getting killed. We have seen this before. Sure, it has a few new angles, and there is a lot of potential for a good Hansel and Gretel story. This just was not the right one.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Pointless, Contrived, No Story.","rating":1,"date":"23 October 2011","review":"The synopsis for this one sounded fairly interesting and it was on Netflix Instant, so I checked it out. I've noticed that I typically enjoy recommendations that are 2-2.5 stars on there because overall, I quite enjoy bad movies as long as there is something...anything to keep me entertained.<br><br>This movie actually starts off fairly good. Then after the introductions of characters gets over with is when the movie starts to dive bomb as it's clear the people behind this movie really had no idea of what KIND of movie they wanted to make. I say this, because early on it feels like they have a ton of pointless red herrings. For example, there's a woodsman that you constantly hear off in the distance that they seem to try and make you think is part of the plot, but he's not. He's worthless and does not help the movie push forward at all.<br><br>Another thing that royally annoyed me, is that this is one of those movies where at ANY POINT each of the cast could have done something to stop the children who are harassing them throughout the movie (of course, I say \"children\", but they are most likely 18-20). I mean, seriously...like 8 people can't take out two little brats, only one of which was armed at any given point? Come on. And then they actually capture one of the kids and want to do something about it, but the lead stops them as if she's not aware they are getting picked off. Oh yeah, because she's \"just a kid\"...riiiiiight.<br><br>Then the ending....absolutely a cop out. It's like they just didn't even care to end it. It's not a \"twist\", it's just bad. <br><br>Do not waste time with this one.","user":"dustyp-1","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"director takes viewers for a ride and not in the good sense","rating":2,"date":"24 February 2011","review":"doesn't do justice even to b grade horror movies .i was fooled into thinking that the great Mike Nichols had experimented with a different genre but couldn't believe that it was the same after watching the movie.finally came to know through IMDb that this is a completely different guy who had earlier helmed \"a dead calling\"(i have the misfortune of watching that too)..i think he should write something with his name so that there is no confusion to people...the movies plot was different but handled so poorly that you feel like tearing out your hair especially the wooden performances of the child actors of indeterminate age...my rating of 2 is for the somewhat different plot...but nevertheless its an hour and a half of my life i'm never getting back","user":"jitendra-mahim","rank":[22,35]}]
