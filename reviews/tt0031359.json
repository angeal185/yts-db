[{"title":"\"Creates an air of electric tension that Hollywood could only envy.\"","rating":25,"date":"25 May 2004","review":"In Victorian London, Louis Bower (Walbrook), murdered his aunt for her precious rubies that are hidden somewhere in her house, only he couldn't find them. Having eluded the police for a number of years and changed his name to Paul Mallen, he takes a wife in the fragile Bella (Wynyard), and the couple move back into the house so that he can continue his search under cover as a respectable Victorian husband. At the same time he tries to drive his wife out of her mind because he is afraid that she might discover his guilty secret...<br><br>The first film version of Patrick Hamilton's successful stage play is technically modest compared to the 1944 Hollywood remake (see my review), but this British National production directed by Thorold Dickinson creates an atmosphere of genuine electric tension that Hollywood could only envy. Hardly surprising really that they tried to destroy the negative of this picture. Fortunately prints have survived and it often turns up on TCM every few months. Good performances too, especially from Walbrook who portrays the villain as a vile Victorian bully whereas Charles Boyer played it smooth. Wynyard does well as the tortured wife while Cathleen Cordell is fine as the tarty parlour maid whom Walbrook uses to add insult to his wife's injury.<br><br>The film was available in the UK on VHS but it has since been deleted, although the Hollywood version is out on DVD. Let's hope this version finds it's way on to DVD too.","user":"jamesraeburn2003","rank":[55,58]},{"title":"Stop titivating yourself, come on.","rating":9,"date":"5 January 2005","review":"What a crisp, deeply rooted thriller Thorold Dickinson created. With vile creatures (Paul) and goofy policemen and maids, we are easily captured into the world of the Mallens. Diana Wynyard does a spectacular job as Bella, giving us the right amount of insecurity coupled with fear. She is the true victim of this film and Dickinson does not let us forget that. Wynyard is nearly overshadowed by my favorite character of the film, Paul Mallen, played with so much evil by Anton Walbrook. I have seen several films in my life, and I must say that Walbrook ranks among some of the most sinister villains of them all. He has no super powers, just the ability to manipulate Bella mentally, proving that he is stronger than her. He thrives on Bella's insecurities and makes them into his greatest form of punishment. These two working together really transformed this 40s thriller into something concrete and powerful. It is the dynamic between the two that kept me glued to my seat and continually asking for more.<br><br>Coupled with the superb acting is the creativeness of Dickinson and his writer A.R. Rowlinson. Together they set the mood with darkened corners and alleyways with that constantly looming feeling that the events are going to get grittier down the road. This team made Victorian London a spooky place to visit at night. They make Bella the victim throughout this entire film, making even me wonder if she really was slowly going mad. It isn't until the end that the truth is revealed and even then we are left in suspense. It isn't until the credits roll is the film over, and that is hard to accomplish for directors of the thriller genre today. Dickinson proved that he could handle all the elements with the greatest of ease and bring them to the screen in a film that would last the test of time. I am not embarrassed to show this film to friends because I do believe that they would see the value in this production.<br><br>Grade: ***** out of *****","user":"film-critic","rank":[54,58]},{"title":"Just as good--if not better--than the 1944 remake","rating":10,"date":"2 November 2003","review":"It's easy to see why MGM locked this away in their vaults when they issued their 1944 remake--it's really great!<br><br>An evil crook (Anton Walbrook) slowly tries to drive his wife (Diana Wynyard) mad for some jewels.<br><br>This isn't as lush as the remake, but it more than makes up for it in other departments.  For one thing--it's shorter by about 30 minutes and there's no romantic interlude at the beginning.  This one starts dark and gets darker. Walbrook is frightening as the husband--much better than Charles Boyer in the remake.  The scenes where he yells at his wife had me jumping.  Wynyard is great as his fragile wife.  She doesn't go into hysterics and chew the scenery like Ingrid Bergman did--she plays it calmly and quietly and very very realistically.  Her final confrontation with her husband was just great.  Also Cathleen Cordell is lots of fun as Nancy, the parlor maid.  In the remake she was played by Angela Landsbury (in her film debut). Surprisingly, Cordell is better than Landsbury!<br><br>The remake copied this film virtually scene by scene--and suffers somewhat by comparison.  It added on the unnecessary romantic subplot with Joseph Cotton.  Thankfully, there's nothing like that here.  This just grips you from the very beginning and doesn't let go.<br><br>Both movies are great but this one is marginally better.  Very recommended.","user":"preppy-3","rank":[59,64]}]
