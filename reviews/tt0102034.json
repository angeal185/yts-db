[{"title":"McCloud from Outer Space","rating":3,"date":"11 April 2004","review":"All true Highlander fans will simply not acknowledge the existence of Highlander 2, wih good reason: Planet Zeist.<br><br>if you were to see part 2 and not the Original, it would be ok, cuz it would make sense in its own way.  H1 and H2 are effectively unrelated films.  But Highlander was quite an original story.  H2, unfortunately, is a bit goofy and out of sync.  Quite laughable in its own way.<br><br>If you want a good laugh, check it out.  It's high cheese.  If you're a Highlander purist, it DOESN'T EXIST.  The intention was probably good, trying to show the aftermath of McCloud's mistakes after winning the original \"tournament\", but the premise is ruined by Planet Zeist, and Michael Ironside is just rehashing the Kurgen.  He's a bit funnier in the villain role, but it doesn't save the movie from being silly","user":"Archduke-1","rank":[45,52]},{"title":"I think Ebert said it best.","rating":4,"date":"26 July 2004","review":"Ah, friends. Come sit with me as we experience the Quickening. If we both stick our hands into a puddle of orange, shiny goo, we'll be shocked, and yet, united. Then we can battle the evil Katana and save Zeist from ... from what?<br><br>This is the effect of HIGHLANDER II.<br><br>HIGHLANDER II: THE QUICKENING is set in the future. Well, at least, I think it is. The film begins on Earth in the year 1999. Then, it heads off to the planet Zeist 500 years before. Following that, we're back to Earth in the year 2024. I'd say the film is pretty much divided between being on Earth in 2024 and Zeist 500 years before, but I think it was meant to be on Earth in 2024.<br><br>Now that that's cleared up ...<br><br>Imagine, if you will, that most of what they told us in the original HIGHLANDER was crap. Immortals don't come from nowhere, they come from the planet Zeist. The entire original HIGHLANDER movie was lies! Lies! Lies!<br><br>And if you believe that, I've got some $200,000 property for you down in sunny North Carolina.<br><br>Connor MacLeod, the main character of the original film (played by Christopher Lambert), is old and dying. When, in 1999, the Earth's ozone layer was nearly completely gone, MacLeod created The Shield Corporation, which then created a shield which would protect the Earth from the sun's violent rays. But in 2024, the world is a dark dungheap, and MacLeod's pretty much to blame.<br><br>Now let's go back to the planet Zeist. General Katana (Michael Ironside) is pretty pissed. MacLeod's still alive. So he sends his two retarded minions to kill MacLeod. The extremely elderly MacLeod somehow starts dancing around like Dean Martin and beheads both of them. The power of their lifeforce makes him young once again and free to kiss terrorist Louise Marcus (Virginia Madsen) and then try to take down the world's anti-Ozone shield. Oh yeah, the ozone's healed, by the way.<br><br>So then Katana comes to Earth to kill MacLeod, who is suddenly super-cool and ready to kill Katana. But for some reason, he needs help. So the producers paid Sean Connery $3.5 million. Behold! Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez is resurrected from the dead and comes back (for nine minutes of screen time) to help MacLeod shut down the shield.<br><br>If you haven't figured it out by now, HIGHLANDER II is completely messed-up.<br><br>I haven't seen a sequel this bad in who knows how long. It contradicts the entire HIGHLANDER mythos, and thus was ignored in every other sequel and television series that followed. <br><br>But there is a good side to the film. I think Ebert said it best in his review of the film: he describes HIGHLANDER II as being \"a movie almost awesome in its badness\". How awesome do you hear that? But that's exactly what HIGHLANDER II is: almost awesome in its badness.<br><br>It may be one of the worst films ever made, and it may be the worst sequel, but it is also a very fun and frequently (unintentionally) funny film. In the words of the Immortal Ramirez, \"If you can summon it all up, at one time, in one place, you can accomplish something glorious.\"<br><br>Whatever that means.<br><br>NOTE: There are two versions of the film. The theatrical version, called the Quickening, has just been reviewed here. The director's cut has been re-named the \"Renegade Version\" and changes much of the film's story. The film has also been completely re-edited. The Quickening version runs 89 minutes, while the Renegade version runs 109.<br><br>HIGHLANDER II: THE QUICKENING by Russell Mulcahy. * 1/2 out of ****.","user":"Tom_Benton","rank":[72,87]},{"title":"Worst Sequel of All Time","rating":4,"date":"4 August 2002","review":"(I May Spoil some of the movie)Without a shout of a doubt, this is by far the worst sequel ever made for a movie. The first Highlander was a great film, it had a good story, good characters and plot that pretty much worked. Highlander II had some of the worst acting I have ever seen, really bad camera work, horrifying choreography in the fights scenes, a story that made absolutely no sense, cruddy special effects and overall, it was just a really bad movie. Though I am a fan of the first Highlander, it seemed to me that a sequel was not possible. Macleod had defeated the Kurgan and won the Prize. Now all of a sudden it's the future, and the immortals came from another world? I am fan of Michael Ironside but this was by far his worst acting job ever as he played the villain, Katana. What makes absolutely no sense to me is that in the first Highlander, the immortals didn't know why and where they came from. Now all of a sudden, Macleod remembers life on his homeworld of Zeist. The one thing that kept this movie up somewhat was Sean Connery's return. Now he died in the first Highlander, but they brought him back. And it really wasn't explained how he came back to life. This was by far the worst of the Highlander series, and the sequels later on disregarded this movie which I felt was a good idea.","user":"simonsez2","rank":[68,84]}]
