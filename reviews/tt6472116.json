[{"title":"A soffisticated psychological drama","rating":8,"date":"30 March 2019","review":"A great movie about the courage of retired mexican Boxer to fight his own demons and his feelings of guilt. A deja vu moment allows the main personage to take a difficult decision in his life. The movie ist not proposing any extraordinary action scenes, opposed to the expectations and to the title. It could be better described as a soffisticated psychological drama.","user":"alexandrovn","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"A Psychological Character Study that Deserves a Second Look","rating":8,"date":"11 December 2019","review":"If viewed as a boxing movie, Bayoneta/Bayonet will disappoint. If viewed as a psychological drama, this film will gratify.<br><br>Bayoneta/Bayonet revolves around the story of Miguel \"Bayoneta\" Galindez, a retired Mexican boxer who debates on going back into the boxing world. Though the plot seems storied and cliche, Kyzza Terrazas throws in a few twists that we don't expect.<br><br>The plot is slow and steady. Miguel Galindez is portrayed more as a regular, yet troubled, person than a former star boxer. We see the effects that retirement and previous failures have had on him and we emphasize with him.<br><br>Also, the cinematography of this film is simply beautiful. I've never been more drawn to a film due to its visual beauty than Bayoneta. Not enough credit is given to Guillermo Garza in this regard. This film brings the cold harsh environment of Finland to life that is rarely seen in any other film.<br><br>Though many judge this film for not delivering the action that they were expecting, I urge viewers to reexamine this film through a different lens to appreciate its true genius in storytelling.<br><br>4/5. Underrated and underappreciated.","user":"mikayakatnt","rank":[2,2]}]
