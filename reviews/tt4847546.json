[{"title":"Horrible. One of the worst pieces of garbage I have ever seen.","rating":2,"date":"30 July 2018","review":"I've seen some terrible movies in my lifetime, and this one is no different. Talent-less actors, weak special effects, the movie takes forever to get going and when it does it looks like a bad porn film. Really, this movie is just terrible and everyone involved should be embarrassed. Tragic film making at its worst.","user":"manuelasaez","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"WTF?","rating":2,"date":"18 April 2018","review":"Two really negative reviews yet it has a rating of 7.6. Appears that a lot of shills have been tapping star keys to push the score up. Pretty obvious really that they are shills.","user":"shadowfax73","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"This is a scurvy film. Ryan Nicholson, the fx guy did some good job but the lingering gory n cannibalism scenes were a put off.","rating":3,"date":"20 April 2018","review":"Saw this on a dvd. I got enticed due to Sadie Katz n the trailer. What a disappointment this film turned out to b.\nTher was absolutely zero suspense n tension. This movie is completely devoid of any atmosphere. \nThe plot is about an owner of a diner who is also moonlighting as a watchman in a museum of Egyptian artefacts. He stops taking his pills n during one of his work shift he sees the Egyptian goddess who demands him of blood n sacrifice which will enable their reunion.\nTher was too much gore n i fast forwarded some scenes, especially of the cannibalism. \nThe effects by Ryan Nicholson is noteworthy but the lingering gory scenes were a letdown for me.\nAlso the abrupt ending added more fuel to its already awful screenplay. \nIt is a remake of the 1963 film which i hav completely forgotten.\nMayb will revisit soon. The original was directed by the father of gore films, Herschell Gordon Lewis.\nThey say the original was the first splatter film n one of the earliest to enter video nasties.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[20,28]}]
