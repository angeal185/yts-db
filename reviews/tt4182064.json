[{"title":"Not Worth Your Time","rating":21,"date":"21 December 2016","review":"'Late Summer'which is also known as 'Sensommer' is mainly revolve around a lonely elderly lady.<br><br>First let me write about the story - sadly the story has no real substance in it. There was a mystery in the story but it was all explained at the end. But I believe if at the end they did not reveal everything then it would have been better and the viewers had to figure it out themselves. So they could have the satisfaction that they got the mystery solved. But now the film is dull for my taste.<br><br>About the acting, all I have to say is there was nothing extraordinary about it.<br><br>So, all in all you can really skip this one.","user":"niaz_islam","rank":[6,15]}]
