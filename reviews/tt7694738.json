[{"title":"Sinister action thriller about betrayal","rating":7,"date":"4 March 2019","review":"Best F(r)iends: Volume 2 is quite different from the first volume and might actually surprise you a lot. The first film focuses on the difficult friendship between introverted drifter Jon Kortina and eccentric mortician Harvey Lewis who develop a scheme of selling gold fillings from the deceased's teeth to shady underground businessmen. This second movie tells us how the quiet drifter and his manipulative girlfriend leave the mortician for dead and try to run off with the money the scheme has made to start a new life in Colorado.<br><br>This second volume has a much steadier pace than the first volume. This is due to the set of unusual characters the couple encounters on its strange road trip. The diversified locations also add some diversified entertainment. The final thirty minutes of the movie are very intense, come around with a series of intriguing plot twists and feature numerous deadly confrontations in breathtaking landscapes.<br><br>Despite the differences between the two volumes, the weird tone, unexpected events and strange characters keep them together in a quiet coherent way. The ever-changing second volume itself is kept together by numerous surreal dream sequences that connect both volumes and give more background information about the two lead characters. It's certainly impossible to watch only one of the two volumes or to watch them separately over a longer period of time.<br><br>This unique second volume is so intriguingly strange that it could be watched on several occasions in order to uncover more unsettling details and understand all its facets since some questions remain unanswered which gives the viewers some food for thought. This film has the potential to become a genuine cult movie while the first volume is rather an appropriate introduction to the madness that unfolds here. I would recommend the two volumes to fans of television shows with uniquely strange characters such as Fargo and Twin Peaks and obviously to anyone who has watched The Room even though these two volumes are much more clever, coherent and serious than you might expect. Grab a beer, invite a few friends and enjoy these two volumes to the fullest.","user":"kluseba","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Watching grass grow would be better","rating":1,"date":"22 January 2019","review":"No expectations going into this and that was a good thing because the fall was not that far. Seen better film on teeth, but only a couple of hours lost maybe I can help someone else not make the same mistake.","user":"stevenbyrd","rank":[14,28]},{"title":"The magic is back","rating":10,"date":"5 February 2019","review":"Recaptures the magic of The Room and the unique chemistry between Wiseau and Sestero","user":"renzo-r-mora","rank":[8,16]}]
