[{"title":"Never quite makes up its mind what story to tell","rating":4,"date":"21 March 2015","review":"Any five to ten minute excerpt from this movie could easily lead a viewer to conclude that this is a well made horror or suspense thriller. The production values are high, the performances good, and so on.<br><br>The problem is that the parts of the film don't fit together. The sequence of action has the usual slow build and accelerating pace of any good thriller, but while the set-up is promising, and the events proceed logically enough as interesting and sympathetic characters are frightened, threatened or killed off, the reasons underlying the events remain obscure.<br><br>Hints and suggestive exposition are introduced, and then forgotten. There are explicit references to religious-themed horror fantasy, speculative science, and even a few elements of a possible conspiracy. An elaborate backstory is gradually revealed, and then abruptly dismissed. The conclusion doesn't really conclude anything: there's a decisive ending, but no resolution, no revelation, not even a clear idea of the probable consequences.<br><br>It's possible a re-edit could address these issues and make it a decent film. As it stands, though, it just doesn't work.","user":"avdropm-944-921852","rank":[63,75]},{"title":"Disappointing and unoriginal","rating":3,"date":"15 May 2015","review":"I really wanted The Lazarus Effect to be good. It has a great cast and an interesting premise, and I love horror movies so why should this be any different? Well first of all calling it a horror movie is a bit of a stretch. Yeah, there are \"scares\" but they're all the clich√© flickering lights, someone coming up behind someone else's back, fake out, cheap ass easy jump scares that we've seen a million times and you can see them coming from a mile away. <br><br>The best thing this movie has going for it is its atmosphere. It all takes place in an empty laboratory and there are some moments where you feel the claustrophobia of being trapped in a place where dead bodies are kept and weird surgical instruments all over the place. But none of that psychological horror is expounded on. It's just like one second I'm like, \"hm, this could actually go somewhere\" and then two seconds later a freaky face pops on screen and it's like ugh, why bother.<br><br>The acting in this movie is fine for what it is. Aside from the two leads, Evan Peters was the only character I cared about because he was the comic relief but he just isn't given enough to work with. Everything about the movie feels rushed. The characters aren't developed enough. The movie is barely 80 minutes long and it still has dull moments. It also borrows a lot of elements from other horror movies. A good chunk of the movie is straight up \"Event Horizon\" in a laboratory with some \"The Shining\" and \"Lucy\" sprinkled here and there. Sure there is some creepy imagery but it's stuff we've seen a million times. If they had actually built up tension instead of relying on stupid jump scares then maybe the imagery would have some effect. As it stands, it's just like... what a waste.<br><br>I can't give this movie a lower score because it did have potential and I liked the cast. There are some moments that are admittedly cool, however brief they are. Oh, and none of the movie makes sense. It starts off plausibly with these doctors performing weird experiments but as soon as sh*t starts to go down, any sense of realism goes out the window. The Lazarus Effect isn't terrible - there's just no reason to see it. Go see \"Event Horizon\" or \"The Shining\" if you're in the mood for some real psychological scares.","user":"lnvicta","rank":[125,156]},{"title":"It has good ideas, but fails to realise them.","rating":4,"date":"6 April 2019","review":"Sadly this is an ultimately unrewarding film, to read the plot, you'd be forgiven for expecting something dark, original and interesting, when in reality it's generic, flat, and badly realised.<br><br>The production values are a little poor, and the storytelling is disjointed, lacks any sort of core plot, at times it seemed to make no sense.<br><br>A few times they could have gone for real scares and horror, sadly no such moments ever happened. The dog could have been good.<br><br>Quite poor. 4/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[9,9]}]
