[{"title":"Made me laugh","rating":9,"date":"24 July 2019","review":"Since the synopsys for this movie is extremely vague, I will start the review by writing a proper one:\nThe main character's dad dies, and he takes care of the funeral. His father's house must be sold, while he is dealing with cleaning up the house, he gets a call that leads to him reconnecting with his uncle who he didn' speak to in years. His uncle is sick, so he helps him out by taking him to doctor's appointments and befriends a girl living in the same building as his uncle.<br><br>Thoughts:\nThe movie had several moments that made me laugh, it mostly utilizes awkward humor. The main character (Peter) is robotic but we slowly find out more about him as the movie progresses. I would say this movie is unique, does not utilize clich√©s. It becomes more serious in the second half, but delivers a satisfying ending. I would say it is worth watching.","user":"bugger-17071","rank":[28,30]},{"title":"A real look at difficult relationships","rating":10,"date":"26 December 2019","review":"This film looks at the pain of missed opportunities and the hope of second chances in family relationships.

This film engages you in its story and never pulls you away from its world and its characters. It helps tremendously that it is anchored by its main performers realistic, human interactions. This world these characters inhabit feels real.","user":"fitzgerald-68298","rank":[6,6]}]
