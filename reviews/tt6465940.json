[{"title":"Not every sequence of scenes is considered a movie.","rating":1,"date":"22 November 2018","review":"This short photographed material which is called a movie deserves a point out of ten, not because there is no zero, but because it carries an idea, so this worth half a point, and another half point for the rare beautiful landscape scenes.<br><br>Other than that, everything is absolute rubbish, starting from the acting to the weak story and the missing plot, you get the feeling that it's an episode in a series.<br><br>The main idea it carries is, What if somehow during a threesome, the girl got attracted to one guy and neglected the other ?!<br><br>If you want an answer for this question, then google it, seriously, it's less painful than watching this movie.<br><br>The movie starts with skype call of two guys inviting a girl, who is a friend to one of them, to meet up and they propose a threesome to her.<br><br>The events follow up when they meet up, and a lot of awkward situations happen, till you get in a weird meaningless finale.<br><br>FYI, no threesome happens here, no severe nudity, except for a pair of boobs and two guys' bottoms.<br><br>Also FYI, I had to run the movie in triple the speed in order to reach the end, I just wanted to know how this weird relationship would end !<br><br>Finally, not every person with a camera can make a movie, although the high quality scenes that any DSLR can get, it's all about the person who uses it, and unfortunately the final product here was boring poor an hour long movie.","user":"MplusA92","rank":[11,17]},{"title":"I Enjoyed It","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2020","review":"I found this actually humorous; especially the part where one dude's mother talks to her mopey son who was in the threesome but didn't actually get any of the sex. His mom relates a story about her having a threesome once and then using a cucumber on some other dude and the look on her son's face is priceless. During this whole thing, the other two in the threesome are talking about getting married right after the threesome and about the guy taking the girl's last name, a dog's chewed up tennis ball is their ring, or whatever, and they seem so happy while the other dude is just moping around all depressed. Hilarious.<br><br>You can tell with the dude and the girl (Zoe and Issac, I think) are really into it but you can also see slight tension between the two. And the other dude (Charlie, I think) is feeling depressed, left out, angry but still thinks he has a shot with Zoe. So Isaac goes camping before the ceremony and Charlie goes over to Zoe's to...do whatever. Zoe keeps calling Isaac on his camping trip but Isaac doesn't have his phone, and Charlie is hanging out with Zoe, eating dinner, and she's beginning to waver, maybe thinking straight about the whole thing. When Isaac starts playing the guitar and singing badly and the cringed face of Zoe. Hilarious. I laughed out loud at that. Do Zoe and Isaac get married? Yep. But the true winner here is Zoe because she gets her threesome whenever she wants (though separately) because Charlie pretends that Zoe is his Mommy and and gets his milk from her, in the end.<br><br>It's not a long film. 71 minutes. This isn't a skin flick (some nudity) but there's a few scenes of graphic sexual verbiage. Especially toward the end. The photography is fine. The acting is fine. Direction is fine. Everything's fine. I enjoyed it.","user":"nammage","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"This is my lifesomething.","rating":10,"date":"24 November 2018","review":"I enjoyed the realness and comedy of this movie. This is what can happen sometimes in real threesome situations. Very much worth the watch.","user":"cast_aways","rank":[8,15]}]
