[{"title":"The critics are WRONG!","rating":9,"date":"9 May 2009","review":"Don't always believe what the critics say. I have no explanation as to why some critics gave Little Ashes bad reviews other than it just wasn't your typical movie and they couldn't understand that.<br><br>This movie tells a beautiful and fascinating story (read the synopsis beforehand it helps).<br><br>The acting is excellent.<br><br>The accents sound/are authentic (when Dali sounds American or French that is done intentionally from what i hear.) oh, and it's an INDEPENDENT FILM! aka it's not necessarily going to be like every other dramatic film out there.<br><br>Go into it with an OPEN MIND. If you enjoy the previews you will probably enjoy the movie.<br><br>Go see it and form your own opinion. This movie is great but it isn't for everyone.","user":"Actor317","rank":[96,130]},{"title":"wow. i loved it. definitely a love or hate movie.","rating":9,"date":"21 July 2009","review":"There aren't much words to describe. Whether you like this movie or not definitely depends on the type of person you are. its definitely a real independent European film. but i love it. i think the actors capture everything well and the casting was exceptional. i loved the relationship between Dali and Lorca. I watched it a few days ago and i am still thinking and obsessing about the film and its aspects. I think if your the more sentimental type you'll enjoy it, but then again you may not. Like i said, you will either love it or not. its not one of those 'society-accepted' common films i.e. 'transformers'. its artsie and dramatic and Dali is just eccentric. love it. love love love it. 9/10.","user":"jayjay_shine13","rank":[29,39]},{"title":"Haunting and captivating film with wonderful actors","rating":9,"date":"21 July 2009","review":"I watched this film a week ago and after the last shot I realized that I wanted to watch it again. That very moment! From the very beginning! I read in someone's article the word \"haunting\" about this film - I absolutely agree with it. It's an elegantly made film with fascinating actors. The enchanting guitar, violin and piano just intensify the heady mood of it. The actors' way of speaking (described as \"terrible accents\" in someone's comment) didn't bother me at all, maybe because neither English nor Spanish are my first languages. But I agree with Dromerito2003 that it would've been more believable if all of them spoke Spanish (Robert Pattinson definitely has \"language ear\" and it wouldn't be difficult for him to speak Spanish only, I think). With subtitles. By the way now I'd like to learn Spanish to read Lorca's poems in it. And to visit Spain shown so lovingly ( I agree that photography is great!)and to see as many works of Dali as possible. And to watch \"Little Ashes\" again...","user":"JaneYak","rank":[34,47]}]
