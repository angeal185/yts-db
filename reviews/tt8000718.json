[{"title":"My Opinion as an Iranian","rating":8,"date":"5 August 2019","review":"I think this movie shows relatively realistic image of Iran , Iranian people and clash between Iran and Israel.\nAs an Iranian I enjoyed the movie. unlike some of similar movies about Iran , all Iranian characters are good hearted people with no Iranian interrogators or such. also I like that -despite having Israeli production- the involvement of Mossad on Iranian scientist assassination and sabotaging Iran's nuclear program is depicted without hesitation. Acting was good and Iran's streets and atmosphere shown believable and almost perfect ... there is no Opel Astra police cars or old Volvo Station wagons in Iran though.\nI gave is 8 of 10.","user":"taghiramzi","rank":[70,95]},{"title":"No Ending","rating":2,"date":"30 December 2019","review":"This film simply ends. It has a very long and involved plot, but there is no resolution at all.","user":"sorceress2","rank":[21,26]},{"title":"a really good spy movie","rating":8,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"This movie shows us what it's like to be a spy, particularly one in which the spy is really hated by the country being infiltrated (a Mossad agent in Iran). It shows how very difficult it is, and how lonely. It also shows the dangers a spy faces because his or her controllers 'back home' don't always know what they're doing. It also shows the convoluted personal relationships, and how they get complicated and twisted up during a spy's career.<br><br>I do not understand the negative reviews on this site. Just watch this movie carefully, maybe watch it twice, and you will be very impressed.<br><br>As to the criticism of the ending, I will say this: the movie is over, and she's left going through the rest of her life looking over her shoulder, being hunted. That's it. She will never be safe again.","user":"mathomas-28053","rank":[6,6]}]
