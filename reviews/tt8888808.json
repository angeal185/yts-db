[{"title":"It's Right There In The Title","rating":8,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"This is a Hallmark Christmas romantic comedy, that really isn't a Hallmark movie, but it fits the mold. If you don't like Christmas rom-coms, then you are barking up the wrong Christmas tree. If you like light, corny, romantic holiday fare, you may consider giving this a view. It has a solid cast, quirky secondary characters and the story engages you enough so that you want to hang in there and see how everything resolves. Kudos to everyone involved, especially first time feature writer and director Olivia Dunkley, who gives us a nice, corny Christmas movie instead of another in the endless re boots and sequel re hashes.","user":"maxwelledisonvii","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"Not bad at all","rating":8,"date":"20 December 2019","review":"People usually fall into two camps. those who love Hallmark rom-coms and those who hate Hallmark rom-coms! I am more or less indifferent, but the wife loves these things and roped me into watching this last night. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised. There is nothing new or surprising here, but it was engaging, hit all of the Christmas rom-com tropes and made me smile in the right places, I think! I can honestly say that I enjoyed it more than most of the movies that Hollywood thinks we all want to see around Christmas.","user":"georgebronee","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"HORRIBLE!","rating":1,"date":"19 December 2019","review":"I had to give it a star to post the review. This movie is awful! The male role is not only a terrible actor, but he is creepy. The female role is also terrible and comes across desperate and pathetic. This is not to be compared to a Hallmark movie. It is so bad.","user":"iamgrl","rank":[2,4]}]
