[{"title":"NOT ''Boooooooring''... unless you're prepubescent.","rating":7,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"People should have to state their age group when posting comments here. I'm in the 50+ group and loved the slow burning tension of this movie. Most teenagers will post things like ''Boooooooring'' and I understand. No gunfights, no blood and gore, no supernatural mumbo jumbo, no superheroes. Just a glimpse inside the minds of ordinary people living extraordinary events.<br><br>Really more of a psychological suspense than a killer-thriller.<br><br>Excellent cast, some additional intensity would've been good here and there, but I respect the director's vision of this story.<br><br>So many bad movies out there... this is not one of them.","user":"p_ferland","rank":[157,188]},{"title":"Spoiler Alert","rating":6,"date":"13 May 2019","review":"I'm really struggling with this film! I enjoyed the suspense, thought the acting was decent, but one thing has left me really bamboozled....<br><br>What happened to the \"grocery\" woman who was attacked? Three people playing out the final scenes in her bedroom whilst she sat on on the floor. Did she turn a blind eye to the whole incident? Why didn't she call the police? Did they drag his dad out of the house and wave her goodbye whilst she went back to the shopping channel? How has nobody mentioned this? So confused. It's ruined what was a pretty good suspense film for me.","user":"djtonybanks","rank":[58,69]},{"title":"Closure for Whom?","rating":7,"date":"25 May 2019","review":"This movie would have been a solid 8, but what was up with the ending?<br><br>None of the victims' families got any closure and he's now regarded as a wonderful citizen for eternity?!<br><br>Horrible ending, to an otherwise good film.","user":"tonyhf","rank":[34,39]}]
