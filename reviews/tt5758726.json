[{"title":"Hilarity from New Zealand","rating":8,"date":"17 July 2018","review":"Jonny (Anton Tennet) lives in Thames, New Zealand, where he makes a meager living running errands for local kingpin Shelton (Jonny Brugh). One day he meets Shelton's sister Kelly (Hetty Gaskell-Hahn); it's love at first sight and that gives Jonny an incentive to try pulling off a caper, despite being completely incompetent. Things do not go well until he stumbles upon an ancient Chinese relic that enables him to bend time and, well, after that things begin to go very, very far from well.... This is a zany, wacky ride where each scene is even more absurd than the one before it; it's also very tightly drawn, clocking in at a mere 81 minutes, meaning that there's no filler here. Delightful!","user":"alisonc-1","rank":[21,34]},{"title":"Time Travel for Dummies","rating":7,"date":"28 August 2018","review":"This is a laugh of a film, well done and it exploits all the nooks and crannies of overlapping timelines to the point where you're spinning in circles. Really entertaining and smart in it's delivery of a well worn plot made unique through it's rougues gallery of characters and awful outcomes.","user":"smidebarry","rank":[14,27]},{"title":"A Fun Ride","rating":7,"date":"27 August 2018","review":"Caught this one at the Fright Fest Film Festival, a solid concept that has a lot of fun with itself. Overlapping scenarios get a bit deep at moments but the outcome is well worth the trip. The effects are middle of the road but the performances work and add a welcome layer of laughter to the concept. A comedic take on Looper and what happens when too much of a good thing isn't that good for you.","user":"barbaragolia","rank":[9,22]}]
