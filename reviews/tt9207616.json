The whole movie feels like we are following a film crew around while the actors rehearse their lines. Gary Oldman will apparently take any job he can get. He does wear an eye-patch though...good call by the wardrobe department; they really earned their keep.","user":"ramfat","rank":[76,114]},{"title":"Wasted Talents","rating":4,"date":"23 November 2019","review":"What's Kurylenko and Oldman doing in such a poorly scripted and directed movie?<br><br>Watch out for:<br><br>1.\nWriters' limited vocabulary is confined to the F word and screaming fits<br><br>2.\nA bunch of henchmen strolling around in circles in a parking structure<br><br>3.\nThe heroine, ex-Bond girl is the female version of John McClane.<br><br>4.\nYou'll be eager to walk out of the cinema midway through the movie and certainly don't care if the good guys slice or die.<br><br>\nDon't waste your time and money on this movie.","user":"johnhow-82589","rank":[55,83]},{"title":"Don't Bother..","rating":1,"date":"24 November 2019","review":"What a waste of time, energy &amp; oxygen this film was.
