[{"title":"Russian Dashcam Compilation","rating":4,"date":"2 October 2017","review":"The entertainment value of \"The Road\" movie is quite high but do I need to see it in the cinema? The idea of \"The Road Movie\" sounds witty but can it live up to it? Not at all! These videos where just in a random order. I expected them to be a bit categorized or even arranged to a story (?). The randomness of it all was disappointing and I felt that I could watch the same thing at youtube (Russian Dashcam Compilation). Some scenes relied only on dialogues and they weren't even subtitled. It had some interesting moments when we watch a car crash happening and &gt;10 people just stop their car, step outside, watch the wrecks, smoke and talk..It felt like a mirror being holded up and we even spent money to see the accidents! I had a good time seeing this and you will have too if the movie theater is crowded and the night is in full swing.","user":"fai-90469","rank":[14,18]},{"title":"Life from the dashcam","rating":6,"date":"30 January 2018","review":"Russian dashboard camera footage has become sort of an internet cliche - filling youtube and even old-fashioned homevideo TV programs with crumpling metal and shattering glass of haphazard Russian road traffic, with drunken maniacs spliced in.<br><br>Fortunately The Road Movie isn't just a highlight reel of spinning car wrecks, but also includes both bizarre, tragic and humorous occurences. My personal favourite were the guys who talked about boozing and slaughtering some animal, but accidentally drove out and into a river, driver laconically commenting \"That's it. We are sailing\". Talk about Russian fatalism.<br><br>In a fact, the subtitles that actually open the discussions of (mostly) unseen passengers make the compilation stand out as a worthwile, though at times slightly boring documentary piece.<br><br>As a sidenote, one of the other reviews refer to the clip where we see a blazing fireball streak the sky and occupants of the car wonder what the heck it was - the guy who says it was a meteor was correct - it was so-called Chelyabinsk meteor that was (fittingly enough) captured by multiple Russian dashcams.","user":"oktjabr","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"a documentary in the truest sense of the word - and a great guilty pleasure","rating":6,"date":"28 January 2018","review":"\"The Road Movie\" (NR, 1:07) is a documentary from Belarus and is unlike any doc you've ever seen. It's short for a feature-length film and it has no narration or graphics (except for some words and numbers that appear on the screen), which makes this movie a documentary in the purest sense of the word. It documents. Period. Even more unusual is WHAT it documents - the strange things that happen on the roads of Russia and other former Soviet Republics. That's right, it's a movie made up of dashcam videos.<br><br>But it's much more than just a series of spectacular vehicle crashes (even though there are plenty of those). These videos span 2011-2016 (based on the dates on the outer edges of the clips) and they let us see and hear shocking, humorous and bewildering things that happen in the car, to the car and outside of the car - and quite the variety it is - and almost all from the cars of ordinary, everyday people. Throughout the movie, there are the aforementioned crashes - and horrible driving conditions - from fire to ice and everything in between. From a couple different angles, we see a streak of light in the sky. (Is it a meteor? Is it a plane crash? Is it a UFO? We hear drivers and passengers discussing it, but they never find out. And neither do we.) There's a police chase through the streets of Moscow - with an unidentified vehicle heading straight for St. Peter's Square (one of the few sequences from police cars).<br><br>And the videos include plenty of clips of people behaving oddly, comically and inexplicably: An apparently mentally ill person jumps on the hood of a car and starts screaming at the windshield. A barefoot young woman who is crying appears out of nowhere, sits on the hood of a car for a moment, and then walks over the top of it. A driver who is apparently upset at the driver with the dashcam comes after that driver with an axe - and then things really get serious. Another driver and his passenger negotiate terms with an unseen prostitute (audio only, but subtitled for non-Russian audiences).<br><br>It's all shot from the (usually) stationary, but unflinching perspective of the dashcam (like when a thief grabs one of the cameras and runs off with it - with the owner in hot pursuit). \"The Road Movie\" is skillfully edited voyeuristic pleasure. It's often surprising, sometimes funny, occasionally frightening and always interesting. Like observing a car crash, police chase or another person even crazier than you, you just can't look away. This film allows us to indulge in some good old-fashioned rubber-necking, in many different situations and without the fear of getting into an accident ourselves or being judged by others - unless of course, they see you watching the movie, but then, they are too! This film is not winning any Oscars, but it does provide a guilty pleasure for those of us who THINK that where WE drive is crazy! \"B\"","user":"dave-mcclain","rank":[6,7]}]
