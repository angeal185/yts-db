[{"title":"No limits to stupidity.","rating":3,"date":"14 September 2018","review":"Although not boring, it is a piece of majestic crap. The most infantile screenplay ever... embarrassing at times.<br><br>Can't understand the IMDB high rating.<br><br>Aliens please take me, the humankind is not an intelligent race.","user":"peter-vit","rank":[69,79]},{"title":"Such a shame","rating":1,"date":"23 August 2018","review":"This had so much potential, big name actors (for Australia), clearly a significant budget but wow what a disaster it was. Bad direction, bad acting, poor continuity.\nWas really hoping this would be quality as a proud Australian but this movie has set the local industry back years. \nSuch a shame","user":"stephenpersoglia","rank":[124,148]},{"title":"Very bad Red Dawn remake","rating":1,"date":"22 August 2018","review":"Just needed to post a review to make the overall rating a little more honest.<br><br>I understand people have different tastes and all that, but this movie really deserves barely a 1 star rating overall. There is NO WAY any honest person could give this a 9 or 10 rating. NO WAY.\n \nBorrowed this from another review because is says it so succinctly:<br><br>Complete waste of time. The acting was mediocre . The plot , story and message, was a total waste. Worst sci-fi movie that I've seen in years.<br><br>Editing this movie down to 60 minutes or so would have maybe brought it up to a 3 star and wasted an hour less of my life.","user":"curtreams-07813","rank":[95,119]}]
