[{"title":"That's entertainment!","rating":7,"date":"27 November 2006","review":"Not the most accurate rumination on whether or not Anna was really Anastasia, perhaps, but creamy, expensive entertainment, expertly done. Many share in the credit. There's a witty, epigrammatic screenplay by the always reliable Arthur Laurents (love that closing line, and most of Helen Hayes' dialogue) that manages to speculate perceptively on the nature-of-performance theme without beating it into the ground; an evocative Alfred Newman score that surpasses virtually anything else he did at Fox; fine CinemaScope photography that really uses the outer reaches of the screen, though it does dabble in spectacle for spectacle's sake at times; a superb Hayes (she could be theatrically actressy or resort to little-old-lady tricks in other movies, but here she's the real deal); a delightful Martita Hunt; and chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brynner that suggests all the underlying sexual tension without ever stating it explicitly. Also knock-your-eye-out costume design. In a time of rampant Hollywood bloat and slow-moving epics, this one moves along, without too much pretension. And Anatole Litvak's direction, while no great shakes, is nicely paced.","user":"marcslope","rank":[26,31]},{"title":"Fascinating film","rating":4,"date":"4 April 2002","review":"The \"what if\" story of Anastasia is a fascinating one.  This particular version of that story is outstanding.  A great script that is witty and often funny, filmed and acted beautifully.<br><br>In addition to containing the finest performance of Ingrid Bergman's career, including Casablanca, Yul Brynner is at his best and Helen Hayes delivers an absolutely brilliant gem of a performance.  While Bergman justly won Best Actress of 1956 for her performance, I find it astounding that Brynner and especially Hayes did not even get consideration.  Yes, Brynner was nominated and even won for his silly, over the top performance in The King And I.  And I'm sure, like Jim Broadbent this year, he was rewarded as much for his body of work for the year as he was that single performance.  Still though, I'm baffled as to why he won for The King and not for \"The General\".  The snub of Hayes, though, is even more mystifying.  Particularly because 1956 was a pretty weak year for great films and performances, especially in the supporting actress category.  Any year in which a performance like Dorothy Malone's in the Sirk trash de l'annee, Written on the Wind, can win has to be weak.  Hayes performance, in addition to being played to perfection, also seems like the kind that is almost a given to at least be nominated.  In other words, if Anastasia was remade (again) this year, Judi Dench would play the role and a nomination would be a given.  Almost as much a mystery to me as the \"Is she or Isn't she\" thing.<br><br>This film fluctuates wildly between dark and light.  One minute, you're shocked by the horrors Anastasia must have endured over the years, the next minute Ingrid Bergman is making you laugh out loud at a brilliant drunken performance.  One minute, Bergman is in tears, the next she's overjoyed. Definitely one of the all time great performances by an actress. <br><br>\nHowever, there are a few things I'm just not sure how I feel about.  And perhaps that's one of the films' intentions.  (Possible spoiler ahead)  The ending is very surprising and very abrupt.  And not entirely satisfying.  Or is it?  I'm not sure.  Not being familiar with the story before I saw this film, I expected a letdown in the final twenty minutes after Anastasia's grandmother accepts her.  I predicted they would plant one final seed of doubt, and then end it.  And they do...in a way.  But not the way I would have hoped.  I would have liked to see it end on a dark and sinister note. To put it into our heads that maybe Ingrid Bergman's character might be playing everyone for a fool.  Maybe.  As it stands, the apparent flight with Brynner's character is functional enough, I suppose, to create some mystery. In other words, for me, the ending is a letdown, but not a total letdown. The difference between a great film and what could have been a brilliant one.","user":"clydefrogg","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"The Real Deal","rating":8,"date":"11 February 2006","review":"A trio of unscrupulous Russian exiles Yul Brynner, Sacha Pitoeff, and Akim Tamiroff locate an amnesia victim among the flotsam and jetsam of refugees in post World War I Europe and attempt to pass her off as one of Czar Nicholas II,'s daughters, Grand Duchess Anastasia, who survived the massacre of the royal family in 1918. <br><br>The role of \"Anastasia\" marked Ingrid Bergman's return to an American film production after her exile from America after 1949 and she won her second Oscar with it. She runs a whole gamut of emotions from absolute despair to an assumed air of royalty. After a while Brynner and his confederates think that just maybe Ingrid's the real deal.<br><br>Of course the ultimate test is whether the Dowager Empress of Russia, Helen Hayes, accepts Ingrid as the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Although Ingrid got her Oscar, I've always felt that Hayes gives the best performance in the film.<br><br>At the age Dowager Empress Marie was in the Twenties all she had left was memories. She's from the Danish Royal House and was the widow of Alexander III and the mother of Nicholas II of Russia. Her world was turned upside down in 1917 with the Russian Revolution, not just toppled from the privileged position she had, she lost her entire family of the next generation of Romanovs to political upheaval. Hayes is back in her native Denmark, a lonely proud, but regal woman with nothing but memories. She truly becomes the Empress Marie.<br><br>Yul Brynner as General Sergei Pavlovich Bounine is one of that crowd of Russian refugees who apparently got out of Russia with more than just a skin. He's the owner of a Russian caf√© in Paris and should be doing OK, but he's got a streak of larceny in him and a taste for high living. He's involved in bilking a whole lot of Russian exiles in a search for a Romanov heir to claim millions deposited by the late Czar for his children in the Bank of England. He's got to come up with an heir of some kind and fast. But he's a charming fellow and gives one charming performance.<br><br>Both Brynner and Director Anatole Litvak with their own Slavic backgrounds give Anastasia a real flavor of authenticity for the main characters and the Russian exile background of the film. It was shot on location in both Paris and Copenhagen and the camera work is first rate.<br><br>Anastasia became a milestone film for Ingrid Bergman and while Anna Koreff may have been a bogus Russian princess, as an actress Ingrid Bergman was always the real deal.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[30,39]}]
