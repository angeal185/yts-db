[{"title":"It tried. It failed.","rating":4,"date":"8 January 2020","review":"Trespassers is a movie that wanted to be more I think, one that thought it could expand and grow into something bigger later on, an edge of the seat thriller/horror with some good twists and kills.<br><br>Sadly it failed on pretty much every level, being nothing more than a movie that takes forever to start and then delivers some annoying performances and questionable writing really. It is definitely not the worst out there, but if you're into such movies perhaps try something like Revenge (2017) because just like this one it is over the top but manages to provide some better scenes and closure. Even Mandy has more to offer compared to Trespassers, a movie that oddly enough is categorized as horror as well, perhaps the home invasion theme managed to bring this up.<br><br>All in all, I don't think people will have fun with this one sadly, so I will not recommend it, not even for a boring late night. Look elsewhere, find something different.<br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Kill 'em all.","rating":3,"date":"21 October 2019","review":"There is not one likable character in this film. I won't give anything away, but I spent the first half hoping that they would all get killed in various gory ways.","user":"matt-diteresa","rank":[25,28]},{"title":"I feel really bad Fairuza had to be in this...","rating":3,"date":"31 October 2019","review":"This thing is obnoxious and unwatchable start to finish. Annoying characters, idiot police, and home invaders who can't get there fast enough to end the main characters and get this trash over with.","user":"kwilhelmi","rank":[12,13]}]
