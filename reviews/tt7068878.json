[{"title":"Its okay","rating":4,"date":"18 April 2019","review":"This movie is good to watch with the family. But it I wasnt expecting for this movie to end the way it did. I get that the main character, Faith, is 18 years old wants to know who she is. I would've expected for her to take on the ranch that her mom gave her after passing away and run it with Blake and Cory. It seemed like once Faith's friends from the city showed up on the ranch, that they were all gonna turn it around and have rodeos right there. I'm kinda disappointed in how it ended.","user":"bridgettrogers","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Crap!","rating":6,"date":"6 March 2019","review":"Worst acting I seen in past 10 years. And thats saying something!","user":"ArturACrowley","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Maybe for very young teens","rating":4,"date":"27 May 2019","review":"I'm probably not the target audience for this. I guess it's for 13yo girls. The acting is pretty bad but I guess most of this comes from the horrible dialogue.\nThere is hardly any emotional impact and the characters don't behave realistically.\nDon't watch this movie if you have anything better to do but you shouldn't be afraid to put this on for your kid.","user":"Hitchslapped","rank":[6,6]}]
