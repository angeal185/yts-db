[{"title":"Fun Clean Family Friendly Movie","rating":9,"date":"9 March 2020","review":"Hundley and George go on an adventure in the country. Hundley learns to have some fun and loosen up. There is some very tame peril but nothing that's too scary lol. The kids adore it.","user":"wingodsaysso","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"I'll say it simply","rating":9,"date":"3 June 2019","review":"This film is to the TV series what Curious George 3 should have been, either to the other films or to the TV series. My principal criticism of Curious George 3 was that it was disconnected and for the most part you can't even tell whether it is related to the other films (what I call Timeline A) or the TV series (Timeline B). This movie is the exact opposite: it ties into Timeline B right off the bat, so you know exactly what to expect from it. Furthermore, it does it so naturally that it feels like a superb, content-rich mega-episode of the show instead. Whereas in George 3 NOBODY you knew from A or B showed up, here EVERYBODY shows up. Even if only in a cameo, you see virtually the whole cast from The City AND The Country. That brings me to my favourite part of it all, which in my estimation was also the most innovative. Whereas a regular episode is usually set either in The City or The Country, this one crosses over back and forth and even makes characters cross the barrier. This means that characters that never met in the TV show get to meet for the first time and interact, and that is positively fantastic.\nFinally, for such a simple premise, the film is surprisingly delightful. It is in my opinion a worthy addition to the Timeline B continuity. My only gripes are the usual with George movies, poor taste in external music. Ironically enough, I actually liked the fish song better.","user":"thedecimator1337","rank":[0,0]}]
