[{"title":"Suspense , adventure movie bristles with cliches , but it boasts two good stars , Gable and Hayward","rating":5,"date":"12 June 2018","review":"A woman , Susan Hayward , enlists a shipping magnate , Clark Gable , to help her to find his lost husband , Gene Barry , in Red China . Meanwhile , Clark becomes involved with a motley collection of unsavoury underworld figures. As there are rumors that the hubby might be held by the Communist Chinese military as a spy and Gable set out in hunting the missing man in Hong Kong , Macao and Canton .<br><br>\nAn entertaining but slowly paced adventure has Gable as a shady smuggler entrepreneur who attempts to save the husband photographer of a distinguished Mistress, Hayward. \nLate Clark vehicle with the ordinary formula beginning to fall and feel the postwar strain ; besides, there is not enough action to keep adventure fans happy . It hardly ever delivers fast movement , though there is an exciting final getaway . Still a decent but mediocre fun, at times , from two top drawer stars, Gable and Hayward. As Susan had been among the myriad starlets vying for the Scarlett OHara role nearly two decades early .Here Hayward has a character less dynamic than those she was used to at the time , like the Oscarized : I want to liveÂ¡ . Support cast is pretty well , there's plenty of notorious secondaries as Michael Rennie , Gene Barry , Jack Kruschen , Russell Collins , Tom Tully , Leo Gordon, Richard Loo , Mel Welles , a very small role by James Hong , Alexander D'Arcy , and it is surprise to find the glamour of a silent cinema great star : Anne Stern as a middle-age woman who marries Russell Collins.<br><br>\nThe picture contains colorful cinematography in Cinemascope, Color De Luxe, by Leo Tover, probing his camera really makes the teeming streets and water-ways of Hong Kong and Macao spring to life . And sensitive and romantic musical score by Hugo Friedhofer, including oriental sounds. The film was regular but professionally directed by Edward Dmytryck . He was a fine craftsman who directed a lot of films, some of them are considered classic movies .Howewer, Edward's later pictures tended to be on the sluggish side , such as Soldier of Fortune .Edward was a member of the communist party and he was denounced before HUAC . He was one of the so-called \" Hollywood Ten\" , though , subsequently he turned an informer and was panned by the establishment . Dmytryck made films of all kinds of genres such as Western: Shalako,Alvarez Kelly, Raintree country, Broken lance, Warlock ; Wartime : Anzio, The Caine Mutiny, Hitler's children, Young Lions, Back to Bataan ; Drama : The carpetbaggers, Mirage, The human factor, The left hand of God , The mountain, Till the end of time, Crossfire , Her first romance , Tender comrade , End of affair , Cornered , among others.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Hong Kong is the real star of the movie...","rating":7,"date":"9 July 2003","review":"In search of her missing photographer husband, Jane Hoyt (Susan Hayward) arrives in Hong Kong and learns at the U.S. Consulate that her mission is futile, that neither the United States nor the British government can help her... <br><br>She turns in despair to Hank Lee (Clark Gable), an American soldier of fortune who runs a profitable smuggling business on each side of the bamboo curtain...<br><br>Hank is attracted to Jane's sultry red-haired beauty... He develops a personal interest in the lady, but when she repulses his advances, he realizes that the only way to win her over is to rescue her husband...

Unhappy with the roles MGM was giving him, he did not renew his contract. \"Soldier of Fortune,\" which Gable subsequently did for 20th Century Fox, is a big budget, good-looking movie with big stars, none of which can hide the fact that it's a routine story that John Hodiak could have done in black and white in 1950 and probably did.<br><br>Susan Hayward plays a woman who arrives in Hong Kong to look for her photographer husband (Gene Barry) who has slipped into China illegally. She runs into of a bunch of sleazy characters and finally meets Henry Lee (Gable), a soldier of fortune with money and contacts. He's an older version of Rhett Butler - out for himself but capable of goodness as well. He falls hard for Hayward and becomes more determined than ever to find her husband so he doesn't have to compete with a ghost. With two such attractive stars, it's obvious what's going to happen.<br><br>The stars and the supporting cast - Michael Rennie, Tom Tully, Anna Sten et al - are all very good. It's a beautifully photographed film that undoubtedly looked great on the big screen with its Technicolor panoramas of Hong Kong, but alas, it's not very exciting. Gable looks fantastic and immaculate in his white suit, his smile as dimpled and his voice as gruff as ever, and Hayward, not the warmest actress who ever lived, is excellent as a concerned and confused woman. They work very well together.<br><br>It's hard to say the movie is not worth seeing because as excellent as some of our actors are today, there are no Gables. There was only one - and checking him out is always worthwhile.","user":"blanche-2","rank":[21,23]}]
