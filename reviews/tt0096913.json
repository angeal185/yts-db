[{"title":"The Best is the Best","rating":8,"date":"14 March 2002","review":"I'm not sure why I liked this movie so much.  The plot is just another Rocky derivative and the dialogue rather pedestrian.  However, it does have James Earl Jones which is always a plus.  Despite the clich√© story I still actually cried at the end.  I was moved.  I felt for these characters, their struggle and their triumph.  This movie is a good guilty pleasure.  It shouldn't be as enjoyable as it is.  Here's to the emotional power of cheese.","user":"HBeachBabe","rank":[40,47]},{"title":"The greatest ever","rating":10,"date":"30 November 2005","review":"I've seen lots of comment on this movie but this is my all time favorite. The first time I saw the movie I was 7 years old I'm 23 now and last week I saw him for the 58the time. I admit, the screenplay becomes old fashion after all those years but it's the greatest taekwondo-movie ever made!!! Everybody talks about the karate movie, OK, it's the \"US karate-team\" but the main fights are taekwondo-style, with a little bit of hapkido in it. Especially the true taekwondo battle between the rhee brothers at the end, I'm a taekwondo-member myself and what they 'fake' is very difficult, ever harder than a real fight. And too all the people here who think this movie is't worth rating high, try those kicks yourselves, trust me,it's hard, even without opponent! Best of the best rules!!!","user":"pythonpower83","rank":[16,19]},{"title":"Indeed","rating":9,"date":"11 May 1999","review":"Yeah, I mean there will be critics out there who will say, it isn't the greatest acting or dialogue, but the martial arts and the final scene are excellent. Especially from actors such as Eric Roberts and Chris Penn who have had no formal martial arts training. The film is a master piece of martial art cinema, and yes I strongly say it is better than Titanic.","user":"Gothic","rank":[31,41]}]
