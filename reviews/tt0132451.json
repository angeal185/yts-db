[{"title":"Terrible!","rating":1,"date":"18 October 2000","review":"About 95% of the Puppet shots were patched together from other Puppet Master movies. This produces the interesting effect of having someone from the present chatting face to face with a puppet in 1940's Germany. Did they think we wouldn't notice? It just shows you what these film makers think of their audience.<br><br>Then there's the scene in which Tunnler drills a guy between the legs. Where are the guys hands? Flailing around! I think I see a way out of this. Pick up the puppet that is drilling into your balls!<br><br>Idiocy. This was the beginning of Full Moon's death.","user":"goonorama","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Evil Little Dollies","rating":3,"date":"4 March 2003","review":"Based totally on the interesting looking cover I saw, I decided to see this movie. I had not seen any of the previous sequels, so I started from scratch. It starts out strange as a man is burning something and tells whatever it is that he was sorry. This man turns out to be Dr. Magrew, an old tinkering man that appears to be a scientist or something. There are these dolls, strange looking ones that move by themselves. One with a knife, a top's head, pinhead, and a cowboy with six arms. I assumed that they were evil, but they only seemed to kill humans that seemingly deserved to die. Two sheriffs and a bully were the victims. The most evil of the beings turns out to be Dr. Magrew who is turning an innocent man named \"Tank\" into some puppet. Jane Magrew is also innocent and for some reason loves the \"Pinhead\" doll. This doll loves her more than the human Tank whom she falls in love with. A very strange ending as Tank's anger gets the best of him with Dr. Magrew receiving his wrath. Poor Jane just survives but with many questions to answer with all the dead bodies laying around her house. If you like strange then this film is for you.","user":"jcholguin","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Why God, why?","rating":1,"date":"11 March 2001","review":"I rent horror flicks all the time, the campier the better, even such stinkers like Blood Diner... but this... I think that if they had used this film on Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange, he would have gone homicidal again. Full Moon begins to crash and burn, leading to the ultimate craphole, Puppet Master Retro.  The kills are so retarded, and at the end, which made me wish to commit suicide... Tank spends the whole movie carving this puppet out of wood, when he is transferred into it, there's a TV screen?  And a laser? Did I miss something?  And then the way he zaps the scientist... I've seen better special effects in the Power Rangers tv show.  What I realized is that if you read the back of this video box, it tells you the whole story... Seriously, the whole thing.  Damn you to hell for making this movie, Full Moon, and may God have mercy on your souls.","user":"VerbalKint","rank":[6,8]}]
