[{"title":"Nothing special indeed","rating":1,"date":"23 April 2015","review":"Terribly filmed, weakly acted, lamely written, and wretchedly scored. There might be something to the subject of a daughter dealing with her mentally ill mother, but the theme of elderly ladies seems to drag the film-making back in time too. Slow-paced, slow-witted, and silly, the only entertainment is provided by the antics of a dumb hunk, a little dog, a spunky mother, and \"feminist\" discussions that were stale 30 years ago. Either this is some parody that has fallen flat or Combs is so proud of being a \"mature\" woman that she has become a parody of her own grandmother. Some of the supporting characters do a decent job, the highlight for me was a bored receptionist, that is how banal this movie is.","user":"timlin-4","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Special in her own way","rating":8,"date":"16 February 2014","review":"Every woman is special in her own way. This film sensitively depicts the difficulties of living with a mother who is mentally ill while holding down a job and maintaining a close relationship with a boss who is mentoring you for advancement in the company. <br><br>The three female leads are all excellent. Karen Black, in one of her last roles, and Barbara Bain in a rare role, are both delightful to see in these parts. Both play strong women who have personal issues and an affection for the younger woman who holds her own and shows growth over time. <br><br>I'm so glad that I happened to notice this film in my local video store. It is one of those sweet independent productions that doesn't get much attention but will likely be appreciated by those who give it a chance. I will certainly tell people about it. Congratulations to the writer and director on a job well done...","user":"sfdphd","rank":[8,13]}]
