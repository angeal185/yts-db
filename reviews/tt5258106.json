This movie kept me hooked until the very end from the sweeping views of the Philippines waterfalls and greenery to the heartfelt scenes of the characters ups and downs. 100 Yards is a faith based drama about a young pro football athlete who decides to venture out to the Philippines to search for his missing mother. His character arc expands over the film from rage and confusion, to hopelessness, then to faith and realization that to go the 100 Yards you have to be willing to walk every step and face every obstacle with hope and faith. A very great movie and I'll be sure to share this with all our friends and family! I can't wait to see what the director comes up with next!","user":"giannal-19578","rank":[1,7]}]
