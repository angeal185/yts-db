[{"title":"A good interpretation of Naylor's novel...","rating":14,"date":"14 December 2000","review":"I read the novel in my college African-American literature class and loved it.  When I saw the movie version, I was very happy with the way it was done.  Jackee steals the movie with her presentation of Etta Mae.  Oprah does a good job as well.  This movie stayed really close to the plot of the story.  If you want to read the book, but don't have the time, you could probably just watch this movie and pick up on everything that is crucial.

I feel like I was invited in-it is so painfully real.<br><br>The writing, the acting and the directing is so well done.  It also feels like a play.<br><br>It's honest. 9/10","user":"tbabe29","rank":[6,11]},{"title":"Excellent movie. Jackee shines over Oprah!","rating":10,"date":"25 May 1999","review":"Excellent drama about a group of women living in an apartment building. This explores all their lives and shows how everyone is struggling through something. jackee comes out the best! This movie is dramatic, hilarious and heartbreaking.  Such lines as \"You shoulda thoughta that before you started breeding em like roaches!\" and Jackee's one liners during the tenants meeting had me laughing out loud.  Highly recommended!!!!!!","user":"eric-144","rank":[5,10]}]
