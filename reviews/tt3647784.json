[{"title":"I gave us another soldier","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"In 2045 the Malvado Cartel acquires military grade droids. The military gets Carson Wright (Brad Schmidt) out of prison because he has a chip in his head, a fact that failed to play an important role. Brad Schmidt is hardly a screen tough guy. The plot was boring, dialogue tough in a silly way, and acting non-existant. I guess the idea was to put some droids in the film and forget about things that go into making a decent cult grindhouse. <br><br>Sometimes the droids move normally, other times looked like claymation. Not much in character build-up. Mostly a sausage fest. Could have had a hot Asian marine. Not worth the time. <br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"That's a joke","rating":1,"date":"8 July 2018","review":"Totally disaster. Robots looked so fake,visuals so poor,actors are not convincional. Piece of crap. About the plot. This film doesn't have story line. Who is the main character? What happened to him after he won against bad guys? Nothing was shown. Totally rubbish.","user":"Edvis-1997","rank":[4,10]},{"title":"Very bad","rating":2,"date":"14 January 2019","review":"One of the worst movies I have seen.
