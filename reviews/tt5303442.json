[{"title":"His life was more entertaining before Hollywood","rating":8,"date":"21 May 2019","review":"This is a good compilation of Flynn's activities before he became an actor. If you have read his autobiography the story is more or less true. Aussie actors are good and it holds interest. His life in New Guinea and Australia is highly readable and this is a good shot at telling the story. Ain't Shakespeare, but enjoyable.","user":"tflynn-46074","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Underrated movie, not bad at all...","rating":7,"date":"10 February 2019","review":"Nice movie, totally underrated... Somehow reminded me of Indiana jones or some other 80's movie like that. The movie doesn't have much of the fancy special effects that younger generations probably hunger for, so maybe this isn't for teenagers, but people who like older movies will like this because it's made in a similar way like those 80's movies... The story line isn't maybe the best or most exciting, but there is enough entertainment for sure.","user":"yannesbox-179-385862","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"A Win for Flynn","rating":9,"date":"24 April 2019","review":"In Like Flynn is a cinematic masterpiece bringing to life the daring adventures of Hollywood star Errol Flynn before he was discovered by the spotlight. Focusing on Flynn (Thomas Cocquerel) and his fellow sailors, who later become close to family, In Like Flynn takes viewers on an adventure unlike any other. From gunfights to escaping the treacherous jungles, this film is filled with those classic action scenes that are hard to find in modern action-adventure films, bringing back moments that remind me of Indiana Jones type adventures that I could watch again and again.","user":"madiimcc","rank":[9,13]}]
