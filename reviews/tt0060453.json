[{"title":"60s London well worth a (re)visit","rating":8,"date":"24 January 2006","review":"I enjoyed \"Georgy Girl\" at the time of its original release, but hadn't thought about it until I recently viewed the DVD version. This revisit was well worth it: \"Georgy Girl\" is a delightful film.<br><br>Charlotte Rampling's Meredith is my favorite of the four main characters. Rampling has always been physically stunning, but it's her moody intellect within that keeps Meredith modern rather than a 60s icon who looks sensational in Mary Quant mini-dresses, a darker version of Julie Christie in \"Darling\" (a character who didn't have too much of a light side herself). Meredith is cool, in control, self-serving, brutal, and surprisingly honest about who she is. \"You take me as me,\" she tells Jos (Alan Bates) as she cajoles him into marrying her, not so much because she's pregnant but because she's bored. It seems in Meredith's view, you can easily get rid of a pregnancy, but boredom requires more skill and is potentially a worse situation in which to find yourself. Other actresses could have successfully made Meredith a bitch, but Rampling makes her fascinating and thus strangely likable. When she exits the film, things go a bit limp, but then there's little left than to move the story to its inevitable conclusion.<br><br>Alan Bates plays Jos with such high physical and verbal energy he seems to be all the Marx Brothers rolled into one. His facial expression at the culmination of his strip during the 'I Love You' sequence suggested to me a nod to the great Harpo.<br><br>Lynn Redgrave made the role of Georgy so much her own it's difficult to believe the story that Vanessa Redgrave had been originally intended for it -- and even more difficult to imagine Vanessa playing scenes with Rampling.<br><br>The title song became a big hit at the time. In the film, the lyrics vary somewhat from the pop version, serving to set up the plot during the opening credits and then comment on its resolution at the end. In between, the song politely vanishes, leaving the classically influenced score by Alexander Faris to take over with its harpsichord riffs and its subtle playfulness. I especially liked the violin solo that accompanies the transition from orgasm to morning sickness.<br><br>The dialogue is often fast, overlapping, thrown away, or contains obscure (to me) cultural references, so it's worth enabling the English subtitles for DVD viewing. You wouldn't want to miss \"Moss Bros\", or Alan Bates' rapid-fire disrobing monologue, or Meredith's contempt for the concert at which she has just played violin: \"Beethoven night. They're like animals.\"","user":"warrenk-2","rank":[49,53]},{"title":"One of my personal cult movies","rating":8,"date":"22 April 2002","review":"Reviews seem to miss the real theme of this film, which is about the voyage of self-discovery of a person who feels out of sync with her world and tries to define, or redefine, her own true self. This theme has a strange attraction for me -- I identify with Georgy's search, I think, because of my own feelings of misalignment with the world or alienation. Unfortunately, as a male, it seems that the principal characters in films addressing this theme with sensitivity are invariably women. Perhaps in our society men are expected not to have such uncertainties about themselves or to suppress them, so no films are made. Two other films I enjoyed because of their similar themes are \"Muriel's Wedding\" and \"Thelma and Louise\". If you like, you can tell me I'm reading far more into this film than was ever intended, reminiscent of Mark Twain's famous warning. But you won't convince me!

Redgrave's roommate is a cold-hearted and embittered woman, who banks on her good looks to get her what she wants out of life. Although the roommate becomes pregnant by her fiancee, the young man soon realizes that he fancys the homely but sweet Georgy over the constantly complaining woman about to give birth to his child. The baby is born and is instantly rejected by the mother. Georgy is determined to protect the innocent child and to bring her up by herself, if she had to. The ending is one of my favorite film conclusions ever. You will not be disappointed!<br><br>This film was ahead of its time in 1966 England (and the world). Despite the progressive themes, both the film and its infectious theme song became enormous successes. If you know the song, look for a much more elaborate rendition in the film, featuring many extra lines. The same was done with the legendary \"Song From Moulin Rouge\" (1952). -- \"Georgy Girl\" receives my highest recommendation!*****","user":"thursdays","rank":[56,63]}]
