[{"title":"miłość tak właściwie 8/10","rating":8,"date":"1 December 2017","review":"I've said it before and I'll say it again , i haven't seen a bad Polish film yet and here's another good one . <br><br>It wasn't perfect and it's not the best I've seen but it was definitely good and worth seeing . <br><br>This is the third in a series and I haven't seen the others so I can't comment if there's an ongoing story but this stood out on its own . <br><br>I felt like I was watching a direct copy of one of my favourite films at times LOVE ACTUALLY (2003) . It turns out since seeing it that is actually part of its marketing and the fact that all the music was English added to that . Plus the use of the oboe to highlight romance adding to the theme. <br><br>So this is another Christmas movie but the clue was in the title ' letter to Santa ' But it a beautiful story of intertwined stories exactly as you have in Love Actually with so many situations and characters that seem indentical but that wasn't a bad thing as it added to the familiarity and enjoyment. <br><br>I look forward to the next Polish movie , they're simply much better than most of what Hollywood forces on us . <br><br>Pad.A 8/10","user":"Padreviews","rank":[5,7]}]
