[{"title":"Losers Take All is a comedy in which we follow \"The Fingers,\" a fictional punk-pop band as they strive for success, while struggling with internal band issues.","rating":7,"date":"3 December 2013","review":"Losers Take All was perhaps the best thing to happen to me this year. I stumbled upon this gem on Netflix, and I must say, I was impressed. Initially I was interested when I saw that this film was a part of the Kevin Smith Movie Club, but then I also realized that it stars Kyle Gallner, who worked with Smith on Red State. Being a huge Kevin Smith fan, I had to give it a watch.<br><br>The movie begins with two friends in high school who, as many people who start bands normally do, have tastes in music that differ from the norm. Fast forward a few years, and Brian and Dave are in a failing band, playing in roller rinks, and going nowhere. Luckily, they find a guitarist and a drummer at a show they attend, and even though their musical tastes differ, Brian decides they must form a band, or rather the Mescalin decides. Throw in a furniture selling manager, and an A team van and let the games begin!<br><br>Basically, in 2013 if a movie isn't a remake, or total crap I enjoy it; so I enjoy about five movies a year. Losers Take All was hilarious, well written, evenly paced, and it dealt with real issues all bands face such as creative differences between main members. The director, Alex Steyermark, does an amazing job considering it was only his third film, and previous work as executive music producer on over 50 titles gave him insight into creating a good film soundtrack.<br><br>The acting wasn't amazing, but it was far from bad, and the music in the movie was better than what most bands are putting out today. If SLC Punk, Airheads, and The Rocker had a baby from some crazy threesome, this movie would be it. I would recommend this to anyone 16+ and hope to find similar movies because it was just that enjoyable.","user":"The-Plague","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Apart of the music there's not much going on.","rating":5,"date":"27 February 2019","review":"Following a starting band, watching their struggle to find gigs, fans or a company that wants to produce them, it's all déjà-vu to me. I'm not saying that the acting was bad or so as it wasn't but the story just lacks some enthusiasm and originality. It's all too cliché to be special. And for a comedy it clearly lacks of humor. It's not the couple funny moments there are that will make this a comedy I will remember. If you want to watch something simular but really funny than I recommend you watch Flight Of The Conchords (2007), a serie that deserved so much more credit. The good part of Losers Take All is the music. For once the music didn't suck so that's a good point. For the rest it's really nothing special.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Fun romp, great music","rating":9,"date":"12 January 2014","review":"After sitting through a complete train-wreck of a movie (my husband's choice) I figured I couldn't do any worse and picked \"Losers take all\" on Netflix, even though our musical tastes differ greatly. Amazingly we BOTH loved this movie - a rare occurrence. <br><br>I am not a movie critic, I don't care about actors, and I don't need to over-analyze; a movie that tells me a story, keeps me entertained, interested, and emotionally connected to the characters will get an easy 6/10 or higher ranking from me. <br><br>'Losers take all' does all of that and more; the acting was genuine and believable; and the trip back to the 1980s brought back memories; the camera was an unobtrusive observer without being unimaginative; but best of all, the movie made my husband and me laugh out loud frequently, and not once was I told to \"turn the volume down\"... the usual consequence of any music-related movie-watching that I enjoy. <br><br>In some films of the genre (a band forms and tries for stardom) the music sucks, or the actors clearly cannot play/sing, or most often... BOTH. This is not the case here. And yes, sure, there were some cliché moments, but they (as with all the funny parts) did not seem trite or artificial at all, but arose with organic authenticity. I especially liked how they integrated the 'on the road' experiences.<br><br>Although I was never really into punk and metal at the time, I loved the soundtrack for the film - great stuff! Made me feel 20 years young/er ; )","user":"rhondasmit","rank":[4,6]}]
