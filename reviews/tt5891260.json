[{"title":"Someone is Trying to Tank this Movie... Don't Let Them!","rating":10,"date":"4 January 2020","review":"Groupers is an incredibly fun, surprisingly poignant, and undeniably original film. I was lucky enough to see it in theaters and when I first checked the ratings they were where I expected them to be (in the 7-8 range)<br><br>Suddenly, an influx of 1 star reviews (oddly on the same day) have unfairly hurt the little-indie-Movie-that-could. Im not sure if it's homophobes or someone who has it out for the director or one of the actors, but it certainly seems suspicious.<br><br>Check it out for yourself!","user":"brennansnyder-11126","rank":[46,54]},{"title":"I am not a film critic...and I enjoyed the movie","rating":8,"date":"3 January 2020","review":"I am not a critic or a \"film school guy\", I am just like to watch various types of movies and appreciate them for what they are, a brief escape from reality. This movie is weird, somewhat disturbing, and has some dark humor to hold the attention of the audience throughout. It's a look into how groups form, shape your thinking, and ultimately how we can grow out of the 'group think' mindset. If you don't take yourself too seriously, you can, and should, enjoy this film for what it is...","user":"troytaylor-04036","rank":[41,48]},{"title":"Don't assume that all good reviews are fake. I really liked this movie","rating":7,"date":"30 December 2019","review":"Totally novel idea and really well acted, shot and nicely developed.<br><br>Sure it has flaws but I'd much rather watch this movie that has created such a visceral reaction from people than some of the other, middle of the road trash currently out there.<br><br>Really nice work","user":"future_release","rank":[45,54]}]
