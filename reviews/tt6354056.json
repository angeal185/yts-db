[{"title":"A fun gay comedy for any adult","rating":8,"date":"18 December 2018","review":"Yeah, this is bound to upset some yahoos, promoting a society that accepts LGBQT, but it is actually quite smart and very funny in its approach to the superhero genre while making a social commentary that's rarely hit-over-the-head level. As an ally, I laughed through most of it, and nodded my head in others in agreement. So worth a viewing. There is some male nudity, so keep the kids away if you must, but if your sense is an open-minded one, gay or straight, there is a lot to enjoy here. Even if you're Canadian (if you see the film, you'll understand what I mean).","user":"rbf55","rank":[12,30]},{"title":"A Fun Time with something different.","rating":8,"date":"28 December 2018","review":"Better than average campy fun movie. As someone earlier mentioned, think of a James Bond movie done by a collaboration of Mel Brooks &amp; the Broken Lizard folks. The acting was decently accomplished, particularly by the two leads. There was full frontal nudity which wasn't titillating and I suppose would turn some off. If there was one thing that turned me off it was the impression that the entire movie was dubbed.","user":"ljmcfarland","rank":[5,11]},{"title":"Hilarious from start to finish.","rating":9,"date":"18 December 2018","review":"You know how Mel Brooks makes fun of Hitler? Well, enter Richard Griffin against MAGA.","user":"whatboxcreations","rank":[11,31]}]
