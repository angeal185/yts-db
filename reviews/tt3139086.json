[{"title":"\"Seriously? Ice Puns?\"","rating":8,"date":"12 January 2015","review":"Batman is a real badass, the Joker is a total wacko, Harley Quinn is hot. What else do you need? No but seriously, Aussault on Arkham did many things right, the characters are fun (especially Boomerang who is the major comic relief in this movie, the Joker and of course Quinn), the action is pretty awesome and there were some very fine One-Liners also.<br><br>What I liked the most was the very mature style of the movie, there is blood spilled, heads are blown of and teeth get punched in but nothing is never totally over the top (as many already said it's very surprising Assault on Arkham was rated PG-13 and not R).<br><br>Altogether I liked: <br><br>-gritty style <br><br>-mature humor <br><br>-well animated action/fight scenes <br><br>-actuall plot surprises <br><br>-real fight consequences (villains DIE, and don't flee with a black eye) <br><br>-GREAT voice acting<br><br>Now for the things I did not like: <br><br>-not enough Joker (yes his role was pretty major but it was not quite enough screen time for my taste)<br><br>-overall to short (71 mins? really?)","user":"T_Beer","rank":[36,39]},{"title":"Awesome!!","rating":10,"date":"2 August 2014","review":"DC animated movies almost never fail to please me and Batman: Assault on Arkham, directed by Jay Oliva and Ethan Spaulding, portrays criminals with a vicious and sexy attitude.<br><br>With almost all the same voice actors from the Batman Arkham series including Kevin Conroy, Oliva and Spaulding take the Batman animated movies into Arkham Asylum just as portrayed in the Arkham video games series. In my opinion, it's about time Warner Brothers created a Batman animated movie based on the atmosphere of the Arkham games as it is so popular with the fans. <br><br>Interestingly enough, this movie focuses more on a criminal special task force created by Amanda Waller, who also created the Suicide Squad, rather than Batman; however, there was still enough of Batman to satisfy our Dark Knight needs especially when the voice is Kevin Conroy. What surprised me the most was Troy Baker as the voice of the Joker. Though he has been the voice of Joker before, I almost thought it was Mark Hamill until I looked up the cast. With that in mind, Baker's acting inspires me with high hopes for the Jokers future.<br><br>Overall, this Batman animated movie had a sexy, trilling, attitude which was packed full of lethal action that would please any Batman fan. A perfect 10!","user":"crimson_knight_7","rank":[89,105]},{"title":"Better than the Live-Action Suicide Squad Movie!","rating":10,"date":"28 January 2017","review":"It's really not that big of a surprise to find out that \"Batman: Assault on Arkham\" is a much better Suicide Squad movie than the one with Jai Courtney (Captain Boomerang), Jerod Leto (\"The Joker), Margot Robbie (Harley Quinn) and Will Smith. I mean, duh?! We should've seen this coming, but I guess not.<br><br>But yeah, everything that was literally wrong with the live-action \"Suicide Squad\" movie, this movie actually made up for as DC and Warner Bros.' way of saying, \"We're sorry\" to the fans.<br><br>Bottom-line, if you want to see a really good Suicide Squad movie, don't watch the live-action version. Go watch this movie instead. It deserves a lot more attention.<br><br>10 out of 10 stars.","user":"xgray-03873","rank":[15,16]}]
