[{"title":"Dead-on parody of Hollywood","rating":8,"date":"11 June 2000","review":"This is a great movie.  It is absolutely hilarious, and it easily represents R. Townshend's best work.  In fact, it's far, far better than anything else he's ever done, which is remarkable considering the film's tiny budget.<br><br>\nThe humor is biting and relevant.  The movie is highly recommended.","user":"BigMan-12","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"Perfect","rating":10,"date":"10 August 2003","review":"I've forced this film on all my friends and there isn't one who regrets seeing it. A couple haven't been that enthusiastic at first; thought it was all right but didn't understand the fuss I make about it, but the next day they'll want to watch it again.<br><br>I find it pretty embarrassing when someone quotes the inevitable Austin Powers, but for months after seeing this film I just couldn't help it - probably the reason I had to get everyone I know to watch it.<br><br>Some films have great scenes and some are just good films; this is both. Genuinely funny with real heart.<br><br>Say it with me now: WINKY DINKY DOGGG.","user":"onlylivingboy","rank":[24,27]},{"title":"Impressive Independent Film - Real and Funny","rating":8,"date":"3 February 2004","review":"Interesting and impressive, Hollywood Shuffle allows the characters to make the point that Townsend is making, without being too harsh or lecture-like. The film incorporates some great parody scenes such as the Siskel and Ebert inspired \"Speed and Tyrone\" where the reviewers sneak into movies.<br><br>\nMost impressive is the background to the film, which makes the finished product all the more impressive.  Townsend's freshmen effort is a true success, and goes where few first timers are normally able to go.<br><br>8/10","user":"Headbiscuit","rank":[15,16]}]
