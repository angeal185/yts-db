[{"title":"I think you're innocent","rating":2,"date":"6 January 2019","review":"Reggie (Omar Brunson) is being harassed to sell drugs. He is saved by a homeless boxer (Steve Daron) who teaches him how to fight. Add a poorly scripted backstory and a cameo by Burt Reynolds.<br><br>This was not a gripping film by any means. It has all the excitement of an after school special. The plot and dialogue were predictable and boring.<br><br>Guide: No swearing sex or nudity in an urban drug crime film.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Straight to DVD","rating":1,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"An absolute howler. Don't bother wasting 90 minutes of your life on this drivel!!","user":"superwraight","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Looks Like A Bad TV Movie","rating":1,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"A predictable, timeworn plot. Hackneyed, shallow characters. Corny, banal script, all of which is dragged along by wooden, amateurish acting. The fight scenes are particularly embarrassing!<br><br>I did not want to see Burt Reynolds lend his talent to this quagmire of pointlessness, so I turned it off after 30 minutes, something I very rarely do.<br><br>How anybody can consider this a well-made film beggars belief!","user":"cobdun","rank":[3,5]}]
