[{"title":"I owe the \"Black Christmas\" 2006 version an apology..","rating":1,"date":"13 December 2019","review":"Blumhouse is hit or miss with their movies.. THIS one was terribly bad. When this movie was announced I already knew it was gonna be a let down. Stick with the original, or even the 2006 version. The 2006 version was FAR better than this trash. Plus, the trailer showed pretty much everything. So, do yourself a favor and save your money. Watch the trailer instead to see the whole movie, because that's what the trailer basically did. 1/10.","user":"jess-gonz20","rank":[320,359]},{"title":"Get revenge.","rating":2,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"If you know someone in your life who you hate then buy them a ticket to see this.\nThen sit back and laugh like Mr Burns knowing they are watching this awful movie.","user":"websterlovesfilms","rank":[287,330]},{"title":"A DISGRACE to the 1974 Classic!!!","rating":1,"date":"13 December 2019","review":"And I thought the 2006 remake was bad? HA. This one makes it look like a great movie! Seriously guys, this movie had no quality plot, writing, thought, or direction. The characters were exceptionally bad and unlikable and had no depth. The scares were clich√© and very unoriginal. It's a total introvert to the 1974 cult classic. The original actually had suspense, a creepy atmosphere, scary scenes, and an effective direction. This one had none of those things...\nI'm very surprised because Blumhouse usually makes quality films, from my experience. Very disappointed.<br><br>DO NOT ruin your holidays and see Black Christmas! The original is great, but not this one!","user":"JohnnyRatesALot","rank":[247,283]}]
