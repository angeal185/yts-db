[{"title":"Spider-Man Far From Home is truly amazing","rating":10,"date":"20 July 2019","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of these movies (Iron Man, Thor, Spider-Man, Black Panther &amp; All The Avengers) &amp; I Loved Spider-Man Homecoming &amp; Spider-Man Far From Home is even better. It's a fantastic storyline &amp; it's so action packed &amp; I love that they brought in Quentin Black AKA Mysterio. This movie had so many twists &amp; turns &amp; I liked that they introduced the character \"MJ\" who in the previous films was played by \"Kirsten Dunst\" this entire film is great &amp; I can't wait for part 3.","user":"celebration72","rank":[111,163]},{"title":"For all Spider-Man's fans","rating":10,"date":"30 July 2019","review":"Great movie, well done!! Good storyline, acting and action. A must watch","user":"shanksrajendran","rank":[140,209]},{"title":"Brilliant follow up to Endgame and Homecoming","rating":10,"date":"21 July 2019","review":"After the emotional turmoil that was Endgame, this movie expands upon the idea of \"what happens now?\". The tone of the movie is lighthearted but has some deep moments, making the viewer laugh and cry. Gorgeous visuals and a great script complement the perfectly casted actors. However, some tension gets removed quickly by cheap jokes and predictability.","user":"icescream-00727","rank":[117,173]}]
