[{"title":"Old school horror from Vietnam","rating":6,"date":"24 February 2018","review":"As a Vietnamese myself I never care about the film industry in Vietnam cause they often produce way too many awful movie so to see a movie especially my favorite genre horror from my homeland get the attention from the West is awesome but at the same time I'm not biased at all when review The Housemaid cause it still a genetic Asian horror movie with the usual twitching dark woman.It not scary and the mellow drama not helping anything but I will give props to the director for trying the best he can to deliver a enjoyable horror movie without the bad taste joke or over the top acting I usually see in a Vietnam movie","user":"phanthinga","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"Not what it seems","rating":9,"date":"18 February 2017","review":"Great movie and one of the most horrifying I've seen. I'm not sure how scary this movie would be if I watched it at home with a bunch of other people, but when I watched it at the movies, the entire cinema was empty. I was the only person at the screening and and though it wasn't the scariest movie I've watched, it was definitely one of the most scary experiences I've had. Primarily, the movie relied on incredibly loud jumpscares, but it backed up the fear factor with the disturbing and original storyline. <br><br>I regard movies set in this time period poorly, as it just doesn't interest me, but this was not let down by the fact it was set in an earlier time. The mansion and its surroundings were nicely developed into a surprisingly eerie setting and the plot twists and turns as the movie progresses. <br><br>I always enjoy the fresh feel of Asian horror movies. This was the first Vietnamese horror I've watched (having mainly viewed Chinese and Japanese horror movies) and it was certainly impressive. About 50% of the movie is in English, so if you don't like subs, it's all good. <br><br>SEMI-SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT... The aspect I felt this movie lacked was a grand finale of jumpscares and terror. Movies such as 'The Conjuring 2' and 'Lights Out' both ended this way and it greatly increased the overall scare of the movies. Though I remember praying that there wouldn't be a finale at the time (as I was fairly freaked out having watched the movie alone), I think it could have capped it off nicely.","user":"Horror-88","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"Not a bad story, could have used more horror scenes","rating":6,"date":"1 May 2018","review":"I never expect very much when I watch a Vietnamese movie. Most of the time they are not that great due to overacting and things like that. But with The Housemaid I never had that feeling, on the contrary I thought all the actors were good for once. For the horror part I was expecting more though. Okay it's a bit dark and there are some good passages but the movie could have used more of those moments. The story wasn't bad either. It came even with a twist that I didn't see coming and that's always good. I would not go that far that I would watch it again but it's worth a watch. When it's about Asian movies the Korean ones are definitely the best ones but this Vietnamese one was better then I expected it to be.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[4,4]}]
