[{"title":"Definitely worth seeing for two amazing performances from Downey and Duvall.","rating":8,"date":"7 September 2014","review":"I saw this film twice at TIFF and was quite impressed! It's getting some harsh reviews, undeservedly. Yes, it's too long and yes, director David Dobkin needs to work on his tone and pacing, but the story is great and the performances are fantastic! <br><br>Not a simple courtroom drama at all, the story is more about Hank Palmer (Downey)'s struggle to understand his relationship with his father and to accept where he came from. It's about identity, family, and all the messiness and contradictions of life. <br><br>If you are a teenager who can't sit still through a more-than-two-hours long movie, or expect some type of John Grisham or Iron Man-like action from this film, you will be disappointed. If you are a true film lover who revels in watching great actors practice their craft, you will not be disappointed by The Judge. <br><br>This movie is definitely worth sitting through for amazing performances by both Downey and Duvall, who could both be up for Oscar nominations for their roles as the son and father, respectively. There are many very funny moments as well as many touching moments between father and son, brother and brother. The audience I sat with at Roy Thomson Hall loved it, frequently expressing their appreciation with laughter. See for yourself on October 10--don't let a few critics spoil it for you.","user":"eem-439-229585","rank":[250,288]},{"title":"Beautiful and Deeply Touching","rating":8,"date":"11 October 2014","review":"I don't usually write a review, but I feel compelled to defend this film against critics who, I feel, have unfairly given it a low rating. While its premise is not necessarily unique and it has its fair share of clich√©s, The Judge is a deeply moving film that showcases the acting powerhouse that is Robert Duvall and the undeniable versatility and magnetic screen presence of Robert Downey Jr. There are also strong supporting performances from Vera Farmiga (she and RJD have great chemistry), Billy Bob Thornton, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Jeremy Strong. I dare anyone who has dealt with family issues not to be affected. Forget the critics - they don't know everything - and do yourself a favour and watch The Judge. You won't regret it.","user":"AnnikaLen","rank":[288,340]},{"title":"A Great Film that I highly recommend if you are an adult","rating":10,"date":"2 November 2014","review":"If you are an adult wanting to see a great film about real life family issues with some terrific court room drama you should see this film. It is well written and directed with great performances by Downey and Duvall. I think Downey gives his best performance in a film and Duvall is again outstanding. <br><br>I found this to be a better film than Gone Girl. It is more believable and more moving.<br><br>I am a baby boomer who likes science fiction but I am quite pleased to see a film without a super hero and CG images. <br><br>I hope to convince my daughters (all in their 20's) and my parents (in their 80's) to see this movie.","user":"DocIndy","rank":[79,92]}]
