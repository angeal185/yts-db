[{"title":"Still Great","rating":27,"date":"27 October 2017","review":"My boyfriend has this on DVD so we put it on last night and watched it together. It is still good and has not dated at all.<br><br>The clique is indeed mean and one wonders whether high schools are like that today. I graduated high school a decade ago and don't remember such a mean environment, but then again that is the appeal and story of the film.<br><br>The girls are really hot and they flaunt it. Gretchen is the prettiest to me, but of course they are all handpicked to be pretty especially during their stage show.<br><br>In short, funny, mean, sexy and anyone who has attended high school is bound to identify to some degree. Fun film","user":"ahf-23971","rank":[170,177]},{"title":"Fun, Sexy, Engaging","rating":9,"date":"26 August 2017","review":"This film is fun. You laugh, you get angry and you enjoy the show (literally, there is one!) This film is sexy. Who doesn't like girls in mini skirts? Well, OK a few do not for legitimate reasons, but most men do. Sex and the human body is natural, primordial and eternal and this film gives you eye candy sweetness.<br><br>This film is engaging. You are interested in the characters, the actresses take on their personas well and the plot moves along quickly.","user":"l-70607","rank":[206,230]},{"title":"Fun, Entertaining but Not Realistic","rating":21,"date":"21 July 2018","review":"This is a fun, entertaining classic film that is sexy, hip and full of attitude. I love it.\nHaving said that, reading the many reviews some claim this is realistic or true to the high school culture. I like to know which schools these reviewers attended. It is nothing like my high school! And I don't want them to be like one another. I watch movies for flights of fantasy not for realism (unless it is a documentary)!","user":"Stephanie-thrasher","rank":[105,115]}]
