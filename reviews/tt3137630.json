[{"title":"I don't care what others say, I loved it!","rating":10,"date":"4 March 2017","review":"OK, don't shoot me, I'm a humongous Ricky Gervais fan, ever since I saw The Office for the first time, so I may not be the most objective of people. But films are made for us all, including crazy fans like me, and we're all entitled to our opinion. And my opinion is - it is brilliant and I love it. I loved cringing all the time at Brent's pathetic ridiculousness, but I also loved his humanity and true heartbreak. I don't agree the film is over-sentimental. We get a chance to see Brent's soft side, though he's trying his best to hide it, and it's great. Ricky Gervais is an absolute genius at portraying this character, and I hope it's not the last we see of him. Additionally, since I have a chance to do it here, I want to express my admiration for Ricky Gervais as a person, a beautiful person who stands up for those who have no voice.

Barely anyone turns up and even his own band doesn't like him.<br><br>The plot is OK...You can tell that David Brant despite all the 'foot in mouth' moments is a genuine tryer and does garner some sympathy towards the end of the movie. its apparent the humour does disguise an individual seeking acceptance and genuine friends. <br><br>I had many good laughs - an easy 8/10 for me...","user":"gbrady01","rank":[26,34]},{"title":"Cringeworthy for all the wrong reasons.","rating":3,"date":"20 August 2016","review":"Precursor: Huge fan of the UK Office, the Gervais, Merchant &amp; Pilkington radio shows and Podcasts, and Extras. <br><br>Life on the Road is a tread through the same old water that does nothing with the David Brent character except make him more unbelievable. The brilliance and innovation of The Office came from the characters being true to life, and carefully written. Without Stephen Merchant Ricky Gervais is exposed as an awful writer. Like Derek, this suffers from painfully clumsy dialogue, each character having to spell out their feelings as if keeping a diary. The \"mockumentary\" format is now well and truly a dead horse. Gervais has steered the comedy formula he popularised into a brick wall. <br><br>The characters are all regurgitated. There's a new Gareth, a new Finchy, a new Dawn. The pacing of the film is awful and the whole second half is cobbled into one rushed mess of an ending. <br><br>The concept isn't so terrible on paper. Brent's band, Forgone Conclusion, are a recognisable characteristic of every backwater British town, the group of ageing, leather jacket clad rock and rollers who can't let go, and want to give it one last push to \"make it in the music biz\". The problem is this shtick isn't enough to carry the film, and the fuddy duddy rock lyrics are a joke that wears thin. To combat this, Brent inexplicably writes songs like \"Be Nice to the Disabled(s)\", and the character is uncompromisingly steered into social calamity. <br><br>Another problem with Gervais' sledgehammer approach to subtle writing is that the characters intended to come off as \"cool\" (Doc Brown's rapper character, the label reps) feel incredibly corny, while those intended to come off as corny come across as something far worse.<br><br>We have little time to get to know or care about anyone in Brent's new office, these scenes are forgettable and do little other than trying to re-hash the TV series. Fans of the old XFM shows will notice a welcome return of Ho-Lee Fook, the little funny Chinese fella, in one of the funnier scenes in the film. There's not much else to get your teeth into: it's a pointless film. If Gervais and Merchant actually put their heads together and wrote something original, they'd be dangerous. As it is, like Derek, Life's Too Short and Hello Ladies, this is a tired vanity project with no purpose, no insight, and no imagination.","user":"davidwmfc","rank":[84,125]}]
