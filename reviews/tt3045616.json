[{"title":"Maybe I just like bad movies","rating":9,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"I saw this movie with my family a few years ago because of Depp and McGregor and we all ended up laughing the whole time and enjoying it. I'm not saying it's up for best picture or anything but it's certainly a movie you can pop in and get some laughs out of.","user":"tuckerbuffington","rank":[33,37]},{"title":"Under-rated old fashioned romp","rating":7,"date":"11 May 2015","review":"This movie actually made me register with IMDb to publish my displeasure. I've read the reviews here and typically they're from art house aficionados who sooooo want everything to have meaning. News flash, sometimes a movie is just a movie and sometimes humour is unsophisticated. Get over it.<br><br>Johnny Depp seems to be a target for these reviewers at the moment. I found his performance/homage to Terry Thomas \"rather good\". The various cameos and supporting performances were also \"rather good\" The film is soaked in British humour and I can see how some from the \"colonies\" just don't get it but for people to give this 1 or 2 out of 10 is beyond belief.","user":"dave-milne-02443","rank":[119,149]},{"title":"Silly Fun!","rating":6,"date":"18 April 2015","review":"Adapted from the book anthology by the same name written by Kyril Bonfiglioli, 'Mortdecai' is silly fun! Though never hilarious, this recent box-office disappoint isn't entirely bad either. <br><br>'Mortdecai' Synopsis: Juggling angry Russians, the British Mi5, and an international terrorist, debonair art dealer and part time rogue Charlie Mortdecai races to recover a stolen painting rumored to contain a code that leads to lost Nazi gold.<br><br>'Mortdecai' needed more wit &amp; humor, no doubt. But what is served in this action-comedy, isn't unbearable. Some of it actually works, as the bumbling protagonist gets into a series of wacky moments. Even the supporting characters are fairly appealing. But, in totality, I wanted to laugh more. <br><br>Eric Aronson's Screenplay is continuously silly &amp; on-track, but not foolproof. David Koepp's Direction is impressive. So is the Cinematography. The Editing, however, lacks sharpness. Costume Design &amp; Action-Sequences, are fair.<br><br>Performance-Wise: Johnny Depp as Mortdecai, is in good goofy mode. The versatile actor seems to be enjoying himself, although his talent is much above a film such as this. Ewan McGregor is first-rate. Gwyneth Paltrow looks aged &amp; tired here. Paul Bettany has his moments. Olivia Munn is seductive. Jeff Goldblum appears in a cameo.<br><br>On the whole, 'Mortdecai' won't make you fall of your seat with laughter, nor will it want you to pull your hair in anger. Its strictly a one-time watch.","user":"namashi_1","rank":[57,75]}]
