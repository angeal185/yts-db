[{"title":"Agatha's novel comes to brilliant life.","rating":2,"date":"2 August 2002","review":"In a time when people consider the likes of Vin Diesel, Jack Black, and various three name actors as underated actors, people should realize what a brilliant talent Sir Peter Ustinov is. Ustinov, a two-time Academy Award winner, has done it all, whether it would be Kubrick films, children's programs, teleplays, feature films: you name it, he's done it. He also plays the definitive Hercule Poirot, the Agatha Christie creation.<br><br>Evil Under The Sun is done almost like a play, but a good play. Poirot is vacationing at a posh resort as the fee for helping a millionaire find out who stole his expensive diamond. Poirot meets up with plenty of the usual types that would be at these places in the mid-30's, including an ex-actress named Arlena Marshall (Diana Rigg) who is pretty much hated by everyone. As in all cases with murder mysteries, Mrs. Marshall is murdered, and Poirot uses his abilities to solve the crime.<br><br>This movie was great. It drew me in because Ustinov and the all-star cast work brilliantly together to make the film a joy. The acting and the story are superb. Also, despite the fact that it's an 80's movie, you won't see any of the trappings of that decade. Hey, any film with an English-speaking Jane Birkin is a must watch for me. I don't know if it's available on DVD, but I'm sure A&amp;E or some other similar channel will air it. Recommended.","user":"BlackJack_B","rank":[53,55]},{"title":"Peter Ustinov, Mediterranean sunshine, a dead body -- all this and Cole Porter too!","rating":7,"date":"7 May 2002","review":"Peter Ustinov recreates the role of Poirot, following the wonderful Death On The Nile.   This is not the story as Agatha Christie wrote it, but here we have a rare example of the movie being better than the book.  In fact it would be more accurate to say that here we have a murder mystery based on an idea by Miss Christie.  We are presented with is a cast of characters, a murder victim, and just about everyone has a motive. Poirot of course, deduces who did it.  The sun in question, under which this evil takes place, shines down on a privately owned island in the Mediterranean, giving us a warm and exotic location.<br><br>There isn't one bad performance among the cast, several of whom have appeared before in at least one other Poirot story.  Maggie Smith and Jane Birkin in Evil Under The Sun;  Dennis Quilley and Colin Blakely in Murder On The Orient Express.   Diana Rigg and Maggie Smith almost steal the show as two women who smile sweetly at each other as they spit venom!  But every bit as good are Blakely, Quilley, Mason, McDowall and the rest.  And while all this is going on, the soundtrack is solid gold Cole Porter, which has been orchestrated perfectly to fit the story.<br><br>This movie is pure fun.  Make yourself comfortable, suspend disbelief and allow yourself to be transported to another era and location for a couple of hours of enjoyment.","user":"Graunch","rank":[40,41]},{"title":"Good murder mystery","rating":8,"date":"12 February 2007","review":"Hercule Poirot (Peter Ustinov) is vacationing at a resort on a beautiful island. A very rich and evil woman (Diana Rigg) is murdered. The owner of the resort (Maggie Smith) hires Poirot to find the killer.<br><br>This was made because \"Death on the Nile\" was such a big hit. For some reason this bombed quickly at the box office. I can't see why--it's no classic but it's actually well-done on beautiful locations with a good cast. Ustinov is just perfect as Poirot and the rest of the big name cast (among them...Roddy McDowell, Sylvia Miles, James Mason) do well. Nicholas Clay especially stands out...and wears a VERY tight bathing suit through most of the movie. The script is well-written with some hysterically catty dialogue between Rigg and Smith. There's also some great Cole Porter songs on the soundtrack and the costumes are just breath-taking (especially on Rigg).<br><br>Not as good as \"Death...\" but fun and enjoyable. Worth catching.","user":"preppy-3","rank":[17,17]}]
