[{"title":"Worth a watch, but you may get angry","rating":9,"date":"19 September 2018","review":"I am not from the US, I don't like in a country where abortion is much of a debate. It's crazy to see a country which boasts about personal freedoms is determined to remove reproduction freedoms from women. It made me angry that the anti-choicers just ignored why abortion became legal in the first place. It was a hard watch, but very interesting. I wanted to shout through the screen","user":"chazzheaton","rank":[42,62]},{"title":"Absolutely brilliant! But very upsetting","rating":10,"date":"14 September 2018","review":"This documentary showcases the many dimensions of the politicized abortion In the United States. It gives you a facutal ground about the opposing sides, and illustrates the extreme power and responsibility that the appointed judges have in the Supreme Court. <br><br>It will however make you very upset when you realize that the opposing side has a lot of men in powerful positions making decisions about women. An eye opening documentary for sure, a must see for both men and women.","user":"lottanordin-90611","rank":[44,73]},{"title":"We will never go back","rating":10,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"Opposition to abortion was never a \"woman\" issue, but always a political tool used by men in power to control women. It is a proven scientific fact that pregnancy &amp; child birth is more dangerous for a woman than a safe &amp; legal abortion. Every person. male &amp; female, needs to watch this documentary &amp; demand &amp; vote that the right for a woman to make her own choice about her own pregnancy be protected by the constitution. Her rights are not a tool for male politicians to use for their gain.","user":"amberwatts-46670","rank":[38,74]}]
