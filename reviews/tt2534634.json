[{"title":"Great film featuring both good fencing and history","rating":10,"date":"9 February 2016","review":"When I first heard about this film, I was rather apprehensive about its portrayal of fencing. Too often such films fall prey to unrealistic swordplay, or to relegating the fencing to some metaphors and maybe a lunge every now and then.<br><br>Not so with this movie. Not only are the lessons portrayed in a realistic way, the tournament itself had the feel of an actual tournament and the actions executed looked like they were supposed to. I did notice the modern scoring system was used, but I assume this is so as not to confuse the viewer; the old system kept track of hits scored against a fencer, and as such the numbers would be reversed.<br><br>History-wise, it gave a good picture of the time period and the perils in which Soviet citizens found themselves.<br><br>In my eyes, the only 'weak point' would be that the underdog story is a rather standard one, but I honestly didn't feel that it detracted from the movie at all.","user":"turok-91212","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Beautiful film about small people under the Soviet rule.","rating":8,"date":"4 April 2015","review":"A good film about seldom-seen topic. Living was difficult and sometimes dangerous under the Soviet rule in Estonia straight after WW II and Klaus Härö's film tells story about that. It has been built around true story about a teacher which teaches his pupils to fence. <br><br>Problem on this film was that I knew too much about the story before seeing it. So it didn't give many surprises.<br><br>Not much to complain about directing, acting or anything else. Maybe the story needed something more to be more interesting but the film depends on true story so it could have been wrong to make up something.<br><br>Best thing about this film is that there is used both languages Estonian and Russian. So the characters use the right languages. It is of course subtitled.","user":"sakari-lonn","rank":[37,44]},{"title":"Slow paced, poignant, captivating, well-acted gem","rating":10,"date":"22 October 2016","review":"I came across this gem by accident. A friend gave me several movies and I only just found this one 8 months later. I found this movie extremely touching. The pace was slow but I found that this accentuated the underlying emotions and I was captivated from start to finish. I have certainly seen other movies with this basic plot but this movie stood out because the performances were deep and poignant. I like many Hollywood movies but this was noticeably different: At once simpler -- with less \"action\" and less dialogue and less \"spelling everything out\" and maybe at the same time more complex because of what was portrayed in a look or a silence. Glad I watched this.","user":"KHamblin-1","rank":[15,17]}]
