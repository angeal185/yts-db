I'm usually all for a good B horror, but this one had me nodding off. It was incredibly hard to follow what was going on and who everyone was, and absolutely no emotional connection was enforced with any of them to the point where I was hoping they'd all get killed off. Takes literally 40 minutes for anything mildly exciting to happen, and calling it mildly exciting is being generous. Lighting was either too much or too little, nothing inbetween, making zero proper atmosphere for what I was guessing the feeling they were attempting to pull off during different scenes. Character development was nom existent, lines were cardboard and delivered just as dryly. Not worth your time, even if you're bored.","user":"MadMadamMolly","rank":[1,2]},{"title":"Very happy to finally see the movie","rating":6,"date":"16 February 2019","review":"Good story line that kept you guessing.\nSome of the acting was very good.\nThe lighting and makeup could of been better.\nThe camera angles were great.\nThe music and background sound effects were great.\nGreat job Brad and gang.","user":"guido_junior","rank":[3,13]}]
