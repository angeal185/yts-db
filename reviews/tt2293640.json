[{"title":"Vast Potential Fun, But Frustratingly Underplayed","rating":5,"date":"25 June 2015","review":"What an enviable list of voice-over stars. <br><br>What fun characters mouthing multi-language pseudo-meaninged gibberish (as opposed to just gibberish). <br><br>What a great start with a series of interesting minion history snippets (all of them already in the trailer - yes, those are the best bits and nothing else in the rest of the movie comes close).<br><br>What frustration when the gear just gets stuck - and the whole thing numbingly grinds into predictable land with uninteresting plot, an array of boring characters  blah blah  and ends up just another multimillion gibberish animation.<br><br>After the first 10 mins, Minions is plagued by too many unnecessary pointless characters, plain villains, inconsequential dialogue and actions  and the boredom (and depression) that the Minions experience on screen is unfortunately also paralleled at the same time by the audience and never really lifted up after that.<br><br>Surprisingly, Allison Janney's character and voice was the most distinctive, but it was only a minor role. Sandra Bullock's villain Scarlett Overkill is way underdone, and the character visualization lacks any wickedly engaging factor, just boringly unlikeable. Jon Hamm's character adds nothing at all to the flimsy plot and his voice is too generic to matter as to who is doing it. All the other stars had inconsequential and indistinctive who-cares voice-overs.<br><br>The whole thing is so bland that the leery voice of Young Gru (Steve Carrell) right at movie's end was such a welcomed relief - at last (and alas it was the end) a little promise of inventive fun  but way too late.<br><br>Watch it, but don't expect too much and you'd probably be mildly entertained.","user":"ken558","rank":[62,98]},{"title":"Below par money spinner","rating":4,"date":"27 June 2015","review":"I don't usually write reviews but this was such a disappointment that I felt I had to put something. Most of the good jokes were shown in the trailers, so if you've seen the trailer then it's probably not worth the money. There were 3 of us watched this and although we all loved the despicable movies none of us enjoyed this. My son (11) said it felt like it was 2 hours long it was so boring. I can't really explain why it came across as so poor - but it just seemed really lazy and without Gru to play against the Minnions were just to simple. It was slapstick with no soul. The music although quite good didn't really seem to fit the film - just seemed to be tacked on at bit were they felt they should have a soundtrack and a famous song. Buy yourself a copy of despicable me and watch it again and again. Much better value for money! This just felt rushed, with loads of stock jokes, maybe hoping enough of them would hit the mark - they didn't.","user":"flint1961","rank":[177,300]},{"title":"propaganda wins","rating":1,"date":"11 August 2015","review":"with all the sponsorship of all kinds of commercial products and exhibitions and promotions this rubbish has become a must-see and nobody dares to say a bad word against it because you are not sure people dare to agree with you while in fact almost everybody falls asleep in the theater. you could only keep quiet during and after seeing the movie. the story is not suitable for children. the plot is so weak it can hardly called a comedy. the characters are a bunch of scrambles. a total disappointment. the only thing i could do is to sigh. in this generation we are living in a pool of propaganda. popularity rules.","user":"chengkinkwan","rank":[43,75]}]
