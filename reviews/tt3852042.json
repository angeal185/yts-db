[{"title":"Could have been inspirational","rating":2,"date":"8 March 2020","review":"Thematically, it's a warm, inspirational story. However, the poorly written script and mediocre acting drag the story down. Fellow Christians, please stop raving about everything that is created by another Christian or that has Christian themes.","user":"sgierling","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Embarrassing","rating":1,"date":"3 March 2020","review":"As a fellow Christian, I can't stand seeing movies like this come out. In real life, we can't rely on angels to come out if the sky and fix our problems. We deserve better representation than a poor plot with uncomfortable conflicts and a literal angel to come out if nowhere and break the whole story. Bad things happen, and it does poor when it rains, which is why people, especially faithful people, need a story that represents the reality of Christian faith. Out of love, I cannot give this movie a good review. I can only say we deserve better. If you want to give us hope, don't give us an angel. Give us hope.","user":"dillonaforte","rank":[16,26]},{"title":"Ouch","rating":1,"date":"3 March 2020","review":"I understand the concept of making a family movie that has good message but this is borderline torture.<br><br>It's the Green Mile meets this flick without the happy ending. If you need to waste a couple hours of your life because of self hatred or you need a good punishment for your kids this movie has it all.<br><br>You will absolutely be praying by the end of this movie but it will be to make it stop. These movies are the reason the church can not reach the younger audience.","user":"kobemoss-67188","rank":[9,16]}]
