Wonderfully shot, passionately edited and genuinely expressed. Say what you will about their sanity - a wonderful depiction of a truly human journey.","user":"rogerradd","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Beutiful photography, confusing timeline.","rating":6,"date":"29 December 2018","review":"If for nothing else it is worth watching for the scenes. But as an icelander it is also rather difficullt since they are talking about a trip to the westfjords while showing clips from other parts of the country at the same time. The narrator seems to ignore this and talks about stopping for a wave thats hundreds of miles to the east of their route.","user":"bjarkih1977","rank":[3,3]}]
