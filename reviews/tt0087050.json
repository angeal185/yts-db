[{"title":"Sarah Connor - Vs - Satan","rating":9,"date":"1 January 2005","review":"Certainly one of the better adaptations of a Stephen King tale, Children Of The Corn, for me, was a goosebump film. But all the more chilling was an unseen, Evil Force who a group of murderous children happily calls \"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\" (Rows, meaning rows of corn in a corn-field) The image you get of this \"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\" character is simply Satan with a new nick-name. And why old Lucifer has chosen to possess a billion ears of corn in Nebraska {instead of the John Deere tractor sitting alongside of it} is beyond me. Whatever the reason, the fact that he's somewhere within that cornfield gave me the chills throughout this film. More chills than watching these children go on a killing rampage throughout the small town. Anyone over the age of 17 was quickly laid to rest at the beginning of the film, and any kid about to turn 18 happily sacrificed themselves to \"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\".<br><br>The film stars Peter Horton and Linda (Terminator 1 and 2's) Hamilton. By accident, they enter this small town and become the towns only two grown-ups. Once spotted, they are quickly labeled \"Outlanders\" and are pursued throughout the remainder of the film until they are finally caught, bound and prepared for sacrifice.<br><br>I love this film. Its had a special place in my heart for years. There is not a boring moment in this film that would put you to sleep. There are many jolts, winces and frights. And even though the \"He Who Walks Behind The Rows\" fella never shows his face, you will definitely feel it's presence. Trust me. Just knowing that he's somewhere in the midst of that cornfield will be enough to creep you out.<br><br>I give this gem a 9/10","user":"bigbenjr48","rank":[60,76]},{"title":"\"Outlander!\"","rating":9,"date":"9 November 2001","review":"Children of the Corn is a classic example of a movie that was much more frightening when I was a kid. Now I suppose it pales in comparison to the better horror flicks I've seen. It's still not a bad genre flick and I recommend seeing it. Children of the Corn has its moments. Isaac and Malachai are still creepy looking cats (both played effectively by John Franklin and Courtney Gains). The musical score with the children chanting is an eerie effect too. The caf√© scene and the accidental hit and run are the standouts of the movie, it's pretty grisly stuff. The rest is a bit mediocre. Peter Horton and Linda Hamilton are pretty good as the young couple trying to escape the murderous children. And an appearance by R.G. Armstrong is never a bad thing. The movie is a \"loose\" adaption of a Stephen King short story, but the sequels are just absolutely King rapes. So do not bother with those.","user":"Backlash007","rank":[44,57]},{"title":"Pretty atmospheric.","rating":9,"date":"29 December 2001","review":"After reading some negative comments on this film it seems to me that many of those reviewers hate horror movies.If you don't like horror,then leave this genre alone!!!Go back and watch some Hollywood big-budget trash!!\"Children of the Corn\" is an enjoyable horror film with a few creepy scenes and some good shocks.The acting is decent enough,and the atmosphere of an isolated town(Gatlin)is well-captured.I've seen the first four parts of this series and they are not really bad(want some crap-check out \"Witchcraft\" series)Enough said-try this one if you enjoy watching horror movies.Very atmospheric score too!","user":"HumanoidOfFlesh","rank":[85,134]}]
