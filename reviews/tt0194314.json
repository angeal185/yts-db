[{"title":"Not a Harlequin style romance.","rating":7,"date":"23 August 2004","review":"Before I comment on this film two introductory remarks are necessary. (1) I recommend anyone who is aware of the way in which it was panned by the critics (\"puerile self conscious euro-trash\", etc) to forget these reviews. I believe it is an unusually rewarding work to see. (2) The title is very misleading, just reading it one cannot be aware of the irony with which it must have been chosen, and anyone expecting to see the film equivalent of a Harlequin novel needs to be warned in advance.<br><br>\tThe story is of a young women who loves her very unresponsive husband, but finds the dissatisfaction she feels from her rare and unfulfilling copulation with him drives her into a series of increasingly destructive extra-marital relationships. These are very graphically portrayed, although she struggles to keep her marriage intact. To me this is perhaps the most unsatisfying aspect of the film - today I would have expected that such a marriage would have broken up very quickly and the woman involved would have felt free to look for a more fulfilling relationship. However many films and novels are based on the theme of women who accept either indifference or a great deal of both physical and mental abuse from partners that they love, and I must accept that this is an important theme for a film.   <br><br> \tAlthough the story is far from new, it is handled here with unusual sensitivity and understanding. Some of the sex scenes would normally only be seen in a hardcore porn film and this appears to be what has upset most of the critics, but I cannot go along with this as a valid criticism. Why should films exploiting torture, death and destruction be accepted as mainstream, whilst those dealing with the personal relationships so vital to living a fulfilling life become subject to censorship?  However it is important to warn anyone considering viewing this film that although it contains a great deal of graphic sexual activity it is never erotic.These scenes (even those between the young woman and her husband with whom she is certainly in love) uniformly show cold mechanical and meaningless relationships which are ultimately self destructive. They concentrate on the emotions of the woman concerned and, since she is largely passive in most of them, and can often only convey the story through her facial expressions, such scenes require both a very fine actress and a very sensitive director in order to succeed. In my opinion this film provides both. It could probably only have been directed by a woman, and one can sense the determination of both the director and the lead actress to draw viewers of both sex into the story so that they are not merely voyeurs, but are forced to consider its relevance both to their own lives and to those of their friends.    <br><br>\tUltimately the ending of a film of this type can make or mar it. Both a happy and a totally tragic ending for what is intended to be a look at the lives of quiet desperation lived by many women would be inappropriate. Instead the director has taken our understanding of her main character further forward by showing us that for many such women their ultimate satisfaction comes from their children rather than from their life partner.<br><br>\tIt is a mark of a successful film when graphic images from it keep coming back to mind long afterwards, particularly when these images force one to consider whether there are lessons in it applicable to ones own life. I believe this would be the experience of most of those who see this film Although I would NOT recommended it as either a skin flick or an erotic film for a couple to watch together in the bedroom, I have no hesitation in recommending it strongly to all those who adequately appreciate what they can expect from it.","user":"bbhlthph","rank":[92,105]},{"title":"at best a few curious intellectualized moments and some (appropriately) uncomfortable real sex. the rest...","rating":5,"date":"28 August 2009","review":"Someone hit the proverbial nail-on-the-head with Romance. A critic wrote that it's like a \"bad update of an Antonioni film\", and I think that's about as fair a description as one could ask for. It may also depend on how you feel already about Antonioni and his depiction of the precise lack of love or responsiveness of emotional contact in people - or, perhaps, if you've even actually seen an Antonioni movie. While Catherine Breillat probably (and, I would admit, rightfully) considers herself a thoughtful, passionate filmmaker interested in passionless people and in trying to pick apart the thoughts (or anti-thoughts) of a character like Marie, I have to ask after a while, in a film that doesn't have Antonioni-stature direction or compositions: what's the point? We have seen women like this in other movies, in loveless relationships or going out to spread or fulfill their empty wishes or such with others. Such as, yeah, Antonioni, but others too.<br><br>It's frustrating to watch, to say the least, but I wasn't ready at first to hold that against the movie. I wanted to see what it had to say, to see how Breillat would show people just having realistic sex, explicit in depiction (naturally, and believe you me its real sex) and talking like couples (or not-couples) do in such situations. I tried to stick with Marie's self-analyzing, her self-aggrandizing thoughts expressed in the first-person narration. In an odd way Caroline Ducey gives a good performance, or better than I remember at the time watching it, since she is good enough to not really need the narration to fill in the audience. Her face, her lack of expression, her inverted and bored and, perhaps, deep down f***ing scared self, show enough. The telling becomes overkill, even from a psychological stand-point.<br><br>Some may not agree with this, and that's fine. Some may watch Romance and just love that it shows real people having problems and having such problems during real sex. For the first half I could stick with the movie even as it had its pretensions because I wanted to see where it headed with Marie's infidelity (with the unnecessary lie about being married). It's when the other guy at the school Marie teaches at, and takes her in and turns things up on the sado-masochist meter that I started to waver on it... and, odder still, got bored. It didn't interest me seeing how perverted this guy could get, or how accepting Marie was of it or how it was shot or scored or edited. I admired that it attempted at depicting such a torrid sexual situation so seriously, but it ultimately just didn't do it for me - not on the kind of level the old-school hardcore-serious-erotic films did (i.e. Last Tango in Paris).<br><br>Romance is intelligent, and it does have something to say about women and loveless relationships. But was I moved by any of it or intellectually engaged after a certain point? No. It's a movie in a limbo where it wants to have something important to convey through art no matter what the cost, but the points aren't as interesting as its filmmaker thinks or terribly original. And if you just want to watch it for the sex, you're in for a not-too-good surprise. 5.5/10","user":"Quinoa1984","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Romancing Marie","rating":7,"date":"2 May 2006","review":"Marie and Paul, who are lovers, are a mismatched pair. The fact that Marie's sexual expectations are not fulfilled by the elusive Paul, can be traced to the fact that he is a model, who might be bisexual and who might care for Marie, or just be repulsed by her directness. The sad fact is that Marie feels abandoned by the same man she loves.<br><br>The first clue of the way Marie and Paul are incompatible can be observed at the photographic shoot sequence at the beginning of the film. Paul is being made up in front of our eyes. He seems to be a narcissistic man in love with his looks. The way he poses for the camera gives us an indication where his mind is and when Marie tries to get his attention in bed, his attitude shows us a man who is not interested in having sex.<br><br>Marie goes into a life of adventure finding sexual relief in the furtive meetings she is seen engaging in with men that only want to satisfy themselves. It's only Robert who captures what Marie is all about. As they begin a series of kinky encounters, Paul appears not to even suspect what Marie is doing. His proposal of marriage comes quite unexpectedly even though they have been living together for a while.<br><br>Marriage brings a change in the way Marie looks at sex, but finds ways to make her visits to the doctor play tricks in her imagination as she is examined by a group of assistants. When labor begins, it's Robert who she contacts because Marie realizes he is in the same wave length and Paul, who never wakes up from his drunken stupor, never knows what hits him.<br><br>Catherine Breillat shows she has no fear in the way she presents her films. She is frank about the way she perceives Marie's situation. Ms. Breillat film, like with \"A Real Young Girl\", bears it all for her viewers. There is nothing left to the imagination, yet, her feminist sensibility is not to be discarded as it makes one thinks about this young woman and all what's going on in her mind.<br><br>Caroline Duceny plays Marie with conviction. Sagamore Stevisin is seen as Paul and Francois Berland plays Robert. They all respond well to Ms. Breillat's commands.<br><br>Obviously, this is not a film for everyone that doesn't want to see it with an open mind. Most of the subtle comments will be lost by the viewer that approaches this film as an erotic, even a pornographic attempt to mix sex for shock value.","user":"jotix100","rank":[25,31]}]
