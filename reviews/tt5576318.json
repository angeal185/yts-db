[{"title":"What a mess with this Hitchcock stuff...","rating":1,"date":"5 September 2017","review":"I actually expected to see a well made thriller like Hitchcock but there is no Cock Tobin in this film at all. <br><br>The title misguides audiences who anticipated Cock Robin in this film...<br><br>And the story is split around in the casts members. It is hard to keep track of the story if there is a story at all. <br><br>I hope standardised story structure is needed for this local blockbuster. <br><br>1 out of 10.","user":"thomaspans","rank":[75,104]},{"title":"The carefully crafted scripts","rating":8,"date":"27 June 2019","review":"The carefully crafted scripts show the tension and appeal that far exceed imagination.<br><br>The most lacking of domestic films is this. The domestic film is just a few pieces of fresh meat thrown into the pot, with some licking pee, and began to cheat money.<br><br>The whole film is really not a turning point, and the veins are inherited but the blocks are distinct. You have me and me in you.<br><br>To make a metaphor, like taking a sightseeing train, passing through different scenic spots such as mountains, grasslands, forests, etc., but the forest is far from the mountains, the mountains are undulating and visible, and the end of the grassland is a forest. This is the feeling.<br><br>At the beginning of the film, I gave a skeleton to one of the core car accident cases, and then affixed the flesh and blood through the lies of different characters. In the middle of the process, I found that this person still holds another person, and the other person is the first one. The fur was given to the flesh and finally ended on the last page with a ghost story of 15 dollars. What appears in the eyes of the audience are two completely different people, one called the case and the other called the humanity.<br><br>The film's reflection on human nature is so simple but deep into the soul. Every one of us is constantly burying the mud of our own lies. In the end, everyone is completely unrecognizable. It is in the old saying that the surface of the dung egg is actually Everyone's bones are soaked in black by the mud.<br><br>Think again, the most confusing in the film, all become successful people, which is consistent with reality.<br><br>At the same time, the performance of each major character in the plot is a three-pointer, or easy, or nervous, or crazy, but every performance will make people feel that this role, at this time, this should be the case.<br><br>If you say the shortcomings, there are also one or two slight flaws. Such as: Aji did not give a clear explanation. These are all minute and innocuous.","user":"yoggwork","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"Nice Try.","rating":6,"date":"24 January 2020","review":"The director gets mega points for moving the story around so it'll keep you on your toes and confused with it's never-ending twists. Unfortunately, in the ends, it simply adds up to a well-photographed and somewhat gory story with an in implausible narrative thread weaved throughout. I'd recommend this film if it wasn't so indulgent and proud of its twists. In the end, though, it leaves a lot to be desired. See it if you're a fan of Asian crime drama; skip if you're also into a good story well done.","user":"redrobin62-321-207311","rank":[0,0]}]
