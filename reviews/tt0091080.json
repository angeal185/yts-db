[{"title":"The resurrection of Jason is the best \"Friday the 13th\" - supernatural slaher 80's horror film with action my personal favorite","rating":10,"date":"26 August 2019","review":"Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives is my personal favorite horror slasher film of all time. The ressurection of Jason on a graveyard is a bad-ass smart idea in the film. Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews) stabs Jason (C. J. Graham) with a steel and a lightning storm resurrect Jason from the dead is a smart idea and the best scene I have ever seen. Writen and dircted by a bad-ass director Tom McLoughlin who was the best choice for this movie. The director made a Jason unstoppable supernatural force ever in the franchise. Starring Thom Mathews as Tommy Jarvis the hero in this movie he is a bad-ass action hero I have ever seen.<br><br>Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives and Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood are my two favorite horror slasher films. This is my top number 1 favorite film in the franchise The New Blood is my second favorite slasher film. This film has action, great death kills, gore, love the graveyard scenes, I love the cast. I love, love, love this movie to death!<br><br>I love Jennifer Cooke as Megan she is one hot sexy babe but Tina Shepard (Kar Park-Lincoln) is my favorite final girl. I love Megan to death she is one hot sexy babe. I love Paula (Kerry Noonan) she was the heart of those kids counselors. I love Cort (Tom Fridley) he looks like young Johnny Depp in A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) my personal favorite slasher film of all time. I am A Nightmare On Elm Street fan that is why I name my username like that. I love David Kagen as Sheriff Garris he was a bad-ass a cop who has to do his job by protecting kids and his daughter I love him.<br><br>Thom Mathews is the only Tommy Jarvis for me not Corey Feldman or that actor from Part V. Alice Cooper made songs for this film: He's Back (The Man Behind The Mask) which is a bad-ass song, Teenage Frankenstein and Hard Rock Summer which is hard to get this song. I love Animal by Fellon which it is a bad-ass song.<br><br>This movie is fast paced, the pacing is fast, death kills the gore are excellent but I still prefer The New Blood death kills better than Jason Lives. My favorite scene is when Jason slashes with machette paintball players three at once. I love when Jason stabs with a knife Cort in the head and the van flips ovrer and explodes it has an excellent explosion but New Blood has better explosion than this film. Jason Voorhees played by C. J. Graham was believebl enough and scary. C. J. Graham was a trained marine and he obey orders and everything that director said.<br><br>The Finale is a bad-ass scene on the boat Tommy Jarvis set a trap for Jason and chains him, while he burns the lake on a fire bad-ass scene. This movie is a creative the film has kids in it for the first time, which is more interesting. They don't make movies like this anymore. Excellent horror film from the 80's Jason Lives is tied with The New Blood I love both of the films to detah and so damn much. Recommened this film to any horror fan and Thom Mathews was really decent love this actor so damn much.","user":"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Best of the best of the best my all time number 1 favorite Jason Friday the 13th film","rating":10,"date":"24 September 2017","review":"Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives is my all time number 1 favorite film of the franchise. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This movie is the bomb this movie is the best horror slasher 80's movie in my opinion. They don't make movies like this anymore. I really wish that Hollywood would make movies like this one today. This movie has everything I just love to death from the setting, from the music from the actors just everything it has in here.<br><br>Tommy Jarvis goes to the graveyard to get rid of Jason Voorhees' body once and for all, but inadvertently brings him back to life instead. The newly revived killer once again seeks revenge, and Tommy may be the only one who can defeat him.<br><br>Thom Mathews is the best Tommy Jarvis in my opinion I love this actor so damn much he is so underrated. Tom McLoughlin resurrected Jason Voorhees and he made so damn good job the best film he directed and writing it. I just love it so damn much. Jennifer Cooke was great as Megan Garris and she was likable I love her so damn much in this movie. I love David Kagen as Sheriff Garris he grow on me he gave 100% of him. I love Kerry Noonan as Paula she had the most heart in this movie. I love Tom Fridley as Cort seriously he looks like young Johnny Depp in this movie. Whole cast is serious and does excellent job I love everyone in this movie. I love Bob Larkin as Martin on the graveyard I love his lines \"Some folks sure got a strange idea of entertainment.\" I love the actor so damn much in this movie. <br><br>I love the graveyard the scene that was filmed in this film I love C. J. Graham as Jason Voorhees he is excellent as Jason I love him so damn much on the screen. He gave 100% of him, oh he didn't? Yes he did! It was so joy able to watch this movie in Thursday that I was jumping from excitement so much I love this movie.<br><br>I love the songs from Alice Cooper who performed the songs for this movie I wish Alice Cooper would have been extra in this movie. He was extra in John Carpenter's Prince of Darkness which he produced and sung the song Prince of Darkness. I love soundtracks from this movie: He's Back (The Man Behind The Mask) the best song ever. I have heard the song many times. Teenage Frankenstein and Hard Rock Summer are the best soundtracks from Alice Cooper. The Song Animal is the best song from the movie I am listening I loved it. I have so fun with this movie the best of the best.<br><br>I love the kills, \"even if it has humor on it\" what humor? I haven't seen any humor in the movie but I saw a great slasher film that's what I saw. Martin Becker made special effects and he was great I love practical effects in this movie I love good kills.<br><br>This movie has Jason walking around like a Terminator from the first film we even have a Deputy Colone (Vincent Guastaferro) aiming with Dan Wesson Model 15-VH with a big laser sight on Tommy in which Megan use the gun either. It see similarity with these movie and with The Terminator from the 80's. The resurrection scene for Jason is excellent made given these movies I can go with it. I love the James Bond homage in the opening credits. This movie felt a little bit more like a movie from the Halloween franchise with Tommy and company going after Jason and that is probably why I loved it.<br><br>I love the final climax showdown between Tommy and Jason on the lake set on fire in the climactic scene in the boat. Tommy is attacked in a boat in the middle of the lake and ties a boulder around Jason's neck to trap him. Jason fights back, holding Tommy underwater long enough to drown him. I love the sacrifice scene from Tommy that he sacrificed him self and he chained Jason in the lake which he belong. Tommy is a bad-ass in this movie is my action hero.<br><br>I love this movie to death I love everything about this movie it is my number 1 favorite Jason film. This movie also has action I forgot to mentioned but it has ton's of action it is great entertaining action horror film.<br><br>This movie get's my favorite Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 the best Friday the 13th slasher movie ever I love it to death. They aren't movies like this one today we don't have them anymore.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[89,126]},{"title":"Jason really LIVES...","rating":10,"date":"19 December 1999","review":"With the exception of part 9, ALL of the \"Jason\" movies just keep getting better!  In my honest opinion, this sequel comes in third as far as Jason \"sequels\" go (ps:part 1 will always rule) and this sequel comes in right after parts 2 and 4.  Part 1 is simply a classic.<br><br>Director/Writer Tom McLoughlin has literally recreated Jason after the turn of events in part 5, replacing the character's once-human figure from parts 2-4 with a better, more menacing, grosser, unkillable, zombie-like figure. In this installment, it seems that Jason has stopped chasing his victims and has become a little more quiet and subtle about his \"kills\".<br><br>Most of all, McLoughlin really makes \"Jason Live\" in this movie.  Jason thrives!!  McLoughlin, in my opinion, has directed what is probably the most \"scary\" Jason of them all.  I've seen them all a hundred times, and I still jump when he appears in the window in front of Sissy.  The acting is extremely acceptable from its predecessors, especially the roles of Tommy Jarvis (Thom Matthews) and Sheriff Garris (David Kagen).  Even the camp counselors liven up their roles a bit.  Though it was inevitable for them to be slaughtered, I still thought that it was cool that I still remember their characters.  There is just something about this one.  Jason Lives has an excellent story line that delivers, however, the gore is relatively low at certain times, but McLoughlin never fails to bring it all back with shots of that very very bloody machete of Jason's.<br><br>This sequel contains many of my favorite death scenes so far in the series. What McLoughlin did in this movie that previous directors didn't was he actually made Jason unpredictable.  I mean, you KNOW he's gonna kill the counselors, but you don't know when or where. I absolutely LOVE that feeling of uncertainty.  McLoughlin has Jason lurking out of windows, behind doors, and the scariest part is when Jason is unknowingly in the motor home as the teenagers pull away from camp.  There is also a lot of the usual CH CH CH HA HA HA and deep black darkness to enhance Jason's (CJ Graham's) menacing figure.<br><br>For once I didn't want any of the characters to get killed.  I enjoyed all of their roles.  I especially didn't want Paula (Kerry Noonan) to die, and her responsible, soft-spoken, motherly role had me rooting for her to be the lone survivor.  That was a first for me...except for Chrissy in part III I never really cared much for the campers.  However, my hopes were mutilated in the cabin when Paula dies probably Jason's most notorious kill to date. My God, that cabin is bloody!<br><br>Overall, I recommend this installment to any hardcore Jason fan.  It is a real horror movie, this time it's for real.  Rent it, buy it, do whatever! It's great!   Jason Lives...he breathes...he can never die","user":"tyhemp-2","rank":[62,88]}]
