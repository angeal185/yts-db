[{"title":"One of the most bizarre films out there","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2002","review":"Like everyone that has reviewed this film before me, I am going to sing it's praises, however, unlike those before me, I'm not quite sure why.  This film did everything it was supposed to do as a horror film.  It scared me in a few areas, it was quite gory in others and it was easily one of the ten most quirky and bizarre films I have ever seen.  I can't tell you why anything transpires the way it does in here, I can't even tell you why people do the things they do, but I don't really think that is the point of the film. Like David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, this is more of mind altering experience or a dream that just doesn't make any sense.  Perhaps this is a film that is esoteric by design and if that is the case then perhaps I should just watch it over and over again until I do have some sort of puerile grasp of it. <br><br>Dictionary.com's definition of a phantasm is \"in Platonic philosophy, objective reality as observed by the five senses.\"  Another definiton it gives is simply, \"a notion\".  And if you watch this film from beginning to end you will see why this makes all the sense in the world, yet it is still an abstruse concept that is meant to be exactly what it is.<br><br>The film begins with a funeral of one of Jody (Bill Thornbury) and Reggie's (Reggie Bannister) best friends.  Jody's little brother, Mikey ( A Michael Baldwin) is a precocious kid who can't seem to stay in one place and follows his big brother everywhere he goes.  Hence he is at the funeral but is surreptitiously hiding out in the bushes.  As the funeral ends, he sees the caretaker lift a casket all by himself and put it into his truck.  This is the nascency of the bizaare rituals that encompass the film. <br><br>\nMichael decides to investigate the strange looking mansion where the cemetery rests.  Once he breaks into the house, he is chased by some strange Jawa looking creatures and by a sphere that seems to come out of nowhere and drains your head of blood.  He does escape and finally gets his big brother to believe him when he says that things aren't quite right up at the Morningside Cemetery.  Now, up until this point, the film is quite linear. You have your classic set-up, a spooky looking mansion where the dead are taken and your typical stupid characters that do the traditional scary movie things, like going to investigate a haunted house all by yourself, gratuitous breast shots, some eerie music and dark nights.  But that is where the title \"typical horror film\" ends and it crosses over into Rod Serling territory.  From here on out, it just goes weird, but in a goosebump inducing way that keeps you frozen in your seat.<br><br>Don Coscarelli can take all of the praise and/or blame for this eccentric film.  He wrote, produced, directed, was the DP, the editor and as another reviewer so aptly pointed out, he probably swept the floors at night and fetched coffee for those on the set.  This is his incarnation.  I also happen to agree with other viewers that say that this film has one of the most haunting yet mellifluous scores which is on par with Carpenter's Halloween theme.  Both are intricate pieces to the presence of the film. Words like haunting, eerie, creepy and forbidding all come to mind when you hear the score.  It is also uncanny to see some of the similarities to A Nightmare On Elm Street and Phantasm.  Nightmare was a little more clear with what it was trying to say but both films have an overtly murky and dream like exploration into realms that many of us have yet to understand.<br><br>The underlying theme in this film is the unsolved questions that plague many of us when we wonder what happens when you die.  Most of us believe that you go to Heaven or Hell.  But those are just theories.  And if theories are unproven then what is stop you from believing that this movie could really be the answer to those questions?  As the tag line for the film so poignantly points out, \"If this one doesn't scare you, you're already dead.\" What if all of this was true?  What if you could be stolen and made into something that you did not ask to become?  Who is the Tall Man and what is he doing here in our world?  One of the most harrowing yet well done plot pieces is when Mikey goes to the girl's house and finds an old picture of the Tall Man sitting on a horse carriage, looking like it is circa 1776. This leaves the viewer ripe with questions.<br><br>Phantasm will leave you with more questions than answers but I will say this about the film.  In a day and age where you get prosaic, banal and myopic efforts like ( take your pick of most of the horror that has \"graced\" our screens since the Scream and Blair Witch craze) and you compare them to films like Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Phantasm, you quickly realize that the 70's and early 80's was the genesis of the horror film.  I realize horror probably dates back to Nosferatu and it became respected with Psycho, but to look at the films that were born in the 70's and 80's, it's a veritable, indefeasible list of some of the most revered and imitated horror films of all time.  Now that I have seen Phantasm I can easily see the mark it has left on other films.<br><br>9 out of 10----As I said, I still can't tell you what this film is all about nor can I tell you what it all means or how it all ends, all I can say is that it made me feel something strange with it's disingenuous stroke of the brush.  This is a film that absolutely demands a second and third viewing....which is what I am about to do right now.  BOY!!!!!!!","user":"baumer","rank":[101,121]},{"title":"Phantasm - feel the love","rating":19,"date":"19 August 2003","review":"Phantasm is possibly my favourite film of all time.Why? It's not about the budget or the hype of a film, but mainly about how this film makes me feel. Phantasm director Coscarelli crafted a little gem of a horror movie that has bought me more enjoyment than any major Hollywood film I can remember. I first saw Phantasm as a kid in the 80's and it has stuck with me ever since. It was great to rediscover this film on a beautifully mastered DVD.<br><br>\nFor me, Phantasm combines a nightmarish quality that few horror movies achieve with a nostalgic trip back in time to the late 70's. The central theme is that of young Mike being abandoned by his brother Jody, and overcoming his fears. The cryptic nature of the Tall Man's presence adds to the tension, and Myrow's eerie soundtrack is the perfect finishing touch.<br><br>Like a nightmare, there is no explanation or attempt to pander to desires for a logical conclusion.  The little touches such as Jody and Reggie's jam session add to the homely feel of this movie - it's like a well worn pair of jeans. It's crystal clear that no studio executives were in the editing room at the last minute, trying to turn Coscarelli's vision into another mediocre horror film . For the director, this film was clearly a labor of love. Coscarelli is still an outsider from the Hollywood system. I am grateful that he hasn't been sucked into turning out mediocre movies for major studios but has stayed somewhat true to the original spirit of Phantasm.<br><br>Many of the comments here on IMDB criticize the film for weak FX and poor acting. When viewed in the context of a genre film made by young industry outsiders for $300,000 in 1979, I think the technical values are exceptional. Critics who claim otherwise have no idea of the work involved in the process of creating a movie, especially before the advent of video.<br><br>I've seen Hollywood blockbusters made for many millions of dollars with great technical values, and yet I can't think of one that I can enjoy time and time again like this film. If you consider yourself a fan of horror movies, you owe it to yourself to own this classic on DVD.<br><br>10/10","user":"auteurus","rank":[81,97]},{"title":"Imaginative, Bizarre, And Thoroughly Entertaining.","rating":10,"date":"15 July 2006","review":"\"Phantasm\" is about a young teenager, Mike, who just recently lost his parents. He is worried about losing his older brother, so he follows him everywhere, including a funeral. While hiding in the bushes during the funeral, Mike sees \"The Tall Man\" (played by the creepy Angus Scrimm), the man who runs the funeral home, pick up a casket by himself. Mike begins spying on the man afterwards, fascinated with uncovering the strange events surrounding the funeral home. While investigating, Mike discovers a strange world within the walls of the mortuary, including flying metal spheres with sharp arrows that drain the blood from your head, and many other horrors. Turns out, the Tall Man is from another dimension, and is taking the bodies of the dead and reincarnating them in his world for slaves. Mike teams up with his older brother and the local ice cream man, Reggie, to stop the Tall Man's gruesome work.<br><br>I remember my mother telling me about how much \"Phantasm\" scared her when she was a teenager, and she rented it one day and I watched it along with her (I was about nine or ten at the time), and it was genuinely one of the most bizarre movies I've ever viewed. Written (as well as directed) by Don Coscarelli, \"Phantasm\" has become something of a horror classic over the years, and deservedly so. Coscarelli's writing here is so unique that it hurts. Everything in this film is surreal and dreamlike, and the entire plot line is so out there that I can't think of another film that can quite compete in terms of strangeness. But, despite it's strangeness, this movie works, in it's own, weird little way. The script is solid and the characters are believable (there are some real-life situations thrown in as well, so there is some sort of viewer-character connections that can be made), even though about ninety-nine percent of this film is something of pure fantasy. But it's quite a scary fantasy, and that's for sure.<br><br>There are many elements in this film that have become somewhat legendary, among them being the murderous silver spheres and The Tall Man's \"Boyyyyy!\" line. The thing is, among all of the randomness that is \"Phantasm\", this is quite a terrifying movie. A dense feeling of helplessness and foreboding is hiding in every scene, and the cinematography and locations add to this quite a bit. The imagery is bizarre and often very spooky, and the settings are perfect (especially that creepy old funeral home). The viewers themselves are easily caught up in the engrossing story, and the atmosphere is very scary. Michael Baldwin plays our lead hero well, with Reggie Bannister as the ice cream man, and Bill Thornbury as Mike's older brother, Jody. And Angus Scrimm plays his signature role as The Tall Man, and his presence alone makes this film scarier than most of it's genre. And then there's the score to the film, which is equally as effective and just as chilling. The film concludes leaving many questions open-ended and unanswered, but honestly - can you really expect genuine, fulfilling answers when the movie itself is so strange? I think it's good that this film does leave some loose ends, because it goes along with the movie's overall feel.<br><br>Bottom line - I don't think this movie is for everyone, and it might be just a little bit too weird for some. Honestly, one of the strangest, most out-there films I have ever seen, but in my opinion, that's a good thing. The story is strange but well crafted, and the bizarre imagery and atmosphere make this a painfully unique, scary experience. I can see why \"Phantasm\" has become such a classic of the genre. For me, this film remains a nice little piece of spooky and original nostalgia, and I'm glad my mom decided to scare the daylights out of me with it at such a young age, because I grew to love this movie later on. 10/10.","user":"drownnnsoda","rank":[52,69]}]
