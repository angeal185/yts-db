[{"title":"If you want to see tornadoes, go on the internet. Stay away from this disaster at all costs.","rating":2,"date":"20 April 2015","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm fascinated by tornadoes - I've seen Twister 100+ times as a kid and it still holds up today. Why? Because it has relatable characters, great pacing, and a looming sense of danger that's always around the corner. I was hoping Into the Storm would be a modern day Twister but better - with technology the way it is, how hard can it be to create a worthwhile disaster film with such a simple premise? Well, Into the Storm makes it look damn near impossible.<br><br>The positives of this movie are as follows: the tornadoes. They look cool. That's it. Tornados on the internet look cool as well. No one should have to sit through an hour and a half of trash to see a few nice storm graphics. The characters in this movie are dreadful. I challenge you to care about a single one - hell, try remembering one of their names after the movie finishes. They're all awfully written, and the acting doesn't help one bit. Richard Armitage was fantastic in The Hobbit movies but holy hell it's hard to believe this is the same person.<br><br>The story (or stories rather) are abysmal. Seriously, why make three separate story lines for characters we don't care about? Are we supposed to care if the dad gets forgiveness from his sons? Are we supposed to care if the kid gets the girl from school? How about whether or not the hillbillies make it big on Youtube? The answer is an overwhelming \"F*ck no\".<br><br>Also, this is a found footage movie. Why? Beats the hell out of me. The gimmick is getting thin in horror movies, let alone a movie like this where they have to constantly make up excuses for these characters to be filming everything. In fact, nothing in this movie is believable. Twister had characters with depth - you believed that these people were storm chasers, and you believed in the tension between Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt's characters. Here, everything is so blown out that the imminent threat of what's happening on-screen doesn't phase the audience at all. We're supposed to believe that a tornado can rip through a concrete building in two seconds but can't suck up someone holding onto a flimsy car door? The movie makers take unbelievability to new levels here. Into the Storm is a collection of disaster scenarios loosely connected by multiple underwritten stories being carried by unlikable characters. The most unbelievable thing about this movie is the fact that I actually made it to the end.<br><br>If you want to see tornadoes, go on the internet.

That's our thing. We watch a lot of different types of movies and we watch movies all the time. So I feel confident in saying I know quite a bit about movies--about what makes a good movie, how to tell a good movie from a bad movie, etc. <br><br>My mom really wanted to see \"Into the Storm\" because she's on kind of a Richard Armitage kick since \"The Hobbit\". We talked about going to the theaters to see it, but I decided to check the IMDb reviews, and they told me it was a terrible movie.<br><br>So we didn't see it. Tonight I was picking up a couple Redbox movies on my way home, and decided to get this one because why not. I wasn't expecting anything, but we were still curious about it.<br><br>So we watched it, and I LITERALLY DON'T GET all the negative reviews!! The main strike against this movie (according to the reviews) was the acting. What?! I thought the acting was really good! I thought the characters were all believable! I was able to understand and emotionally connect to all the characters--there were two scenes that made me cry a bit, and I am NOT a crier. I NEVER cry during movies. The acting and the documentary-style filming actually made me feel like I was ACTUALLY THERE (although this could probably have been even more palpable if I had seen it in theaters...that's what you get for basing a decision on IMDb reviews?), which was very stressful, but made the movie so much more enjoyable.<br><br>I have seen A LOT of bad movies in my time; \"Into the Storm\" doesn't even come close to making that list.","user":"gemma_night","rank":[26,31]},{"title":"A really good bad film","rating":8,"date":"21 August 2014","review":"There are bad movies that are just intolerable to sit through. And then there's \"Into the Storm\".<br><br>Jan de Bont's 1996 \"Twister\" came into cinemas like – and excuse the pun – a blast of fresh air. Whilst \"Into the Storm\" is not exactly a remake (there are no cows present at all for example!), it shares many of the key characteristics that made Twister such a fun popcorn movie: a truly terrible script, some pretty awful acting in places, a predictable plot, and the occasional mind-bogglingly improbable scene, but all redeemed by some slam-dunk fantastic visual effects.<br><br>Firstly, the script. Sneak a shot glass and a flask into the cinema and play the new drinking game: a shot for every time anyone says \"Are you alright?\". You'll be legless before the first hour is up.<br><br>Secondly the acting. This is a cast where the most well-known faces are Richard Armitage (Thorin in the Hobbit films) and Matt Walsh (Mike McLintock in the excellent \"Veep\"). And I don't like to be harsh on a young cast of actors in the early dawn of their careers, but let's say that some of the cast were probably cast more for their looks than their acting talent. I also struggled with Armitage's single dad/school principal character who in certain scenes (particularly one in the front of the stormchaser's van) looks the spitting image of Leslie Nielsen's Dr Rumack from \"Airplane\". I almost expected him to go off into that character at any moment – – \"No, the school won't be safe. And don't call me Shirley\".<br><br>One of the youngsters that I think did make an impact was Nathan Kress in his movie debut as the younger son Trey.<br><br>The predictable plot. No spoilers, but there's a small town and lots of tornadoes: \"bigger than any storm that's ever been\" (since \"Twister\" anyway). The plot, as it is, centres around a failing documentary film crew trying to capture good footage before the tornado season is up: with backer's funding drying up, the pressure is on. Walsh plays the hard-pressed producer/director sparking off the Helen Hunt character Allison, played by the fetching Sarah Wayne Callies, a data-besotted scientist for who, it seems, science only works for when good luck is in her favour. Aside from the film crew, the remainder of the cast are the residents and schoolkids of the backwater Oklahoma town of Silverton, with the usual disaster movie will they/won't they (die) tensions as the tornadoes wreak their havoc. Humour is injected through a couple of rednecks intent on making their fortune through Jackass-style video clips on Youtube.<br><br>The improbable scenes. Again no spoilers, but one of the characters meets an end that is massively improbable, poetic, beautifully shot and ironic. but also snort-worthily funny. And why suddenly does sleepy old Silverton suddenly reveal itself to have a MAJOR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT with dozens of Jumbo jets waiting to be lifted into the skies? Whilst a memorable special effects scene, it makes absolutely no sense at all. It's almost as if the filmmakers got to the end of the film and found a million dollars of contingency funding they hadn't used: \"What can we do with this? Oh, I know!\". Bizarre.<br><br>And those effects! This is no \"Sharknado\"! The special effects are all top notch, including a spectacular scene where a twister gobbles up a petrol station and all of its burning fuel which is a masterclass in CGI. I have no idea where you would even start in developing that.<br><br>The director is James Cameron protégé Steven Quale (2nd unit on \"Avatar\" and \"Titanic\" and director of the passable \"Final Destination V\"). And all in all, I think he does a pretty good job. The film is massively helped by a sensible 90 minute running time, which is all the light plot could really sustain anyway. And it is a good decision to adopt (in part) a \"Cloverfield\" type of video blog format (part documentary footage; part high school 'video time capsule' interviews) that holds the interest well.<br><br>So, in summary, this is a terribly good bad film and well deserving of your summer popcorn money. Just about everyone came out of the cinema with a silly grin on their face. Nuff said.<br><br>(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to follow the blog. Thanks!)","user":"bob-the-movie-man","rank":[163,254]}]
