[{"title":"Possible Alternate Title - When Fathers Leave","rating":5,"date":"21 January 2019","review":"Originally attracted to this movie as I am a James Franco fan, but his role lasted about 20 minutes and then he abruptly disappeared, leaving his family and the viewer twisting in the wind as to why or where he went. For me, I spent most of the duration of the film pondering that question. Good acting by the principal stars but slow moving and a little too full of symbolism for my taste.","user":"cageyk-46578","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Bait & Switch","rating":1,"date":"9 February 2019","review":"There is nothing relating to science fiction in this film. We agonized though a porta-John of teenage angst only to emerge covered in a stinky blue slime of disappointment. Yet another Millenial flop. Hated it!","user":"thesidneyhouse","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"Social realist film on finding life in the middle of nowhere","rating":3,"date":"8 November 2019","review":"This is a dull movie, but is honest about it. Follows the life of some youngsters abandoned by their father. They live in the American desert towns where there is little to do and little life except that which you can make.<br><br>It's low budget and shakey cam, but the real crux is some fine acting by the mostly young crew. Beyond that there's nothing there. So much more can have been said and done. There is hope in everyone and you can take if that happens or not.<br><br>It's a snapshot on certain lives. I just think there was more and better to say.","user":"joebloggscity","rank":[5,5]}]
