[{"title":"Beautiful and humble","rating":10,"date":"8 March 2019","review":"A gorgeous movie, subtle, light and poetic. A delight to see something so refined and wise in our over-thinking modern world. Spiritual, and thankfully not creepily religious like so many potentially lovely movies from USA.","user":"aoifev","rank":[26,28]},{"title":"Gorgeously beautiful mysterious and an excellent cast","rating":10,"date":"1 December 2018","review":"I do not understand the low rating for this movie. It may seem slow at first, but because the acting and action is rather slow - quite peaceful - perhaps it doesn't suit the modern aesthetic.<br><br>However, that being said, it is a simple, beautifully written and acted story based on prayers and angels. But not your usual angels or prayers, a totally real and significant modern take. Perhaps the modern mentality cannot abide such a concept , but for those who can, this movie is a very good experience.","user":"rt-59493","rank":[39,46]},{"title":"Beautiful","rating":10,"date":"8 March 2020","review":"This was an excellent movie- yes the acting seems off and it was a bit slow and odd- but in the end you understand the beauty of it all and everything about the slowness makes sense. We need to slow as humans - we need to see the beauty around and be grateful - this film is something magical, something holy in a sense. Thank you to all the Made it. It touched my soul for good- well done!!! Beautiful","user":"bpow05","rank":[14,15]}]
