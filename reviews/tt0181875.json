[{"title":"One of my favourite movies of all-time","rating":10,"date":"5 February 2005","review":"Finally, a movie worth the full price of a ticket! Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's semi-autobigraphical story of an aspiring rock journalist who goes on tour with a band in the 1970's. If it sounds familiar, it's probably because the story is hardly new. There have been dozens of movies made about the rock and roll lifestyle: the drugs, the sex, the fights, and all the bumps on the road to success.<br><br>So what sets Almost Famous apart? The acting, for one. Frances McDormand was brilliant as William's (newcomer Patrick Fugit) well-meaning but overbearing mother. Fugit, for his part, had a convincing performance as the shy, awkward teenager struggling to be a journalist but at the same time aching to belong. Kate Hudson, in her breakout role as groupie \"Penny Lane\", gave her character depth beyond what might have been a limiting role. And Billy Crudup, as band Stillwater's charismatic lead guitarist, shines. Jason Lee is always good, and as Stillwater's lead singer, this role is no exception. And I can't review this film without giving a shout-out to the chronically and criminally-underrated Philip Seymour Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in with his portrayal of legendary rock journalist Lester Bangs.<br><br>The writing in the film also contributes to its effect. Many of the great lines belong to McDormand but there are plenty of others to go around. In addition, the music of the era can't be beat. Everything from Simon and Garfunkle to Alvin and the Chipmunks shows up at some point in the movie's extensive musical score.<br><br>The plot may not be particularly original, but it rings true. I of course am approaching this review as a music fan and someone interested in the industry. Nonetheless, I believe that even people who couldn't care less about rock music will enjoy this movie, since it's not so much about the music as it is about life. A central theme is the conflict of William: Should he remain a detached but lonely outsider so as to be an impartial journalist, or allow himself to make friends with these people and feel like he belongs? Aside from bringing up questions of journalistic ethics, this dilemma mirrors much of what people in all wakes of life deal with daily.<br><br>Almost Famous is realistic, funny, touching, and one of those rare movies that makes you feel like you've gained something just for having seen it. It's too bad that they say rock and roll is dead, cause we could sure use more movies like this one!","user":"segacs","rank":[277,322]},{"title":"Crowe knows what it is love some little piece of music so much that it hurts","rating":10,"date":"5 October 2000","review":"There's a (by now) well-known scene early on in ALMOST FAMOUS when William Miller is poring through the records his older sister Anita has left behind for him since she ran off from home.  Inside the album cover of The Who's TOMMY, she leaves William a note, telling him to listen to this with a candle lit, and he'll be able to see his future.  He puts on the record, \"Sparks\" comes on, and the look on his face as he listens is the look every rock fan will recognize.<br><br>There's been tons of stuff written about rock-n-roll music, from those who think, like William's mother Elaine, that it's a corrupting influence(or those who go even farther and consider it \"the devil's music\"), to those who insist the music is meaningless and to take it seriously smacks of pretension, because it's \"only music.\"  And then there are people like Cameron Crowe, who recognize rock-n-roll, and the music which came in its wake, is the shared experience of many people starting from the 1950's, in the way maybe that plays and earlier types of music were in centuries before.  Sure, there's television and movies as well, but rock music is shorter and more direct.  And sure, it can just be fun and a way to cut loose once in a while, but it's also something which can speak to what we love, what we long for, what we're afraid of, what we think, what wounds us inside, and so much more.<br><br>Because Crowe is a fan, he's able to capture all of this in his movie.  It's not just in the obvious moments, like the people on the tour bus singing along to Elton John's \"Tiny Dancer,\" which lifts them out of their black mood, or singer Jeff Bebe leading everybody into singing \"On the Cover of Rolling Stone\" when he learns he and his fellow bandmates will be on the cover.  It's in the wild spirit of people like Sapphire, one of the Band-Aids(read: groupies) who follow the band Stillwater and others as they tour the U.S., or in the more tender spirit of someone like her sister Band-Aid Penny Lane, who believes she and the other Band-Aids serve as a muse to bands like Stillwater, and who soaks in all of her experiences like a sponge.  It's also in William, who tries(like Crowe did) to balance reporting with his very obvious love for the music.  And it's especially in the line I quoted from at the top, which Sapphire says to Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond late in the movie.  To be sure, the road of rock-n-roll isn't all covered in roses.  There's outrageous behavior(like how Russell treats Penny, or William losing his virginity to three of the groupies), drugs, excess, and yes, pretension(like when Jeff lectures Penny about the power of rock-n-roll and then adds, \"And the chicks are cool, right?\"  But those who wanted this to be more like THIS IS SPINAL TAP are missing the point.  This isn't a movie about the obvious problems and silliness in rock music.  It's about what still draws people to it, and though Crowe acknowledges these people's faults, he still loves them for who they are.<br><br>Of course, there's a lot more reasons why ALMOST FAMOUS is a great movie besides its love of rock-n-roll.  It's well acted across the board(in addition to all the performances mentioned several times, I'd like to highlight Fairuza Balk as Sapphire; not only does she get the best line in the movie(along with Frances McDormand's \"Don't take drugs!\" and \"Rock stars have kidnapped my son\") with that line about music(I also like what she and the other groupies yell as they're about to deflower William, \"Death to Opie!\"), but she also captures the carefree spirit of the time.  She may not be important plot wise, but if you took her character out, the movie would be missing something), it's a terrific coming-of-age story, it's a bittersweet love story, the dialogue is great, and it looks terrific.  But it's Crowe's obvious love for the music, and for the people who love it, that makes ALMOST FAMOUS the best thing I've seen so far this year.","user":"SKG-2","rank":[194,227]},{"title":"Heart-wrenching, honest, clever; everything I like in a film","rating":10,"date":"27 September 2000","review":"I've seen a few coming-of-age films, and a few prodigy-cum-genius type films, and of course more than my share of romantic comedy stuff.  This film skirts between the lines of all those possibilities and somehow manages to find its way to the viewer intact, deftly and with a whole lot of old-fashioned charisma.<br><br>The acting was honest, true to how people behave without getting schmaltzy or over-dramatic.  Cameron Crowe gets these actors to all project a belief in themselves and bring that across in a way that we care about what happens to them.  I particularly liked the rendition of William Miller by Patrick Fugit, who steals the show as the precocious rock-n-roll journalist.  He evokes visions of a young Matthew Broderick or a wide-eyed Michael J. Fox without ever getting corraled into being the \"cute but troubled young kid\".<br><br>Frances McDormand is amazing and well-cast as Elaine the Mom, someone so wrapped up in creating a safe, healthy environment she drives both her children far away from home.<br><br>Billy Crudup &amp; Kate Hudson create the tension filled romance that drives the story along; both did a great job &amp; were adroitly evocative of those fast times in the rock &amp; roll fantasyland of the 70's.  Billy, as Russell Hammond, teeters on the edge of fame, not wanting to leave his long-suffering bandmates behind but being courted as the band's star by the record company, is palpably torn.  He carries William through the whirlwind of emotions and music along with him, showing him a world that is desperate and lonely, even with the whole world seemingly vying for his attention. His casting is also very clever, seeing as how Billy Crudup also sits on the brink of his own stardom &amp; acclaim in real life.<br><br>Lester Bangs is William's 'guru', played to perfection by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  A walking oxymoron, he exudes a callous arrogance and at the same time expresses genuine affection for the up-and-comer, sometimes giving William the exact advice he needs to get him through the toughest moments as a rock critic &amp; dealing with the love/hate relationships they seem to engender with everyone in their world of music.<br><br>I can't say enough about the awesome casting job, as well as the very detailed set design, costuming &amp; realism to the times.  Period pieces are usually difficult to do well; Mr. Crowe did this one genuine and good.<br><br>A truly great film, one that I'd heartily recommend to all but the most jaded rock critics.","user":"dave-943","rank":[192,229]}]
