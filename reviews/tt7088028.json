Its rarely brought up by the hero, i never really experienced the weight (excuse the pun) of why his weight loss was so important to him. I understood it was because his father died of weight loss and by the end it seemed his passing had an effect on him, I understood that much, but thats not enough, I need to experience these feelings in order to feel what the writer/director was going for.<br><br>the plot needed more compelling moments, heavier events. The obstacles that the hero faced never hit me hard to think \"wow, hows he gonna lose the weight now, that's devastating\" it was all very tame and I always knew he would lose it.<br><br>It just plotted on in a predictable direction, nothing terribly interesting. Everything kind of gets resolved the way you'd imagine, shame.","user":"richardadesmond","rank":[1,1]}]
