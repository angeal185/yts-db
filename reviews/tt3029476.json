[{"title":"Dramatic deep sea desperation","rating":7,"date":"18 June 2015","review":"Pressure is an example of how to make a small scale movie right. Put several characters on a predicament and let them resolve the increasingly dangerous issues with nature and probably each other. The movie is set nearly exclusively on one location, yet this claustrophobic environment is showcased with rich visual, even sometimes ironically beautiful. The cast, though small, has enough drama for an engaging thriller.<br><br>Story follows four men who are tasked to fix oil pipeline on sea bed. This is a very risky job since there's a storm brewing and sure enough, they find themselves trapped underwater. With pressure differential, amongst other lethal problems, they have to work together to ensure their survival. The plot offers healthy amount of realism with its taxing physical condition as well as human nature in jeopardy.<br><br>Surprisingly, the simple setting and premise are effective in creating tension. Characters are decent, each of them has their own vice and these make the already volatile situation escalate. Delivery from the actors are nice, coupled with good pacing, the dynamic between them feels natural. It is quick on introduction and doesn't prolong the scenes needlessly, making the desperate men appear more identifiable.<br><br>Graphic is not the usual sea oriented or submarine movie, it's in fact quite pristine. The overall tone is painted with blue tint, it eases the sense of dread in sophisticated way. Some of the scenes have outstanding cinematography so the audience won't be lost despite the murky surroundings. A minor obstacle is the movie use to specific lingo that might confuse casual viewer, but majority of the time the dilemma is expressed with adequate simplicity so it can easily capture the thrill.<br><br>Cleverly implementing fast pace, good characters and clear visual, Pressure makes the modest premise into an engrossing voyage.","user":"quincytheodore","rank":[27,34]},{"title":"Surprisingly Good","rating":7,"date":"12 June 2015","review":"This was not a movie I was really interested in seeing. Four guys trapped in a submersible bell vehicle during a storm. Sounded like it would be boring. In truth, it wasn't the type of genre I'm interested in. However, they did a very good job.<br><br>The acting was awesome, and it seemed realistic as to how people would behave in such a situation. The production value was good, as was the cinematography. It didn't look cheap or CGI to death. The movie did tend to have a claustrophobic feel, as a real life situation would.<br><br>There is nudity. The young man is dreaming or having a hallucination, and a girl swims up to him, and she's totally naked, and you see everything.<br><br>I recommend this movie. I gave it a 7-star rating. I doubt I'll watch it again, but it was surprising that they did such a good job on the movie.","user":"chrismackey1972","rank":[39,53]},{"title":"Very Poor Extremely disappointing","rating":4,"date":"11 October 2015","review":"I have just watched the Movie pressure, which I was actually quite looking forward too. However, having now seen it, I can only say it was quite disappointing. I could not believe how technically incorrect it was, it even failed at the most basic level. <br><br>Saturation divers at a working depth of 650 feet do not breath air as was not only stated several times during the film but also on the DVD box cover and claimed by the Director in the bonus clips on the DVD. Saturation divers breath a mixed gas of Helium and Oxygen which is approximately 97% helium 3% Oxygen. They do not refer to it as air, they refer to it as gas.<br><br>If the Director of the film cannot even establish the most basic information to be technically correct then it is no surprise that the story line and script was so weak and such a washout. Even the end seen showing the survival of the baby diver of the group is complete nonsense, this would have resulted in an explosive bend which would literally have blown the young man's body apart.<br><br>There was an incredible amount of technical inaccuracies in this film far too many to list here. This combined with an incredibly poor disjointed weak script should really have confined this movie to be left sunk at the bottom of the ocean.<br><br>If you do want to watch a movie about saturation divers that get trapped at the bottom of the sea in a diving bell that is technically accurate, is a claustrophobic and nerve tingling drama with a good story line then I recommend you watch the English version of the Norwegian made film from 1989 called The Dive (Dykket in Norwegian).<br><br>I would not recommend anyone to pay money to go and watch Pressure.","user":"paulobernay","rank":[24,34]}]
