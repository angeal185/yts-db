[{"title":"Not a Sci-Fi","rating":8,"date":"16 November 2018","review":"I love Science Fiction - and I love a good story. This was a really good story about relationships and how people treat each other. No action packed space thriller here - just a nice tale about a person who wants a bit more from her life.<br><br>The soundtrack is annoyingly repetitive - but otherwise, very watchable.","user":"sdi1000","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"A genuine delight!","rating":9,"date":"22 November 2018","review":"This film was a genuine delight. It was funny, moving and thought provoking. A very clever script and a stunning soundtrack. Good to see a truly great independent British science fiction. Definitely worth a watch! This film is certainly is not action packed, it moved along at a gentle pace that I really enjoyed.","user":"info-89575","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Unique Beautiful Drama","rating":10,"date":"7 December 2018","review":"This is one of the most unique and delightful sci-fi drama I've have ever seen.
