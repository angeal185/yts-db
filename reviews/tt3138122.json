I could not expect such low interesting movie on such subject. Actually I wish to happen something remarkable till end, but my bad luck I never saw that even movie end. No thrill no suspense and even no action you would see. Only three or four times gun shooting happened and movie ends. No action, no mystery nothing. I wasted my time and money on it, so I do not recommend to others. Avoid.","user":"saptesh786","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"Zzzzzz","rating":5,"date":"20 July 2019","review":"Very slow. starts going then slows again.
