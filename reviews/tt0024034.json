[{"title":"the movie that created the clichés","rating":9,"date":"16 March 2006","review":"Most of the negative comments posted below seem to be from people who either just don't like musicals or who are unaware that all the \"cliches\" in this movie were essentially invented by \"42nd Street.\" It's sort of like complaining that Shakespeare is full of quotations. This movie is absolutely brilliant, which is why it's been imitated endlessly for the last seven decades.<br><br>Sure, Keeler's not the end-all of tap dancing, but she fits the bill as an ingénue and is generally amiable and perky. The plot is predictable, but only because we've seen it duplicated so often. If you hadn't seen the same sort of thing a million times, you'd notice that it's tightly assembled and even somewhat suspenseful. The show is full of first-rate comic asides, even if some of the material is dated by obsolete slang and contemporary pop culture references.<br><br>And do people still take the trouble to complain that Busby Berkeley's dance numbers couldn't have been seen properly by the audience in the theater? That's like complaining that an ape couldn't really grow to be as large as King Kong. The whole point is that it's a movie, and Berkeley is able to do things that can't happen in the real world. Hence the transformation of background settings while the camera is close up on an actress's face. There isn't even such a thing as a close-up in a stage production. Carping that a '30's musical isn't realistic enough is like complaining that Venus couldn't actually have been born out of a clamshell.<br><br>In any case, this is one of the great '30s musicals... and one of the great Hollywood movies of all time. If you don't like the genre, then so be it. It always amazes me that so many film fans strongly prefer \"Singin' in the Rain\" to such predecessors as \"42nd Street,\" \"Dames,\" \"Top Hat,\" \"Swing Time,\" etc., when \"Singin' in the Rain\" is simply an homage to the '30s musical and generates quite little fresh material of its own. Mind you, it's a brilliantly executed homage, and it arguably benefits from its overt tongue-in-cheek attitude, but I can't help thinking many are simply swayed by the fact that it's in color (really good Technicolor) and has clearer sound quality than its '30s predecessors. Either way, you need to see and appreciate the original movie musicals before you can really understand what \"Singin' in the Rain\" was about... just as you should see some Hong Kong action flicks and blacksploitation films to get what's going on in \"Pulp Fiction.\"<br><br>But I digress. See \"42nd Street,\" and try to keep an open mind. Just because it's old is not a reason to assume that the people who made it didn't know their business extremely well.","user":"storyguy","rank":[96,99]},{"title":"A steamy, erotic musical of the 1930's.","rating":8,"date":"15 June 2001","review":"Do you find the musicals of the 40's and 50's pristine, sterile and virginal in the extreme?  And based on this unhappy discovery you've decided that you don't like musicals.  Please do not distress yourself and allow me to introduce you to the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930's, starting with 42nd Street, the best of them all.<br><br>\nLike nearly all the musicals of its time, 42nd Street is a depression-era back stage musical which focuses on the grueling hours that have to be put in by the singers and dancers day after day in preparation of opening night. The film has a fine cast with lovely Bebe Daniels as Dorothy Brock, Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Ginger Rogers, George Brent and Warner Baxter, who chews the scenery in every scene he's in as the stage director of 'Pretty Lady'.<br><br>\nWhat separates films like \"42nd Street\" from the musicals of the 40's and 50's is the daring camera work of dance director Busby Berkeley.  Berkeley loves his chorus girls, and he has no qualms about aiming his camera up their dresses at every opportunity.  One of the sexiest moments in the film comes when the girls try out for the chorus in their street clothes.  Each girl of course is dressed differently from the others, with a different hat (love those cute 30's hats) dress and high-heel shoes.  This variety makes them look hotter than when they're all wearing the same chorus outfit.  When they have to show their legs in the hopes of being chosen,  Berkeley gets his camera down low and gives you a birds eye view of each girl's legs ... first a front view, than they turn and let you get a good look at their calves.  It is a very erotic scene.  Later, when the girls leave their dressing rooms and are coming down the stairs for opening night, Berkeley puts his camera under the stairs and shoots up their dresses as they pass. Again, when the girls emerge from backstage and high-kick out for the opening number, Berkeley has his camera down low at a 45 degree angle, aiming right up the chute of the costumes of the first few girls to dance out on stage.  Further along, all the chorus girls form an arc in one number with their legs wide open and Berkeley tracks right thru their legs all the way around the circle.  You can even see the last girl has a gold ankle bracelet on her left ankle.  Once the production code was strictly enforced after 1934, shots like this were never seen again.<br><br>\n42nd Street has three great songs, \"You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me\", \"Shuffle Off To Buffalo\" and of course \"42nd Street\".  There have been many revivals of \"42nd Street\", and they often include the best numbers of other films, along with the three I mentioned, including \"Dames\" from the film of the same name, \"Go Into Your Dance\", a terrific number, and \"Lullaby of Broadway\", which is the highlight number from \"Gold-Diggers of 1935\", which has a spectacular tap dance sequence with 100 chorus girls wearing gorgeous, sheer black skirts as part of their chorus outfits.  If musicals often leave you cold, and you haven't given \"42nd Street\" a try, than I suggest that you do so ... and sit close to the television set.","user":"Ted-101","rank":[33,33]},{"title":"\"Now go out there and be so swell you'll make me hate you.\"","rating":10,"date":"22 September 2002","review":"I must admit, the reason I purchased this movie was all because of a CD I bought that had Ruby Keeler singing \"42nd Street\" on it.  But I also must admit that my purchase was not a waste of my money in the least!!!!<br><br>I adore this film.  It's the quintessential Depression-era Busby Berkley musical that usually starred either Ruby Keeler, Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, Jimmy Cagney, and featured a young Ginger Rogers.<br><br>Let me begin by saying that (especially for the time period) this actually happens to be a rather risque little musical... from Ginger Rogers' character actually having the name \"Anytime Annie\" to the little scene occuring on the train when Ruby Keeler extends her arm to have her shoes shined.  But I'm not writing to focus on that.<br><br>Warner Baxter gives a tremendous performance as Julian Marsh, the director whose life and financial security hang in the balance with the opening of his new musical \"Pretty Lady.\"  (His last scene in the film is especially powerful, and at the same time very depressing.)  George Brent is grand as Pat, the man deeply in love with the star of \"Pretty Lady,\" Dorothy Brock. Also, a young Dick Powell shines as the juvenille of the show, Billy Lawler, who happens to be in love with a doe-eyed chorus girl by the name of Peggy Sawyer.  Boy can he sing!!  Bebe Daniels is gorgeous as Dorothy Brock, the star of the show who is having trouble maintaining a balance between her Sugar Daddy Abner and the love of her life, Pat Denning.  She has such a fantastic talent as an actress and singer and is one of those true 30s beauties.  And look at that wardrobe!  (One thing I also noticed about Daniels... she's a TERRIFIC crier.)  Then you have Ruby Keeler (aka the former Mrs. Al Jolson) playing chorus-girl-turned-over-night-star Peggy Sawyer.  Ruby Keeler is absolutely adorable, with her petite frame, lovely large eyes, and fresh face.  She makes the song \"42nd Street\" her own, and her dancing is FANTASTIC!!!!  I have read many comments where people said she \"couldn't dance\" and looked like a clunky cow... but let's take a few things into consideration.  First of all, she was playing a kid who, by luck, got into a huge musical production.  Her dances had been choreographed to make her seem insanely talented, but at the same time a little awkward. Second of all, Ruby Keeler had a style all her own.  Her taps weren't the light, airy taps of say, Fred Astaire, but they were much more earthy. (And by this I mean no disrespect to Astaire, as he is one of my favorite actors!)  Her taps weren't light brushes on the floor, they were pounded deep into it.  Her singing is so cheerful and so lilting... her ingenue image paved the way for other similar ingenues, such as Debbie Reynolds' Kathy Selden in \"Singin' in the Rain.\"  But, upon viewing this, there are two characters that stick in your mind: Lorraine and Anytime Annie, superbly played by Una Merkel and Ginger Rogers.  They're so hilarious -- absolute riots!  They could not have found a better pair to spark off of each other as wisecracking friends; Lorraine who is, shall we say, stuck on Andy (Gotta love the platinum blonde hair on Una!  She's such a fantastic character actress.), and Ann, who aside from her obvious permiscuous ways, does a great British accent (love Ginger's random monacle!) and is quite humorous when loaded.<br><br>All in all, coming from a die-hard musical fan, I give this movie a definite 10/10!!!!  Watch it, and I promise you'll agree.","user":"Sweet Charity","rank":[54,59]}]
