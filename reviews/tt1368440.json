[{"title":"Hmm, why all the bad reviews? This is a rare story told well and should be appreciated as such","rating":10,"date":"6 November 2012","review":"It seems that a lot of people are threatened by simple truths in this film. Fat people don't want to be told that their food choices are being influenced by advertising. The negative ratings come from the mirror held in front of the faces of the audience, the negativity is a reflection of the shame of being overweight or the reflection of their own brands that they are wearing and the value they put in them.<br><br>This is an original film that doesn't fit the current Hollywood blockbuster mold, but rather it requires self-examination of what influences human choices.<br><br>There are a lot of word salad reviews on this movie already, no need for another. Go in with no expectations, come out with a cleaner view of the world and start to understand why you're craving your McDonalds/Coke/Idevice.<br><br>Check it out and be pleasantly rewarded - unless your own reflection reflects something too unpleasant to accept....","user":"JackHoffe","rank":[148,191]},{"title":"Jean-Paul Sartre, Beckett would be proud","rating":7,"date":"17 October 2012","review":"Somewhere at the far edges of the absurd, the profound can be found. This movie can be enjoyed strictly as a comedy, it can be taken seriously by a few, but most should know this film reaches further than it could ever truly grasp. Branded is flawed, fun, and perhaps best enjoyed in an extremely tired, alternative state of mind.<br><br>A few reviews and reviewers note that this film does not live up to its own advertising. There is irony there, but what does live up to advertising? Advertising is amongst the biggest waist of resources in contemporary society. Not just in terms of illusory currency, but the waist of many of todays greatest artists, thinkers, and idea makers; professionals payed to spin lies and manipulate participants of mass media consumption.<br><br>Branded may only scratch the surface of many important current problems caused by modern media, but at least its creators and performers put themselves \"out there\" to ask some interesting questions. May more artists ask important questions, and help move us all to a better place.","user":"urthpainter","rank":[87,115]},{"title":"Advertising is out of control.","rating":10,"date":"15 October 2012","review":"I didn't expect much of the movie, seemed like one of those film festival pieces of crap. But it really wasn't. Yes there is a certain amount of artsy-fartsy stuff put in there but that fits quite nicely.<br><br>I actually watched the whole movie. To me that says something. These days most of what's new isn't or great concepts are horribly executed (and Hollywood is only remaking stuff lately). Because of that I often find myself trying to do something else while the movie is still going. That didn't happen this time.<br><br>I also kinda hope this movie serves as a bit of an eyeopener, there are places where advertising is actually banned or at least from public places mainly the streets. Makes you feel peaceful being or even seeing such a place especially if you are used to be bombarded with all sorts of advertisements all day and everywhere.<br><br>BTW: I didn't even have subs for the Russian parts, still very watchable. BTW: Leelee Sobieski, doesn't she look a lot look Helen Hunt (but younger)!?","user":"rds_1","rank":[53,68]}]
