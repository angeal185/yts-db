[{"title":"Visually intriguing with unexpected twists, although poorly executed.","rating":5,"date":"28 October 2017","review":"Replace (2016) has been on my watch list ever since the official poster came out, what motivated me to watch the film was the body horror genre and the potential this film had. I knew almost nothing about this film, other than the IMDb bio and the mixed reviews. I recently found the film on DVD in HMV without a price-tag. When I sat down and watched the film I was instantly stunned by the introduction, however I quickly found myself foreseeing a disaster after the introduction. <br><br>The execution of Replace is very amateur and bombastic, mainly the music choices, sound editing and the editing. The music was quite hyperbolized attempting its hardest to provoke any emotion that's intended, the problem is that the development for this film is lacking, so the soundtrack appears as bombastic. The sound editing was very baffling, you could clearly tell when a line was dubbed, however voices of the actors would echo randomly for no reason, the sound editing was very inconsistent and became a massive distraction. <br><br>The editing for this film is perhaps the worst aspect, the editing really damages the film stylistically. This film is utterly confused on what style it intends to illustrate, this is conveyed through the complete switch of style of music, initially the soundtrack choice is synthetic, although later the soundtrack becomes orchestral, with very stock violins and bombastic motifs utilised to force the emotion down your throat. The editing is also a problem due to its tendency to flicker uncontrollably. At times you have no idea on what's happening.<br><br>In terms of what this film accomplishes, the twists and gore effects are superbly done. The gore effects seem very organic, although these gore effects are juxtaposed by the unphased performance of the main character, the pain is barely felt.<br><br>As a whole, Replace is a student film that has some great cinematography although also includes baffling editing, terrible sound design, sometimes laughable dialogue, and a score that's very bombastic and confused.","user":"chazthegamr","rank":[20,32]},{"title":"Replace it with something else to watch...","rating":2,"date":"24 December 2018","review":"The sole reason for why I sat down to watch this movie was because Barbara Crampton was in it.<br><br>I started to zone out from the movie after 20 minutes of absolutely and complete boredom. The first 5 minutes of the movie was adequate, then the movie just fully lost momentum and assumed a very monotonous pace. In between 20 minutes to 50 minutes, where I turned this ordeal of a movie off, I have little idea of what happened, because I started to do other things whilst the movie played on.<br><br>The storyline here was abysmally boring and uneventful, and it didn't really bolster the movie much that the characters were so non-distinct and pointless that they could just as easily have been replaced by mute and inanimate cardboard cutouts.<br><br>I will admit that the synopsis of the movie and the movie's cover oversell the movie, because the product that is the movie was just rubbish.<br><br>I have absolutely zero interest in returning to give this movie a second chance, because there was no appeal in it for me at all - well aside from Barbara Crampton, but not even she could manage to do anything to lift up the ordeal that is known as \"Replace\".","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"BOMBASTIC!!","rating":1,"date":"14 January 2019","review":"How many times can you say bombastic?
