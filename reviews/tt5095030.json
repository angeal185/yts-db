[{"title":"It's okay","rating":4,"date":"7 July 2018","review":"If you love shallow movies.<br><br>There isn't any depth in this movie. The jokes, story, villains, subplots. It all falls flat. It all one-dimensional. We have a mysterious-looking antagonist named Ghost, but she doesn't have a layer, she can't be mysterious, and at one point she serves up a clot of over complicated exposition that gives the film little bit action. You don't care if she'll accomplish her goal or not. You don't even care which side is going to win. We have lots of jokes, but they're all stale. If you find this humour funny, I'm sorry, I just can't take the movie seriously. While some ''intense'' interrogation scene was going on someone's cell is ringing with a joke sound. And this call is in this movie just because to be there - just because to be ''funny''. It doesn't have any contribution to the story or the storytelling, it just there like that Russian family from Justice League. We have a story that concerns a rescue mission. But there isn't any complexity or twist that blows the audience away. Just flat. You could easily predict what's going to happen next. We have a subplot concerning a romantic relationship between Antman and the Wasp, but there isn't much, it just teases us around, and that's all. We have another subplot concerning a lovely relationship between a dad and his 10 years old daughter, which is not very well developed but still a little bit heartwarming because it's a relationship between a dad and his 10 years old daughter.<br><br>While a woman who is in constant physical and emotional pain is trying not to die, the movie is trying to be funny. Peyton Reed maybe should've gone for the head, not chest. But then again, he can't, Disney has the strings. It got to try to be colorful, amiable, ''funny'' with forced jokes and fake actings. I really wonder when Marvel and Disney are going to take some risks and make a groundbreaking superhero movie. I guess never. Critics fine with eating the same turd for 10 years.<br><br>There isn't any climax, or depth, or emotion. Just a filler movie with no heart and soul.<br><br>PS. Amazing FBI work right there. It was too realistic for this movie 10/10","user":"nothimme","rank":[974,1]},{"title":"Really solid movie","rating":8,"date":"19 July 2018","review":"Just an overal good movie. The story could have been a bit better and the villans were not Thanos-level but it just does the job. I wanted more actually, because the CGI was really good. Also this is one of the funniest mcu movies, so if you want a good laugh I recommend this. <br><br>I applaud Paul Rudd and Micheal Douglas, great performance! <br><br>If you're a marvel fan this will satisfy you 100% and even if you just want to relax and enjoy this movie with the family, that's cool too. <br><br>It's kind off not really tied to the rest of the mcu, just as the first one, only captain America civil war a bit. Make sure u stay for the first post credit scene!","user":"mathias-degroof-678-362907","rank":[86,132]},{"title":"Ant-Man and the Wasp: On par sequel","rating":7,"date":"9 November 2018","review":"I love what Marvel have done in the creation of their \"Universe\" it's an overwhelming triumph and despite my fears they managed to slot Antman in there perfectly back in 2015.<br><br>A heavily comedic character is was heavy on charm, humour and elevated by a fantastic charm. Truth be told I found myself really hyped for the second movie, more than any other (Except GotG).<br><br>With every cast member both big and small returning a fantastic villian and the one and only Laurence Fishburne, the stars were aligning for another fantastic addition to the universe. And it is................kind of.<br><br>Regarding the previous films I've enjoyed them all with the exception of two. I didn't see the appeal in Dr Strange and thought that Black Panther was one of the most overrated movies in the history of the industry.<br><br>Antman 2 delivers, it does just not to the extent I hoped. Rudd, Lilly and Douglas are excellent once again and the story is fantastic though I think much of the impact of some of the story is highly lacking.<br><br>Our new villian delivered more than I'd ever expected, Pfeiffer was a great addition and Pena managed to annoy me less than usual!<br><br>The first movie got a solid 7/10 from me and this sequel is recieving the same. What that means is I consider it a good film, it's just not exactly groundbreaking stuff. I feel the movie played it a tad safe and didn't meet its potential.<br><br>Regardless it's funny, it's action packed and it's likeable and therefore it's another Marvel success in my book.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Incredible cast<br><br>Genuine laughs<br><br>Fits into the universe well<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>I still don't like Pena<br><br>Some of the impact was lost<br><br>Bit generic<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>Lilly is a very clever actress who picks her roles well<br><br>Someone still needs to explain to me how they do that age regression thing sfx<br><br>Walton Goggins has friends in high places<br><br>The size shifting has all kinds of bedroom possibilities<br><br>Truth serum IS a thing","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[33,49]}]
