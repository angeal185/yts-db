[{"title":"superior horror/shock film from talented cult director Bob Clark","rating":10,"date":"15 April 2005","review":"Excellent spooky variation on \"Monkey's Paw\" really plays on deep emotions in a crude (but effective) manner.<br><br>Low-budget, but fast-moving and scary. This is one of my favorites.<br><br>A distraught mother \"wishes\" her deceased Vietnam soldier-boy son home only to discover he isn't quite who he was when he left.<br><br>Many different horror archetypes (zombies, vampirism, cannibalism) are touched on without being confirmed, which makes the film that much more effective.<br><br>The film is also a sharp and dark commentary on the state of the returning GI. Andy sits for hours in his dazed \"zombie-like\" state and stares at the walls. He becomes violent and acts irrational. Many symptoms of post-traumatic shock syndrome.<br><br>Written by Alan Ormsby, who also collaborated with Clark on \"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\" and would later go on to pen Paul Schrader's remake of \"Cat People\".<br><br>If you're looking for another solid Bob Clark spook-fest, check out \"Black Christmas\" (which bears an eerie similarity to the original \"Halloween\", though it predates it by several years!!) before \"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\".<br><br>Many have commented on the *shocker* ending. If you are expecting something along the lines of the original \"Carrie\" - something to make you jump out of your seat - you will be disappointed. <br><br>The ending is more dour and stunning. I didn't see it coming, but it made perfect sense in line with everything that had happened. It's the kind of ending that a film would never have now. It's simply too honest. One of the better horror endings I've seen, actually.","user":"tristanb-1","rank":[38,47]},{"title":"Superb horror","rating":14,"date":"14 January 2004","review":"This is a horror film that expands the boundaries of the genre.<br><br>Put simply, it is a film about a dead man walking, but this dead man \"died\" in Vietnam before he returned home and his unexpected arrival opens many wounds within his family and amongst old flames and acquaintances.<br><br>Director Bob Clark is not satisfied depicting returned vet \"Andy\" as a zombie. Although he does crave human flesh and speaks infrequently, part of the film's charm is the reaction of people to the dead man's less-than-chipper mood.<br><br>Shots of Andy rocking like an autistic child are priceless, as is a \"conversation\" Andy has with the mailman who laments the returned boys \"we should have lost\". The family pet is not exactly Andy's best friend anymore, either.<br><br>John Marley as Charles Brooks, Andy's dad, is really great here. Although he tries hard to accept the new Andy, we really experience his gradual realization and disappointment that Andy is not the same Andy anymore.<br><br>Jim Backus is brilliant as the undead vet. He uses his voice to convey Andy's apparent indifference to life back home and adopts a strange, somnambulistic gait.<br><br>Technically adequate for a low budgeter, the film's richness of character and situation never shifts our attention to any production deficits.<br><br>\nOne of the best horror films ever.<br><br>Truly creepy and, ultimately, very sad.","user":"fertilecelluloid","rank":[34,42]},{"title":"Scared the ---- out of me","rating":24,"date":"24 July 2004","review":"So many horror films, both then and now, exist solely to provide cheap titillation to gore hounds and casual thrill-seekers.  'Dead of Night' (aka \"Deathdream\"), however, is serious business, and seriously scary. Comparable to 'The Exorcist' in its exploration of the parent-child dynamic when the child is given over to something sinister, I personally liked this more than I liked 'The Exorcist.'  It's leaner, more suspenseful, and less pretentious.  <br><br>Richard Backus is Andy, a soldier who returns from the war (presumably Vietnam) the very night his parents and sister are informed of his death in combat.  The homecoming is not a happy one, however.  Andy just isn't quite himself.  Laconic, humorless and irritable, he doesn't want to go out and isn't interested in seeing visitors.  Worse, there could be a link between him and the gruesome murder of a truck driver that occurred the night of his return.<br><br>Like 'The Exorcist,' 'Dead of Night' - a reworking of \"The Monkey's Paw\" -- aspires to be more than simply a horror film.  It aspires to be a Vietnam allegory, and it aspires to be a family drama.  Remarkably, it succeeds as all three.  It makes a compelling statement about returning soldiers, is a truly frightening horror film, and also a harrowing family drama.  John Marley, as a Andy's father, conveys torment and confusion effectively, and Lynn Carlin is especially good as Andy's mother, a woman who has disappeared completely inside of her denial.  The suspense is unbearable, and there's skillful use of both sound and space in creating it.  The chills are never cheap and are consistently hair-raising.  The movie marches headlong into its inevitable conclusion and is utterly uncompromising throughout.  That it was rated PG at the time is a shocker.<br><br>The movie has some flaws and lacks visual polish, but this is almost irrelevant given how brilliantly everything works.  The director is Bob Clark, who would go on to direct the first two 'Porky's' films, 'A Christmas Story,' and 'Baby Geniuses,' and he has made a rare horror film, one that is intelligent, thoughtful, and damn scary.","user":"MichaelCarmichaelsCar","rank":[28,34]}]
