Probably one the strangest films I've ever seen but that's by no means a bad thing! A great cast, locations and music. Little lacking in the story department but don't let that put you off - just give it a watch for Jemaine Clement and Matt Berry!","user":"rokchik07","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"It's a truly MAGICAL experience :D","rating":9,"date":"8 November 2018","review":"This movie is absolutely not for a wide audience but if you fit the niche they are targeting like I do you will absolutely love it !!\nIt's super weird, has an assortment of one of the best characters ever, has great music and it has Aubrey Plaza what more can one wish for !\nI will watch this one quite a few times in my future I am sure of it :)","user":"mrzim_logovanje","rank":[34,43]}]
