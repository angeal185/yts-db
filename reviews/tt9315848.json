[{"title":"Vir Das Is Back Stronger and Harder Than Ever","rating":10,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"Honestly this review doesn't deserve 10 stars as it would be a little ludicrous of me to review a comedy show 10 star when I was enlighten and taught many things and issues in this special. Vir das doesn't only create a story to make people laugh but he actually enlightes them by telling them how dumb they really are without letting them getting hurt. He touches sensitive topics and then turn them in a dark comedy but what he is trying to say to you sticks with you after show is over. You will see things he showed you and then know that it's wrong to do those things and will laugh after that.","user":"hritikpatil","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"Hilarious. Relatable. Recommended!!!","rating":9,"date":"12 December 2018","review":"This is Vir Das at his best. As an Indian citizen in America, I found the content extremely relatable, funny and in some cases inspiring. Hats off to you Dr. Das! Keep it coming.<br><br>PS: I regret selling your show tickets at the last minute in Philly as I was tired from the whatever Rocky Run in the AM that day.","user":"dhawalsehgal","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"Vir Das is one of the most intellectual comedian we have in India","rating":10,"date":"27 December 2018","review":"This was one of the best stand up from Vir Das and I'm saying that because it contains a lot of good messages with the right amount of fun. I agree it is not his most funny one, but it definitely his most fun to watch stand up.","user":"dharamsingh15","rank":[8,10]}]
