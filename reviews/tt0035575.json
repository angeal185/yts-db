[{"title":"Focus on the dancing talent of James Cagney","rating":26,"date":"26 September 2004","review":"There are many, many James Cagney films that show his enormous talent as an actor. He was equally at home in musicals, dramas and comedies. While I have always been a fan and appreciate his unusual scope, this movie in particular caught my eye and totally blew me away when the scene I'm about to describe unfolded.<br><br>Near the very end of the film Cagney's character (George M. Cohan) bids farewell to the President and leaves the room. There is a long, open staircase he starts walking down. As he walks you sense a bit of a bounce beginning to take over his step.....one that quickly gives way to an awesome dance as he navigates the stairway. Many will not note, but this dance was a fantastic achievement on two fronts. One, it was done in one \"take\"...that is, the camera never stopped; the scene never \"cut.\" The camera stays with him in one shot all the way through. Second, Mr. Cagney never ONCE looks at his feet or down at the steps. It's almost impossible to WALK down a staircase without looking down or hanging on to a banister....this man DANCED down a staircase without benefit of seeing or touching anything.<br><br>Couple this feat with the brilliant display of \"hoofing\" he gives earlier in the film when he literally dances up the walls and you have a movie that deserves its \"classic\" rating. If you haven't seen it please make it a point to do so. Any movie that is awe inspiring 62 years later must be worth a peek, don't you agree?","user":"shiloh_3","rank":[74,78]},{"title":"Cagney's Favorite....And It Shows!","rating":10,"date":"11 February 2006","review":"James Cagney recalls in his autobiography that this movie was his favorite, largely due to his love of dancing. He was one of the great \"tough guys\" of all time on film, but dancing was his passion, he noted. It shows here. This was \"a labor of love,\" to use a clich√©, and it's obvious how much fun he was having in this film. His hoofing talent also was obvious. He was good, very good.<br><br>In fact, for the audience, most of this movie is pure \"feel good.\" Almost all the characters are nice people, the story is inspirational and nicely patriotic and the songs are fantastic. If you pick up the two-disc special-edition DVD that came out several years ago, then you'll see this film in all it's glory. The transfer is magnificent and really brings out the great cinematography. I never realized how beautifully filmed this was until I saw this on DVD.<br><br>The story is simply the biography of George M. Cohan, the writer and Broadway star of many, many hit plays and hit songs. Unlike today's biographies, this is a very positive story about a man who brought patriotism alive during World War I with such inspirational songs as \"It's A Grand Old Flag\" and \"Over There.\" For some of us, listening to these songs can bring a tear or two.<br><br>Cagney is his normal riveting self and Joan Leslie certainly makes an appealing female lead as Cohan's wife. The great Walter Huston plays Cohan's father. I've always found Huston to be an actor of great presence. In this movie is a very, very touching deathbed scene with he and Cagney.<br><br>So you have a little bit of everything here from drama to romance to comedy to music and Cagney is the glue to fits it all together beautifully. One of the great classic films of all time.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[60,64]},{"title":"A Flag Waving Triumph","rating":8,"date":"22 July 2004","review":"Right from the start, I have to say you do not need to be an American to be caught up in the excitement of the blatant flag waving tribute to a great artist.  \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" made to boost morale after the U.S. entered the war surely would have achieved its goal.  It would have been even better in Technicolor (not the coloured version later shown).  The songs were great, the acting and the individual dancing style of James Cagney was superb and deserved the Oscar.  The two scenes featuring \"Over There\" were very moving with Frances Langford a standout!   The story, while bearing small resemblance to real life, was good and Walter Huston and Rosemary de Camp were excellent.  When you see a film such as this some 60 years after its release, and still really enjoy it, it shows how the Golden Years of Hollywood were just that.","user":"dougandwin","rank":[36,38]}]
