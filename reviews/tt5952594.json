[{"title":"An outstanding existentialist drama","rating":9,"date":"9 March 2019","review":"Triumphs of the human spirit constitute perhaps cinema's most enduring story material, and this French film shot in Nevada brings a powerful existentialist message to the viewer without the preachiness one might expect of an American movie on the subject.<br><br>Matthias Schoenaerts, his shaven head and rock-solid physique suggesting a Vin Diesel, is magnificent in the lead role, a convict without hope or direction paralleled with the title wild horse he's tasked to train for sale to police departments or ranchers in a prison program run by craggy old Bruce Dern. Connie Britton makes the most of her two scenes as a prison psychologist working on rehabilitation.<br><br>Most of the cast is non-pro, actual prisoners from such a program giving solid performances for debuting feature director Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. Echoes of \"The Myth of Sysiphus\" and other existential writings underpin the action, but Laure carefully makes it a visual cinematic experience, not one of those 1950s Playhouse 90 classics from TV's Golden Age. Free of sentimentalism, it also keeps the melodramatic subplot involving chicanery and violence in prison to an absolute minimum, and is a wholly satisfying movie with universal appeal.","user":"lor_","rank":[58,82]},{"title":"A lovely tale","rating":7,"date":"19 June 2019","review":"Yesterday evening, I saw this film at a premiere in the presence of the actor <a href=\"/name/nm0774386/\">Matthias Schoenaerts</a>, the director <a href=\"/name/nm0166438/\">Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre</a>, the producer <a href=\"/name/nm0004347/\">Alain Goldman</a> and part of the film crew, within UGC Les Halles, in Paris. <a href=\"/name/nm0166438/\">Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre</a> and <a href=\"/name/nm0004347/\">Alain Goldman</a> briefly mentioned the manifold difficulties dealing with the making of a first film abroad. Women in the audience were clearly under the spell of <a href=\"/name/nm0774386/\">Matthias Schoenaerts</a> who behaved like he was himself under <a href=\"/name/nm0166438/\">Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre</a>'s spell.<br><br>Without unduly spoiling the script, Roman Coleman (<a href=\"/name/nm0774386/\">Matthias Schoenaerts</a>) is incarcerated for aggravated violence. After a decade in prison, most under total isolation, he has the opportunity to benefit from a rehabilitation program involving the training of wild mustangs. But before controlling a wild animal such as a mustang, first you must be able to control yourself. And that's definitely the point. Thus, we see Roman (the prisoner) and Marquis (the mustang) taming to each other, as the fox and the little prince (<a href=\"/name/nm0756686/\">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</a>, 1943).<br><br>The script is predictable and the taming phase is described as elliptically as naively, but we can easily cope with this secondary observation. Moreover, the cast is excellent, the Belgian actor <a href=\"/name/nm0774386/\">Matthias Schoenaerts</a> enjoying a legendary charisma and a remarkable aura. He is also perfectly seconded by <a href=\"/name/nm4207146/\">Jason Mitchell</a> and <a href=\"/name/nm0001136/\">Bruce Dern</a>. In fact, I was particularly moved by the message of hope transpiring throughout the entire film, a prison being generally reduced to the single status of « let's hide the dust under the carpet », that is to say that as long as the scum is in jail, the society will feel better (it is certainly a plus) but without really worrying about the after-jail (that's weird, isn't it?)<br><br>As a synthesis: a lovely tale brimming with beneficence, philanthropy and humanity. 7/8 of 10.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[22,31]},{"title":"man and horse figure it out","rating":7,"date":"21 March 2019","review":"Greetings again from the darkness. A herd of wild horses frolic and gallop and relax in the prairies that separate majestic peaks of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Suddenly the peace being enjoyed by the horses is interrupted by the deafening noise of a helicopter above. The purpose of the helicopter is to push the herd towards the corral and trucks that are part of the round-up. An opening title card informs us that more than 100,000 wild horses roam the U.S. countryside and the government is only able to manage a small percentage. Part of that process involves therapy for prisoners ... an obvious analogy being the two wild beings try to tame each other. When the prisoners have trained the horses, an auction is held, and many of the animals will be used in law enforcement - an irony not dwelled upon here.<br><br>Roman Coleman is a guilt-riddled man. A man of short fuse and violent ways. He readily admits to the prison psychologist (Connie Britton) that \"I'm not good with people.\" After 12 years in isolation, he's been transferred to general population and he seems pretty indifferent about it. His guilt is the type that only a split-second violent outburst can saddle one with - though we don't hear the specifics until late in the film. The psychologist assigns him to \"outdoor maintenance\" which is a fancy institutional term for, well, shoveling horse manure.<br><br>As he observes the rehabilitation program, where the convicts train the wild mustangs under the tutelage of crusty old horse trainer Myles (Bruce Dern), Roman is drawn to the wildest of the wild ... a mustang kept in a dark stall and labeled untrainable. The parallels to Roman himself are obvious, and soon head trainer Myles and fellow convict Henry (Jason Mitchell, MUDBOUND) have invited Roman into the program. It's here where man and horse prove how similar their temperaments are - they both react with anger to most any situation. After a particularly cruel and unfortunate outburst, Roman is back to solitary confinement and studying up on horses.<br><br>Writer-director Laure de Claremont-Tonnerre co-wrote the story with Mona Fastvold and Brock Norman Brock (BRONSON). It's the director's first feature film and she shows a real knack for pacing ... letting the uncomfortable scenes between man and horse breathe and play out. Speaking of uncomfortable, when Roman's pregnant daughter Martha (rising star Gideon Adlon, BLOCKERS) shows up to get his signature on a form so that she can run off with her boyfriend, the history and lack of commonality between the two is palpable. Their scenes together are excruciating. Sure this is a cliché-filled concept, but the director and especially the cast keep us glued to the screen and caring about what happens.<br><br>Matthias Schoenaerts stars as Roman, and it's yet another stellar performance from the actor who exploded onto the movie screen with BULLHEAD (2011) and RUST AND BONE (2012). Since then, it's been one terrific turn after another. His physical presence and soulful eyes convey so much. He has mastered the strong silent type, but here he expertly uses body language to communicate with both the horse and the audience. The drug-dealing sub-plot appears to have been included to remind us just how dangerous a prison yard can be, but we never lose sight of the pain involved with second chances and learning to be a better person. There are some similarities to two excellent 2018 movies, LEAN ON PETE and THE RIDER, but this first time filmmaker wisely lets her talented cast do their thing, as she complements their work through cinematographer Ruben Impens' (BEAUTIFUL BOY) fabulous work up close and with expansive vistas. Robert Redford was an Executive Producer on the film, so the beauty of the area is not surprising. The film allows emotions to play out right through the final shot.","user":"ferguson-6","rank":[32,49]}]
