[{"title":"For cat lovers.","rating":7,"date":"18 July 2018","review":"If you love cats you will definitely like this documentary because that's the only thing you will get to see. The daily life of three different types of cats, the farm cat, the stray cat and the city cat. From a kitten to adulthood they follow a farm cat in France, a stray cat in Greece, and a city cat in the overpopulated Tokyo. Each has a different style of life as the situations of their surroundings are completely different. While the farm cat has the comfort of being domesticated he still hunts for pleasure as the stray cats hunts for surviving, while the city cat is housebound and has other priorities. It's a nice and learnful documentary, with cute images of our dear beloved animals. A documenatry where you learn something about their behaviors and their instincts, sounds good to me.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[6,6]}]
