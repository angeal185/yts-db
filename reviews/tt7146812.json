[{"title":"Hate it but not cause it is bad.","rating":9,"date":"5 April 2020","review":"I hated this movie because it hit me so hard. Lost my dad a while back and never dealt with all the things from that but this movie kinda drop kicked my feelings into the focus. Hard to watch a film with tears streaming down your face","user":"z-knipp","rank":[75,88]},{"title":"Great film that doesn't have issues of other films","rating":9,"date":"4 March 2020","review":"The dead parent trope might be overused for Disney movies but Onward doesn't make the mistakes of those movies. The siblings fight like siblings though out, not just at plot critical moments. Their single mom has a boyfriend who is not an evil stepparent trope, and their mom is actually proactive during the events of the film, but the adventure still belongs to the boys. I've been tired of plots that have parents oblivious to what their kids are doing. I came for the DnD references but I cried for the well-rounded characters.","user":"brigid134","rank":[217,299]},{"title":"Movie for boys where the price is love - bravo Pixar","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"Doing a fulfilling movie for boys where the price of the quest is emotional wholeness and found love is a rare sight and not an easy task. Pixar succeeded by providing rich brotherly relationship, adventure, magic and finally love. It is much more a common message in movies for girls like Frozen, but I think that the magical combination of all the ingredients achieved by Pixar is important and entertaining at the same time. Wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone :)","user":"alffastar-261-288715","rank":[166,243]}]
