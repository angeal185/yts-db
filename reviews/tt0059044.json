[{"title":"\"Wholly Bananas! It's a Girl's Leg!\"","rating":6,"date":"19 August 2000","review":"Just what does a teenage boy bursting with testosterone say, while with his bikini-clad girl, they discover a dead girl in the sand?  \"Wholly Bananas ! It's a girl's leg!\" of course.  That is just one example of the laughable dialogue contained in this thoroughly un-artistic look at a painter who uses blood to create his art.  He starts by using his own, then moves to girl models for their hemoglobin, corpuscles, and plasma for his creative inspiration.  Color Me Blood Red is the third film contained in what is typically known as the Blood trilogy directed by that world renowned director of gore...Herschell Gordon Lewis.  Yep this film has all the Lewis trademarks.  Poor direction...it has it!  Cheap sets too!  And that acting only Lewis seems to inspire...so bad it is funny.  Many of the performers in here are so awful that one wonders how they were ever chosen, although the lead, Gordon Oas-Heim(Don Joseph) as Adam Sorg shows signs of mediocrity at times.  For a Lewis film, Color Me Blood Red is a fun picture. It has some good honest to Gosh belly laughs(99% unintentional), and a story not too unlike Roger Corman's A Bucket of Blood.  And the lead actress...Candi Conder does more than AMPLE justice to a very nice swimsuit! I had fun watching it...never took any of it serious and, for a Lewis picture, it has minimal gore(only four deaths).  It gives new meaning to the phrase that life is a canvas!","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Those bloody artists!","rating":5,"date":"8 April 2006","review":"\"Color me Blood Red\" completes the infamous Blood-trilogy by the even more infamous director Hershell Gordon Lewis and, although my least favorite film of the three, it's another silly entertaining and smutty gore classic. Don't look for many film-making qualities here, as the story is rather unoriginal (imitating Roger Corman's 1959 \"Bucket of Blood\"), the acting is unspeakable and  especially compared to \"Two Thousand Maniacs\"  it's clumsily edited together. Good old Lewis brings the art of finger painting to a whole new dimension here, when mentally unstable artist Adam Sorg discovers that the blood of his girlfriend's cut finger supplies him with the exact right shade of red he needs for his macabre paintings. He's going to need more, of course, and thus he kills her as well as various other models in order to complete his masterful art gallery exhibits. I spotted LESS gore than in the previous two Blood-trilogy films, still there are some effectively nauseating scenes, most notably the one where Sorg literally squeezes all the blood out of one his victims' intestines. Other than the gore, there are the hilariously inept dialogues and the complete lack of context to enjoy. If you're not into The Godfather of Gore's work, however, this will just seem like a mindless and sadistic trash-movie.","user":"Coventry","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Lots of dumb fun to be had with the Godfather of Gore.","rating":23,"date":"23 July 2002","review":"You gets what you pays for with Herschell Gordon Lewis movies. If you are looking for a great, original plot with interesting characters, well acted and impressively directed, then don't look here. But if you want to see a silly Roger Corman rip-off with lots of unintentional cheap laughs, and plenty of HGL's trademark, then you're in the right place. 'Color Me Blood Red' is the last in Lewis' Blood Trilogy, and is the second best of the three in my opinion. ('Two Thousand Maniacs!' just beats it for sheer entertainment value). Don Joseph plays a tormented artist who discovers a way out of his artistic rut - blood, lots of it. Joseph's acting is variable at best, but possibly the best seen in a HGL movie, and he comes across as a corny, poor man's Timothy Carey. Which may not be much, but it's enough, and his performance stands out from the rest of the inept cast, especially the bizarrely unbeatnik beatnik teens (WHAT was that all about?!), and William Harris' stupid art critic character. 'Color Me Blood Red' is dumb, no doubt about that, but it's dumb FUN, and should be seen by every horror movie buff for its historical interest if nothing else.","user":"Infofreak","rank":[7,10]}]
