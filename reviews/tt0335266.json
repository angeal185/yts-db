[{"title":"Lost Souls","rating":9,"date":"29 March 2004","review":"It's been a long time since a movie has made me hurt the way this one did. Perhaps \"hurt\" isn't the right word.  \"Ache\" is more like it.  I could so completely identify with both characters.  <br><br>Bob is a middle-aged actor caught in a life which has lost its zest and purpose, doing what he \"ought\" to be doing (making money doing whiskey commercials) instead of doing what he WANTS to do (plays).  And then a young, beautiful, intelligent woman enters his orbit.  On that level alone, with its mute longing and sexual tension, I can identify with him.<br><br>And then there is Charlotte, a student of philosophy seeking herself, her soul lost and adrift.  She doesn't know who she is, doesn't know what she wants.  Her life is a quest for authenticity of self.  And I identify with her because so much of my life I have been seeking the same thing.<br><br>This movie isn't for everyone.  They will call it boring, lifeless, limp. There are people, I realize, who have never experienced that kind of longing, who had never sought meaning in their lives, and searched for their own lost souls.  They live for the here and now, without giving a thought to the spiritual aspects of life.  <br><br>A friend said introverts will love this movie, extraverts will hate it.  I think that is a fair surface assessment.  This movie is all about the inner lives of two people whose souls connect for a brief time in an alien city. It is a love affair not of bodies, but of minds and spirits.<br><br>Some this movie will make angry.  Some this movie will make weep.","user":"SECurtisTX","rank":[603,706]},{"title":"What makes a good movie...","rating":10,"date":"6 August 2005","review":"When I used to think of what made a good movie, I would look at a movie from all aspects: direction, cinematography, editing, acting, story etc. The sum of all these parts make up the whole, and are also what lead me to my opinion of a film...<br><br>Then came Lost in Translation. The first time I watched this movie, I felt a strange sense of depression that lasted for a few days, but I couldn't put my finger on why. I watched it again and again, and felt the same way each time. I thought maybe it was because I have never traveled and would really like to, or that I have the desire to find the perfect woman in a strange world.<br><br>Whatever the case, I realized one thing. LOST IN TRANSLATION MADE ME THINK. It made me question my life, its purpose, whether I was happy or not, and what I want do with it. Never has a movie touched me in such a way, and for that reason, this is the one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. That doesn't mean its the best movie ever made, in fact, I can name many that are technically better than this film, like the one I named before. But I cannot name a movie that has had more effect on me than Lost in Translation, and that is why I love it and will love it forever.<br><br>Think of the last movie that really made you think, one that had such a great influence on you that it somehow changed your life, even for the littlest bit. That, to you, is a great movie...","user":"jlmmymack-1","rank":[607,743]},{"title":"Lingers for days- sucks you in.","rating":10,"date":"30 November 2005","review":"Few movies make you THINK long after they end. That's OK. Movies are supposed to entertain and most do so without requiring even one ounce of thought. It's sad that maybe some of you out there prefer movies- and life- that way. Thankfully this movie is all about thinking and feeling. This is not a chick flick. It's a human experience flick.<br><br>This film examines and lays bare the intricacies of love, life and loneliness; the claustrophobia, insomnia and disorientation of traveling to a foreign country. The loneliness that creeps in after life's normality starts to wear thin. The spark of promise that meeting someone new brings. This is what life is about and what this film so flawlessly portrays.<br><br>How many of you can relate to and have actually been that guy/girl on business, in the hotel in some foreign city, happily married yet feeling alone and beaten by life's banality? How many of us have been tempted in that very situation, to stray from the confines of moral adherence for the lure of a forbidden, if fleeting, joy? How many have felt that tingle- that spark- when a stranger smiles and you think, \"you know, in another life...\"? Change the time, place and all of us have been there whether we admit it or not. Maybe single people don't get this movie; maybe it's for those of us who have walked down that aisle and are wiser to the realities of life.<br><br>The characters here are true. Their dialog is true. The setting is true. It's all tirelessly fascinating because we can all relate to it and it involves us in a way that most movies do not. We find ourselves drawn to every moment these two experience together and apart. We are intrigued by the glances, nuances and words they share.<br><br>Johanssen is brilliant and beautiful as the lonely, young wife questioning her marriage. Her beauty is classic, not necessarily sexual, though she is obviously alluring in this role. Her bee-stung lips, perfect body and haunting eyes may have something to do with that. Still she's more sophisticated beauty than mindless hottie, even at 19. This is a role tailor-made for her. It could never have been Reese Witherspoon or Jessica Alba or - God forbid- Jessica Simpson, or anybody else in that realm.<br><br>Murray is simply at his best. He does \"exasperated, middle-aged and depressed\" better than most, with his receding hairline and frumpy body. You really believe that these two could connect in a physical and emotional way, as remote as that may seem on the surface. What other 50-something could ever be believed to be appealing to a young woman as pretty as Charlotte? That's a tough chemistry to fake and I can't think of a more perfect pair. What drives them to this attraction is what's intriguing to watch.<br><br>Go see this. Turn off your \"Major Blockbuster-Tom Cruise-Action-Pop Culture Catch Phrase-Big Star\" mind and tune in with a more searching self. Watch this with your soul and heart, not your eyes. If you look deeper than the surface you'll find yourself moved by the whole experience. Yes, it's THAT good.","user":"mlee-29","rank":[624,775]}]
