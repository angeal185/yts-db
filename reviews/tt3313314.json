[{"title":"Waste of time","rating":1,"date":"24 February 2019","review":"Everything was terrible... The acting, writing, story, etc... Don't waste your time with this. I don't write reviews often, but I felt I needed to warn others about how bad this movie is.","user":"jordan-arscott","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"2 December 2018","review":"Looks like all the friends and family members rated this movie 10 out of 1.\nThe story is extremely dumb, chaotic the best.\nNot sure the director,writer or the actor/actresses are worse.\nI gave 1 star because there was no 0 or minus numbers.","user":"sanikok-565-783461","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Utter bad one","rating":1,"date":"24 February 2019","review":"I made an IMDB account just to rate this movie. It was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The other reviews must have been friends and family or paid for. The acting was cliched and poorly executed, not that they had much to work with from the script. The whole plot was awful and made no sense. None of the characters reacted to events in any remotely plausible way. The ending left much to be desired.<br><br>I could go on, but please save your time and sanity and skip this one.","user":"mayrme","rank":[7,7]}]
