[{"title":"Surprisingly still holds up over 20 years later","rating":8,"date":"19 March 2018","review":"There are two kinds of people in this world. Those who find Beavis &amp; Butt-Head hilarious and those who find them unbearable. I'm in the former category and was pleasantly surprised by how funny I still found this film. I remember when it originally came out that Beavis &amp; Butt-Head were pretty played out by this point and a feature length theatrical film filled with big names voicing characters (Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, Robert Stack, Cloris Leachman, Eric Bogosian, Richard Linklater, Greg Kinnear, David Spade, and David Letterman as a Roadie) seemed like overkill. I remember grudgingly liking the film, but rewatching after having not seen Beavis &amp; Butt-Head in quite some time, the film felt pretty fresh and surprisingly prescient given the amount of pop culture youth take in today, along with the dumbing down society (also see Mike Judge's underrated satire \"Idiocracy\" for further explorations of these same themes). However, it may be that I'm now older and and am just cranky old man bemoaning \"kids these days.\" Back in 1996, MTV was the main source of youth pop culture and Beavis &amp; Butt-Head were a hilarious sent up of MTV's lowest common denominator fans. Today, youth consume pop culture instead through any number of social media apps and streaming apps/devices, rather than one channel and Tiger Beat magazine. The medium may have changed, but a satire of youth culture being dumbed down (to a ridiculously low level of by our two heroes) is still just as relevant today. I think it's this element of satire that many critics missed back when Beavis &amp; Butt-Head originally aired. Beavis &amp; Butt-Head were never presented as characters to to aspire to or intended to be seen as \"cool.\" They were made by their creators to be held up for ridicule and to be mocked. Admittedly, many youth at the time missed the intended irony and instead enjoyed the TV series for all the wrong reasons, but that's not a reason to dismiss the characters outright. Now to this film in particular, the pair have their precious television stolen and they then set out to find a replacement, which has them mistaken for hitmen and puts them in the middle of government espionage and intrigue, of which they are completely oblivious. I found just about everything in the film hilarious and worthy of being considered satire. Everything in the film works as both as straight humor and also as social commentary. From the oblivious Tom Anderson (a likely cousin of King of the Hill's Hank Hill) to Mr. Van Driessen lovingly sung rendition of Lesbian Seagull over a montage of Beavis &amp; Butt-Head obscenities committed across the country on their ill conceived cross country road trip to \"score,\" to the pair meeting the Bubba US President of the 90s, Bill Clinton, is all quite funny and quite clever. Overall, if you can get past (or get into) the crass surface level humor, \"Beavis &amp; Butt-Head Do America\" is heeeeee-larious.","user":"a_chinn","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Don't mis-judge Mike Judge","rating":7,"date":"14 May 2006","review":"I know a lot of you who have never seen Beavis and Butthead probably think very little of the show based on the low-brow nature of it (I was one of them), but if you give this movie a chance you'll see that it's actually as well written and at times as, dare I say, subtle as King of the Hill.<br><br>Beavis and Butthead have their TV stolen and when trying to get it back are mistaken for hit men by drunken drunk Muddy Grimes (Bruce Willis, as I was rather shocked to find out once the credits rolled), who sends them on a mission to 'do his wife' Dallas. Misinterpreting this as any horny teenagers would, B+B head to Las Vegas to carry out the terrible act. But we discover (they don't, however) that Dallas and Muddy are part of international weapons conspiracy and our two teen-aged heroes are being set-up to take the blame.<br><br>So, as they take off across the country, causing absolute mayhem wherever they go, the ATF closely follow, giving full body cavity searches to everyone and anyone they meet at the order of head honcho Agent Flemming (the late Robert Stack), who comes out with some brilliant, deadpan one-liners. The set-pieces are wonderful and the mushroom-induced dream sequence by Rob Zombie looks amazing.<br><br>Mike Judge's animation style also brilliant. Avoiding bright, primary colors used in shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy and Futurama, he uses mainly softer colors, pencil-effect scenery and water-color backgrounds. It's a sort of calming, easy-going animation style that he's totally made his own.<br><br>You should totally check-out this movie. Don't be put off by what you may have heard or may think of Beavis and Butthead. You'll be conning yourself out of loads of laughs if you do.<br><br>And look-out for Daria Morgendorfer in the 'Lesbian Seagull' scene.","user":"CuriosityKilledShawn","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"Was laughing non-stop","rating":8,"date":"11 December 2015","review":"Beavis and Butthead is just hilarious. This movie is exactly what the show is like but longer. I couldn't stop laughing. Beavis and Butthead love to entertain us (ha ha anus). I just couldn't stop laughing at cornholio no matter how many times I heard it. It just never gets old. The bit where they walk in on the principal getting spanked is hilarious and the plane scene. If you are a fan of Beavis and Butthead and you haven't seen this movie you should go watch it. Trust me you won't be disappointed. To be honest I wasn't even expecting much and I loved it. Mr anderson was good in this movie as well and so was the main fbi agent. I also liked the character Muddy voiced by Bruce willis.","user":"eduderocks182","rank":[6,6]}]
