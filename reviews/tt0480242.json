[{"title":"A Delightful Treat for Adults","rating":9,"date":"1 November 2007","review":"The most satisfying element about \"Dan in Real Life\" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. The casting of Oscar-winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! Had this movie been made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would have been a disaster.<br><br>Another wonderful aspect about \"Dan in Real Life\" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the \"frat pack\" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. \"Dan in Real Life\" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. Whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from \"Dan in Real Life\" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.<br><br>My only problem with \"Dan in Real Life\" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress Brittany Robertson. It's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. Either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.<br><br>All in all, \"Dan in Real Life\" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. The quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.","user":"chere43","rank":[210,278]},{"title":"Not massively original, but it is entertaining","rating":7,"date":"15 January 2008","review":"Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls. At a large family homecoming Dan meets his perfect woman, only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother.<br><br>What's a man to do?<br><br>I rather liked \"Dan In Real Life\", but I would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained, rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful. If you cannot accept it, fear not, \"Get Smart\" will be along later in the year, but for the record I thought he was very good.<br><br>\"Dan In Real Life\" starts off like your typical, incidentally amusing, family drama, but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, cinematic pickings would be very scarce indeed, wouldn't they?), but \"Dan In Real Life\" is entertaining, and a good cast (who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the luminous Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a ponder on the meaning and passion of love.<br><br>I hope that Steve Carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again.","user":"seawalker","rank":[60,83]},{"title":"Sweet, Funny, Touching...Just About Perfect","rating":10,"date":"4 October 2007","review":"I got to see this film at a preview and was dazzled by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughing so hard at a film and yet being moved by it. The laughs aren't gags here--they're observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks of \"Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!\" I won't give away the plot, which is more than just \"Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend.\" The whole family plays a part in the relationship here. Probably the best blend of laughter and warmth since \"While You Were Sleeping.\" <br><br>Steve Carell goes much deeper than he's gone before, and for the first time I really liked him. The cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've loved in other roles, but they blend to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is lovely as the mother, Juliette Binoche is luminous and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), and even the reviled Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touching performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and I'll buy the CD the second it's available.<br><br>Don't miss this one.","user":"writtenbypatrick","rank":[179,279]}]
