[{"title":"EXCELLENT COMEDY","rating":10,"date":"19 July 2019","review":"We have A LOT of questions. Who is the \"concerned friend\" in the leather jacket that got murdered? Why did Jennifer put sticky tape around her ankle? Where is the detective's daughter? Why did she look for sticky tape and not a knife? Why did her fake husband feel the need to wear glasses since she couldnt remember anything? Did they ever find the real husband in the boot of the car? For a man that has a lot of locks on things, why did fake husband not lock the freezer with detective Morzel Freeshington (a mix of Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington....you're welcome) in it? Why didn't they use the excellent balcony at the top of the stairs to throw someone through it? Why did she not use the walking stick, which was dramatically zoomed in on, as a weapon? Did the neighbour of the leather jacket wearing concerned friend get back to sleep with that car alarm going? Why did fake husband light a random candle after tying Jennifer up with flammable material? Did the blonde doctor ever go home or get a break, concerns about illegal working practices? Why did fake husband not use at least a symbol, a capital letter and at least one number in his password, which was guessed by a woman with actual brain damage? Why was Jen so confused at her maiden name being Jennifer Allen, when her kidnapper took her actual husbands name?<br><br>If you have lots of wine, this film is genuinely funny. If you don't have lots of wine, get some!","user":"rhiannajohnson89","rank":[847,928]},{"title":"Trailer spoiled it.. predictable and loose ends","rating":3,"date":"19 July 2019","review":"I watched it, thinking that there would be something MORE than what the trailer showed... cause the trailer showed a LOT, it basically gave the whole plot away!!\nI really watched it thinking there was a bigger twist, but alas.. there was none.<br><br>There's things that I I didn't like:\n<ul><li>Loose Ends: There's a character who was portrayed as evil, identity shrouded in Mystery.. but the movie ended without explaining WHO that character was, background story, ANYTHING.</li><li>Heroine is suddenly a lock-picking master.</li><li>Heroine, limping and all, can sneak up behind the villain without issues.</li><li>Dumb detective doesnt call for backup when confronting the Villain, despite knowing what he is heading into.</li><li>No twist, no nothing. It is a story you would expect from start to finish.</li><li>[Spoiler[ The Villain's action during the start of the movie was questionable.. Why was he super confident in claiming he was the husband when he got to the hospital, when he didnt know yet that the girl lost her memory? Had she not lost her memory, he would have been caught in the hospital right there and then. Thats just.. weird.</li></ul><br><br>The good points:\n<ul><li>It kept me watching throughout the entire movie.. maybe because I was waiting for a twist that didnt come, but it still kept me watching.</li></ul>","user":"zlockke","rank":[224,252]},{"title":"You'll be sorry...","rating":1,"date":"21 July 2019","review":"It was my night to pick the movie, and 'Secret Obsession' popped up at the top of my Netflix account, so I thought rather than spending an hour sifting through the choices, I'd take Netflix's recommendation.<br><br>Throughout the movie my husband made several comments about how unrealistic the plot was, and I agreed, but for some reason we sat through it, thinking it would get better...<br><br>As the movie ended, my husband left the room to make a phone call. I didn't think much of it, but he was gone for quite some time. When he returned 30 minutes later, he was brandishing divorce papers he had printed out himself on our new hp printer. I didn't even know a person could procure divorce papers so quickly! I begged and pleaded with him to forgive me, but he said he couldn't be with anyone who would hurt him like that. A part of me knows that it's the truth. He deserves better. We all do.","user":"joleenbinder","rank":[214,244]}]
