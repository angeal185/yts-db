[{"title":"This turned out to be a dud","rating":4,"date":"11 May 2016","review":"One of the worse ghost stories that I have seen in recent years. I was not scared at all. <br><br>The filmmakers did a lackluster job with the film. It had a lot to it. A woman comes to Singapore to find out why her sister took her life and finds clues that something supernatural was involved. Not a hard story to follow, but then they added in this extra story about a group of priest looking into someone using computers to recreate the tower of Babel, The stories interconnected real badly and I could not tell you how the filmmakers drop the ball with what could have been a touch down.<br><br>It's not scary and it does not give me goosebumps or creeps me out. It falls too flat to be any worth watching.","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"I don't know where to start......","rating":1,"date":"12 February 2016","review":"I really don't know where to start......This shouldn't be called a movie at all. The acting is awful and the story is inconsistent and contains many discrepancies. The actors don't seem to fear anything, they keep seeing ghosts and they don't scream, run or even panic. The little girl in the movie doesn't even look like her parents (And no, she is not adopted), I mean, no one noticed that! Not even the cameraman!! The movie is not on a very low budget as you will see that the producers spent a couple of hundred dollars on some graphics for lousy ghosts and flying bodies. I wouldn't really recommend anyone to watch it, not even when you have nothing else to do. You will basically waste 2 hours of your life.","user":"The_Goldfinch","rank":[63,84]},{"title":"Literally Frustratingly Terrible","rating":1,"date":"27 July 2016","review":"I found myself imitating mystery science theater to keep myself full pulling out my hair and gouging out my eyes. The acting is purely Awful! The little girl thinks EVERY disturbance is her mom coming back, the word Mommy is used in this film more than anything else. The plot is terrible, had zero to do with Babel and the tower. Did I mention the offering is nothing? This is nothing more than a B exorcist movie with no plot and terrible acting, even the Asian Priest has miracle ability to hack cyber attacks..... Really? The Tower of Babel is pointless, there is NO offering, I literally would have been pleased had EVERYONE died in this movie. Save yourself the shame and don't watch this terrible film, it isn't even humorous in its terrible nature. If I had control I would delete this video from all things.","user":"papajay224","rank":[14,16]}]
