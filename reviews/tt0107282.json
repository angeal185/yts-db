[{"title":"Glorious Film making","rating":9,"date":"2 August 2003","review":"Every time I look back at movies through the years, I find myself wondering why The Joy Luck Club did not make a huge splash in the awards circle.  The film is one of the BEST FILMS of my lifetime.  It will always represent to me, the dream that is America.<br><br>I think it's because the emotions of the film are so universal, that I count it as one of my favorites. I am male, I am hispanic, I came to the United States when I was 13 years old.  I felt alienated, lonely and hopeless, could anyone really understand all that I wanted to do, all that I wanted to become.  How do you reconcile your cultural roots, with wanting to fit into the American Dream.<br><br>I try to watch The JOY LUCK CLUB as often as I try to read the book. Because it reminds me that we are all connected in so many ways. That our dreams and desires are not all together different. that Love reaches beyond race, beyond politics and beyond time.<br><br>when I saw this film I thought, The Academy of Arts and Sciences would gush over it.  But it never reached the kind of acclaim it truly deserved.  I think it's because most film makers field of personal experience limited in reaching and feeling.  Most of the Academy comes from back grounds that didn't see struggle, that doesn't see the world in unison, but in carefully separated categories. This to them was not a human experience film, it was a film for a minority group.  But, while The JOY LUCK CLUB is life affirming to some, to those who have lived the similarities, it is life changing.","user":"Ironboundfw","rank":[90,97]},{"title":"affecting","rating":9,"date":"26 May 2004","review":"It's surprising they managed to make a movie out of The Joy Luck Club, which was, after all, a series of anecdotes by 8 different people.  But somehow they did it, seamless weaving in and out of the characters' reminiscences. <br><br>\nJoy Luck Club could reasonably be described as a chick flick - it is, after all, a film about a bunch of women and their feelings - but that would be a disservice.  \"Chick flick\" has become a somewhat derogatory term, partially because it was a term created by guys who find women and their feelings annoying, but to a great extent because most movies in this class are shoddy pieces of tripe like \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.\"  If movies of women and their feelings were all this intelligent, insightful and affecting I doubt anyone would have even coined the term \"chick flick.\"  This is a movie of honest emotion that leaves you with a sense of fulfillment, a rebuke to all those manufactured, syrupy women's movies that Hollywood churns out.  Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended.","user":"cherold","rank":[35,37]},{"title":"Different strokes for different folks","rating":12,"date":"12 June 2003","review":"I have read the book and seen the movie.  I have also read reactions to both.  Some really liked it and found it to be very real, while others hate it and object to the \"stereotype.\"  It seems to depend on whether you could relate to the stories, characters, or themes.<br><br>I myself could relate very well to the stories, but that could be because I too have experienced the intergenerational and intercultural conflict as an American-born Chinese daughter with a very traditional Chinese mother. Many other American-born Chinese women who were born in the 1960s could relate to the stories very well also.  For us, we would start crying as soon as the first sentence is made.<br><br>I didn't experience everything that June, Rose, Lena, or Waverly went through, but on a grander scale, they are dealing with issues that I have struggled with as well.<br><br>I understand that there are other women who could relate to it as well, and these are not Chinese women--or even Asian women.  Perhaps Amy Tan has touched on universal themes that women of other nationalities could relate to.<br><br>On the other hand, I have found that some people who are ten years younger than me didn't like the book/movie too much and found the characters \"stereotypical\" or \"unrealistic.\"<br><br>Some Caucasian males didn't like this book/movie either, and again it comes back to them not being able to relate to it.<br><br>I understand another user's comment about the negative portrayal of Asian men, but this person has forgotten about June's father who was portrayed as a very likeable man who was trying to bridge the gap between his wife and his daughter.  As for his objection of the daughters marrying Caucasian wives, he needs to realize that there are other issues/reasons involved and it's not because Chinese-American women like them \"hate Chinese men.\"<br><br>In short, this movie is very good at portraying the intergenerational and/or intercultural conflict between people who are caught between two cultures. Women like me have cried while watching this movie because the issues have been very real for us.  For those who could not relate to it or cannot see the \"reality\" of it, then this movie would not be for them.","user":"lschow310","rank":[49,54]}]
