[{"title":"A nice action thriller movie","rating":9,"date":"16 February 2018","review":"Jawaan is a very good action thriller. Sai Dharam tej gave a comeback after 3 failures. Although the movie got negative reviews this movie is a must watch. It is a different concept about protecting country's pride by saving a unique and expensive missile. Very well directed and enacted by all the actors in the movie. Everyone did justice to their own role and did their role according to the movie. Plz, I encourage you to watch this movie.","user":"kotasairahul","rank":[3,9]},{"title":"Has flaws, but is an interesting, intense action thriller.","rating":8,"date":"5 June 2019","review":"Action thrillers are the best when least disrupted by badly placed songs and subplots. Jawaan suffers from these two things quite badly but the plot and action sequences are so impressively crafted that it becomes an interesting watch.<br><br>One of the biggest mistakes is the inclusion of the heroine's character in the film when she practically has nothing to do with the main story other than slowing down the pace and killing the intensity. Songs are randomly placed and totally unwanted. Other than that, we have an intense action thriller with plenty of cool action and well-written characters. Sai Dharam Tej and Prasanna have done an excellent job and the execution of several confrontations between them is top notch. VFX, while mostly fine, is weak in the final moments.<br><br>If you have problem with enduring the songs and subplots in a tightly written action thriller, I'd suggest you to watch the Hindi version that at least does away with the songs.","user":"Prashast_Singh","rank":[0,2]}]
