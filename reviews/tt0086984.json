[{"title":"a great movie, misunderstood by most","rating":10,"date":"7 December 2003","review":"possible spoilers<br><br>I'm pretty sure that Body Double is one of the most misunderstood movies of all time. Many people call it a tribute to Hitchcock, other people call it a rip-off of Hitchcock, some people think it's a parody.... I think it's more than any of those things, I think it's an analysis. A humorous, insightful essay on Hitchcock... Kind of like something Godard might do, which isn't surprising when you realize that Godard is also a big influence on De Palma. <br><br>The distancing techniques employed in the film, the way he hams it up, the scenes where the internal logic breaks down in obvious ways, like the kissing scene near the tunnel, where the movie suddenly reenacts the famous hotel kiss from the second half of vertigo, at a very unexpected time with almost no set up to make the scene believable... All these things are intentional, designed to let the audience in on the fact that this is not just a straight forward movie (although it can be enjoyed that way). De Palma wants the audience to have some separation from the story so that they can look at the movie in a more critical way, and think about Hitchcock's movies from a different perspective. These distancing techniques also allow de Palma to get away with some pretty harsh/sleazy scenes, and that was necessary because the analysis wouldn't have worked any other way.<br><br>\nThis is basically De Palma saying, \"what if Vertigo and Rear Window had a baby, but the baby was born in the 80's and raised by a prostitute and a murderous pimp.\" The result is a fascinating movie that stands up very well, as long as you understand the intentions. If you take it the right way, it's one of De Palma's very best movies.<br><br>As a big fan of vertigo and rear window (vertigo is my favorite movie of all time), it was fascinating to me, to see De Palma, rework those story's, twine them together, and put them in a different context. I really enjoyed it both times I've watched it, and I'm pretty sure it's one of those movies that will just keep getting better with repeated viewing.","user":"Undead_Master","rank":[63,78]},{"title":"De Palma in his Hitchcock Phase","rating":25,"date":"25 June 2002","review":"Sort of a cross between \"Rear Window\" and \"Vertigo\" but instead of James Stewart we get Craig Wasson as a struggling actor mixed in with  some sly jokes at the film studios, actors, and adult films. Visually very stylish with hypnotic score.  Bizarre music video sequence is well done to the tune of \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  If you can look past the plot holes, it's an entertaining over-the-top effort from De Palma.","user":"GizmoMkI","rank":[43,55]},{"title":"Much better than expected","rating":8,"date":"3 April 2002","review":"I admit when I rented this movie, I did so just to get some cheap thrills. I was aware of the negative reviews from uptight critics who dismissed it as sleaze, and to be honest, that's what I was in the mood for. Besides, my curiosity was aroused. (No cheap jokes, please!)<br><br>To my surprise, this is actually a compelling, well-crafted thriller. Let me take it a step further. It's an improvement over DePalma's effective but overpraised \"Dressed to Kill.\" \"Body Double\" is actually better-constructed and better-paced. Perhaps the extremes of the film's content turned off some members of the critical community. And keep in mind that many of these people loved Dressed.<br><br>However, if you can stomach some of the content (it would certainly warrant an NC-17 in today's climate), there's much to like here. DePalma's approach might be manipulative, but when he does so this effectively, it's hard to complain. Technically, it's a marvel of film technique. Wasson's claustrophobic attacks are effectively conveyed to the viewer. When they hit him, they hit us just as hard. The very ending, which I wouldn't dream of giving away, is a work of pure genius. The infamous drill murder is a terrific setpiece.<br><br>One aspect that interested me was its attitude towards porno. So-called \"dirty movies\" are not condemned, but treated as simply being another side of the film industry. It's not considered right or wrong; it's just there. Such a nonjudgmental outlook is refreshing after hearing the tiresome rants of self-appointed \"moral watchdogs.\" Likewise, there is a loving tribute to B-movies during the opening and closing credits.<br><br>\"Body Double\" isn't good art by any means, but it's good trash. Watch it, and you will behold DePalma at his sleazy best. He makes no apologies for what he does, nor would we want him to do so.<br><br>***1/2 (out of ****)<br><br>Released by Columbia Pictures","user":"shaun98","rank":[46,61]}]
