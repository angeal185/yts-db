[{"title":"The human inhumanity","rating":30,"date":"30 July 2013","review":"Let's go to the theme park to see the Orcas. Playful, interacting with their trainers who swim with them carefree it is a guaranteed spectacle and fun time.<br><br>Do we ever consider, that these intelligent creatures spent a lifetime enclosed in a large bathtub so that we can be entertained? Imagine going to see a show of children ballerinas knowing that those children spent their entire lives locked up in a room when not performing. Would anyone stand for this? Surely not, I would hope.<br><br>This riveting and didactic documentary explores the owner's attitudes when occasionally those animals flip out and act in an aggressive way. It is always the trainers fault, or the bad manners of the animals. In fact, it appears that those who run those theme parks have gone out of their way to hide the truth which is those who work with killer whales are in great risk.<br><br>The death of a long-time and renowned trainer brought the issue to the surface where enquiries had to be made.<br><br>We might be better informed about the risks involved but the rather lax legislature regarding animal rights allows these companies to still operate and oppress animals in an inhuman way.<br><br>Well made and runs high on emotion, it will make the viewer contemplate on the scale of human tyrannism.","user":"cinematic_aficionado","rank":[130,143]},{"title":"Hearing a harsh critique of SeaWorld only seems right coming from the people it meant the most to.","rating":10,"date":"20 July 2013","review":"Without a doubt Blackfish is one of the most horrific theatre experiences you'll have this year. Director Gabriela Cowperthwaite presents a very carefully constructed case on the effects of inhumane treatment of Orcas in captivity. The one-sided argument is that the untimely human deaths caused by captive Orcas were not their fault but rather the fault of their captors; SeaWorld, and the evidence proving this point is so disturbing and so shockingly obvious that it's no wonder SeaWorld refused to be interviewed.<br><br>The story centers on Tilikum, a 12,000 lbs. Orca that is directly responsible for the death of 3 people, including Dawn Brancheau the former senior trainer at SeaWorld in Orlando. The film explores the reasoning behind the likely \"psychosis\" Tilikum has experienced in captivity, and the disgusting cover up executives have tried to make.<br><br>While SeaWorld naturally refused to be interviewed, the films perspective mostly derives from former trainers/employees of SeaWorld and other various experts. Their experience working with Orcas - most having dedicated their lives to it - is truly heart breaking. Presenting the theory, the evidence and finally a solution to the topic at hand, Blackfish is a marvellous story that will have you as tearful as the trainers that sincerely care for the well being of the creatures.<br><br>Blackfish doesn't just show a bunch of disgruntled former employees bashing SeaWorld either. The greatest technique employed in this film is its use of footage from shows featuring these trainers when they were younger. There's something so mesmerizing about watching the smiling young trainers play with their best friend while hearing their older self reminisce in voice over. Hearing a harsh critique of SeaWorld only seems right coming from the people it meant the most to.<br><br>While we've always known Orca's are intelligent creatures Cowperthwaite dedicates a lot of the film to demonstrating their capacity for emotions as well; watching them over time build connections with their trainers and each other. So by the time they show us their capture and captivity and witness the pain felt the whales, Tilikum especially, we know that their violent behavior is a direct result of SeaWorld. Killer Whales having never harmed a human in the wild.<br><br>I want to go through every point made by the movie but I won't. You need to see this for yourselves. The facts aren't what drive this film, the emotion behind them do. This is one of those movies you just won't stop talking about, and for the subject matter that's the best compliment it can receive. In the end sharing this information is what's going to help these Orcas.<br><br>Between the gripping footage and the distressing stories Blackfish effectively proves its point. There are very few movies like this; a must-see. There is no way after seeing this movie that you'll ever want to go to SeaWorld again, and for the sake of the animals that's the only thing we can do for them. Since it's made quite clear; the only thing affecting their decision-making is: how many Shamu dolls and tickets they've sold.<br><br>Our Rating:10/10<br><br>Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of Blackfish!","user":"thejoshl","rank":[199,223]},{"title":"On how humans should (and should not) encounter orca whales","rating":9,"date":"28 July 2013","review":"First, that's a great documentary: it beautifully combines Herzog's \"Grizzly Man\" thrilling, escalating tension of how things go wrong when humans misinterpret their relation with nature with Achbar &amp; Abbott's \"The Corporation\" sharp examination of modern-day companies.<br><br>Second, it is aesthetically captivating and pleasant to follow. Cowperthwaite's reconstructs the narrative leading to the final, and fatal, encounter of Tilikum and Dawn Brancheau, alternating footage, both in the wild and in aquariums, with interviews and contextual data. <br><br>Finally, it is a work that, without ever abandoning neutrality, serves a mostly noble cause: that against the confinement of animals that are intelligent, social, and set to crisscross oceans, not to be kept in tanks.<br><br>My hope is that, by being such a fine piece of art, it also helps change the industry of marine-life entertainment theme parks.<br><br>So \"Blackfish\" is a big splash in more than one way! Go watch it.","user":"imdb-694-11888","rank":[61,68]}]
