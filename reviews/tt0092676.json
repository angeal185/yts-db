[{"title":"Enjoyably ridiculous.","rating":6,"date":"22 August 2012","review":"Horror fans who delight in the cheesy and the silly may find a fair bit to appreciate with Norman J. Warrens' \"Bloody New Year\". Don't go into it expecting anything resembling a coherent plot, but be prepared for a lot of insane nonsense.<br><br>The story has three young couples up to a whole bunch of tomfoolery at a carnival who afterwards find themselves shipwrecked on an island. This island features a hotel that not only is celebrating Christmas in July, it's celebrating Christmas circa 1959, and is eagerly anticipating 1960.<br><br>Among the assorted crackpot ideas Warren and screenwriter Frazer Pearce throw at the wall are snow indoors, invisible pursuers, a furiously moving camera seemingly inspired by \"The Force\" from \"The Evil Dead\", a \"table monster\", and lots of hilariously, endearingly tacky special effects. The good thing is that Warren and Pearce do seem to be just having fun with the genre because this whole production has a heavy tongue in cheek feel. Now, some people may find this simply *too* cheesy and *too* silly, but others should find themselves smiling if not laughing outright.<br><br>The first 15 minutes quickly establish the irreverent tone, and the filmmakers do achieve and maintain a certain loopy charm and a \"Just what the hell is going on?\" sensibility. The actors do an impressive job of keeping poker faces throughout, and they're all reasonably appealing, although there will undoubtedly be viewers who will get sick of all the screaming that Janet (Nikki Brooks) does. One of the best routines involves some appearing and disappearing sets of footprints.<br><br>These 90 minutes of off-the-wall antics don't quite fly by, but enough amusing stuff happens to help people pay attention. The music, by Nick Magnus and a duo dubbed \"Cry No More\", merely adds to the appeal. All things considered, this is an interesting effort among Warrens' filmography.<br><br>Six out of 10.","user":"Hey_Sweden","rank":[13,13]},{"title":"Take a ride on Norman's ghost train","rating":27,"date":"27 March 2002","review":"If \"Terror\" was Norman J Warren's take on \"Suspiria\", then \"Bloody New Year\" is surely his version of \"The Beyond\".  After a slow start, it changes from a British teens at the seaside affair, all big dippers and frustrated love triangles, to a delirious zombie movie - \"Quadrophenia\" crossed with Lucio Fulci.  <br><br>Considering the extremely low-budget, this is a creditable piece of filmmaking, with Warren achieving some neat shock effects.  The young and unknown cast acquit themselves reasonably and there is some groovy organ music to spice up the final reel mayhem.  The unexpected arrival of the fairground yobs adds to the fun.<br><br>I do have two questions though!  Norman is such a nice man so why does he go in for ultra-downbeat endings?  And is there really a time-warp island,complete with drooling zombies, living lifts and ambulatory fishing nets,within sailing distance of Barry Island Funfair?  Has the local Tourist Information Centre been informed? (Wait a minute, that's three questions).","user":"heedarmy","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"Bloody New Year=A Bloody Good Time","rating":6,"date":"25 January 2005","review":"I have wanted to see this film for a long time based on its very cool original VHS cover art and I finally rented the recently released DVD to see it. I had assumed long ago it was a typical slasher set on new year's eve, but before I had rented it I had read little blurbs about something to do with time travel or something supernatural, and was a bit turned off by this. Well, it turned out that the film isn't a slasher at all and really it can not be neatly categorized as belonging to any one horror subgenre. I really liked this movie and am disappointed to see such unfavorable comments about it. Yes, its cheap, and cheesy and lame in some parts, and the acting and realism and logic is far from stellar, and yes it borrows somewhat from famous movies such as the Evil Dead movies and the A Nightmare On Elm Street series, but all that withstanding the film is very entertaining and has a great deal of originality to it. Many of its effects are quite impressive and creative and although things are a bit slow to start early on, once things start happening, the pace and frequency with which weird stuff happens is relentless! I think many non-horror fans would find this amusing because to them it would probably be a complete joke, and I highly recommend this movie to all horror fans who can look past low budgets, poor acting, and faulty logic, and still enjoy a very well written and photographed, extremely unique movie.","user":"UltimateDarkness","rank":[8,11]}]
