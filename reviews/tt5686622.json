[{"title":"Had potential to be great but sadly it fails","rating":4,"date":"28 February 2018","review":"I like the concept and idea of the film as it is something fresh on a lackluster social media internet crazed genre.<br><br>This had the making to be a stand out film if it had backing and with that backing a bigger budget and more in-depth script, selfie from hell suffers from a rushed story. As said before I liked the idea of this film but what we got was not great with sound effects that came from the cutting room floor of insidious to the film only running for just over an hour. <br><br>Selfie from hell had the potential to be great but with a tight budget and a rushed story and script it falls flat on its face which I'm disappointed in as was hoping for much better.","user":"wycherleyp-960-470658","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Poor effort 2/10","rating":2,"date":"9 September 2018","review":"Ok the acting was good except for the sister character, and cinematography solid enough.<br><br>But... oh no, no other redeeming features. Lots of silly jump scares and a real paint by numbers approach to horror. Oh let's go on the dark web, and I'll talk to myself as I'm on google so the audience knows what's going on. It was like copy-paste from lots of better films with no heart or originality. This social media horror genre is one I'll be avoiding, too many turkeys.","user":"alicepetit","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Ultimately disappointing, despite some good ideas.","rating":4,"date":"27 August 2018","review":"I was intrigued by this film, and having watched the short story a few years ago I was intrigued to see how they'd expand on the story. The ideas are great, the idea of punishing those that constantly take selfies is I'm sure a secret pleasure of the writer. This new fascination in films with exploring the dark web continues here, with a bit of a twist. The acting is good, the music is good, despite all those positive elements the film is ultimately flat, the scares are a little on the childish side, the pacing is all over the place, it doesn't really give anything new, but worst of all is the ending, which is simply terrible.<br><br>A few nice ideas, but the execution is poor. 4/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[8,8]}]
