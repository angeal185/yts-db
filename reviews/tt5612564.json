[{"title":"Walk in my shoes","rating":7,"date":"19 October 2017","review":"Struggling artists and broken down characters ... it will not be easy to completely sympathize with the main character (one of them that is) and it has not so much to do with the profession she \"chose\" for herself, but rather the way she aims to reach her goals. But then again, if you don't have a flawed protagonist, where would the friction be? In this case, we get an added bonus of a different path ... The main actress has quite some baggage to carry.<br><br>Strong female characters (with as mentioned before flaws, but nevertheless) are not that common in film, so it is refreshing to see this. And while the script may feel unfocused at points, the story is so weird and out there ... no pun intended. But it does make up for it for sure. If you like slow pacing drama, with small Science Fiction and social issues fragments woven into it ... this is for you","user":"kosmasp","rank":[21,34]},{"title":"Utterly Ridiculous","rating":1,"date":"19 January 2019","review":"I'm all for female directed sci-fi but I'd like for it to also make sense. The story was dull and unoriginal and the acting was stiff and unbelievable.","user":"the_nephilim71","rank":[11,17]},{"title":"Daft rip-off of Under the Skin","rating":2,"date":"25 August 2018","review":"Boring, pretentious, and banal picture made by an untalented group. Nothing of this production has any merit or quality. The narrative (there is no story) is poorly constructed and offers nothing of interest. Seems to me that someone watched Under the Skin and thought they could do better - they thought wrong. Nothing happens!","user":"William_Henry_Pratt","rank":[19,33]}]
