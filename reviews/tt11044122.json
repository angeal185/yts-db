[{"title":"A love letter to the fans","rating":10,"date":"27 November 2019","review":"This documentary by the producers of \"Honest Trailers\" is a heartfelt tribute to one of the most perfect films ever made. It was made by fans, for fans, and that's exactly what Galaxy Quest is all about. While I re-watch the original movie on a regular basis, this film made me want to watch it all over again. I did not mind at all paying a premium at the theater to see it, and I hope it wider exposure so that many other fans can enjoy it. My hat is off to the producers for a wonderful trip down memory lane.","user":"ccdesan","rank":[21,22]},{"title":"A good documentary, crap sound mixing","rating":8,"date":"10 January 2020","review":"I did enjoy watching this documentary, I LOVE Galaxy Quest, and this was a good trip behind the scenes. But, as others have said, the sound mixing is abysmal. The background music is considerably louder than the interviews and it's very annoying. Someone needs to remix this. Otherwise, it's honestly very interesting and entertaining.","user":"wildcard8788-48-275440","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Brilliant documentary bought down by a piss poor music track","rating":8,"date":"18 December 2019","review":"10/10 for content, 5/10 for audio mixing.\nThe only thing that spoiled it was the sound mixing ... for about 1/4 of the interview and commentary scenes the music was about TWO OR THREE TIMES LOUDER than it should have been, and was so bad at times you could hardly hear what the person they were interviewing was saying. (An excellent example of this was the interview with the female fan outside the cinema at ~1h20m mark where you almost need to lip read to figure out what she's saying.)<br><br>They really need to re-edit this with the MUSIC SCORE reduced to ~40% of its current volume in EVERY scene where people are talking.","user":"crashman_123","rank":[16,20]}]
