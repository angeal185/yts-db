[{"title":"\"Love Me Tender\" brought to the movies one of the most popular entertainers of all time, Mr. Rock 'N' Roll himself, Elvis Presley","rating":7,"date":"7 April 2007","review":"Why 20th Century Fox felt that starring him in a Western would be successful is merely academic When Elvis broke into gyrations and song, audiences were electrified <br><br>The storyfilmed in black-and-white CinemaScope was about a bunch of Confederate soldiers who stole a Union Army payroll and then discover that, just five days ago, Lee had surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, ending the Civil War <br><br>Hiding the money, The Reno brothers (Richard Egan, William Campbell, and James Drury) decide to use it for themselves, and return home to the family farm and their kid brother Clint <br><br>Presley was cast as a Texas farm boy who marries his cavalry-man brother's sweetheart when news of his brother's death filters through But the brotherplayed by Richard Egan isn't dead at all and incurs Presley's jealousy by resuming his friendship with his former sweetheart the beautiful Cathy Reno (Debra Paget) The situation went from bad to worse <br><br>In his first motion picture, Elvis proved to be a rugged fighting man, a wonderful loving man and a terrific singing man Hear him sing: \"Let Me,\" \"We're Gonna Move,\" \"Poor Boy,\" and \"Love Me Tender.\"","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[27,28]},{"title":"Solid movie with excellent introspective performances.","rating":21,"date":"21 February 2004","review":"The fanfare of a young Elvis Presley and his first movie certainly was blinding when it came to this movie. It was hard for people to see past it, however, upon viewing the picture, Presley's star dims as he takes his seat at the table among some of the acting greats of cinema. The viewer relinquishes the idea that it's Elvis and accepts him as the doting youngest son of the Reno family.<br><br>Dramatic without being maudlin, the picture chronicles the lives of one family post-Civil War, and how each member dealt with the harsh realities of war. Hearing that the eldest son Vance (Egan) has died, Clint (Presley) and Vance's former love (Paget) marry in the aftermath of the murder of her parents and the Reno boys father. As is in wartime, things become increasingly more difficult when he and his two other brothers Brett (Campbell) and Ray (Drury) to find this, as well the spoils of war haunting them shortly upon their return.<br><br>It's an honest look at a difficult time in this country, with great performances all around -- from the handsome, impressive lead Richard Egan on down the cast. Egan's portrayal of Vance Reno is an amazing performance -- restrained without being stolid, much as men were during the time. Egan gives glimpses into the inner turmoil that sits just below the characters surface, making the character heartbreakingly sympathetic and admirable.<br><br>It's Elvis Presley's best performance and (dare I say only worthwhile) role and film. Upon reflection, his co-stars helped to elevate him into something more than what followed (with films) and Presley really seems to have taken this one seriously. Regardless of whether you're a Presley fan or not, the understated performances, simple but effective storyline and message, and moving conclusion make this a must see.","user":"Eireann","rank":[33,38]},{"title":"Not just another Elvis movie","rating":10,"date":"8 October 2006","review":"This was a critically acclaimed introductory role for Elvis. This was not one of the more cheesy moneymakers that Col. Tom Parker stuck him with for the remainder of his career (Girl Happy or Blue Hawaii for instance).<br><br>Elvis showed great depth as an actor in his role as Clint Reno and also showed the potential to broaden his career from the premier musical superstar of our time into one of the crossover megastars that we see commonly today.<br><br>His music is an integral part of the movie but it isn't put on display the way his future movies do. When you watch this film, try to remember he hadn't done any of those 90-minute rock-n-roll videos with the likes of Ann-Margaret and Nancy Sinatra.<br><br>LOVE ME TENDER is worth viewing if the viewer is willing to set aside their preconceived expectations of \"just another Elvis movie.\"","user":"tbill1963","rank":[21,24]}]
