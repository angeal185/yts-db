[{"title":"Well worth watching","rating":8,"date":"29 April 2017","review":"I don't know what the budget for this film was but I doubt that it was huge. Even so this is an excellent film about men and war and the aftermath of their actions. Although there is a some conventional war film action this is generally a well-paced, slow moving film which might not appeal to viewers hoping for non-stop action.The characters are well drawn and the acting is first rate. Hoult, in particular, is excellent but Cavill, as well, is fine. There is a little of the usual American gung-ho moments but these are timed and acted well so they help to define the characters rather than simplify them. It's not a preachy film about rights and wrongs and the Iraqis are, the limited fight scenes aside, portrayed as people under duress attempting to continue their lives as best they can. Overall a very good, thoughtful film.","user":"morgan-659-312842","rank":[52,54]},{"title":"A simple but effective plot","rating":23,"date":"23 August 2017","review":"This film tells the story of a young soldier in Kuwait, who is reluctantly being sent to Iraq to help fix the water supply system in a village. However, their help is not welcomed by the village, and they are mey with multiple hostile attacks.<br><br>\"Sand Castle\" has a simple but effective plot, where the soldiers have to do everything in their power to fix the water supply that got broken in the war. A seemingly simple task becomes very complicated when the locals are actively resisting and even sabotaging the operation. It can be plainly seen that, what seems to be a good will mission from one side is interpreted as an unwelcomed act by the other side. I think this unwelcomed good will mission can be extrapolated to the whole war, and this particular mission is a microcosm of the whole Iraq war. It leaves soldiers wounded physically and psychologically, especially when soldiers think they are doing good.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"Tale of an anti climactic mission during the Invasion of Iraq....","rating":7,"date":"21 April 2017","review":"Sand Castle is not an easy film to review in terms of gauging it against other high adrenaline, fast paced, action filled war movies. <br><br>That is not to say the film was not worth watching. It certainly is. Avoiding any spoilers here, the story moves at a rather slow pace for a war film but has a definite message to deliver and does so with finesse and realism. The acting is very strong from each of the characters and the Direction does not overdo the story by muddling it with unnecessary and gratuitous violence. Of course there is a degree of \"war time\" conflicts and shows its affects on the soldiers who live with it during their tour.<br><br>To add to the credibility of the film, the writer (an actual veteran of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq) simply conveys his experience while serving there. I liked this approach to the Genra as it tells a story of a simple objective which becomes difficult due to the nature of war itself and the unfortunate casualties that suffer because of it. It also shows the human cost to both sides, the U.S. Troops as well as the people caught up in the terrible circumstances of war. I felt it illustrates that perspective quite well.<br><br>If you looking for a \"Platoon\" or \"Black Hawk Down\" type film, this is not for you. But, if you are interested in a film that successfully portrays the life's of all people affected by war, even if the story line does not center on the most brutal and violent ways, this is a film worth watching.","user":"stephenw-30180","rank":[72,81]}]
