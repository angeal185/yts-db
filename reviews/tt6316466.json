Not worth your money, time or brain cells.","user":"gshep-60155","rank":[14,14]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"13 February 2020","review":"As someone who is dating a trans partner and identifies as nb, this movie was horrible. It represents heavily towards terf mentality and plays off the idea conservatives have about the who bathroom fiasco, when the big issue is predatory men.","user":"adriwillsims","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"A really bigoted movie","rating":1,"date":"1 January 2020","review":"It's just transphobic and homophobic on so many levels.<br><br>Lesbians date women. They do not date transgender men, as they are men. Lesbians do not date men. Lesbians do not get \"cured\" of being gay by straight men. A cisgender man wouldn't need to pretend to be a transgender man to date a woman, because she's already dating men.<br><br>Avoid this awful movie.","user":"sashaafox-82686","rank":[51,64]}]
