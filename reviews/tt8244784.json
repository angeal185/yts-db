[{"title":"True to the adage: 100% of Americans think 50% of Americans have lost their minds.","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2020","review":"Much more enjoyable than expected.<br><br>The beginning of it is funny enough, but it is the ensuing few scenes which are riotously HILARIOUS and make it worth watching- I literally laughed until I cried.<br><br>Toward the middle of the film, there is a wide gap where the laugh-out-loud moments are slowed and further and further apart, but still bring a smile or giggle here and there. The ending while good, is overshadowed by a preceding fight scene that is one for the books. It was really, really well done.<br><br>The best part of the entire movie though, and what makes it stand out, is that if a person watching has more than two brain cells, the dialogue is spot-on close-to-perfect in mocking BOTH SIDES of the political divide. And here, is what I think people are missing: NEITHER side is depicted as being 'better' than the other. Or worse. It has fun at the expense of everyone and it doesn't do it in any overtly mean way, but in a way where we can nod and nod and nod and laugh ... at ourselves ... no matter who we are or where we stand.<br><br>Lastly, a horror film - it is not. Somewhat gory, yes. A \"horror\" film? no.<br><br>7.6/10","user":"Her-Excellency","rank":[239,297]},{"title":"Simply hilarious.","rating":9,"date":"23 March 2020","review":"I'm not sure all the people that gave bad reviews even seen this movie or they are just plain miserable. Some have just read too much into it. It's a fun dark humoured movie with a bit of gore that doesn't take itself seriously. You moaners need to get a life and not realise that not every movie has to be analised to see if its black/white or red/blue or rainbow. Enjoy it for what it is. FUN. If not then watch The Waltons on a loop.","user":"johnjkelly-36119","rank":[151,213]},{"title":"The message...stop trying to find a message in everything!","rating":6,"date":"20 March 2020","review":"This movie was written to basically call everyone an idiot if they base their whole lives around politically based ideological garbage. It's saying that regardless of being far right or far left you're still basically the same breed of moron and that it's the people living in the middle, who are actually trudging away just living our lives, are the actual badasses. Well not me specifically, but the general \"we\". The people who ignore the extremes of politics and just get things done. This movie portrays that in the least subtle way possible and I thought it was pretty hilarious.<br><br>There is almost no plot to this movie, which I'm sure will turn people off, but that's honestly what I liked about it because as commentary it speaks to political discourse that we see every day. It's all crap on both sides. Just buzz words and stupid conspiracy theories with both sides trying to paint each other into a box with very specific ideologies. Then we have the protagonist, a woman we know nothing about, nothing is ever explained about her, and she just takes over everything. It's all a very hamfisted analogy for modern society but I thought it was hilarious.<br><br>The plot is dumb, the characters are disposable, you never know what's going to happen next, everyone is insulted by the end, and Betty Gilpin does a hilarious job of just being bizarre. She also shows off some of her skills she's developed from starring on GLOW and her body is crazy tight in this. This is overall just a silly, ridiculous, popcorn flick with gratuitous violence...which is exactly what we need in an overly charged political era. It's a 6 because it's no masterpiece or anything, but it's plenty enjoyable.","user":"terrencepatrix","rank":[146,236]}]
