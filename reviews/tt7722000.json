[{"title":"Very Problematic","rating":2,"date":"16 March 2018","review":"This is nothing more than the cynical attempt of a D-list actress to profit from various social issues. If it wasn't a one person show I would take it seriously, and might even believe that the intentions behind it were sincere, but as it is I think this was done to bolster Anna Deavere Smith's brand rather than out of a genuine desire to affect a positive change, or to bring awareness to issues.There are SO MANY talented artists who could have made a meaningful contribution through this as well, that it honestly reeks of narcissistic self-indulgence on the part of Smith to perform it solo.","user":"Kaptain_Bluddflagg","rank":[11,28]},{"title":"Flawless","rating":10,"date":"7 March 2018","review":"Thank God for Anna Deavere Smith. Her work should be seen by everyone everywhere. From my lips to God's ears, amen.","user":"mssusanmarie","rank":[7,20]},{"title":"If you want respect, show respect","rating":2,"date":"17 February 2020","review":"I was disturbed by the use of the term \"paddy wagon\" throughout the film, particularly in the recounting of Freddie Gray's ordeal. This term is very derogatory to people of Irish descent and should not be used EVER. I think the actor thought it meant the police vehicle was \"padded.\" A very ignorant assumption. Do your homework and show some respect for other cultures!","user":"joelmc-88670","rank":[0,0]}]
