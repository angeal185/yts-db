[{"title":"Great movie","rating":9,"date":"11 June 2019","review":"Hughes bro's are not trying to alter people's views on religion or any thing else.\nThey simply made a great watchable apocalyptic movie with marvelous actors and credible story. Relax and give it the credit it deserves.","user":"monobloc","rank":[56,64]},{"title":"Really... You call this propaganda?","rating":10,"date":"24 June 2018","review":"This is by no way a bad movie, yes the plot is pretty simple and lacking depth. Notice all the 1 star rating people are just hating because it has something to do with the Bible lol. The acting is very well done. The visuals are also very nice. It's funny the world we live in where almost 90 percent of the one 1 star ratings are just because they can't get over the fact this movie has something to do with God and a Bible. This movie by no way forces any believes on the viewer.","user":"roycethat","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"Denzel Washington Is Strong In This Post-Apocalyptic Tale","rating":8,"date":"27 September 2015","review":"Thirty years after a man-made apocalypse, Eli (Denzel Washington) hikes westward on a quest across the vast American interior--a dark and dusty scape. He encounters a number of people who survive at the expense of others. In a small town, he is captured by a local despot named Carnegie (Gary Oldman) who makes him an offer. Being a loner, Eli prefers to go his own way, but he may not have a choice.<br><br>\"The Book of Eli\" is a stylish film that is reminiscent of \"I Am Legend\" and other post-apocalyptic stories, though it carves out a niche for itself due to its strong characters and its central theme.<br><br>The film presents some religious sub-themes, which might find differing interpretations by different viewers. <br><br>I found the ending a little disappointing, but I think others may enjoy the twists in the final scenes. Mila Kunis plays a strong character--a young woman whose life undergoes a transition under the influence of Eli.","user":"atlasmb","rank":[10,11]}]
