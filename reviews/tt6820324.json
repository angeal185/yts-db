[{"title":"Fantastically imaginative, creative and quirky kid detective adventure!","rating":9,"date":"9 February 2020","review":"Watched this with my kids (8 &amp; 10) and we loved it. Between the great casting and acting from everyone (especially Flo) to the main character's (Timmy Failure's) hard boiled and dry delivery of almost every line, this movie is spot on. Settle in for a fun detective adventure that weaves the quirkiness of Portland with the absurdities of an unsupervised, intelligent kid's imagination as he tries to solve his next case involving the class hamster, the \"Russians\", and a Segway.","user":"markcaron-82524","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"Boring!","rating":4,"date":"14 March 2020","review":"Was looking forward to watching this with my girls 8 and 5. They lost interest and I lost interest not long after. This movie was so boring can't believe Disney came up with it.","user":"jasemoore74","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Who is this even aimed at??","rating":2,"date":"27 February 2020","review":"I usually enjoy most Disney movies, even as an adult, but I really disliked this movie. I don't think the main character is a very good example for children, and for adults, the character development I was expecting isn't there (a lot more could have been done given the scenario), so you will basically waste an hour and a half waiting for something to happen to make the movie a bit more worthwhile and be very disappointed in the end.","user":"astephanie-chamberlain","rank":[5,7]}]
