[{"title":"A sadly overlooked gem","rating":3,"date":"3 July 2001","review":"One can only be thankful that Disney did not get hold of Richard Hughes' novel.  The saccharine sweetness would have made one gag.  The only disappointment that I had with the film was that it did not follow the book. Otherwise, this was a superb film in its own right.  Anthony Quinn proved that he could play other characters than Zorba, an often overlooked fact.<br><br>\nThe children were so prim and Victorian \"proper\" that their conflict with the pirates. or privateers, as they preferred to call themselves, was at time hilarious.  My favorite scenes were when the children, who were on the ship for months without any means of amusing themselves other than their own devices, spooked the crew with various innocent or mischievous plays, such as pretending to do a burial at sea, and turning around the head of the ships figurehead so that it faced backwards.  The superstitious sailors were terrified by what was really childish mischievous fun.<br><br>\nWhen the ship put into Tampico, where the Captain hoped to leave them behined with the local Madame, played by Lila Kedrova who seemed to have taken acting lessons from Carmen Miranda, the children were spruced up and returned to their clean clothes and with their hair combed.  As the crew member doing the grooming explained: \"the Captain wants you to look your best for the ladies\".  \"What ladies?\" asked the children.  Under his breath the seaman muttered \"You'll find out.\"  Of course, the local ladies were the ladies of ill repute in a Godforsaken part of the Carribean where anything goes and the law would never set foot.<br><br>The beauty of the film is that it rises above the mawkish semtimentally that it could have fallen into.  The Captain, Chavez, takes to the young girl, Emily, who is as feisty as they come, and she and the other children take to him.  A Victorian version of the Stockholm syndrome where the captives idenity with their captors.<br><br>The story is a tragedy, as the pirates who after all, were simply making a living in the only way they knew. It wasn't even a profitable living, just a traditional, but dying, occupation.  Suddenly they were stuck with some ill-disciplined little English children travelling to England to be paced in English boarding schools and \"civilised\",  and neither side really understood the other.  It was the misunderstanding that caused the problems and led to the final tragedy.<br><br>I would recommend this film to people who like to think and ponder over what is right and what is wrong, and from what perspective do we view right and wrong.","user":"eunicem","rank":[37,41]},{"title":"A great adventure film with a strong cast and a surprise ending.","rating":25,"date":"25 June 1999","review":"Having read the book in 1965, I took my (then) 3 young daughters to see the film.  They were so stirred and charmed that they made me sit through a second screening.  Anthony Quinn and James Coburn were brilliant, lovable rogues and the main little girl was someone my kids could identify with. Gert Frobe as the Dutch sea captain was memorable, and the English cast, director Alexander Mackendrick and the screenwriter(s) should be commended for creating a superb example of the art of cinema.  I have but one sad comment: Why isn't this film available on videotape or disk, or at least on cable?","user":"Phil-221","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Definitely worth watching.","rating":9,"date":"31 August 2004","review":"I had never even heard of this movie before. Probably wouldn't have watched it...but it was on AMC tonight and nothing else was on. I'm glad I didn't miss this one; this movie is very close to what \"real\" pirates, corsairs and privateers were like in their waning days. Of course there is a bit of artistic license, but the makeup of the crew, the scenes at the Port of Tampico, and the general feel of the film make it good fare, considering the constraints put on motion pictures in the year it was made. Many things implied, and understood behind the PG-rated facade of most scenes. The acting I found very good, the actors showed their contempt, inhumanity, decency, evil etc. (the facial expressions and acting of the madam in Tampico shows the ugliness behind the gilded facade beautifully) without having to \"talk down\" to the audience. Overall a very pleasant surprise for me, and I won't miss this one the next time it's on.","user":"cobram-1","rank":[21,25]}]
