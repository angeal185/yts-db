[{"title":"Too much going on","rating":4,"date":"1 May 2019","review":"This film is too ambitious for its own good. There are so many story lines and the film moves in-and-out of them with no apparent rationale. Less would be more. The acting is uniformly good and the film manages to have a \"mean streets\" feel to it. Any two or three of the story lines (criminal faced with choice, betrayal of friend, family discord, girl tries to make it, family fights mob influences, getting ahead in the mob) would have made this a good film, but all of them is just too much.","user":"drjgardner","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Ja fool","rating":5,"date":"5 December 2018","review":"I'd rather watch a screwdriver shag a brown bucket then watch ja fool dance about.","user":"arronmcpherson","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Waste of time","rating":2,"date":"23 May 2013","review":"Whilst the lead guy does have solid presence it wasn't until half way though that I realised this was some cheap b grade rubbish. All the mafiosi tropes are here from makin da bolognese sauce to getting gunned down at a restaurant to the rat to revenge to you get the idea. The soundtrack shifted the tone so wildly that it gives you the feeling of different editors. They should have stuck to the gritty rock stuff instead of Italian arias at the hit whilst everyone does in slow mo...I kid you not. All of it reeks of some student effort: Constant time shifts...excessive narration...useless scenes. The lead tough guy guy crying while he jerks off?! lol Looks like a tax loss production to me","user":"bduke-83-514328","rank":[22,27]}]
