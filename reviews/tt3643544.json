[{"title":"RAD MOVIE!!!!!!","rating":8,"date":"2 May 2019","review":"SUPER COOL MOVIE HANDS DOWN. Story was dope. Acting was on point. That house in the hills was epic. I liked the boxing and the relationships of the characters. All went together well and seemed real. Definitely keeping a closer eye on my friends after watching this though. Shows that there can be snakes in your backyard so keep your grass cut extra low.","user":"tompettypresident","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"Great movie","rating":10,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"Wow, it is very refreshing to finally watch a movie with a real life message. I already watched it more than 3 times, Enjoyed it everytime. The story moves you To tear up, get mad, get happy and Lots of other emotions from the first minute to the last. Must see.","user":"timre-87252","rank":[39,61]},{"title":"Great Story","rating":10,"date":"16 November 2018","review":"It's nice to watch a film with a story. I appreciate the layers within the film.
