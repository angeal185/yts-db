[{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"8 April 2017","review":"This movie is awful. I haven't left any reviews on IMDb yet, but this is worth posting. This is the longest and most pathetic waste of time to watch. Bad acting, the title insinuates that it is somehow related to the fast and furious series; it's not. Poor performance, poor plot. Trust me, save your time, money or any \"investment\" in watching this.","user":"nathanjackhomeadvisor","rank":[32,33]},{"title":"Wow","rating":1,"date":"16 April 2017","review":"Definitely a 1 out of 10 as you can't give a big fat zero. All the other reviewers seem to have summed up the film in it's entirety, well except the first review, but as that is from someone who 'stars' in the film then it's not really surprising is it......... Watch it if you want to waste 90 minutes of your life!!","user":"adam-1509","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"What a load of....","rating":1,"date":"10 April 2017","review":"The poster is very misleading. Intending to make it look like something akin to The Fast and The Furious. The plane, the passengers, the crew, the captain, all nonsense. The plane flying between buildings you wouldn't even find in a computer game! And the acting is mostly bad, the plot doesn't make sense, and the last minute is also dumb, dumb. Give it a miss, I really mean it!","user":"Australian1","rank":[25,28]}]
