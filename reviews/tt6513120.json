[{"title":"I'm not a wrestling fan but......","rating":9,"date":"23 February 2019","review":"You dont need to be a wrestling fan to absolutely adore this movie. Its more of a strong family themed movie and a heroic from nowhere to star sports flick. It has at least a half dozen laugh out loud moments, a few moments of stealthily wiping my watering eyes and the euphoric grand finally. If you are a fan of sports movies...go see it!!! Also what else could be better than a van load of aspiring wrestling youngsters doing the sing a long to Iron Maiden!","user":"gryhndrsh","rank":[171,188]},{"title":"Good movie, nice performances, a few fact inaccuracies - but that is forgivable","rating":8,"date":"6 February 2019","review":"A movie, whether based on a true story or fictional one, or maybe a blend of both facts and fictionalized scenes and events - well, just watch and enjoy this one folks, don't be overly-critical all the time. \"Fighting with my Family\" is inspired by the story of the Knight family.<br><br>Dwayne Johnson delivers an enjoyable performance once again. The comic timing and chemistry between him and the other actors is worth watching. This movie definitely deserves more appreciation for its entertainment factor. It is funny and truly heartwarming.","user":"svhot","rank":[174,198]},{"title":"Goodness, one of my best MGM films","rating":8,"date":"15 February 2019","review":"This one is rather good for MGM movies, as it follows the journey of professional wrestler Saraya \"Paige\" Bevis, from growing up in a household of professional wrestlers to winning the WWE Divas Championship in 2014. The film also features the conflict between Saraya and her brother, Zak, as the two both compete in try-outs for WWE; however only Saraya is signed.<br><br>Rather great.","user":"m-86730","rank":[146,168]}]
