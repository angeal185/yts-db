[{"title":"Loose Script, Average Movie","rating":4,"date":"30 May 2017","review":"It is true that it was an average movie but it had some pretty good potential. It easily could have been a very enjoyable movie. Some parts of the movie was well crafted and the camera work was decent; but there was some other parts where the work was poor and sloppy.<br><br>The story had some loopholes and lacks logic, and if you neglect those then you might be able to enjoy the film a bit. The screenplay was okay. The actions scenes were mostly good but some of the action scenes were ridiculous. <br><br>As for the acting it was also an average performance by the cast. Although Anton Shagin who played the 'Shark' character in the film stand out among other actors and actresses for his psycho performance.<br><br>Bottom line is that it is not an excellent movie but you could watch it if you have a lot of spare time.","user":"niaz_islam","rank":[4,5]}]
