[{"title":"It just wasn't funny...","rating":3,"date":"22 December 2010","review":"Okay so you know the premise with these types of films, you've got your father in-law and your son in-law arguing while the rest of their family watch them get into zany situations. Being such a used formula, you can guess what's going to happen, this isn't a problem with comedies as their jokes are what hold them up, right?<br><br>My main problem with the film is that there were no jokes, the entire audience was silent, the only laughter I heard was from some teenage girls laughing at a scene involving a needle and someone's penis. I wouldn't have minded puns, or cheesy jokes, or embarrassing situations, but the film was just like a drama that wasn't very dramatic.<br><br>I felt like the film didn't know what it wanted to be, the title \"Little Fockers\" implies that the children are the main focus, but the two children are barely in the film and when they were, they were just a bit annoying. The film is definitely not a family film, it's heavily sexually based, I wouldn't advise taking your children to see this, but then adults won't find the humour very funny.<br><br>The acting wasn't bad to be perfectly honest, the line up is good and I felt that the characters were believable. As for messages? The film carries some messages about family loyalties and priorities, but doesn't every film like this carry that message?<br><br>I don't like sounding too negative, but the bottom line is that I didn't enjoy this film, simple as that. If you like these kinds of films then I would suggest renting it some time, it's not as bad as I may have made it sound, but it's still pretty bad in my opinion. I hope this review helped you, and maybe saved you some money.","user":"duckfeetpro","rank":[182,249]},{"title":"The same tired old jokes and clich√© miscommunication story lines","rating":3,"date":"25 December 2010","review":"Quality comedies -- if they go beyond one sequel -- never come in  threes. In the case of \"Little Fockers,\" three's a Focking mess. But we  asked for it; \"Meet the Fockers\" ranks as the highest-grossing  live-action comedy in the U.S., so regardless of quality, we were going  to get whatever studios served us. And sure enough, \"Little Fockers\"  cooks up tired modern gags, basically forgetting that the last decade  of comedy (including its two predecessors) ever existed and that we  could be won over by open mentions of sex (ooh!) and recycled dick drug  gags.  It's several years later and Greg and Pam Focker (Ben Stiller and Teri  Polo) live in Chicago with their twins, Henry and Samantha. Grandpa  Jack Byrnes (De Niro) has grown concerned over the Byrnes family legacy  as he's been having some heart issues lately and his first son-in- law,  Dr. Bob, has failed him after having an affair and getting a divorce.  As such, before he and wife Dina (Blythe Danner) arrive for the twins'  birthday, he tells Greg that he's ready to pass the torch to Greg,  who's eager but still scared about winning Jack's full approval and  becoming \"The Godfocker.\"  The film focuses on Jack and Greg again, as expected, so among other  faults, the title \"Little Fockers\" is misleading. The kids are hardly  in the picture expect for cheap jokes and they're neither cute nor  talented. In a family dinner scene where Greg (with \"Godfather\" music  in the background) commands that Henry eat his lasagna, Henry succumbs  but then spews vomit all over his father. Whenever the film seems to  breeze about with a bit more of a sense of humor, a tasteless joke  shoots in that prompts us to do the same.   Contrivances and predictable story lines litter \"Fockers\" and damper  the occasional moments of humor. The familiarity we have with Greg and  Jack helps create that humor and some clever jokes actually do exist,  but the script leans on typical \"misunderstanding\" plot devices, most  of which were ironically used most effectively in \"Meet the Parents\"  and \"Meet the Fockers.\" The whole idea of \"if they worked once they'll  work again\" does not apply. The \"twists\" of this film are set up so  conspicuously that as they unfold, it's like you know what happens  because you've seen it before. And you likely have, because there was  probably something similar in it from a previous \"Focker\" film.  Outside of Jack spying on Greg, who tries to keep it a secret that he's  trying to make extra cash by pushing a new erectile dysfunction drug  for a gorgeous drug rep (Jessica Alba), all the side characters and  plots are garbage. Owen Wilson returns as Kevin and the running joke  other than him being some rich worldly hippie is that he's in love with  Pam, which never amounts to anything. Alba over-ditzifies her part,  which should have been played by a nameless attractive woman, proving  she has no idea how to shake her type.  Even Bernie and Roz Focker (Hoffman and Streisand) are out of place,  squeezed in to appease the audience who expects them to show up. It's  actually unfortunate, because neither of them totally overdo their part  or annoy us with the fact that despite the same thing happening for the  third film in a row now, no one's learned their lesson. Greg actually  catches Jack spying on him on the train and after eight years of  knowing each other, Greg doesn't confront him. Sure this was for the  sake of keeping the tension up, but at some point you can't keep  milking the same goat, or cow, or cat. Yes, Jinxie returns, also with a  convenient line of dialogue from Wilson who says \"I had her brought in  town for you when I heard about your heart,\" just to set up another pet  mischief joke that's completely out of place at the end of the film.  Basically, we're Focking tired. \"Little Fockers\" is simply another  example of a movie concept that's run its course and should have never  gone beyond two films and only did because of the money. In a sense,  there should be no surprises here. Then again, attempted jokes such as  young Henry randomly asking if girls poop from their vaginas at the  dinner table, could have been replaced with something more thoughtful  -- and tasteful.  ~Steven C","user":"Movie_Muse_Reviews","rank":[108,147]},{"title":"What a FOCKED up excuse for a movie!","rating":23,"date":"23 December 2010","review":"This was one of the movies that I was most looking forward to seeing this year and it turned out to be the WORST movie I have seen all year! What were DeNiro and Stiller thinking? Let me rephrase, what was ANYONE thinking who had anything to do with the making of this wretched bag of dreck posing as movie. Back in 2000, Meet The Parents was looked upon as one of the funniest movies ever. I remember that the editorial page of my hometown newspaper even praised it. Here, they have just disgraced themselves. Apparently the movie makers thought it cute to show a little child being injured and someone slashing themselves cutting the turkey. Oh and also, the scene where DeNiro takes that Viagra drug and it shows him with a huge bulge in his....oh never mind. I want to tell the screenwriters that bad taste does not equal funny. DeNiro has earned his place as one of our greatest actors and he should have known better agreeing to this. He merely embarrasses himself as everyone else who made the film did. They should hang their heads in shame.","user":"dtucker86","rank":[78,126]}]
