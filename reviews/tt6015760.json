[{"title":"A terribly worthless film with horrendously poor execution.","rating":2,"date":"16 July 2019","review":"'They're Inside' (2019)\n2/10 ðŸŒ ðŸŒ  = ABANDON<br><br>Why do they keep feeding us these cinematic calamities. The acting, Pace and Storyline was a disaster from start to finish, Complete rubbish is a word I've never used but is absolutely fitting. I really had to fight my emotions to watch it all the way through I was completely UNAMUSED. If creators of horror are going to keep pumping out the same uncreative style of shooting FFF (Found footage films) it has to be imperative that they atleast give us a worthy entertaining storyline that's attached to it. We are so tired of the corny amateur film crew who gets interrupted by wannabe creepy intruders in this case they wear stupid masks that resemble the 'BIG EYES ART PAINTINGS' brandishing steak knives chasing the crew around a secluded cabin in the woods. I really need not say more any twist or turn that's revealed isn't worth you wasting 83 mins. sifting through this trash to see. No I wouldn't reccomend this film to watch I have more fun doing chores around the house atleast it's not a waste of my time. My rating is 2 which urges you to be smart and Abandon this nonsense.","user":"tkaine3","rank":[33,59]},{"title":"Worth a watch - some flaws but definitely creepy!","rating":8,"date":"19 July 2019","review":"Read some reviews on this movie and found it intriguing enough to rent. I really liked the use of found footage. Lead actress was great and helped move the film to its twisted conclusion. Some of the editing could have been tighter but overall a solid first effort.","user":"Horrorfan2019","rank":[13,20]},{"title":"Misguided home invasion effort but still somewhat enjoyable","rating":6,"date":"21 July 2019","review":"Arriving at a secluded cabin in the woods, a group of friends attempting to film a special film project documenting a beloved moment in her personal life, only to have their personal struggles get pushed to the side when a pair of psychotic strangers invade the shoot looking to have fun with them.<br><br>Overall, this one wasn't all that bad. One of the more enjoyable features here is the rather strong setup here that focuses on the stellar invasion done out in the woods. The idea of shooting the documentary at the remote house in the woods through the contest is a fine enough starting point, and with the concept of the footage here being the behind-the-scenes filming of the shoot there's a fun motive for the resulting series of attacks here. This sets up the behind-the-scenes drama as well with the times she states the reasoning for being there at the house and how they're long-buried resentment at the moments that are being recreated on-set gives this a strong start to what's coming to play later in the film. That turns out to be the rather chilling series of surprise ambushes featured by the killer duo. Starting with the initial interruption that is seemingly suspicious but brushed off, it starts to get creepy when added together with their spying on the group from the outside or being there from the very beginning that the group never notices. As well, starting with the opening shots of the freaky killers sneaking up on the personality shooting at the cabin and attacking him shown through the found-footage camera, the home invasion scenes get rather chilling with the full-on attacks that are featured which are non-stop throughout the final half-hour which include multiple chases in the house and outside into the woods that give this a nice life overall. There are a few flaws to be had here. One of the biggest issues is the maddening quality of filming this in the found-footage style which this one completely doesn't need. This one hits nearly every single complaint usually found in found-footage films where it's completely unnecessary to film it in that manner from the very start and just seems to be completely at odds with the type of film they're shooting at the cabin. On top of that, the film also manages to undermine much of the suspense to be found from the stalking in the cabin where this one really could've provided more atmosphere and suspense playing this as a straightforward, traditional genre effort, being one of the rare efforts that would've been better had it stayed as a traditional film. The other big issue here is the film's rather bland pacing that comes into play. The first half here, dominated by so much behind-the-scenes nonsense of the two going through the trials and tribulations of their history together that interfere with the shooting that there's no real interest in this one due to the found-footage aspect to be had here. That also manages to have an effect on the killers here who are absolutely laughable on-screen dressing up in shorts and t-shirts to try to kill people that it's impossible not to laugh at them physically trying to impose their will on others. When the utterly ludicrous finale comes into play that turns this into a wholly ridiculous offering here because the pacing doesn't allow this a chance to do more with them, they end up holding down the film overall.<br><br>Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language, Male Nudity and Graphic Violence.","user":"kannibalcorpsegrinder","rank":[12,19]}]
