[{"title":"Acting may have saved this movie","rating":3,"date":"6 May 2018","review":"This is little doubt that the actors in this movie put on an excellent performance despite the poor and contrived plot line. There was a story here about life and death, being down and out, and purpose but it was so contrived, stereotypical and unnecessarily unbelievable that the message was lost. Rodney was in foster care...really? Is that what led to his homelessness? Give me a break.","user":"bubbakid","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Kept Me Laughing","rating":10,"date":"7 June 2018","review":"Love the movie. Found it funny and at the same time being real. The friendship that Rodney and June has was so real. This is a must watch.","user":"angiewiegold","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"A real surprise","rating":9,"date":"12 May 2018","review":"For fans of Judd Apatow and Greta Gerwig style dramedy - this is a sweet, little indie gem with lots going for it. Tons of nice little moments and performances. Take a chance on an unknown - it'll surprise you.","user":"fallon-dennis","rank":[4,5]}]
