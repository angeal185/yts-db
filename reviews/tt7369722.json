[{"title":"Where was the horror in this?...","rating":5,"date":"30 December 2018","review":"Well, for starters I will just say that this was not all that bad for a SyFy Channel movie actually. But with that being said, then I must also say that this was no outstanding experience in the horror genre either.<br><br>The storyline in \"The Sandman\" is fairly simplistic. An 8 year old girl is capable of invoking a nightmarish creature known as the Sandman, a creature that kills without a second thought. She has been put into custody with her aunt, and they must find a way to rid the girl of the nightmarish entity before it becomes too late.<br><br>Yeah, well on the surface it seemed like a fairly okay plot idea. The execution on the screen, however, told a different tale. The movie was fairly slow paced with nothing overly exciting happening throughout the course of the movie. And that meant that the entire movie experience felt rather prolonged and at times dull. Despite running at a standard feature length, this movie felt way longer.<br><br>The design of the Sandman was perhaps the best part of the entire movie. I liked the way they made him look, however, I would think if they had made sand continuously fall from him from various places, it would have be the icing on the cake. The face of the Sandman was quite interesting.<br><br>For a horror movie, then there wasn't an abundance of special effects throughout the course of \"The Sandman\", which puzzled med, because this definitely seemed like a movie that would have benefitted so much from having lots of special effects. However, the special effects they did have in the movie did work out well enough, and certainly served their intended purpose.<br><br>The acting in the movie was adequate, although it was mostly unknown and unfamiliar actors and actresses to me. I do like that in a movie, so it was a nice thing I think. They had Tobin Bell in the movie and lining on the movie's cover/poster. Just a shame that he was hardly in the movie. But hey, it was the biggest name in the movie, so why not brandish him on the cover?<br><br>Was \"The Sandman\" a scary movie? Hardly so, despite it being branded as a horror movie.<br><br>\"Then Sandman\" is the type of movie that you watch once, and never return to watch a second time, because the movie simply doesn't have enough contents to the storyline to support more than a single viewing.<br><br>An average SyFy release at best.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Exit Sandman...please","rating":2,"date":"19 March 2018","review":"Woof. Bad writing, bad acting, bad effects... Just bad. And the annoying little girl wasn't trying to stop anything and didn't even act afraid. She just conjured up the Sandman to kill folks on a whim and looked like she enjoyed it. So unlikable. My sons and I did get entertainment value from making fun of it, but that's it.","user":"walk929501","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"What a disappointment","rating":1,"date":"27 March 2018","review":"Terrible graphics and even worse acting from the child. Predictable horror made for an awful movie.","user":"cgimmi","rank":[13,18]}]
