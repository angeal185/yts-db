Guy rights the wrong done; learns life lessons in the process. Movie ends. <br><br>A classic movie recipe in the 80's with 'Weird Science', in iGirlfriend our story is resurrected using modern day tech: fictional iPhone app vs fictional science.<br><br>Plot, acting, direction....I won't even waste any more of your time reviewing iGirlfriend except to say the movie is horrible.<br><br>Its not even in the \"so bad its good\" category - its just bad.
