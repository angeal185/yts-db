[{"title":"Disappointing considering the 7.9 rating","rating":2,"date":"21 June 2019","review":"Imagine a one hour and thirty minute television soap opera then imagine calling that soap opera a film. That is what Quality Problems seemed like to me. The reason for two stars and not one is that the final production seemed professional but failed to add any more than the synopsis had to offer.","user":"michaellisher","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Face Bad Situations Head On","rating":9,"date":"28 October 2018","review":"Got multiple challenging situations all at the same time in your life? Watch Quality Problems. Loving family and supportive friends will see you through. As Bailey in Quality Problems found out things do not turn out perfect even if you are the most organized and strongest person. Life will throw you curve balls. Deal with it, add laughter to bad situations.","user":"yvonnechang","rank":[4,12]}]
