[{"title":"A film for the ages.","rating":10,"date":"18 October 2004","review":"This is a movie about the kind of people most of us spend our lives trying to avoid: drunks, whores and cripples of every description. The setting is seamy, mostly taking place in an old neighborhood bar; no ferns here, no clever reparte between beautiful people. The is a story of loneliness and not a little darkness, leavened with gentle, often self-effacing humor.<br><br>The miracle here is the degree to which you wind up truly caring about what happens to these folks. The action in the movie is simple. The people are not, and it is a remarkable feat of storytelling to bring this ensemble to such rich, moving life.<br><br>This is truly a sleeper, Steinbeckian in its evocation of the common humanity in us all.","user":"WLFBoulder","rank":[30,30]},{"title":"Surprisingly Uplifting Movie","rating":19,"date":"19 June 2003","review":"Detailing the plot of this film would lead the unsuspecting to assume they were in for an hour and a half of depression - but quite the opposite. The acting was spot on, the script razor sharp, and the storyline genuinely different and inspiring. I've not seen a copy on video or dvd for years, and for some reason it's never been on terrestrial tv in the UK, and I have to admit I'm baffled as to why. In the genre, it's quite simply one of the best films ever made.","user":"tammas2000","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"Soulful masterpiece.","rating":4,"date":"4 July 2004","review":"It's been many years since I've seen this film, but I've never forgotten it. There's little I can offer in terms of praise that hasn't already been posted here by other commentators.<br><br>It's a film about adversity, finding friendship, and finding the inner strength to rebuild and embrace life for what it is.  It's a film that shows people with physical disabilities in a very normal light, showing them to be neither noble-handicaps nor pitiful cripples, but as normal everyday folks with all the faults and good points of humanity.  It's a film about coping with one's own decisions, and overcoming life's challenges.<br><br>There's some mild profanity, and references to adult situations, as well as some violence, so be warned ahead of time.  It's a film the likes of which I have not seen since, and am hopeful that it'll see a DVD release someday. Until then we'll just have to wait :-(<br><br>In the meantime if you get a chance to view it, then do so :-)","user":"Blueghost","rank":[14,14]}]
