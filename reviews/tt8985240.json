[{"title":"This movie makes no sense","rating":5,"date":"30 December 2019","review":"While the basic premise is somewhat plausible, the execution is not. First of all, \"hotwiring\" went out of fashion fifty years ago, when GM came up with the locking steering column, which locked the steering wheel and the gear selector mechanism. While motor vehicles are still being stolen, it requires a bit more sophistication than simply twisting two wires together.<br><br>The modern variation on auto theft, which involves sophisticated electronics, is a reality. This makes one wonder what they were thinking when they came up with the idea of RFID technology, so that one need not reach into one's pocket to use a car key to enter and start a vehicle. What could possibly go wrong???","user":"nomad472002","rank":[12,20]},{"title":"What a cheap film","rating":2,"date":"3 February 2020","review":"Let's start at the beginning. Stealing a Mustang by hot wiring it. Would not be possible at all. And the high speed chases was slack. Could tell they was all doing like 20 mph. Storyline made no sense what's so ever. She orders parts for her 69/ 70 charger but buys headlights for a 2012 with angel eyes? And also ordered some black alloys but when restored they are obviously chrome.","user":"dnochris","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Tanya Clarke so sexy","rating":6,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"This lady is just hot as hell in this movie .Decent enough film with some average acting from the younger girls","user":"ewgers","rank":[0,0]}]
