[{"title":"One inspired sequence.","rating":8,"date":"14 May 2008","review":"There is plenty of fun to be had in this uneven Danny Kaye entry, the sequence where he gives an excruciatingly complicated explanation of the espionage activities of a group of mittel-European spies with very similar names is a hoot, but it is the ballet parody of \"The Polovstian Dances\" that takes this film to the heights of film comedy. <br><br>I believe this sequence to be one of the three funniest sequences in cinema, along with the first half hour of Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" and \"Daphne's\", (Jack Lemmon's), engagement sequence from \"Some Like It Hot\". The fact that it is unavailable on DVD is as inexplicable as it is regrettable.","user":"bradjanet","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Kaye's Brilliance as a Mimic","rating":9,"date":"6 May 2010","review":"This film is very special to me because when I left home to live in London in 1958, I saw this on my first evening in the city and, as I walked to the cinema, I realised I had not had to ask anyone if I could go or tell anyone where I was going! It was a moment of pure joy - I was free! Other reviewers have carped at the automatic sports car scene but I love this for two reasons: it is very well-constructed, very brief and only a great clown could have carried off. Secondly, Kaye uses his ability as a mimic to produce an impeccable English accent, something which very few Americans can manage (e.g. Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins).","user":"bartonside","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"One of Danny Kaye's funniest","rating":9,"date":"14 January 2004","review":"This, in my opinion, is one of Kaye's funniest performances, showcasing his comedic, singing, and dancing talents to the fullest.  Not to be missed is the movie's finale, where Kaye finds himself on the stage of a London ballet as the leading dancer while simultaneously trying to escape from the baddies.","user":"alazose","rank":[12,14]}]
