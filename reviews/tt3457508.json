[{"title":"Damascus Cover: I've seen much Worse...","rating":6,"date":"26 July 2018","review":"A honest artistic work: well acted, well shot, well edited. And middle east is always an interesting location. The plot is not the most brilliant ever written but I bet that most of us will not foresee the ending.<br><br>I don't understand why exceeding in negative reviews: not every film can be worth an Academy Award. But if you love cinema there is a good chance that you'll enjoy the flick. <br><br>I am old and I've seen much worse...","user":"niutta-enrico","rank":[29,34]},{"title":"Fine film","rating":10,"date":"4 August 2018","review":"Very rarely are authors satisfied with the film adaptations of their novels. I'm the author of the thriller The Damascus Cover, and Daniel Berk has crafted a fabulous version of my book. I'm particularly thrilled with the acting not only of the superb Jonathan Rhys Meyers, but of the entire supporting cast, particularly Olivia Thirlby whose smile lights up the screen. Thanks to all involved with this. I highly recommend the film.","user":"kaplanhow","rank":[57,78]},{"title":"Well Crafted Indie Spy Movie","rating":7,"date":"31 July 2018","review":"I was impressed by this movie. The cinematography was notably good, providing one with a good feel of the atmosphere of the locations in which this film was shot.<br><br>I also enjoyed the political comments that punctuated this movie, without being 'preachy'; something that would certainly turn me off a movie. <br><br>The performances were strong, but at the same time not overly dramatic, which gave the movie the gravitas and tension required for a film in this genre. The storyline keeps you engaged from start to finish, and you leave the theatre suitably entertained - which is what you want.<br><br>Is this film a big budget production like 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'? No. Is it a good independent movie that will entertain you? Yes.","user":"hansolo111","rank":[18,24]}]
