[{"title":"Don't believe the low rating","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"I was hesitant to watch this because of the low rating. But after reading reviews and a rant about how it's not a Christian movie I had to watch. It's an honest, funny, and heartfelt film. Worth seeing!","user":"kali_vaa","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Excellent.","rating":9,"date":"2 February 2020","review":"This is about as good as you could ask for, in terms of a film wrestling with questions of faith in an honest, intellectually sincere, and humane manner. If a film about Christian faith isn't your jam, you'll still likely be surprised; if it is, you're in for a treat.","user":"Ryskon","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Surprisingly Thoughtful","rating":9,"date":"24 March 2020","review":"It's a film where earnest, normal adults discuss organized religion, God, and the scars of their own lives and how it has affected their views on faith.<br><br>I thought it would suck, but it's actually quite good.","user":"mattman149","rank":[2,2]}]
