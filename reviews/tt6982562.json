[{"title":"An enjoyable satire","rating":7,"date":"20 June 2018","review":"Satire about the miseries of a bunch of wannabe actors and celebrities, filled with increasingly dark humor and some funny one-liners. Its aesthetic choices and particularly its score are surprising at first because they are very reminiscent of a thriller, but at the end I found them to work very well by contrast and matched the darkness at the core of the story. All in all, quite inspired and enjoyable.","user":"jrgirones","rank":[7,8]}]
