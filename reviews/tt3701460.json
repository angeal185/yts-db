[{"title":"Excellent coming of age movie, great for date night","rating":28,"date":"28 May 2016","review":"I have seen this film twice and would love to see it again. It covers issues from genetically altered foods, to having the guts to fly out of the nest, to end of life decisions. Some of the best humor in the movie deals with end of life. <br><br>With sci-fi and violence dominating movies, it is a refreshing to see a thoughtful, well executed film. Cinematography was exquisite. Music as well.<br><br>Reminds me a bit of Steele Magnolias. I have watched SM with my grown daughters at least 20 times.<br><br>Windsor is headed to that must watch over and over again category- each time you view it you will discover a nuance not picked up before.","user":"jmcmharper","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"A Celebration of Friendship, Loyalty and Human Resilience","rating":20,"date":"20 May 2016","review":"After enduring one devastating personal setback after another in the small Texas farming burg of Hoxton, you would expect high school senior Maisie Thompson to be the first of her close-knit group of friends to \"get out of this town a.s.a.f.p.,\" as her lifelong bestie, Kat (Quinn Shephard), is fond of saying.<br><br>But the snowballing series of life reversals for Maisie, played brilliantly by Madelyn Deutch, have forced her to grow up early and take responsibility for a disintegrating family, and to be present for close acquaintances who have stood by her through one ordeal after the next. She can't leave.<br><br>If it sounds depressing, it's not. At all. Maisie is buoyed by a support network of five high-school seniors -- friends for life -- who convene each Friday night in lawn chairs to swill cold beers and swap stories alongside Hoxton's vacant Main Street. The discussions range from girlfriends and boyfriends to disgust for the referees in the latest football loss. But talk inevitably swings back around to the main topic: getting out of Hoxton a.s.a.f.p.<br><br>She also is helped along by Hoxton old-timer Gil Denton, played by Barry Corbin in one of the great performances of his long career. Though beaten down by the ravages of old age, Gil is always close by to keep Maisie from sinking into a quicksand of misfortune. His group of geriatric friends face their mortality with tenderness and some truly hilarious moments. Gil clearly has the respect and affection of the six high-school friends, a sentiment that is reinforced when he shows up at their weekly Friday night gathering and blithely guzzles a long-neck in seven seconds.<br><br>Written and directed by Texas native Porter Farrell, Windsor is a wonderful film. It will make you want to go home and hug your mother, hug your father, hug a friend. It will have you looking for an injustice to fight. It will awaken your sense of fair play, and it may open your eyes to the struggle of the American farmer. (Maisie's dad Buck, a local farmer played by Joe Stevens, becomes an unfortunate victim of a nefarious and overreaching agribusiness corporation, sending the family into a tailspin.) Windsor will certainly cause your jaw to drop. The sweeping panoramas of emerald farmland in and around Gainesville, Texas, where the movie was filmed, are exquisite eye candy, for which Director of Photography Josh Pickering deserves a sackful of awards.<br><br>Bring your hankies. As Maisie's setbacks pile up, you will ache for her. But her resilience will remind you that people can be phenomenally strong, especially with the caring support of those who love them. But save most of your tissues for the tears of pure joy that the uplifting ending will surely bring.","user":"jodokent","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"Two Thumbs Up For Windsor!!","rating":10,"date":"17 June 2016","review":"Don't miss catching the film Windsor this summer<br><br>Set in a small town Texas community, it is a beautiful story of real people learning life lessons that can only be learned through the refining fire of difficult circumstances. I think that the cast is so well chosen for the characters. You may find a little bit of yourself in each one of them. They're vulnerable, growing, maturing and facing really tough situations. The magnificent cinematography and scenery will constantly take your breath away. Each time I see the film, I catch more exquisite detail in the scenery and the story, the subtle innuendos, pure lighting, &amp; raw emotions communicated sometimes without even a word. <br><br>Two thumbs up for Windsor!!","user":"mvrutherford","rank":[2,5]}]
