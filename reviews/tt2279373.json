[{"title":"It's A sneezer for the adults, but fun for old sponge bob fans.","rating":8,"date":"14 July 2015","review":"Btw. this is my first review! hope you enjoy! I saw this movie a day after it came out. I was excited to see a new sponge bob movie! I kid you not, the time travel scenes did make me feel dizzy. I caught some of the old jokes like \"My Leg!\" While watching this movie, I enjoyed the superhero forms but I thought it was gonna be like the old episode. I took my little sister to see it and she liked it because of Spongebob characters. I liked the rap battle between the Dolphin and the Seaguls. A nice om-age to Epic Rap Battles of History. It was a very comical experience (I.e. the cannon balls in the bubbles and the ice cream flying out of the shop. All in all, a great movie for the kids, and fun for old sponge bob fans like me","user":"zhalteman","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"Spongebob fans will not be disappointed.","rating":8,"date":"10 July 2015","review":"This film is very enjoyable film overall.<br><br>The story, while it borrows from episodes from the show, is quite well thought out. Basically, it's an adventure movie, a time travel movie, an action movie and a superhero all at once, and the film pulls that off quite well. It has a nice throwback to the older Spongebob episodes from when the show was good. That pirate was quite entertaining and I think that Antonio Banderas did a very good job with that role.<br><br>It is also very clever and funny at times. Given that the show has kinda gone downhill since 2005, I was not expecting it to be that funny, but it really surprised me. The jokes here are quite impressive. I don't think I have laughed this much at a Spongebob cartoon since the first Spongebob film \"The Spongebob Squarepants Movie\".<br><br>The film is well animated. It has a neat blend of hand drawn animation, live action, and computer animation.<br><br>The film also has a catchy soundtrack, featuring a few musical numbers involving some of the characters, and three songs by N.E.R.D. that appear during the end credits.<br><br>This is film is, overall, downright fun. I can't think of a single part where I was bored with it.<br><br>There were a couple of problems that I had with the film. One of them is that the plot drags a little bit up until the final act. The other problem I had is that the computer animation on Spongebob and his allies, while decent, was not terribly believable.<br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed Sponge Out of Water and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Spongebob and/or is into animation.","user":"mhol111964-754-567942","rank":[18,19]},{"title":"Very different from ANYTHING SpongeBob related I've ever seen. High hopes for Season 10!","rating":8,"date":"10 February 2015","review":"This movie wasn't as good as the original movie (mainly because it felt like an hour and a half long episode), but I have to admit that the comedy in this movie was 110% top notch and better than all of the episodes that came after the original movie. When I heard that Stephen Hillenburg returned for the movie, I was excited. However, I can definitely tell that his sense of humor has changed (not in a bad way, though)<br><br>For example, Seasons 1-3 (Golden Era of SpongeBob) had some adult humor, mixed in with cartoonish humor for the more kid-friendly side. The original movie was also as such.<br><br>Season 4-9 were just straight bland cartoons. Nothing really funny, just Spongebob and Patrick laughing annoyingly for a 30 minute time slot, with the plot being something either rehashed, or just straight bland or predictable. <br><br>This movie, however, was WAY different than anything SpongeBob related I've ever seen. The comedy that Stephen Hillenburg brought back to the table was very different than we've seen in Seasons 1-3. The jokes in this movie made me think I was watching a movie like Airplane or Top Gun, the jokes just being unpredictable in the stupidest way, which was extremely funny. For example, there's a part where Plankton tells SpongeBob \"Wait! Hold your thoughts!\" and SpongeBob is then seen, literally holding a thought bubble, just stupid unpredictable comedy like that. I appreciate that, and love that it is refreshing. There were also some suggestive themes in the movie, so the adult appeal is definitely back!<br><br>On the kid side, it was also EXTREMELY different than I've ever seen in SpongeBob. At first, I didn't like how over the top and WEIRD this film was on the kid friendlier side, but I stopped and realized that kids from 1999 and kids from 2015 are ENTIRELY different and have different appeals. After realizing this, all of the randomness and overall WEIRDNESS in this movie made sense. Instead of following the same boring and bland formula from seasons 4-9, someone in the writing staff must have finally said \"Listen, we need to catch the appeal of kids today. If we're going to make kids interested in our show, we need to pull them in.\" and I have to say that it definitely did. I know what the kids are into these days (not trying to sound old), and SpongeBob definitely pulled it off in this new movie.<br><br>With an entirely different, hilarious, and refreshing comedy stance than seasons 1-3, and a huge attempt at actually appealing to kids of 2015 rather than following a bland formula, I have to say that Season 10 is going to be one of the best seasons since the show started. It will reel in kids again, as well as appealing to adults with classic humor and unpredictable comedy. I feel as if the entire show is going to be COMPLETELY different, and it will definitely be noticeable! <br><br>In a nutshell: Loved the movie, comedy was refreshing and hilarious, the kid friendlier side I thought was stupid, but you have to realize that kids in 2015 are different than kids from 1999.","user":"Joynson1995","rank":[47,59]}]
