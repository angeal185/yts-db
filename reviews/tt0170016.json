[{"title":"No Kidding, It was Great! Wassup with you guys????","rating":27,"date":"27 November 2000","review":"Well, I finally broke down and went to see it.  I was hesitant after reading all the pans here.  Egad!   It was a great movie! You can't compare it to the \"original\" any more  than you can compare \"Scrooge\" to the eternal Dickens classic.  It has a life of its own.  Jim Carrey was amazing.   How he can deliver so many feelings and emotions behind 10 pounds of latex is fantastic.  Some of his scenes (obviously impromptu) were so funny I nearly wet myself.  The sets were great and not nearly as over-blown as I had expected.  As for the  \"prequel\" portion, well, it was only so-so. The best part of the whole show is when they sing the \"Ah hoo torres\" song at the end which has ALWAYS been my most favorite Christmas song ever.<br><br>I recommend the movie highly to kids and adults.   As for the negative comments on imdb.com I gotta say...\"get over it, ya big bunch of grinches!!!!!\"","user":"Donsgal","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Christmas Giggles","rating":7,"date":"16 December 2004","review":"I have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down.<br><br>Why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be.<br><br>This film is supposed to be a light hearted, tonge in cheek, family comedy, things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults, and that is exactly what this film does.<br><br>I laughed my nuts off at this film, I thought Carey put in a great performance and the whole film (if watched at Christmas) really give you a bit of festive cheer<br><br>So to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not \"Taxi Driver\" or \"The Godfather\" and take films for what they are supposed to be, entertainment!!","user":"toffeesi","rank":[198,255]},{"title":"A wonderful take on Dr. Seuss' book on How The Grinch Who Stole Christmas","rating":10,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"How The Grinch Stole Christmas was beautifully shot and an excellent twist to Dr. Seuss' story.
