[{"title":"Lousy, \"C\"-grade acting...","rating":3,"date":"8 January 2020","review":"The script is so primitive and the acting horrendous. The only tolerable acting was from the older priest. The fight scenes were a struggle to watch... Very disappointing.","user":"rickwhite1962","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Love Dominique","rating":7,"date":"25 January 2020","review":"Parents guide indicated shld be rated R for violence and profanity but also nudity/attempted rape. Dominique was great in his role but some of the other acting/fight scenes were less credible/enjoyable","user":"sderrickson-55444","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Padre Rambo","rating":6,"date":"19 March 2020","review":"Here we have a pretty decent action flick. Coreographies and action scenes are pretty well done. On the other hand weak plot or script, but who cares on an action B movie. Overall a good one if you're in the mood of watching some action.","user":"dr_bonone","rank":[1,1]}]
