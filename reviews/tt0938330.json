[{"title":"Recipe for a mediocre sequel:","rating":6,"date":"22 January 2013","review":"1) A much smaller budget than the original (20 mil vs 50 mil).<br><br>2) Jump scares. The original had none because of the great story/plot which gave the entire film a terrifying &amp; unnerving feel. This sequel is so cheesy and pretentious that in order to call itself a horror film there needs to be long quiet pauses followed by doors slamming or monsters making loud noises causing the audience jump.<br><br>3) \"3D\"... throw in some scenes where swords thrust out toward the audience even though this kind of gimmicky nonsense breaks any feel of authenticity the movie might have had, even when watching it without the 3D glasses.<br><br>4) Flavor of the week actor(s)... Kit Harrington from the popular HBO series \"Game of Thrones\" is supposedly a high school student along with the main character, but unfortunately he looks (and is) 26 years old... he just feels out of place throughout the film.<br><br>I really enjoyed the original (as well as the games) and wanted this one to be good as well. Unfortunately Silent Hill: Revelation sets out to do two things: A) Continue the story SOMEWHAT from the first film to satisfy Silent Hill fans while having characters reveal story lines piece by piece in \"plot dumps\" that seem forced and out of place. B) Try to make as much money as the original, but with a terrible script, less money, and MUCH less passion.","user":"outofmana","rank":[134,163]},{"title":"Too Short, Underdeveloped","rating":7,"date":"29 October 2012","review":"The first half of the film was great. It was creepy, it was suspenseful, and it was almost scary (speaking as someone who considers most scary films to be dull and silly). The film did a good job of summarizing the first, and the 3D was generally well-done. So where did this film fail? Well first, the character relationships were extremely superficial, to the point where it felt like they were tacked-on or unrealistic. Some of the character motivations were also underdeveloped and made the characters come off as stupid or just hard to relate to, especially towards the end. The characters take a while to actually enter Silent Hill, and when they do the film quickly devolves from creepy moments to explaining the story, which is not particularly compelling. Obviously, the film makers had to work within the context of the original while trying to tie it into the third game, but so much of the film was devoted to characters explaining the plot that it made the film feel somewhat dull. Think of the old adage \"show, don't tell\". The film was overly short, and it seemed as though this was the central problem. 20 more minutes to SHOW the plot, interspersed with a few more creepy scenes, and this film could have easily surpassed the original. Alas, the director chose to keep the film succinct, and the result is that it feels rushed and the last ten or fifteen minutes feel more like a cheesy action movie than a horror film. As I said, with twenty more minutes of footage, the film could have easily been one of the scariest movies of the last 10 years, and could have had believable characters and a more expertly revealed plot. Instead, we're left with a decent movie with a few good scares.","user":"jhelin0436","rank":[97,137]},{"title":"Stop... Please, just stop.","rating":1,"date":"27 October 2012","review":"I'm going to forget for a second that I've played Silent Hill, I'm going to switch off my brain and look at this film as a standalone project, a generic horror film about a creepy town called Silent Hill.<br><br>And as somebody who has forgotten all knowledge of the game series that this film is based on, it would be nice if the film itself could fill me in on the situation a little, instead of throwing 3d effects at the screen and trying (Poorly) to relay a story that makes so little sense that it almost becomes funny.<br><br>Things happen for no reason and have little build-up or explanation, and it isn't too enjoyable thanks to the hokey acting from the majority of the cast, even stars like Sean Bean and Kit Harington turned in mediocre performances, though with the writing the way it was one can't exactly blame them.<br><br>Now as someone who has seen the first film, this \"sequel\" (With the most original sequel name ever might I add) has little to do with the first. Sure it is set in the same place and some situations are repeated but it doesn't continue the flow of the first, nor does it follow any of the momentum. The first ended in a bitter way that held no real place for a sequel to come in, so this whole film just seems tacked on for some extra cash.<br><br>But I'm sure the real problem here is the shameless butchering of source material.<br><br>If this film went under any other name or concept, it would be a badly acted straight to DVD movie that only plays on the Sci-fi channels, but because of the capitalisation on the name \"Silent Hill\" and the intellectual property of its creators, this film has been given a free pass, a pass which it did not use wisely.<br><br>Once again, without any spoilers, it is safe to say that this film does nothing in the ways of conveying the moods and feelings of any of the original games, nor does it try to follow any of their stories, which would be just fine if they didn't spend every other minute shoving fan- service in my face, as if to say \"Look! Remember this from the game? So do we! Take a good long look at it!\" <br><br>Worst of all, the little nods that it gives to the game series are such big parts of the plot that you cannot ignore the fact that they are being used completely out of context, and it gets avid gamers like me really mad.<br><br>All in all, newcomers to the series who like horror films will have a tough time understanding it, people who enjoyed the first film will probably lose interest fast, and anyone who has played the games will spend the entire film sitting in frustration. It is an unpleasant experience, and I would recommend that nobody watches this, not even to see how bad it is, because I don't think the Silent Hill community will be very pleased with another sequel.","user":"maxlegroom-513-169363","rank":[117,170]}]
