[{"title":"Oh what a stinker","rating":1,"date":"8 February 2020","review":"Stupid is as stupid does.This whole movie is stupid. Goodness, what a load of garbage. What is there to like? The plot? The acting? The scenery? People just do not behave the way this guy does in life threatening situations. Only at the end does he do the NORMAL thing but its too late for that poor sap.","user":"dondee-87646","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"its hot in the spanish countryside","rating":5,"date":"13 January 2020","review":"Its a psycho-horror drama flick about an american hippie-backpacker going rural to find his vanished friend, that ends up in a nightmare, because he turned down the wish of a hot sunburned spanish woman, that gave away her heart but was sent back in return. so let the moral be, do not even think about letting a spanish girl down, then shell let you run the devil on the spanish highway.<br><br>its a slow flick with some acceptable acting, a suspencefull score, and a beautiful filmography.<br><br>but its not one for the grumpy old man, he's far too restless , but its still a recommend if you like psychophobia.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[8,13]},{"title":"Intriguing","rating":7,"date":"15 January 2020","review":"An excellently filmed and acted movie that kept my attention throughout. However, watching this at the time of the Australian bushfire crisis I was somewhet repelled, near the movie's start, by seeing the lead character throw an empty plastic water bottle into what looked like dry grassland under a blazing sun without any adverse comments from the other characters (unless I missed something!). For that reason I gave this seven stars rather than eight.","user":"Phillip21","rank":[3,11]}]
