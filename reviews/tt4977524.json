Obviously not to everyone's taste.\nIf you're looking for edge of the seat car chase carnage, blood soaked terror or best buddy heists avoid this movie.","user":"philpeel-658-191198","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"A great black comedy for a rainy day","rating":10,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"I saw this film first at a film festival in the UK and had to watch it again.<br><br>A film with 4 elderly female leads - and to take a serious subject such as alzheimer's disease and make a black comedy is no mean feat.<br><br>This is not a fim with jokes. The humour comes from character and the acting process oozes from these great actresses bones. It did hark back to old Ealing comedies and checking out the film's website I see that this was the intention - so well done to all those involved.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed this film. If it comes to the cinema I will watch it again.","user":"jt-57464","rank":[14,21]},{"title":"Good to watch","rating":10,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"A very easy watch. A black comedy about 4 older gals and their problems with their friend's dead husband.<br><br>Some great humour and good acting.","user":"adam-20374","rank":[11,16]}]
