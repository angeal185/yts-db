[{"title":"Subtle chills....what's that???","rating":4,"date":"21 July 1999","review":"Well, my goodness, am I disappointed.  When I first heard news of a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 film, \"The Haunting\", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer-movie sized visual effects.  But, deep down, I had faith.  Surely, with such a talented cast intact...De Bont and company will not ruin a film, who's original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety.  Well, subtlety, where are you now!!??  My fears have manifested...a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is jaw-dropping; the movie is wonderfully photographed; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never EVER do wrong. But, the script puts it's fine actors to the test..asking them to deliver the kind of stilted dialogue that is only spoken in movies.  In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity...and that's just barely. But, the crime of all crimes is that the horror is shown to us.  We can no longer use our imaginations, feel that horrible dread of fear of the unknown.  No, we get some visual effects to SHOW US what we're supposed to be afraid of...and you know what?  As wonderfully realized as they are...the visual effects come off as sort of silly.  And the climax is a phantasmogoric mess...but things had gone terribly wrong long before that. <br><br>Everything in The Haunting is overdone and overblown.  I'm afraid there are no real thrills or creaks in this old haunted house monstrosity...only groans.   Check out the original instead.","user":"DocHobbs","rank":[132,187]},{"title":"A lackluster supernatural thriller.","rating":18,"date":"18 November 2000","review":"* and 1/2 stars out of ****<br><br>The Haunting is actually a relatively decent film for the first 45 or so minutes.  The setup is promising, the production design of the mansion is a sight to behold, and the cast seems to be enjoying themselves.  It's unfortunate, however, because after that the film begins to fall apart, leading all the way to the ridiculously bad finale.<br><br>Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) is conducting a test on fear, using the bait-and-switch method.  By doing so, he's pretending to do a study on insomnia at the Crain estate, a manor 9 miles from the closest town.  The \"test subjects\" that arrive include Eleanor (Lili Taylor), a hard-working woman who has had little success in life, Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an adventuress  and proclaimed bi-sexual, and Luke (Owen Wilson), an all-around jokester.<br><br>On the first night in the mansion, Eleanor and Theo hear thundering sounds in the walls, but pass it off as a problem in the plumbing.  But events get even more bizarre, as Eleanor sees some sort of a figure inside the fireplace, that just as soon disappears.  Slowly, Eleanor begins to believe that there are ghosts in the house, ghosts of dead children and the owner of the mansion himself, the evil Hugh Crain.  She also makes a discover about her connection with the mansion that could help free the children's spirits.<br><br>The Haunting never features one scary moment.  Rather than going for subtle chills or all-out shocks like in House on Haunted Hill, Jan De Bont prefers to rely everything on the special effects, which really are rather unconvincing, particularly the statues that come to life and the CGI ghosts.<br><br>It even manages to get worse.  Now, to be fair, the film was getting dull by the 90-minute mark so I was initially entertained by the effects-filled finale.  But everything gets positively ridiculous in the last ten minutes, as we find out evil ghosts like to play hide-and-seek and smash things up real good.<br><br>The blame should fall on director Jan De Bont and writer David Self.  De Bont seems to care more about what special effect to use next to \"wow\" the audience rather than actually trying anything innovative.  Self really can't seem to write a good story or truly interesting characters.  The dialogue is perhaps the worse of his writing skills.<br><br>The only thing that keeps this film from a lower rating is the cast, and they do their best to keep the film respectable.  Liam Neeson probably delivers the best performance, being neither as dull or unemotional as critics thought.  Catherine Zeta-Jones shows a lot of life as Theo, as does Owen Wilson.  It's a pity that Lili Taylor's performance, which was decent at first, turned to borderline camp by the finale.<br><br>With nary a true scare in sight, The Haunting should best be seen by those who are scared easily or special effects fans.  For everybody else, this is probably a house not to spend the night at.","user":"jiangliqings","rank":[42,58]},{"title":"Nothing could have saved The Haunting","rating":1,"date":"24 November 2003","review":"The Haunting, if you have seen the original, you know a great ghost story, it's perfection on film. It's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements, it terrified people. It still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film. So when The Haunting was remade in 1999, a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction \"WHAT? WHY? WHAT THE\" But in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation, I'm pretty cool with it. This is definitely not the case, this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and I guarantee will deliver no scares pfft! PG-13, what where they thinking? Not much apparently.<br><br>When her mother dies and her sister evicts her, Nell receives a phone call, telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by Doctor David Marrow at Hill House, a secluded manor. Upon arrival, Nell meets Mr. and Mrs. Dudley, a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark. Shortly thereafter, two other participants in the study arrive, wild Theo and \"bad sleeper\" Luke Sanderson along with Doctor Marrow. Unknown to the participants, Doctor Marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear. Each night, the caretakers chain the gate outside Hill House, preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning, when the caretakers open the lock. There are no working telephones inside Hill House and the nearest town is several miles away. Doctor Marrow revels the story of Hill House. The house was built by Hugh Crain, Crain built the house for his wife, hoping to fill it with a large family full of children, however all of Crain's children died during birth. Crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished, and Crain became a recluse. The first night, Theo and Nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house, including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes. Nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words \"Welcome Home, Eleanor\", and becomes extremely distraught, setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him. He then burned the bodies in the house's fireplace to hide any evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, of whom Nell is descended. Everyone thinks she's crazy while Nell is convinced this is where she belongs.<br><br>Seriously, I suggest you stay away from this film, it's really stupid and pointless. Not to mention the actress the played Nell, Lili Taylor completely annoyed me, her performance, her look, just everything about her, don't get me started on things I would do just to not see her in film again. Catherine Zeta Jones just didn't fit in her role as well and Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor wasted talent once again. The effects are way over the top and too computerized, I just can't believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud. Believe me, if you are going to be afraid of something, be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid. Oh, this film is already hurting me, just don't see it, it's bad.<br><br>1/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[61,89]}]
