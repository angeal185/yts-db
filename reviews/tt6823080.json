[{"title":"To the idiot","rating":8,"date":"7 November 2019","review":"This is for the person that posted a 1 star because he thinks this was listed as a horror film. Well you dumb jerk it is not listed as a horror at all! It's listed on  as a thriller. THILLER!! Can you spell it for us? The movie wasn't bad at all. Really strong acting with a great script. Sorry to everyone else I am just tired of people bashing movies for reasons that make no sense.","user":"nevittjason-19553","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Good storyline but not so good actors","rating":6,"date":"5 November 2019","review":"The story was good, unexpected, but main character was kind of fake drama","user":"champetudo","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Mummy's Secrets Out !","rating":7,"date":"8 November 2019","review":"Slow burn thriller that's compelling. Starts off, daughter coming of age gets visit from long lost mother. The father seems to have a hold over her.\nYou think is this one of those dead or not dead films, I wont give anything away you're just have to see how it plays out.\nThe ending reveals all the dirty secrets. Good Watch","user":"pkdyer6519","rank":[3,5]}]
