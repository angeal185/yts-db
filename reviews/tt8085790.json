[{"title":"I found this lame and cringy","rating":4,"date":"22 June 2019","review":"This movie was trying to be funny, but didn't manage it and just came across as lame and cheesy. The acting left something to be desired, and I honestly just spent the whole film thinking \"when is it gonna end? I'm bored\". I don't recommend it.","user":"pokemon_trainer_lucas","rank":[62,80]},{"title":"The young actress is so talented!","rating":7,"date":"21 April 2019","review":"OMG!! Regina Hall is totaly tailored to her character. She brought her character to alive!! Her attitude in the movie is so funny! Also, the young actress is super talented. She is going to shine in Hollywood. The storyline is okay but I really enjoy their acting.","user":"ilovefoodcoma","rank":[30,40]},{"title":"Average movie","rating":5,"date":"13 April 2019","review":"First off this movie was way too long for what it was. The story was the same as many before it. There were some funny moments, but the length of the film made you feel restless waiting for it to end","user":"chrisagray-27399","rank":[64,92]}]
