[{"title":"Waste of time","rating":1,"date":"17 October 2019","review":"Terrible plot, awful cast and laughable continuity.\nPay close attention at rental car colour.","user":"eligleiton","rank":[22,28]},{"title":"Good Old Fashioned Rural Village Fun!","rating":9,"date":"19 November 2019","review":"I did not expect much at all from this film. I gave it a go because the synopsis mentioned 'folklore', of which I can never get enough. I was unbelievably surprised and pleased to find that it was a well done film in the vein of The Wicker Man and Straw Dogs. I had never heard of or seen any of the actors, but for an indie film(which I prefer to more mainstream movies), it was super fun. It's not a movie that will be to everyone's taste. But if you love rural English villages oozing with folklore and strange happenings, see it on a dark and stormy night with popcorn and a friend!","user":"michelelein-80506","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"I've seen more emotional range in an ironing board","rating":1,"date":"6 November 2019","review":"Seriously this film deserves the same degree of apathy from viewers as displayed by the lack lustre cast with all the emotional range of a blancmange and rather less emotional range than an ironing board.<br><br>The story is ludicrous and unbelievable, and if you are after action, scares or anything other than monotonous meandering by someone whose pregnant girlfriend is supposed to be mysteriously missing then don't bother with this.","user":"aelthric","rank":[8,12]}]
