[{"title":"Starts strong, but becomes largely generic by the end","rating":5,"date":"5 May 2019","review":"I'll Take Your Dead is the story of a widowed man who lives with his daughter and makes money by disposing of dead bodies for people. Unfortunately one of the dead bodies given to him by a client isn't dead, which becomes quite a problem for him.<br><br>The movie started out well. The concept is interesting, the atmosphere is nice and unsettling, and the daughter was great, but unfortunately it mostly derails by the end.<br><br>The main problem with the movie is that the story ends up devolving into a story we've seen many times before, about a guy in a shady line of work who is presented with a difficult decision, chooses to do the right thing, and then has to defend himself against the consequences of that decision.<br><br>In addition to this, the daughter loses her morbid nature part way through the film, which makes her less interesting. The choice to open the film with narration that lets you know that not everyone will survive was also a poor choice, ruining the tension towards the end of the film, as it's not very difficult to guess who's going to die. The movie also has a small supernatural element to it, but I felt it was not used particularly well.<br><br>It's not a bad film, but it's hard to recommend that anybody go out of their way to see it. But if you want something a little unsettling to watch, you could do worse than this movie.","user":"grim2005","rank":[23,27]},{"title":"Would be better without cheap horror sideline...","rating":5,"date":"8 July 2019","review":"Would be better without cheap horror sideline...\nLike a horror it is not good,but criminal thriller could have been much better!","user":"tchitouniaram","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Combination of slasher, zombie, action and horror films all rolled into one","rating":7,"date":"7 August 2019","review":"I rated this higher since it was a great combination of slasher, zombie, action and horror films all rolled into one. The premise is as weird as you can get but the acting and story work. The ending did not sit right with me.","user":"dar0417","rank":[5,5]}]
