[{"title":"Rubbish","rating":1,"date":"8 February 2018","review":"I dont know what I hated more about this movie..\nBad acting, no story, Dumb Screenplay, idiotic dialogues, lazy direction and unrealistic scenario..","user":"mooreyr","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"This Film Is Beyond Bad","rating":1,"date":"12 February 2018","review":"This is the epitome of trashy television. No plot, doesn't make sense. You hate the character development because the actors did a poor job. The script is unbelievable, I found myself laughing at times, the absurdity of what the characters actually say and do. I don't usually review movies, but this one was so bad, it compelled me to save somebody else's time from watching this. What an accident of a movie.","user":"kenvchin","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Something was missing...","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2018","review":"...Like a story, a plot, some character development, motives behind what was going on, a middle, and an end. What a piece of crap this was! By reading the box cover and reading this review, you know as much about it as I do... and I just watched it! That was the biggest ACCIDENT! ...watching it. I've had better times sitting in a car waiting for the police after a REAL accident than I did watching this garbage. Let's hear it for a director that can't tell a proper story. One star was as low as I could go!! So I rated it much higher than I would have otherwise. The best part was when the credits rolled... because it was over.","user":"ejmc111","rank":[21,27]}]
