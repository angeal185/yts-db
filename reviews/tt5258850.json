All characters are important, and the script is suspenseful in their interaction. My two favorite characters are of course Edouard Péricourt and Pradelle (fantastic Laurent Lafitte, he makes me think of John Hodiak). Enjoy.","user":"happytrigger-64-390517","rank":[43,52]},{"title":"Brilliant movie with many layers and reasons to see","rating":10,"date":"30 April 2018","review":"We loved this french movie.
