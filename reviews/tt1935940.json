[{"title":"Nice jolly addition to the holiday genre","rating":7,"date":"24 December 2014","review":"Get Santa is a great new holiday movie with a decidedly British sense of humor about it.<br><br>Santa Clause is in big trouble! A few days before Christmas while testing out a new sleigh he crashes it! His head is boggled, his reindeer are on the loose in London so he is stranded – which doesn't bode well for the children on Christmas Day.<br><br>Lucky for him, a kid named Tom discovers Santa sleeping in his family's garage. Santa tries to rescue his reindeer from the impound and ends up fingerprinted and locked up. It's okay though, little Tom decides that he and his dad Steve need to help Get Santa outta London and back to the North Pole! Get Santa is a good family movie because it is a comedy for the adults and the children. Putting Kris Kringle in jail is definitely the humor for the adults. The father son duo out on the town helping Santa and saving Christmas is for the kids.<br><br>Jim Broadbent is a great Santa for the circumstances of the film. He's jolly and looks the part but there is a twinkle in his eye that suggests Santa is in on the jokes while in prison. The rag tag group of prisoners and parolees that end up helping Mr. Claus are a nice and original change. They are gruff and tough but friendly and you won't find the curmudgeon who learns the meaning of Christmas cliché in Get Santa, thankfully.<br><br>Christopher Smith's holiday film is a nice addition to the genre. Get Santa is not completely original nor is it extraordinary but it is sweet without being saccharine and appropriate for kids without seeming lazy.<br><br>Check out our WEBSITE for all the recent releases reviewed in full.","user":"ArchonCinemaReviews","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Funny and moving in equal measure.","rating":9,"date":"13 December 2014","review":"So refreshing to see an intelligent children's film. Hilariously funny but also very moving. A film that shows even broken families can settle their differences over Xmas. My eight year old and his friend have been quoting lines of dialogue all week. The scene when Santa reveals the history of all the prisoners is so brilliantly written, my wife cried. I also loved the sequence when Santa becomes \"street\" in prison. I never thought I would ever see a Christmas movie featuring Straight Outta Compton by NWA. The kid actor was also really good. I read a review that said the fart reindeer fart scene was cheap. It's no cheaper than the fart scene in Blazing Saddles which is a classic. Not only that but the whole cinema was laughing and unless I'm mistake, this film was made for children.","user":"doggie231","rank":[28,32]},{"title":"Dry humour and Jim Broadbent","rating":7,"date":"21 December 2015","review":"This dry, wry, sometimes snarky Christmas tale touches buttons from the ridiculous to the very human, neatly and surely.<br><br>Several standard American holiday tropes - Santa getting lost before the holiday, kids asking for their parents back, elves who need humans to save the day - are turned on their heads in inimitable Brit-film style. Jim Broadbent does Santa very well. There's a 'Bad Santa' element, Keystone-esque cops and prison guards, and some hilarious farting reindeer.<br><br>The simple human story of father and son bonding, of dad and step-dad and mom making peace with each other, is strong enough to be convincing. And heart-warming.","user":"JaynaB","rank":[9,9]}]
