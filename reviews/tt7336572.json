[{"title":"10/10?","rating":6,"date":"15 September 2018","review":"Are you serious?\nAlthough this movie is a very positive movie, it still have A LOT OF problems.","user":"picklewind","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"Touching & Heart-Warming","rating":7,"date":"16 August 2018","review":"The story line was repeated by many similar movies before and also very predictable but nevertheless, it's still a good movie worth watching at home over a bluray or DVD. There are a few very touching scenes which would make you shed some tears as well. But if you are expecting lots of kungfu or martial art movie, then this is not the one as actions are secondary in this movie.","user":"jeymatt","rank":[15,25]},{"title":"Touching and Inspiring - a movie with a lot of heart and positive messages!","rating":10,"date":"18 August 2018","review":"I went into the theatres expecting a full fledge martial arts movie, but I got more than that. The movie totally blew my expectations away, as Big Brother touches on gender equality, racism and more importantly the flaws in today's education system. The role a teacher plays in his/her students' lives, to inspire and motivate.<br><br>Reminds me of the hit Bollywood film, 3 idiots, but with more action scenes.<br><br>Have not seen a movie that brings out so many positive messages for a Long time.<br><br>Also was not expecting to go into the cinema to see so many people wiping their tears during the movie - a very touching movie with comedic elements and incredible action sequences. A movie with a lot of heart and effort, and deserves to be applauded.<br><br>Definitely recommended to be watched in theatres! :)","user":"tigercanyons","rank":[15,26]}]
