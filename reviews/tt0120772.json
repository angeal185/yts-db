[{"title":"I loved this movie","rating":12,"date":"12 August 1998","review":"I thought that this film was terrific.  I read the book years ago, and actually thought that the movie was better.  First of all, it makes more sense to look at the storyline from Nina's perspective, since she has much more at stake than George does. Secondly, the character played by Nigel Hawthorne was beautifully written and played, and he didn't even exist in the book.  I also disagree with the assertion that George was \"boring\" in this movie.  I thought that Paul Rudd gave a wonderful and moving performance, particularly at the Science Fair when he tells Nina how much he would love to be a father.  Don't believe the critics -- give it a rental.  It's a terrific film.","user":"Red7Eric","rank":[33,39]},{"title":"Great Film!","rating":9,"date":"15 August 1999","review":"Finally a truly great film from a star of TV's Friends. Jennifer Aniston is fantastic as a single woman who becomes pregnant and wants to raise the child with her roommate George, who is gay. Unfortunately for her, she ends up falling in love with him. This sets up what is a nonstandard ending to a romance movie, but the payoff is satisfying enough that you aren't in the least disappointed.","user":"Watcher-37","rank":[36,44]},{"title":"Sensitive straight/gay romance pre-\"Will & Grace\"","rating":6,"date":"19 August 2005","review":"Screenwriter Wendy Wasserstein, adapting Stephen McCauley's novel, begins with a premise which is pure formula: an unmarried mother-to-be in New York City would rather raise her child with her gay best friend rather than with the baby's father. What appears to be a continuation of themes begun with 1997's \"My Best Friend's Wedding\" fortunately leads to a sensitive, perceptive straight/gay platonic romance pre-\"Will &amp; Grace\". A large part of the film's success belongs to Jennifer Aniston (an easy presence on the screen) and Paul Rudd (who is charming without effort, even if some of his dialogue is a little cloying). There's also a moving story thread involving Nigel Hawthorne as an elderly gay man who is cruelly dumped-on by his young lover that shows the sometimes fickle nature inherent in gay relationships, handled with quiet taste by director Nicholas Hytner. Despite a downright peculiar finish (which gives new meaning to the term \"feel good\"), \"The Object of My Affection\" is a sweet, insightful comedy-drama that gets into that curious area not many movies are willing to investigate: why many straight women are drawn to having gay men as best friends, what the two have in common and, ultimately, what actions cross that invisible line between loyalty and disillusionment (which has its basis in disappointment on the woman's part that the fantasy cannot come true). Not everything works in \"Affection\", but it is remarkably pleasant and (for better or worse) hetero-friendly. **1/2 from ****","user":"moonspinner55","rank":[28,34]}]
