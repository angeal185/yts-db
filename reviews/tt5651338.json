[{"title":"Remarkable in a very understated way.....","rating":8,"date":"23 June 2018","review":"Godless Youth is actually based on a novel that takes place during the Fascist period in Germany in the 1930's. Its been adapted to modern times and wiped clean of any direct Nazi inference but the message remains unchanged. <br><br>A society that robs people of privacy, intimacy and emotional integrity whilst injecting fear and control always was and always will be dehumanizing. Godless Youth examines these issues by offering a quietly understated, voice to truth. <br><br>This is by no means a fast paced film.Its slow burn and brings things together gradually by showing you a key event from the perspectives of different players. In have to say it was not what I expected but it all works beautifully when the threads of the story are drawn together.. <br><br>All in all a modest yet remarkable film. 8/10 from me.","user":"s3276169","rank":[16,20]},{"title":"Jugend ohne Gott Review","rating":7,"date":"10 July 2019","review":"This movie is exactly the opposite of High Society, but with the same cast and location. The cast is good and the story itself is not terrible, but it seems the film tries too hard to be conceptual with its pseudo-deconstructions of society and hierarchy.","user":"felipepm17","rank":[1,1]}]
