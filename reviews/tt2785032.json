[{"title":"The Little Death - 8/10","rating":8,"date":"19 February 2015","review":"I've seen my fair share of comedies, to be honest its one of my favourite genre of film and television. However, when I sat down with my fianc√© to watch The Little Death, I didn't quite expect the disturbing hilarity which ensued.<br><br>IMDb describes the film as \"a truly original comedy about sex, love, relationships and taboo.\" and I would certainly agree with them. Write and director, Josh Lawson (Anchorman 2), perfectly combines the awkwardness of discussing sex and fetishes with a funny and provocative insight into the lives of these fictional couples.<br><br>From foot fetishes to rape fantasies, nothing is off limits here and the unfortunate involvement of a sign language translator in a sex chat call tops it off perfectly and had me dreading the next scene for fear of my sides actually splitting.<br><br>In simple terms, The Little Death is a humorous take on some moderately serious views on modern day sex and gives the more vanilla viewer an insight into the lives of people who could easily be our neighbours.<br><br>My vote, 8/10. Just watch out for the resident sex offender, Gollywogs can be a frightening distraction....<br><br>Marc Tew entertainment.uk.to","user":"marc-243-908594","rank":[37,44]},{"title":"A comedy about sex that is sexy and funny","rating":9,"date":"5 April 2015","review":"This is the Hollywood's golden fleece, the sex comedy that Hollywood is always trying to make, and reliably always falls flat on its face with. And amazingly, all of a sudden there is this tiny movie that nobody counted on, and it's perfect, and it's from Australia.<br><br>It's not even that it's an \"alternative\" film. The actors have that glossy soap-opera-star quality to them that I hate so much about Hollywood. They live in better apartments than me, they drive better cars then me (or, they drive cars), their engagement rings are way clunkier than anything I could afford. One major difference between this and the standard Hollywood fare is that the whole shindig is never trying to suck up to me by trying to make me feel like I'm part of this world. Most of all, though, the script is simply outstanding. As it should be if someone has to invest a mountain of money to turn it into a movie. Next, the actors know their craft. They're not just better looking people whom someone has put in front of a camera. And that's pretty much all their is to the big mystery why Hollywood apparently can't make a good sex comedy.<br><br>PS: This movie entertained me while I was watching it, and kept me thinking afterwards.","user":"Karl Self","rank":[29,34]},{"title":"Excellent Writing","rating":8,"date":"24 January 2015","review":"This movie really exceeded all my expectations. I was expecting lewd humour and Viagra jokes, what I saw was far from that. The movie is about sexual deviations and fantasies and how it affects relationships, and it looks at that subject with in a lighthearted way, but never over the top.<br><br>This movie wouldn't have worked without the excellent writing and directing of Josh Lawson, each time something happens or a character appears, I think to myself \"That's what's gonna probably happen\", but Lawson surprises me every time I thought that. The stories were well written and how they all come together in the end was brilliant.<br><br>This was my first experience with Australian comedy, and I will surely watch more of it in the future after this movie.","user":"DonLosKenitres","rank":[48,64]}]
