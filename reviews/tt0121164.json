[{"title":"The Corpse Bride Is To Die For","rating":9,"date":"1 October 2005","review":"I think that The Corpse Bride is a beautiful story. It's about true love and kindness. Johnny Depp is a perfect Victor Van Dort and all the characters are played wonderfully. The animation is superb from facial expressions to a reflection in a tear drop. The ending is one worth waiting for. It's an excellent film that all families should see. I'd suggest not taking children younger than 8 or 9. They might not understand the story line that young, but they'll love the dancing skeletons and the fun songs! That was a surprise: all the songs they sang. If there's one song you must hear it has to be the skeleton one, but also the piano sequence is beautiful as well. Hope you enjoy the film as much as I did!","user":"naturenut","rank":[148,176]},{"title":"Entertaining movie, won't disappoint those that want to see it","rating":8,"date":"2 August 2005","review":"I got to go to an advance screening of 'Corpse Bride'. The anticipation for the movie was high as the theater audience was clapping and yelling.<br><br>I had been afraid this was going to be too reminiscent of 'Nightmare Before Christmas', but it was delightfully original. That is potentially what I enjoyed most about the movie. It's quite an original story.<br><br>I commend Burton and all those who worked on this movie. I really enjoy watching the animation, and the characters are all very well developed. It's so good in fact, that I can't imagine this movie being done with real actors.<br><br>The songs in this movie are good and enjoyable. I don't enjoy them as much as I did 'Nightmare's', but they do justice.<br><br>The voice work in this movie is great. Depp(whose praise I'm not sure will ever stop) did excellent work. I don't think I would've known it was him, that is if I hadn't already. Albert Finney is great, and it's so nice to hear Michael Gough.<br><br>My only criticism of this movie is they don't always take enough time. It starts off wonderfully with the wedding rehearsal, introducing us to the characters and the situation. Then Victor takes ends up \"running into\" the corpse bride, goes to the \"underworld\", and the whole thing is explained with a song. I was left wanting more when it came to the corpse bride and the underworld. Then the movie continues at a nice level, just that one part left me wanting more.<br><br>It's a good movie. If you want to see it you shan't be disappointed. If you don't want to see it, it might be a pleasant surprise.","user":"LivinForMovies","rank":[236,290]},{"title":"A Work of Dark Art","rating":8,"date":"5 October 2005","review":"After enchanting audiences with \"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\" Tim Burton brings another stop-motion animated spectacle, \"Corpse Bride.\" In this story, Victor Van Dort, an inept young groom-to-be, can't make his way through his wedding rehearsal. Going outside to get his lines right, he accidentally winds up marrying the corpse of a murdered bride-to-be. The animation is spectacular, proving stop-motion can be good enough to compete with computer animation. Johnny Depp provides the voice of Victor, showing mild-mannered and nervous grace. Helena Bonham Carter is the voice of Emily, the Corpse Bride, giving the dead character lively emotion. One striking element of the movie is the color scheme. In the living world, there is no bright color, making a near-black and white appearance. The story is well-written, and the music is good. Overall, \"Corpse Bride\" must definitely be seen!","user":"EmperorNortonII","rank":[70,83]}]
