[{"title":"Tarkovsky's Final Masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"18 February 2005","review":"Andrei Tarkovsky was without a doubt one of the genuine artist working in the cinema. With films such as \"Andrei Rublev\", \"Solaris\", \"Mirror\", Stalker\" and \"Nostalghia\", Tarkovsky enriched the world with powerful works for art. \"Sacrifice\" was his final film, made while Tarkovsky was dying of cancer. The story concerns an elderly academic who lives with his family in a rural part of Sweden. When he learns that about an imminent nuclear war, he makes a desperate pact with God. The film is astonishingly beautiful, like all Tarkovsky's films. Images of nature, water and fire feature prominently, as does the shifting from colour images to black and white.<br><br>It is important to remember that Tarkovsky is not a very accessible film-maker, and his films make great demands on viewer's patience and attention, but if you are willing to make the effort you will be rewarded by an unforgettable experience.","user":"RobertF87","rank":[124,145]},{"title":"Offret","rating":10,"date":"21 September 2004","review":"SPOILER: This is the best movie I have seen so far. I watch it again about once or twice a year, like a ritual or an annual holiday I would be taking into levels of consciousness where the mind is not really required. I do not understand, and I do not feel like I have to, it is secondary. I feel touched like only pure and silent beauty can touch me, or bliss. It is obviously created around an idea of sacrifice, being both a gift to others but also to ourselves. By offering his life in order to save his family, his grandson and the world, the main character is also giving a true meaning to his own life that had mostly been of artificiality, questionings and shallowness. Every person who enters the house, he starts seeing under a deeper if not more expressionistic light... And when he meets with magic (while making love with the witch) he creates the bridge that will take him from reality into mystery. The whole film is as breathtaking and self-sufficient as a painting, or even more so, a Russian icon. It is ageless. I suppose it will remain with me for my entire life. I consider it Tarkovsky's last will, but even more so a piece of the Human Heritage that should be protected and kept accessible for future generation.","user":"maeva","rank":[96,121]},{"title":"Find it, Get it somehow... It will change your life.","rating":10,"date":"25 January 1999","review":"I have just registered to the database, and this is my first review that I've written for it.  The first film I thought of was The Sacrifice, Andrei Tarkovsky's final masterwork, and in my opinion his best.  This film affected me like no other, and forced me to look at Tarkovsky in an all new light, as a spiritual creator.  See this film, I guarantee it will change your outlook on life if you give it the chance.  It is the most challenging, spiritually invigorating film I have ever seen, by truly the greatest cinematic poet/visionary of all time.  Tarkvosky is the future of cinema, the one who carried the torch, the one whom all aspiring cinematic artists should look to, and a genius who passed far before his rightful time.","user":"Sculptor","rank":[86,109]}]
