[{"title":"Innocent special effects romp is highly enjoyable","rating":8,"date":"14 February 2019","review":"I guess the the way to describe this movie is Ghostbusters lit up in neon. Please see it just for the cgi, it's awesome. If you have the dvd look for the short on how they created one of the cute characters. The comedy is snappy, almost witty, and yet nothing new, but it works. You'll smile rather than laugh out loud. The story is absurd, which is exactly what we pay Hollywood for, and with this one they've outdone themselves. There's a classic chase. There's a great cameo appearance. There's a cleverly worded love affair. There's a great homage to nerds of the 1980s and overall, I thought, a really whacky satire of big budget invasion movies. It's just such fun.","user":"robertemerald","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Highly underrated","rating":7,"date":"5 January 2019","review":"A fun movie, with bright actors. Entertaining and authentic. Worth surely the view","user":"nicknic","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"Ignore The Pretentious & Pompous Film Critics","rating":8,"date":"29 September 2015","review":"I'm really not quite sure what the film critics were expecting from this film. It's a movie about a video game apocalypse starring Adam Sandler. What in the world were they expecting? Citizen Kane? The Godfather? <br><br>The problem with these so-called film critics today is that they're impervious to accepting anything at face value. I believe it got such awful review from critics because it starred a lot of big name actors and maybe they expected more substance from them; but you have to look at the source material before making those determinations. This is a tongue-in-cheek slapstick comedy that's meant to entertain people especially those who grew up in the 80's and can relate to the video game evolution nostalgia of that time. If you watch this movie with that mindset, I guarantee you will not be disappointed.","user":"angelamparo","rank":[191,287]}]
