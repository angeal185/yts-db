[{"title":"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Exceeds already high expectations","rating":9,"date":"25 March 2018","review":"Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.<br><br>I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.<br><br>Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.<br><br>Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.<br><br>Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.<br><br>This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.<br><br>With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.<br><br>This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.<br><br>Masterpiece.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Cast are great again<br><br>Charm returns<br><br>Excellent nostalgic soundtrack<br><br>Looks amazing<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!<br><br>They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes away<br><br>Michael Rosenbaum was wasted<br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[49,67]},{"title":"Great sequel overall","rating":8,"date":"20 August 2017","review":"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great movie, and I would say better than the recent superhero movies. I'm afraid thought that the first movie set the expectations so high that is not crazy to doubt if this one was able to keep up.<br><br>Visually is as good as the first one, the acting is on point and the soundtrack is dope. The plot is fine, although it falls under the \"knowing better the characters and realizing their sad and deep feelings\" clich√©. It leaves me with the feeling that the first one was innovative and fresh, wherever this one just reused the formula.<br><br>Apart from that, this is an entertaining and fun movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who is into superhero or science fiction movies. It doesn't disappoint.","user":"crberme","rank":[41,61]},{"title":"Almost as funny and charming as the first","rating":7,"date":"24 April 2017","review":"As someone who was floored by the first film, I was eager to see how the second installment in Gunn's trilogy(yes, it's a trilogy now) would pan out. To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot to say.","user":"Harun_Karali","rank":[217,370]}]
