[{"title":"Where's The European Uncut Print ?","rating":1,"date":"1 July 2011","review":"In Ostend Belgium, when this movie came out, it was packed in the cinema/movie theatre. I was 20 back then. I remember that at the end the lady was fully nude running out of the prison. In the DVD's today there are many scenes missing that I remember from watching it complete.<br><br>In 2011 no movie should be released cut anymore. Maybe a movie is too long to some people, but I personally do not like it at all when scenes are missing when I buy a movie. The Internet Movie Database says it has a 126 minutes projection time, but all I can find around the globe is a 118 minute version. I respect those who write here that they are for or against this movie. But ...let's be able to judge it uncut. Come on Warner, where is the complete movie. ?","user":"donationz","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"The unredeemable quality of Douglas' bandit undermines the humor of the film","rating":8,"date":"22 May 2005","review":"In making \"There Was a Crooked Man\" Joseph L. Mankiewicz set out with the intention of creating a cynical Western, based on the view that there is a little bit of badness even in the best of men What emerges in this long and expert exercise is a film so thorough1y cynical, so negative in its view of the human species that the viewer is allowed no point of view of his own <br><br>For Kirk Douglas, the very crooked man of the title, the film gave scope for bravura playing but the characterization is black and utterly ruthless Mankiewicz would have done well to consider the view that there is a little bit of goodness even in the worst of men but the film remains admirable in its staging and in the performances of an exemplary cast<br><br>Douglas, wearing steel-rimmed spectacles and with his hair dyed red, appears at the beginning of the picture as a somewhat cultured bandit; he raids the home of a wealthy rancher and escapes with half a million dollars in cash...<br><br>In making his escape, several of his men are shot to death and Douglas himself kills his surviving companion Thus the swag is entirely his He hides it in a rattlesnake pit in the desert but he is later spotted in a brothel by the rancher and we next see Douglas on his way to jail <br><br>In the prison wagon are five fellow felons: Hume Cronyn and John Randolph, a pair of con-men, religious fakers and implicitly homosexual; a huge homicidal Chinaman, played by Olympic athlete C. K. Yang in a screen debut; Michael Blodgett, a young man who accidentally killed his girl friend's father when suddenly interrupted in an act of love-making; and Warren Oates, a stupid gunman who shoots sheriff Henry Fonda in the leg when the peaceful, unarmed lawman tries to persuade him to surrender<br><br>These endearing rascals are then incarcerated in a cell with a dirty old fellow called 'The Missouri Kid,' played like a ferret by Burgess Meredith<br><br>The theme, like that of all prison pictures, is escape, and with Douglas openly proud of his hidden half-million, escape becomes inevitable and the wily bandit, a born leader of men, can take his pick not only of his accomplices but of the prison warden (Martin Gabel), a degenerate gentleman, as eager to leave, his post as any prisoner <br><br>However, a noisy fight breaks out among the prisoners and in trying to stop it the warden is killed <br><br>One irony leads to another and the new warden turns out to be Henry Fonda, a solidly honest, humane man who dedicates himself to penal reform He quickly spots the officer-like qualities of Douglas and assigns him to supervising the building of a new dining hall It is during the inauguration of the building, attended by the state governor and his guests, that Douglas elects to spark a revolthis cover for escape<br><br>The motion picture is graphic in depicting the sweat and stench of life in a desert prison, and the frustration and despair of its inmates The spirit of decency, exemplified by Fonda's warden, is almost a stimulating note in an atmosphere swirling with resentment and spite <br><br>Mankiewicz' film has some memorable moments: Douglas, in his opening robbery, commenting on the excellence of the fried chicken being served at the rancher's table; Hume Cronyn, passing himself off as a deaf mute at a church gathering, backing into a hot stove and yelling a profane curse; a pretty schoolteacher reciting Henley's 'Invictus' at the dining room ceremony, watched by hundreds of hungry eyes; and in the long chaos of the revolt, a furious montage of incidents, particularly the old Missouri Kid sitting, weeping because he has been in prison too long and hasn't the courage to leave \"home,\" and Cronyn, like a firm-minded old wife, leading his companion back into their cell and telling him they will serve out their sentence","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[34,42]},{"title":"The Judgment of Paris","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2006","review":"This is an interesting black comedy, from Joseph Mankiewicz, about the gullibility of man, and how greed can corrupt anyone. Henry Fonda is a lawman, in typical Fonda-style (before WARLOCK and the spaghetti westerns changed his image). He is a firm support for law and order. However, he has been shot and left lame by Warren Oates, a drunken outlaw. He may have to retire as a result sooner than he expected. <br><br>At the start of the film we watch how Kirk Douglas (Paris Pitman) has robbed the home of Arthur O'Connor with his gang. They are killed off in one way or another. Pitman escapes with the money, and hides it in a hole full of rattlesnakes. But later he is captured. Pitman is sent to territorial prison, where he meets Oates, Burgess Meredith (as the legendary Missouri Kid), Hume Cronym and John Randolph (a pair of swindlers who are also a gay couple), and others. The warden is Martin Gabel, who soon makes it clear that if Douglas wants to be out sooner he needs the warden as a partner. But in a riot Gabel is killed, and Fonda is appointed the new warden.<br><br>Fonda tries to reform the prison, improving facilities and setting up an honor system. Douglas, the total cynic, sneers at all this, and makes his own plans. He is not going to rot for two decades or so in prison while a fortune awaits for him. So he starts plotting to get out, and Fonda keeps watching to counter his plotting.<br><br>I won't add anything else, but in the end one wonders if Paris Pitman's view of mankind is the truth of us all or not. The film has wonderful sharp comedy, including the comic put-downs of Cronyn when undercutting the pompous Randolph, and when one sees scenes like Burgess Meredith taking his first bath. I strongly recommend this film to fans of unusual westerns.","user":"theowinthrop","rank":[26,33]}]
