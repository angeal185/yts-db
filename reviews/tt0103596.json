[{"title":"Great movie!","rating":9,"date":"7 July 2000","review":"I love this movie!  Those three guys are not only great at martial arts but funny and charming actors as well.  All the kids loved it when it came out and still quote lines from this 'classic.' Yes, there are borrowed ideas (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to Home Alone...) but who doesn't? And stunt doubles for the Grandfather, but who do you think he is, Jackie Chan? Victor Wong makes a sincere grandfather/mentor.  Hey, the adult reviewers may not have enjoyed or even understood this movie, but the 'kids' that I know, did.  As for the Ninjas themselves, they acted naturally and credibly. A perfect family movie.","user":"gdkarma2","rank":[32,36]},{"title":"This movie is good....a great kids movie","rating":10,"date":"27 March 2005","review":"OK so i am getting annoyed by all these people bashing this movie....it was made for kids so obviously adults aren't going to love it...DUH!....i mean i watched this movie at least twice a month as a kid and now even though I'm 15 i'll still watch it if its on TV or if i feel like renting it....its a great way to remember what it was lyk being a a little kid....it gets kids imagination working i mean i would spend hours acting out scenes after i saw this movie...and this movie sparked such an interest in martial arts in me that i started taking lessons and now am a brown belt.....its just a fun movie the writer didn't intend it to be a classic but it is anyway to kids and grownups who are kids at heart....think b4 u speak....and don't take everything so seriously....I LOVE COLT!!!!!","user":"xbowlinangel322x","rank":[45,57]},{"title":"It doesn't stink, for a kid film","rating":21,"date":"21 August 2003","review":"Somebody posted complaining about how three kids cannot beat up 30 or 40 bad men. Well if you were a kid, you'd adore this film. I first saw this film when I was I believe five years old. I grew up watching the movies along with the rest of the series: 3 NINJAS KICK BACK and 3 NINJAS KNUCKLE UP. I'm not trying to sound cheesy or anything. I rather watch the series than watching Teenage Ninja Turtles. I think every generation of young kids would have liked 3 Ninjas if they are really interest in Martial Arts. Sure, the film will probably fade away from our interests as we grow up. But in my own opinion and my experiences, I think 3 Ninjas was one of the excellent film of early 1990s that young viewers would enjoy. Now I'm a teenager and I laugh at the thoughts of how obessed I was with 3 Ninjas but that doesn't mean I shouldn't destroy it existence.","user":"static_in_the_sky","rank":[26,34]}]
