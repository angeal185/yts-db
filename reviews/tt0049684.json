[{"title":"comments from someone who saw the movie in 1956 (15 times)","rating":27,"date":"27 June 2001","review":"A movie that pre-dates music videos by a number of years, \"Rock, Rock, Rock\" showcased a number of well-known and not so well-known groups in a venue that, admittedly, had very little plot.  However, this was 1956, and to have Alan Freed take groups that had, and still were having, so much social impact in \"the real world\" and put them together on celluloid was a marvellous event.  Again, this was 1956, and I don't think I would have seen Cirino and the Bowties, Johnny Burnette, Teddy Randazzo, Jimmy Cavallo and the Houserockers anywhere else during that period.  I watched/shouted to/screamed to/danced/to this movie in 1956 (at 10 years of age) and have seen it about 14-15 times since.  I'm certain that had I seen it in 1999 for the first time, my point of view would have been much different, but that's only natural.  After all, what kind of critical analysis will Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" get in the year  2020?  If you can look at this movie with \"1956 eyes,\" you get a heck of a lot more than just \"weak plot.\" By the way, Chubby Checker was NOT in this film.","user":"fsapp","rank":[27,32]},{"title":"Rock before the \"black out\"","rating":7,"date":"28 January 2001","review":"Alan Freed knew that blacks(Negroes then) were the pioneers of the Rock 'n' Role era, and he was not afraid to showcase them. All of the bands, including the white ones, put on a rocking showcase of a pretty good cross section of rock of the time, including \"Rock-a-Billy\".<br><br>The obvious star of this sitcom like plot, however, is a gorgeous Tuesday Weld at age thirteen (It is hard to believe such a beautiful woman was even more beautiful as a child).  Who shows a grace and charm that are far beyond those of the other \"teenagers\" in the movie.<br><br>Definitely a highly entertaining historical document of the times.","user":"rlcsljo","rank":[22,29]},{"title":"Wow wow wow","rating":7,"date":"15 March 2006","review":"This essential time capsule musical from the very dawn of Rock and Roll is really beyond criticism. Many other comments bleat about the quality and the story, but really, would you prefer it did not exist? Is \"EIGHT MILE\" or (groan) \"COOL AS ICE\"or (double groan) \"GET RICH OR DIE Trying'' a better reminder of their music and time in history? Alan Freed should be almost revered for the work he did in promoting rock and roll in the mid 50s and it is because of him this astonishing record of fascinating music acts of 1955/56 exists. Reacting to it as if it was made today is ridiculous. ROCK ROCK ROCK is a complete world unto itself and made with a keen-ness to entertain and elate through some of the essential music stars of the day. It is also charming. Something none of the other three films mentioned above are or could be in the slightest., given their retarded aggression. ROCK ROCK ROCK is fun and a real surprise. A good complimentary film is the 1976 drama \"AMERICAN HOT WAX\" which is a bio of Alan Freed with spectacular recreations of the 50s and the Brooklyn Paramount days with Freed causing dancing strife with uptight authorities. Believe it or like it or not.","user":"ptb-8","rank":[19,25]}]
