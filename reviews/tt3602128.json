[{"title":"A zombie movie that stands out!","rating":9,"date":"28 September 2015","review":"Loved it! It is kind of Shaun of the Dead kind of flick, a romantic zombie comedy, but pretty fresh and funny and entertaining and cool. The actress that plays Deb, the lead character, is fantastic, charming and funny. Ray Wise has a great supporting role. The music, the sound, photography, effects - all together made a very good movie in every level. The director played nicely with clich√©s, made a very light but exciting movie with zombies, and since there is so much zombies these days, it is a great success to make a movie that can stand out. Well done in every way! I saw it at the closing of Dead Lake festival in Palic, Serbia. Highly recommended.","user":"Tokiwood","rank":[48,79]},{"title":"Unfunny Dialogues and Situations","rating":5,"date":"13 November 2016","review":"On the Eve of July, 4th, in Portland, Maine, the camerawoman and aspiring anchor Deb Clarington (Maria Thayer) is drinking with her best friend Ruby (Julie Brister) in a bar. She falls for a handsome stranger and flirts with him. They drink a lot together and in the morning, Deb wakes up in his apartment in an awkward situation since they do not remember what they did on the previous night. When Deb leaves his apartment, she finds in middle of a zombie apocalypse. She returns to the apartment and she learns that he is Ryan Waverly (Michael Cassidy), the son of the wealthy Frank Waverly (Ray Wise), who is the responsible for supplying water to the town. Deb decides to leave Portland to meet her mother, but Ryan convinces her to go to the mansion of his father to meet his brother Chaz Waverly (Chris Marquette) and his girlfriend Stacy (Syd Wilder) and leave the town together. Soon Den learns that Frank and the Governor are the responsible for the outbreak. Will they succeed to escape from the zombies?<br><br>\"Night of the Living Deb\" is one of those films that the viewer wants to like, mostly because of the cute lead actress. However the writers are weak and the cast has unfunny dialogues and situations in the screenplay. In the end, this movie is a waste of a nice cast. My vote is five.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[10,16]},{"title":"Romantic Zombie Comedy","rating":7,"date":"17 August 2016","review":"While I wouldn't call it flavor of the month, the last couple of years saw a bit of a rise. Not only of the dead themselves but a rise in zombie comedies with a romantic touch. Some worked better than others, some just try to be a bit funny. And that is what this movie is. It's not an instant classic or anything, but it does what the box says and it's entertaining enough to watch.<br><br>It starts off innocently enough, just to turn things up and speed things up a bit. The main actress is what either will draw you into it or appall you. I thought she was really funny and did a great job. Of course it's silly, it's meant to be that way. I mean the title along indicates that (how come no one thought of that before I wonder?) ... It's actually pretty easy to decide if you like this or not, but something I can't do for you of course","user":"kosmasp","rank":[12,22]}]
