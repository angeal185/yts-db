[{"title":"\"Night of the Felines\"","rating":6,"date":"31 January 2016","review":"Although this movie was somewhat difficult for me to fathom at times, from what I gather \"Masako\" (Tomoko Katsura) is a prostitute who works at a bathhouse called \"the Turkish Paradise\" in downtown Tokyo. Apparently, she is sexually involved with her bisexual neighbor in the next apartment who goes by the name of \"Honda\" (Ken Yoshizawa). Honda's other lover is a male prostitute named \"Makoto\" (Hidetoshi Kageyama) who has recently fallen in love with a young woman. The problem is that Makoto has only been involved in gay relationships and doesn't know how to make love to a woman. So he asks Honda to help him out. Realizing that he cannot be there in bed with the two of them Honda agrees to watch from the next room. Unfortunately, while Makoto struggles in vain to satisfy her, the woman happens to see Honda watching and angrily storms out of the apartment. This creates a problem not just for Makoto and Honda but for Masako as well. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that there was quite a bit of sex and nudity but not very much character development or general information for the viewer to grasp onto. Again, while I may not have all of the details totally correct, I still thought it was an interesting movie with enough comedy and erotic scenes involving the beautiful Tomoko Katsura to keep things fairly entertaining. That being the case, I rate this film as slightly better than average.","user":"Uriah43","rank":[1,2]}]
