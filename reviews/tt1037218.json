[{"title":"There is nothing foolish about this film.","rating":9,"date":"19 April 2008","review":"Although Flashbacks of a Fool is Daniel Craig's pet project  he's the film's executive producer as well as its star  it actually contains surprisingly little of the blonde hunk (though for the ladies out there, you do, admittedly, get to see his bum).<br><br>Craig plays Joe Scott, a movie star who has plenty of money and sexual satisfaction in his life, one which - when he is not indulging in coke-addled rumpy pumpy at least - is mostly spent looking out to the sea from his minimalist cliff-top pad.<br><br>Yet he has no real friends and seemingly no real future  \"there's no role for you ANYWHERE,\" his agent tells Joe, a moment after he has seen his client throw his prized mobile phone out of a restaurant window.<br><br>As Joe begins to wonder what has happened to his life, we are taken back to his adolescent days of first love on the quiet English seaside, to discover what this Brit has in fact been trying to hide from with a life of debauchery and excess in LA.<br><br>Even a fan of this film should be able see why some might find it slow and slightly dull, as it does rely on the viewer sharing in a sense of glory in the mystical power of great records, the tragic romance of nostalgia and regret, and the theme of washed-up stardom.<br><br>Perhaps that provides limited scope for the film to garner a wide audience, but for those who can find true enjoyment from subtle portrayals of youth and humanity as much as from the more obvious merits of rapid plot progression that will matter little. The direction is superb, the script never feels rushed, and the wistful tone of someone looking back to their yesterdays to get on with their today is rare in its realisation of artistic vision.<br><br>There's no big finale, but that's not to say that the conclusion is anything less than perfect in its mood and its timing. A literate film that is there to relish on a quiet afternoon, Flashbacks of a Fool feels more typical of a book by Ian McEwan (though thankfully it bears little in common to the cinematic version of Atonement) than a film starring the current Bond. It could also have you listening to Roxy Music for the rest of your weekend, even if you've never before had the urge to sing along to Bryan Ferry in the bath - a pleasing added bonus.<br><br>There is nothing foolish about this film  watch it accordingly.","user":"robhastings1000","rank":[112,124]},{"title":"Quite possibly my favourite movie of 2008 - A story told with heartfelt emotion","rating":9,"date":"26 February 2009","review":"There's a saying I heard a long time ago... \"The person that's got everything has nothing\" and this movie kind of explains one way of looking at it (in my opinion).<br><br>In a materialistic influenced world we live in it can be easy to fall into how believing happiness and wellbeing comes only from having all the things wealth can bring i.e. the clean cut minimalist house walking out onto the white sand overlooking a beautiful serene sea, a selection of gleaming new sports cars, the tailored clothes etc etc. But I guess for some people who have reached this place/goal in their life have focused on the goal so much that they've forgotten where they've come from and what they may have been running from.<br><br>Now what this gem of a movie does is carefully and meticulously unravel the story of a troubled man in this very situation, dealing with the daemons of his past, the spontaneous difficult decisions he had to make as a boy which has carved this stone cold embodiment of a man on the edge of existence.<br><br>Now I'm not going to break down and dissect this film and give a whole rundown on how and why I think this is a great movie but I will say this. The story of a nasty main character (amazing job from both Daniel Craig and Harry Eden) and showing the world that he lives in and lived in by slowly letting the viewer past his metaphorical protective wall while allowing the viewer to piece together how and why he is the way he is, is presented exquisitely.<br><br>I don't want to give anything away on the plot and story but I have to say there where two parts that absolutely blew me away and I'll just give you a vague hint. One involving a shot of artwork with intention of displaying a contrast of relation between the background and foreground giving an artistic viewpoint on the real subject matter (works on so many levels) and the other being a close up shot which encapsulated a lot of emotion and made my heart just drop.<br><br>all in all the whole production was done well, especially the editing (even though it's obviously apparent they had some great content to work with) and did, for me, what all great stories do, kept me entertained through demanding my full attention and rewarding that attention in the form of an emotional roller-coaster.<br><br>Last note: please try not to second guess while trying to predict what's coming next and how it ends. Just enjoy the story that is being told because it's been executed very well.<br><br>PS: I would have given this a 10 but wanted other readers to take this review seriously as I do love the art of storytelling, especially a good movie and it's unfortunate that there's too many marketing teams pushing up star ratings here on IMDb.<br><br>Thanks for reading my first review and I hope you enjoy \"Flashbacks of a Fool\" as much as I did.","user":"Sux_S_P","rank":[54,61]},{"title":"I saw it 1st","rating":7,"date":"8 February 2008","review":"This is my 1st ever post on IMDb so I apologise in advance if it's crap! I was 1 of the 1st members of public to see this film as I attended a preview for research and marketing purposes and i had to fill in a questionnaire at the end...yadayadayada (U know what i mean). The film was not what i expected at all. I was expecting a load of drug taking scenes and thought the whole film would have a \"dirty\" feel to it such as \"Blow\" or \"Pulp Fiction\" but it actually turned out to be a very sensitive film. I was moved by the emotional story of this guy's messed up childhood. I was extremely impressed by Claire Forlani's performance even though she's not in the film for that long. This film will give you goosebumps and a trembling lip from the emotional roller-coaster that is this Flashbacks Of A Fool. Good film. Girls in their 30s to late 40s will prefer it to guys. Great 70s Soundtrack (and that's coming from me, a 23 year old!) The soundtrack album should be really good.<br><br>Thanks for devoting 2 minutes of your life to read this! I really appreciate it.","user":"sebastian_n","rank":[227,293]}]
