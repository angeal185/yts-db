[{"title":"The movie is fine, but treat yourself and read the book too","rating":5,"date":"17 April 2004","review":"Based on some of the other comments I was expecting to hate this movie.  I didn't, but I see why the reviews seem so negative.  There are so many things to pick at, and no real bright spots to talk up.<br><br>It really wasn't that bad.  It wasn't great, but it's worth a rental.  I'm not sure I would have felt I got my money's worth in the theater.<br><br>\nI'm sure it was a tough chore to convert the original story to a 2-hour movie script.  They had to take several liberties and condense quite a bit to do so.  Unfortunately, that affected the flow and the movie ends up being a little choppy.  How and why they go back in time is pretty well cut out of the movie and without any detail the believability is nil.  The story boils down to a pretty standard chase and explosion thriller set in the middle ages.<br><br>Definitely treat yourself to a read of the book the movie is based on. Like any book, the depth of characterization is so much more rich and interesting than what comes through in the movie.  Once you get past the introductory technical jargon to set up the story it is a real page turner.","user":"n7zuq","rank":[121,146]},{"title":"Enjoyed It","rating":8,"date":"7 March 2005","review":"I truly enjoyed this movie. It really isn't as bad as most of the reviews I've read make it out to be. It was not horrible or a waste of time. I rented it first and liked it so much I bought it. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi movies for their entertainment value. I haven't read the book, so I can't make any comparisons. I think the whole story came together smoothly. Overall the acting was good, however Paul Walker would probably benefit from a few more classes. Gerard Butler was awesome in his role as Marek. I have a feeling we'll be seeing a lot him in the future (no pun intended). I loved the beginning, the end, and everything in between. I give it a strong 8.","user":"phoebes_jeebies","rank":[137,193]},{"title":"If this concept interests you, take the time to read the book.","rating":23,"date":"23 April 2005","review":"I rented this movie knowing that is it based on a Michael Crichton book. The Movie was somewhat entertaining if you could get past the acting. The sets and the costumes were done well and the battle scenes were plausible. However if you read the book there is so much more to explore with the characters and the action. This book was written so it could be a movie. Ten years down the road this should be remade for justice sake. A mini series on could be in order because of the additional scenes that would be needed. And no I am not naive, I know that in any adaptation sacrifices must be made but I feel that because they got a big name to play Chris the centered the movie around him when it is clearly better balanced in the book. I am not a book snob but I saw so much potential in this concept that I felt that the movie was unfinished. That is why I read the book. Judge for your self.","user":"bear_78","rank":[49,66]}]
