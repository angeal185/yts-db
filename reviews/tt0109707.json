[{"title":"The Best of Burton-Depp","rating":10,"date":"21 April 2004","review":"Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. \"When you re-write a script it gets better and better\" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like \"Nick of Time\" \"The Astronaut's Wife\" and \"Secret Window\" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a \"safe\", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!","user":"filmquestint","rank":[251,281]},{"title":"Burton's grand masterpiece, too bad so few have noticed","rating":10,"date":"25 February 2004","review":"As one of the most overlooked films ever made, \"Ed Wood\" does for Tim Burton what \"Malcolm X\" did for Spike Lee and \"JFK\" did for Oliver Stone, it ruins any expectations one can have of Tim Burton, because he has set a standard here that he will never achieve again.  An interest in the period in which it is set is essential, given the set decoration is the film's greatest triumph.  It's not surprising that Burton's first \"biopic\" is about someone revered in the b-movie heyday of the 1950s - that spawned Burton himself. Burton must have felt he had to make this picture because without filmmakers like Ed Wood, Burton himself would have never existed. Set in seedy B-movie Hollywood in the mid 1950s - and wisely and beautifully shot in black-and-white, Johnny Depp plays the titular character; a young, talentless, but optimistic auteur who dreams of being a film director; going so far as to model himself after his idol, Orson Welles.  Despite an over-reliance on stock footage, a tin ear for dialogue, and a fondness for wacky, exploitative horror and sci-fi fare, Wood wiggles his way into B-moviedom.  Casting anyone willing to step before his camera, Wood cranks out a series of cheesy movies.<br><br>When he has a chance encounter with horror film legend Bela Lugosi, now a 74 year-old, foul-mouthed morphine addict wrecked by his lost fame, Ed sees his meal-ticket. Quick for his next fix, Lugosi doesn't seem to mind that Wood is also an out-and-proud transvestite with a particular fondness for Angora sweaters, and soon begins starring in Wood's features. Lugosi, played by Martin Landau, gives the story its biggest jolts of energy. Landau is hysterical in scene after scene utilizing the \"dirty old man\" routine. Remember, there is nothing funnier on earth than an old man who likes profanity.  A gentle - albeit somewhat fictionalized - bond forms between Wood and Lugosi.  Depp does a spectacular job of fleshing out Wood's quirky innocence and unbridled passion for moviemaking.  This may also be the only Johnny Depp film where you actually see him smile!<br><br>What ultimately makes this film so stellar is the impeccable production and costume design and the crisp B&amp;W cinematography; it literally transports you back to the clean-cut, wide-eyed days of the 1950s.  I cannot recommend this film enough if you have an interest in the world of 1950s B-movies that produced titles like \"Teenagers From Outer Space\" and \"Project Moonbase\". This film functions quite well as a time warp.  I liken \"Ed Wood\" to epics like \"JFK\" because like those films, this movie doesn't seem to be about what happens as much as how it FEELS to be there; and that's what draws me to the film every time I see it.  With \"Ed Wood\", I'm not always interested in following the story, but I'm totally fascinated with being inside that world.  Tim Burton did the best job that anyone could in taking you there.","user":"JawsOfJosh","rank":[284,326]},{"title":"Nice to meet you Mr. Wood","rating":10,"date":"24 August 2005","review":"It is a well known fact by now that Johnny Depp is a subtle, tender, beautiful force of nature. Tim Burton has been able to create universes that Johnny Depp can inhabit with the strange naturalness of someone who belongs. \"Ed Wood\" is the ultimate demonstration of that theory. You're introduced to the world of someone who appears almost a figment of someone's imagination to realise that there is something of him in you and me. What is incredible is that the realisation comes hand in hand with a personal discovery. That funny weird kid represents more than something but the best of you and me. Angora sweaters and childish dreams. The purity of an artist with a talent that is concentrated in his heart. Remember the Salieri of \"Amadeus\" torturing himself cursing God for giving him the gift of recognising the talent in others without having any of his own. Ed Wood, as told by Burton and Depp, is so far away from that pathology that to watch his films after having met him with Johnny's face is an entirely different experience. Everything makes sense. Strangely enough (or not) \"Ed Wood\" died at the box office but as it happens more often than not, \"Ed Wood\" is more alive today than many of the greatest moneymakers of all time. Yes, that business of time never fails. Greatness prevails.","user":"axlgarland","rank":[121,137]}]
