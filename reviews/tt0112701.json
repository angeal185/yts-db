[{"title":"Amusing, or diverting...not \"such fun\"","rating":11,"date":"11 March 2000","review":"I simply adore this movie!  From beginning to end it shines with wit and hilarious depravity.  Having read the book, I think it safe to say that this is one of the best transitions from page to screen.  Everyone is perfectly cast in this - particularly Kate Beckinsale as Flora, Joanna Lumley as Mrs. Smiling, Eileen Atkins as Judith and Ian McKellen as Amos.  Rufus Sewell makes for great eye-candy as Seth, and the virtually unknown Maria Miles is adorable as Elfine.  Aunt Ada Doom, played by Sheila Burrell, constantly reminds us that \"There have always been Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm,\" and although it's probably best to keep it that way, she's in for a few surprises.  Flora's dealings with Mr. Mybug, hysterically portrayed by Stephen Fry, are alone worth the price of renting this movie. <br><br>Flora's decision to go to Cold Comfort Farm after her parents die sets the tone for the rest of the movie; it sounds \"Interesting and appalling...the others just sound appalling!\"  If you want a good chuckle, or just love good British humor, by all means, see this movie!","user":"SarahNM","rank":[74,75]},{"title":"\"I'd take the old woman as well -- but she's so gloomy!\"","rating":6,"date":"6 September 2004","review":"This film was produced for BBC television but had a theatrical release the next year -- probably to take advantage of the popularity of all those Jane Austen movies (Emma, Persuasion, et. al.) It is not a Jane Austen story, but it is a sort of genial romance/comedy of manners (set in the early 1930's?) with a plucky, bright, but penniless heroine. The book it was based on was actually a parody of Gothic romance fiction. Even though this movie is played for laughs (and has many), it still manages to make you care for the characters. Everything works here and (editing, cinematography, performances) and you really appreciate what the director, John Schlesinger, managed to do on a probably skimpy budget.<br><br>This movie was the first I ever saw of Kate Beckinsale and I thought she was fantastic in it. I remained a fan for a long while, even though her subsequent movie performances (and choices) have been awful. She finally lost me with her recent laughable turn in Van Helsing. Nevertheless, she WAS good in Cold Comfort Farm, so if you're no fan of Beckinsale don't let that dissuade you from seeing this movie.<br><br>Other standouts in the cast are Eileen Atkins, Rufus Sewell, and Ian McKellen who is screamingly funny as a fire and brimstone preacher.<br><br>This film is definitely worth having on video or DVD in that it bears up very well to repeated viewings. I've seen it at least 5 times since its release, and my estimation of it rises with each viewing.","user":"dennisayers","rank":[56,57]},{"title":"Delightfully funny and gorgeously imaginative!","rating":10,"date":"2 September 2003","review":"Cold Comfort Farm has been and remains one of my favorite movies of all time. Why? Simple: it is hilarious, has a star-studded and perfect ensemble cast, and is a beautiful adaptation of an equally, if not more hilarious, book. When one thinks about this movie, one always returns to the cast and how well-suited they were for their roles. Kate Beckinsale fits perfectly in the role of London d√©butante Flora Poste who, like Jane Austen, \"could not endure a mess.\" Ian McKellen plays his role to fire and brimstone perfection. Rufus Sewell is remarkably well suited as the smoldering Seth with his brooding eyes and husky, outdoors-y sentiments. Eileen Atkins plays the extremely depressed, reverse-Oedipal mother of Seth in all her exceptional oddness. This is but naming a few of the fabulous cast members that fills this film. The film itself is beautifully filmed and beautifully acted. I would highly recommend it to anyone who 1)enjoys subtle British humor and 2)just enjoys an all-around excellent film.","user":"Cini34","rank":[57,62]}]
