[{"title":"Cheap, Quick, and Funny.","rating":10,"date":"4 January 2001","review":"I actually saw this in the theatre where they filmed the movie theatre sequence just a few months before. I think the movie was only out for about a week, but my buddies and I caught it twice! Even dragged our drama teacher to see it (he loved it).<br><br>This is the kind of high-school humor that was a carry over from the Three Stooges and is still going strong, but Landis was one of the first to bring it up to date.<br><br>I think they shot this in 16mm (it looks it) and the photography has all the depth of a Wilderness Family entry, but the laughs are very much there. And this had one of the most memorable ad campaign tag lines in history: \"Due to the horrifying nature of this film, no one will be admitted.\"<br><br>It was also the only film I know of which had ads featuring a rave by Johnny Carson. It's low budget, but high yuks. I still remember it fondly (Hey, Landis, please return to your comic roots of the 70s and 80s; we don't need another Woody Allen).","user":"Mr. OpEd","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"The Funniest Movie I Ever Saw","rating":10,"date":"31 May 2005","review":"*WARNING: MORE THAN ANY OTHER MOVIE THAT COMES TO MIND, THIS IS A TRUE CULT MOVIE! WATCHING IT COULD CAUSE DANGEROUS NEW THOUGHTS IN YOUR HEAD* DO you understand the above warning? If you don't get that statement, or don't like what it implies, you will HATE this movie. I sat alone in a theatre in a rotten, crummy little one-horse town in the Midwest and saw this movie in 1973. I laughed harder that night than I have since.<br><br>The film violates every possible rule of good taste, all conceivable social norms, and is terrifically long on puns and non-sequiturs. It is a positive wealth of sight gags. this is not highbrow movie by any stretch of the imagination, but low comedy was one thing in the 70's and something less now: it is probably \"too hip for the room\" at the dawn of the 21st century.<br><br>Think of this movie as a knowing \"wink\" at the audience. It says, \"we're going to play a game here--I'm going to pretend to be a movie, and you're going to pretend to be an audience...all you have to do as the audience is to get the joke.\" \"Schlock\" is a satire of a lost genre of horror films: the \"caveman\" movie (specifically it is a first rate send up of one of the classic bad movies of all time: \"Trog\").<br><br>If you watch bad movies for their unintentional comedy, if you think Mel Brook's first six movies are funny, then you're going to love this. On the other hand, if you think that the three funniest movies ever made were \"Scary Movie I,\" \"Scary Movie II,\" and \"Not Another Teen Movie,\" then avoid this at all costs.","user":"barkingchimp","rank":[12,16]},{"title":"Genuinely funny horror movie parody. Neglected comedy classic","rating":11,"date":"11 September 2000","review":"John Landis's first movie may be as good as anything he made. \"Schlock\" falls in neatly with other 'progressive' US comedy movies of the early 70s, which kicked around genre conventions and added a new frankness in language and toilet humour to US film comedy vocabulary. (Others like this were sketch comedy flicks like Landis's \"Kentucky Fried Movie\"; plus the Mel Brooks and Woody Allen movies of around the same time).<br><br>What sets this one apart is its sustained comic atmosphere, which is goofy, laconic and giddy. Set-pieces - like the 2001 parody, the bar scene where the monster 'Schlock' observes a Jose Feliciano-like blind musician playing a piano boogie and ends up joining in, and a very funny scene where the allegedly fearful Schlock goes into a cinema to see a horror movie, and is terrified - all come off perfectly.<br><br>Some beautiful bits of background business too - the hippie in the background of the 2001 scene, just ignoring the portentous foreground action while eating his frozen custard is worth a look. This is just a really, really funny film.","user":"leapso","rank":[6,9]}]
