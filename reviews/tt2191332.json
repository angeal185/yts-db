[{"title":"A Small Gem from Turkish Cinema","rating":9,"date":"20 November 2013","review":"When the film started, with protagonist Nihat slowly making his way to the remote outpost as a guard, part of a forest fire monitoring team, I wasn't sure what I was into. However, as the film progressed the plot became clear - two people, Nihat the widower and Seher, a young woman trying to hide an unwanted pregnancy, crossed their paths in the remote, mountainous part of Turkey. Both wanted to get away from the rest of the world to get over a personal trauma. The misty scenery was beautiful to look at, the acting was solid, and a child-birth scene was so realistic it became disturbing.<br><br>In my view 'Watchtower' is at par with 'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia' in terms of what contemporary Turkish cinema has to offer. Both were great films. And they played a key role in converting me to a fan of Turkish cinema. I highly recommend this film to anyone who seeks an intelligent drama, one without a big budget, CGI effects, violence or sex.","user":"ronchow","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"Stark Realism in This Turkish Drama","rating":7,"date":"28 March 2014","review":"This drama, written and directed by Pelin Esmer, offers up some very stark realism in the Turkish mountains. <br><br>Olgun Simsek gives a strong performance, as Rihat, a carpenter by trade, but who has chosen to take a new job, in virtual isolation at a mountainside watchtower. We learn eventually that he is a spotter there for the Forestry Service, to observe and report forest fires that may spring up. You can tell he's holding inside lots of anguish and rage , but we won't learn till about 2/3rds of the way into the film what has happened to cause this.<br><br>Nilay Erdonmez is equally effective here as Seher, a young woman who has taken a job as a bus hostess and has secured a room at a remote bus terminal not far from Rihat's watchtower. We learn rather early on that she suddenly left Bolu University, where she was studying literature, and was living with her uncle while a student there. <br><br>However, Seher has her own anguish, as she's become impregnated by her uncle and is well along in her pregnancy. She suddenly gets labor pains and has to give birth in the basement of the bus terminal, in a scene that is very difficult to watch. She's so distraught and upset by the whole affair that she tries to abandon the baby boy by the roadside.<br><br>Nihat, who has been at the bus depot getting supplies and tea, sees what is happening and tries to help her, offering her temporary shelter at the watchtower. This is what I would call the heart of the movie, as these two troubled souls try and cope with their own harsh realities. <br><br>The viewer I felt here is offered distinct reality often with the cast so natural it's as if they're not even acting. Also, the cinematography is often quite startling and awesome.<br><br>Although this is definitely not a feel-good movie and can be difficult to watch, the main story is quite intriguing and powerful and it certainly maintained my interest as I wanted to know how it would conclude. I thought Turkish writer and director Esmer presented this drama well and I will be interested to see what her future films present.","user":"larrys3","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Isolation and the desperate need for connection","rating":9,"date":"21 February 2014","review":"Turkish writer director Pelin Esmer as won many awards for this compelling film that deals with the results of trauma on the psyches and souls of two people whose lives have been jolted by trauma. With a very small cast, minimal dialogue from the two main characters, and a supporting ensemble offering realistic interpretations of the people outside the lives of the main characters, coupled with stunning photography of the Mountains of Turkey, this film leaves an indelible mark on the viewer.<br><br>In contemporary Turkey we meet Nihat (Olgun Simsek), a quiet man suffering form the accidental loss of his wife and child in an accident in which he was the sole survivor. He exits the mainstream by becoming an isolated lookout fireguard in a watchtower in the mountains of Turkey. We also meet a beautiful but troubled young Seher (Nilay Erdonmez) who is in college but has taken on a job as a tour bus hostess, living in a crude bus station belonging to her uncle. We gradually learn that she is pregnant (morning sickness and enlarging girth), a fact she finally confesses to her poor but proud mother (La√ßin Ceylan) and father (Riza Akin) who are shocked by her deed. Seher distances herself further and eventually gives unattended birth to the child that resulted from a rape by her uncle. Seher cannot accept her fate, hides the newborn boy in the trash bin and sets out on foot to separate herself from everyone. Nihat, whom Seher has met while waitressing in the bus station, rescues her, takes her and the baby he has discovered to his tower where he nurtures them, encouraging Seher to breastfeed her own child. The interpersonal relationship between these two deeply bruised people and how they cope concludes this deeply moving film.<br><br>In the hands of less talented actors this story would not gel, but the director and his gifted actors create a memorable, important film. In Turkish with English subtitles. Anther remarkable addition to the library of FilmMovement.","user":"gradyharp","rank":[9,10]}]
