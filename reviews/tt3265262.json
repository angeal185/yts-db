[{"title":"For your own educational enjoyment","rating":9,"date":"9 April 2014","review":"In 1997, when I moved to London, as an American, beyond a song on the 'Trainspotting' soundtrack, I had never heard of the band 'PULP' (who released their first album in 1983). That gap in my musical knowledge was swiftly corrected by the locals and I was soon swaying and gushing with empathy to anthems like 'Mis-Shapes' and 'Common People'. The year after my arrival, the band released the controversial 'This is Hardcore' album (which I adored) and largely fell from the limelight. In the UK, at least, Jarvis Cocker and his bandmates have not been easily forgotten and the band, which hasn't toured or played together since shortly after the turn of the century, decided to organize a final concert as a bookend to their career.<br><br>Kiwi filmmaker Florian Habicht ('Love Story') has created a 'concert film' as unique as the band itself. Instead of providing a sleek chronology of the bands history, full performances of their fan favorites, and back-stage antics, he's focused his attention on the 'common' residence of PULP's native city, Sheffield, and made pensioners the center of his study. This may be a film for the fans but, for the sake of pop music history, the greats that didn't quite make it stateside (largely because they weren't macho enough), and because there isn't yet a trailer for this documentary, I encourage you to seek out this ban for your own educational enjoyment.","user":"basil1984","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"Great film","rating":10,"date":"1 September 2014","review":"This is a film about the people of Sheffield and one Pulp concert, rather than the band's career. I thought it was hilarious, and extremely well made, and not at all what I was expecting. The ordinary people of Sheffield (I will avoid saying 'common') are varied and entertaining, and the concert footage is superb. There are many highlights, but I will outline a few of my favourite moments: Steve Mackey's explanation of why playing to people from Sheffield is so nerve-wracking, the performance of 'Help the Aged', the knife maker, Candida's honesty and everything Nick Banks says. Pulp have always presented pop music in an unusual and entertaining way, and this documentary is fitting of that legacy.","user":"andyhardy79","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Enjoyable if you quite like Pulp, probably great if you are a fan","rating":7,"date":"18 July 2014","review":"This easy-going film about the British band that seemed happy to keep things domestic is part concert footage, part \"where are they now\" and a little bit of \"surely this is set-up\" magic, centered around Pulp's final Sheffield concert in December 2012.<br><br>Most people will want to know if it would be good watch, even if they only sort-of like Pulp's music. Well I think it is. Pulp still sound very good in 2014 and it is refreshing to hear a band express sentiments that they actually live by. They are in many ways the antithesis of the fame-game which is hinted at which the various references to everyday working-class life, although the frequent references to \"regular people\" and the slightly self-conscious adoration of common people could be a little grating for some. <br><br>An off-the-cuff interview with some local siblings was a personal highlight, as were the sections with Jarvis alone, although I was left wanting more Jarvis one-to-one time as he comes across as a really interesting guy.<br><br>Like the band it's unpretentious and fun, with an underlying profound message. You'll probably enjoy this if you like Pulp and you'll probably adore it if you're a fan.","user":"t-ferdy","rank":[7,8]}]
