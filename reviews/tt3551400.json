[{"title":"Tension, good kills, grizzly violence n nudity r all lacking in this film.","rating":4,"date":"21 January 2018","review":"Saw this on a rented dvd. The poster was very convincing n so was the Alaska set up but the movie wasnt good. Period.\nThe creature was pathetic but i will still forgive that coz of the budget. The poster had a menacing bear though. \nA low budget creature film without any good kills, nudity n tension zero.\nTwo female models r doing a bikini photo shoot in the snowy Alaska n we dont even get to see good tits. There is a lousy sex scene that too without any nudity. Most of the kills r offscreen n the grizzly violence is pathetic. In fact some of the old bear movies has better kills. Grizzly made in the 70s, n among the new ones, Backcountry n Grizzly park were decent too. I hav yet to see Into the grizzly maze.\nSince imdb has allowed shorter reviews, so from now on i will make a shorter review for bad horror films. Yeehaw!","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Unwatchable","rating":2,"date":"14 November 2015","review":"Have you ever watched a movie and after it was finished you said to yourself (or maybe outloud) \"This should have never been made\"? Such is the case for After Dark's installment of \"Unnatural.\" The general message of this movie was supposed to be a statement on global warming, climate crisis, melting of the polar icecaps, glacier loss--take your pick. However, somewhere along the way, all that got lost and what you got stuck with was a poor attempt at schlock. <br><br>It seems that a photographer, his lackey, and two bimbos are off somewhere close to the Arctic Circle for a photo shoot involving fur. Once they arrive at Black Wolf Lodge, you get lots of giggling, posing, jerking about, faux sex (no nudity), and are introduced to characters you really will never care about. <br><br>The viewer sees the killer bear almost immediately, so there's no tension introduced there. You then get a lot of grunts, huffing, and crackling branches to let you know he's in the vicinity. Supposedly, the particular polar bear is a freak of nature because scientists have (once again) decided to mess with mother nature. Yawn. The makeup for the beast was high-schoolish, as was most of the acting. <br><br>This truly was much ado about nothing. Rated \"R\" and it should have been rated PG-13. Not recommended.","user":"dcarsonhagy","rank":[19,25]},{"title":"Great actors in a not so great film","rating":2,"date":"30 November 2015","review":"Maybe if I'd never seen a movie before, this one would be worthy of more stars, but alas, I have.<br><br>Having said that, now I will say even more! The bear! OMG...that sad sad sad bear! It would have been better if was made out of paper mache. Maybe I just gave some good advice for this film producer for future projects involving fake bears.<br><br>I am a fan of James Remar, Gregory Cruz, Sherilyn Fenn, Graham Greene, and Ray Wise. They all gave great performances, but that didn't help this movie.<br><br>They could have easily named this movie Polarbear!!!!!! Maybe with a few more or less exclamation marks. I'm not an expert on these sorts of things.","user":"BlahX10","rank":[8,9]}]
