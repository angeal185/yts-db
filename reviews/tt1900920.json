[{"title":"Don't look this movie over!!!","rating":9,"date":"9 January 2014","review":"' A music producer promises a young singer an amazing new lifestyle but first she must lend her voice to a celebrity with no singing talent.'<br><br>As a die hard lifetime movie fan I am still quite skeptical when it comes to watching ones I've never seen before, because they certainly have their flops but I came across this on their site and was very pleasantly surprised. The movie stars Christian Serratos who played Angela in Twilight, but I enjoyed this movie way more. Christian can actually act and can actually express emotion - emotion! lol She says more with her eyes than Kristen Stewart could ever pretend to express with her entire face. <br><br>The movie was very enjoyable, some moments could have been annoying but they turned it around to please me. It has some nice romance and family moments. The songs that Christian sings are awesome, I loved every one, I wished that they could be actual songs I could go buy the cd of. I even loved the evil star, but she was annoying lol. And she wasn't even that pretty, Christian was way prettier than she was.<br><br>4 stars out of 5 I love!","user":"lollirot2010","rank":[5,8]}]
