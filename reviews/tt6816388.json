[{"title":"Just awful.","rating":2,"date":"19 February 2020","review":"This is so bad I only watched half of it. This movie is an abject lesson in how not to make a sci-fi/horror film. Contains mostly awful acting, awful characters, awful editing, awful story and awful CGI. It's just awful. The only redeeming feature was the magnificent scenery of the Australian outback.<br><br>Please do not waste your time watching this turkey. There are thousands of movies better than this.","user":"alfredsmith","rank":[65,80]},{"title":"Not a use of time","rating":2,"date":"2 March 2020","review":"From around 10 minutes, it got so boring I literally passed seconds to just finish and review this movie. The name is nice, so the poster. But at last it showed no potential on plot or acting. Some kind of badly mixed up boring scifi.","user":"muhtashimurrahman","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Plotless garbage","rating":1,"date":"21 March 2020","review":"You start in Australia with a mystical meteor touchdown. Random australian guys starts fondling a deceased rat and gets infected with some mind controlling substance. One by one the town folks all seem to fondle dead animals with some fungus like spores on them. They all go zombie. Enter some type of non uniformed nameless police vixen who is days away from leaving police work in this aussie dump. Everyone is slow on the learning curve that the folks standing statuonary around looking blank eith pulsating red lesions and blotches are infected. Now giant sandstorm. Somehow related to creatures arrival. Zombies syart randomly killing people. Heroine cop lady still hasnt figured anything out. Creature uses its scorpion like stinger to round up his zombie folks like a meat on a stick and dissapesrs with them. More zombie people. 3-4 people arm up with guns barely shoot anyone or anything. Sxorpion creature tries to take a young girl they all ask it not too. It doesn't Scorpion like creature eventually rounds up a pile of people then sets tem on fire. Sandstorm disappears. Cut to scene where everyones just relaxed and talking about figuring out what the thing was and credits. I'm pretty sure an 8 year old drew out this plot with crayons and their rich father paid someone to make a movie. Complete garbage.","user":"redwolf_cars","rank":[8,9]}]
