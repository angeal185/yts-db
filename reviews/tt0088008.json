[{"title":"Historic location","rating":3,"date":"3 November 2004","review":"Besides being just a fun to watch movie, the on-location filming includes an area of historic significance. Although the location is listed as Kingman, it includes a race sequence to the old gold mining settlement of Oatman, AZ. I recognized many of the landmarks during the race, as well as the community of Oatman. The race turn around point (straw bales) is at the south end of town. The road race is on the original \"Route 66\", now known on the maps as CR10. It crosses a flat and winds up into the Black Mountains to Sitgreaves Pass, and down into Oatman. The Black Mountains were a significant obstacle to the many who motored west during the great depression, due to steep grades and sharp curves. <br><br>Any trip on I40 passing Kingman, AZ should include a side trip through the tourist town of Oatman, which welcomes visitors and is truly a step into the past. Very few sections of Route 66 still exist that are as beautiful as this road. In the bargain, you can see (and stay in) the room in the Oatman Hotel where movie stars Clark Gable and Carol Lombard stayed on their honeymoon in 1939. Several other movies were filmed in Oatman.<br><br>Enjoy this fun movie, and enjoy the filming location if you get a chance. You will remember the race sequence from \"Roadhouse 66\" when you travel this road from Kingman to Oatman.","user":"lellison","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Nostalgic to say the least","rating":9,"date":"28 January 2016","review":"This movie has a lot to say in it. The open road, the classic cars, the good times, that sort of good things. Well, until a group of hoods run by Hoot (Alan Autry, Bubba on \"In The Heat of The Night\") shoot a hole in a 1955 Ford Thunderbird driven by a New York college graduate(Judge Reinhold). Judge Reinhold plays Beckman Hallsgood, Jr., the son of a fast food restaurant magnate traveling on Route 66 going from New York to California to attend a meeting. Along the way, he comes across some hoods in a Chevy Bel Aire accosted him, then they shoot a hole in the radiator of his beloved '55 T-Bird. Along the way, Beckham meet a drifter named Johnny Harte (Willem Dafoe), a musician living in obscurity. He knows cars, and he's good with a guitar. Both men head to Kingman, Arizona where Hoot and his crew hang out. There in Kingman, they meet a local mechanic name Jesse (Kaaren Lee) who is a beautiful blonde who is good with a wrench. After finding a radiator, they would be able to move forward. However, with Hoot and his crew around, Beckman decided to enter the car race. After a night of passion for both parties, tragedy strikes. Sam(Stephen Elliott), the junkyard owner who helped Johnny and Beckman dies in a fire that also claims the repaired T-Bird. So Beckman entered the race, driving the Mustang. The race is on, and Johnny enters as well. One member of Hoot's crew turned on him. Just say that it's all good. The most important things I liked about the movie were the cars, and the trains that rolled on by. And the roadhouse they went to: PRICELESS. Get your kicks on Route 66! 4.5 out of 5 stars.","user":"GOWBTW","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Better than I expected .................","rating":6,"date":"25 January 2010","review":"Willem Dafoe plays a drifter who quit the music business after his band partner was killed in a car accident. Judge Reinhold is the stereotypical rich kid from back east, driving his 55 T.Bird. These two meet up in the Arizona desert and spend some time in a small town because of car trouble. There they are harassed by a trio of local goons, and are attracted to a couple of cute blonde sisters. The acting is good, the location photography is stunning, the 57 Chevy, 55 Thunderbird, 55 Chevy, 59 Caddy and 66 Mustang are great, there is even a touch of nudity, along with some terrific rockabilly tunes. \"Roadhouse 66\" is definitely above average entertainment. If you can sit back and just enjoy the ride, this movie will not disappoint. - MERK","user":"merklekranz","rank":[10,12]}]
