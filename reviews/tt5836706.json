[{"title":"Tugs at the heart","rating":9,"date":"20 September 2019","review":"Not sure why this movie got such bad rating. I thought it was beautiful and very moving. I think most old people feel like they become unimportant to their family, exactly why we should make them feel important, go visit your grandparents if you still have them around or send them a message or give them a call. Great acting by NN.","user":"renschemari","rank":[30,34]},{"title":"20/10 Stars then ðŸ˜˜","rating":10,"date":"3 November 2019","review":"I thought it was great actually. I can relate in ways, from being 'Tilda, to being her Dad, and going with the flow on a lot with Amadeus!! I would've spread food on my face too!! Loved it and telling my family about this one. Thanks for all the feel goods!!","user":"gbroughton30","rank":[25,31]},{"title":"Alzheimers: Accurate; Funny; Horrifying","rating":10,"date":"22 January 2020","review":"As an attorney who has specialized in end of life illness and providing for Alzheimers victims for the last 25 yrs, and going thru it with my mother, this is an incredibly accurate film, albeit enhanced with a storyline sufficient to make it humorous for movie audiences-- yet truly not out of the realm of the often crazy reality (and horror) of Alzheimers. Nick Nolte should have been nomi ated for an Oscar.","user":"gustaferic-16723","rank":[5,5]}]
