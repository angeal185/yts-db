[{"title":"aw come on","rating":24,"date":"24 July 2001","review":"It's pretty funny, especially when you consider  yodeling polar bear and the unusually-sweatered gender confused ski lodge manager and Annette as the haughty college professor for the very likely class `Fun Without Sex.\" Plus Frankie and Dwayne are pretty funny.  Modern moviegoers are waaaaaaaaaay too uptight.","user":"soames","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"Mindless Fun","rating":5,"date":"8 December 2003","review":"Todd Armstrong and his buddy Craig Gamble (Frankie Avalon &amp; Dwayne Hickman) aren't having any luck whatsoever with their lady friends Linda &amp; Barbara (Deborah Walley &amp; Yvonne Craig).

Best part: Lesley Gore singing her huge 1965 hit \"Sunshine, Lollipops, and Rainbows\" on the bus!  Gore had many better hits, but this one fit this movie perfectly.  Some funny and interesting scenes.","user":"TimRoger","rank":[10,11]}]
