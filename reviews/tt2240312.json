[{"title":"Skip It - Hold Your Breath","rating":3,"date":"11 May 2013","review":"My 5 Reasons 2 Skip It <br><br>1. It is a bad rip off of Fallen (1998) - See It instead - Link below - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119099/ <br><br>2. Terrible acting - The cast is terrible and the acting at times is obvious and painful.<br><br>3. Terrible special effects/editing - No excuse for how bad it is. The spirit leaving the bodies is hysterical <br><br>4. I watched it in Chill Network - I have yet to see a solid movie on this network. Not to say I expected this movie to be solid.<br><br>5. It is made by Asylum - Enough said <br><br>Recommend for: <br><br>1. Katrina Bowden fans - she is one attractive specimen, but I can't say much for her performance in this film.<br><br>2. Nudity fans - there is some modest nudity in the film, but Katrina Bowden isn't part of it.<br><br>3. People who love cheesy movies - it definitely fits the bill <br><br>Email me your thoughts - why2seeit@gmail.com","user":"whyseeit","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Potential was DESTROYED by Direction/Production","rating":4,"date":"4 January 2015","review":"No spoilers here, just basics.<br><br>The acting was fair to OK. The story/script was fair/OK (interesting, but maybe a little to detailed and over-thought, which COULD be OK or great).<br><br>But the direction and production of this just blew any \"watchability\" elements apart. What was reoccurring themes got lost in the convoluted mishmash of the director over emphasizing things that didn't matter, and letting things that do matter just slip right past. Then throwing in totally unneeded special effects that added nothing, and actually detracted from the ability to get into the story. On and on and on, ever 10 minutes part of me went \"ok, I get why the actor played it that way, but why did they shoot the scene like that, and edit it that way, it might has well of been a live play on stage...\"<br><br>If you can see past the horrible production of this movie, there is some decent acting and an interesting story underneath. But, to be honest, it's SO difficult to see because of the horrible production, I couldn't recommend ANYONE try to watch this movie (unless you are only doing so to get horror movie story ideas and see if the actors in it are any good).","user":"BadlandZ","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Don't Hold Your Breath, Close Your Eyes","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2013","review":"Instead of Hold Your Breath it should have been titled Close Your Eyes...yes folks, it was *that* bad. Some of the lines of dialog were absolutely hilarious though I am quite sure they weren't meant to be. I'll never see bobcats or sandpaper in the quite the same way again. <br><br>The actors attempts at actually acting were quite painful to watch and it would appear that most of them all used the same dentist as a majority of them had teeth that closely resembled chiclets.<br><br>The entire premise of this ridiculous film was flawed from the beginning but I won't try and explain why this movie was so awful and in so many ways as I am currently trying to erase it from my memory and forget that I ever watched it. Avoid this one at all costs.","user":"Dawn Jackson","rank":[14,22]}]
