[{"title":"A fun movie","rating":9,"date":"18 December 2018","review":"I was so happy to bring my family to see Bernie the Dolphin last evening at the theater. We loved the movie from beginning to end. Really happy to see a film that touches on conservation and caring about animals... They kids were perfect and so so adorable. Great fun film.....","user":"artfuldodger-28779","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Terrific family entertainment!","rating":10,"date":"9 December 2018","review":"Really enjoy seeing strong family entertainment like this one. Reminded me of a films from the 90s with the kids battling against an evil guy in Kevin Sorbo while trying to save a dolphin they car about. These types of films can become very cheesy and this one didn't. The acting is very believable and not over the top. Dolphin footage is surprisingly well done for a non studio type film. My family had a ball watching it and my kids have already asked to see it again.","user":"gridironspecial","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"Great message on conservationism...terrible movie.","rating":5,"date":"3 April 2019","review":"Living close to St. Augustine and frequenting Marineland and supporting their conversation efforts, I was excited to see the film. The message is very important. It's execution is so bad. Poorly acted. Cheaply made. Painful to watch. Skip the movie and visit Marineland. Although, young kids will like the movie.","user":"kristenkennedy-20723","rank":[4,6]}]
