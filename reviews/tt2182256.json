[{"title":"Not original, but definitely funny and entertaining","rating":7,"date":"6 September 2014","review":"To sum this movie up in one word: entertaining. Even though it's a mash-up of Groundhog Day and American Pie, meaning it lacks originality, and has one of the most clich√© \"plot twists\" of all time, it's still oddly hilarious. The movie is enjoyable if you're watching it with friends, or just sitting at home alone. I really liked the actors, even if the acting wasn't great. It was good, just not great. The jokes are funny;90% of them at least, and it's my kind of humor, so the likability of this movie will vary for each person based on what your kind of humor is. If you liked American Pie, you're probably going to like this movie.","user":"tsangaridesi","rank":[18,28]},{"title":"You can't compare the greats to a movie about ejaculation","rating":7,"date":"3 June 2018","review":"All I see are these reviews comparing the movie to others that are really cornerstone films and its annoying because you aren't gonna watch this movie because you are genuinely looking for an interesting or captivating plot. If you want to laugh and enjoy a raunchy and in my opinion pretty funny movie then give it a try. It's predictable but watchable and I am glad I gave it a watch.","user":"digiorgioj07","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Give it a chance...","rating":9,"date":"13 February 2017","review":"I did not want to watch this film as on paper it sounded awful and juvenile. I gave it a go and am pleased I did. As others have said, this is a mash between Groundhog Day and American Pie. A teenage boy is stuck living the same day over and over, every time he ejaculates he goes back to the start of the day to relive it. It sounds an awful film and there are some moments, such as him using his headteachers sandwich mayonnaise to help him masturbate to avoid being arrested, which bring the humour level down. However there are some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments. The ending is predictable, corny and slightly suspect. Would you really leave a boy in your daughters bedroom, especially if you walked in on them and she was just wearing a bra? There are some great performances especially by the lead I have never heard of before and Craig Roberts. Overall I would give this film a go. It sounds awful and juvenile but it quickly brings you in. You may not find all the humour funny or even tasteful, but there are some really funny moments. The Groundhog Day aspect of the film give it a twist that makes it stand out and above American Pie style films.","user":"LLgoatJ","rank":[6,8]}]
