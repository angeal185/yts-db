[{"title":"Entertaining sex comedy - it is what it is. Plus, take in Johnny Depp before he was famous.","rating":6,"date":"6 August 2005","review":"I knew nothing of this film before I saw it. It was a free \"On Demand\" film from Comcast. I didn't even know Johnny Depp was in it. I thought the plot description (which was vague) sounded like every other girl-crazy sex comedy released after \"Animal House,\" and I got what I expected.<br><br>To be fair this is entertaining. No, it's not a great movie. It's not very well made. It's crude. It's sexist. It's all about sex.<br><br>But that's exactly what it's supposed to be. Graded by the standards of its genre, it works.<br><br>It's about two kids (one of whom is played by Johnny Depp) who gain access to a private resort in the middle of the Caribbean (presumably). There's no backdrop. We don't even know how they got in to the resort. And they look about 16, so it's odd to see them going after women in their 30s and 40s (sometimes succeeding).<br><br>Depp wasn't famous yet (correct me if I'm wrong but this was his first starring role in a film to speak of?) and this certainly didn't help boost his career (he took a considerably smaller role in Oliver Stone's \"Platoon\" the year after) but he displays charisma and good charm that would carry on into his later movies.<br><br>The film's take-it-as-it-is attitude makes it entertaining. It's a simple sex comedy with crude laughs and running gags, a lot of which aren't very funny, a few of which are, almost all of which are at the least amusing.<br><br>Worth catching if you see it on cable some time.","user":"MovieAddict2016","rank":[30,35]},{"title":"A Piece of History?","rating":7,"date":"14 March 2000","review":"Take a typical 80's B-comedy, and give the two male leads to two actors who would go on to awards and world fame.<br><br>Believe me or not, Depp and Morrow take two stock characters and make the material seem that much better; suddenly Jack and Ben hold the film together, rather than just reacting to everything within a narrow character description.  Okay, so it's not art, but it's interesting from a film education perspective, if nothing else.<br><br>The script and direction aren't bad either, for a 1980's sex romp.  Would have liked to see the director go on to better material.  Ah, well.<br><br>7/10, for effort and sheer amusement value.","user":"Quicksand","rank":[31,42]},{"title":"Best Spring Break comedy of the 1980's!!!!","rating":31,"date":"31 January 2001","review":"First of all, let's get something straight. This is in fact the best spring break comedy of the 80's. However, that means it is the best of the 4 or 5 spring break comedies that came out between 1983-1985, really the only two years of the 1980's that had spring break comedies. Therefore, I'm talking about movies like Spring Break, Where the Boys Are, Hot Resort, and Fraternity Vacation, so which also means this is pretty much just a sex comedy. Of all these, Private Resort is by far and away the best one. It follows two young guys, Depp and Morrow, who are just looking to get laid and in the meantime get in trouble with hotel security, Andrew Dice Clay, and Hector Elizondo before his Chicago Hope days. Also, not to mention the beautiful girls throughout the movie, but what else do you expect? As a result, this is a truly underrated sex comedy, but don't bother to watch it on Comedy Central, because like Casino and Goodfellas, it has to be seen uncut. **+ out of ****<br><br>BA,BA,BA, BA-BA-BA-BA-BA......","user":"drdre1","rank":[15,20]}]
