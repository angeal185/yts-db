[{"title":"Cute romance they have","rating":8,"date":"11 June 2019","review":"They take each other on dates and it's honestly heartwarming how the story progresses through time, first half of the movie was very quick in the process of dating or Better said 'being official'. Yet the ending was very quickly progressed as we see it took them 1 year and 4 months to see each other again. With unfaded feelings this love seems to be meant from the beginning. We see luxurious style of living while the main actor uses works money to satisfy a girl. But it all ends in forgiveness from the boss and friendship blooms once again. The movie was overall created intregingly, when I started watching I just couldn't stop. The music was fantastic but there is no soundtrack of it on the internet. 👏🏻💓","user":"juliasikorska-39025","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"GREAT MOVIE!!!","rating":10,"date":"29 December 2019","review":"What a breath of fresh air this film is. Well acted, very smart and very very funny. I found myself laughing out loud many times. Elaine Hendrix (the new Alexis on dynasty) was fabulous! I saw her listed in the credits and it was one of the reasons I decided to watch this film. Elaine and the film did not disappoint!!","user":"neverneedtoleave","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Super cute romantic comedy!","rating":10,"date":"29 December 2019","review":"Loved this film!
