[{"title":"Underrated Horror Flick","rating":9,"date":"13 April 2007","review":"Pumpkinhead is a criminally overlooked 80's horror movie that stands up there as one of my favorites of the entire decade. It is exceptionally well made by first time director Stan Winston who shows more skill behind the camera than one might expect from someone primarily known for special effects. Most of the lead actors do a very good job, with a few exceptions, however Lance Henriksen brings an enormous amount of credibility to the whole thing. I have great respect for character actors such as Lance and this is some of his best work. The creature itself is well conceived however it is hidden in shadows throughout most the picture which allows the actors and the story to take center stage, much to the film's benefit. Overall this is one of the best Halloween movies ever made as that is the perfect time of year to watch this movie. It's dark, it's Gothic, and it's damn cool.","user":"Ithaqua1987","rank":[43,48]},{"title":"Very well executed film","rating":9,"date":"22 March 2001","review":"This film stands as one of the most underrated I have seen.  It has a compelling story of a father's love and the powerful grip of vengeful desires.  It is well acted, has amazing creature affects, and takes the road less traveled by most horror films.  It takes no easy ways out.  The plot prefers to turn slowly into a gnarled tale of battling with an inner demon. The lighting in the fog and the mere visual presence of the witch, Haggis, with her wispy hairs in the fire light, are genuinely creepy. I think Lance Henriksen gives one of his best performances in this film.  Definitely give it a look if you haven't yet.","user":"Stomach Monkey","rank":[46,53]},{"title":"Stay away from Pumpkinhead, unless you're tired of living...","rating":8,"date":"1 November 2003","review":"Most critics (who actually get PAID to critique films, unlike me, HA!) really hated this movie, dismissing it as yet another \"brainless teen\" slaughterfest and slamming it with either one star or a big fat turkey. I've never really understood this. Okay, it's not ever going to win an Academy Award, some of the acting is atrocious and much of the incidental music was cheesy and had me rolling my eyes, but the basic story is quite good. Six city teens on a vacation in either the Appalachians or the Ozarks, make the mistake of running over a little hillbilly boy with a motorcycle. 5 of them want to do the right thing and call the police, but the 6th, a hulking moron with a police record, takes his friends hostage. By the time he comes to his senses, it's too late. The dead boys father has been to see the local Witch, who in turn has summoned the Demon of Vengeance: Pumpkinhead.<br><br>There's really not a lot of gore here, and no sex whatsoever. The \"typical teens\" here actually appear to be in their early twenties, and are hardly the faceless victims you usually find in these kinds of films.  The real menace lies with the hill folk, many of whom look like the genuine article; inbred and dangerous. Lance Henriksen turns in a great performance as the dead boys father, blinded (most understandably) by grief and anger, yet still compassionate enough at last to try and reverse what he has done. The monster, Pumpkinhead, is really cool looking, created as it was by special effects man Stan Winston, who also directed. The atmosphere and mood of this movie are constantly menacing, even in the bright light of day, and Pumpkinhead seems to bring an aura of electrical storms with him wherever he goes, the sound of cicadas and the flashing of heat lightening most unsettling.  The Witches cabin in particular is a magnificent set piece. Worth seeing at least once. The \"professional\" critics are NOT always right.<br><br>PS - Don't bother watching \"Pumpkinhead 2: Blood Wings.\" I've never seen a more horrible sequel with a more annoying cast of arrogant teenagers who deserved to be killed. Banal, moronic waste of film.","user":"Gafke","rank":[61,73]}]
