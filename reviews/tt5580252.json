It is a shame it didn't get a bigger audience, because this experimental film, which had nine directors and eight writers, is a real triumph. Set in a late-1800's asylum, the female patients are tasked with putting on a production of \"Moby Dick\" as a means of therapy. Camilla Belle delivers one of the best performances of the year as Isabel, an unjustly committed inmate cast in the lead role of Ishmael. James Franco also performs nicely in a very small role. This is a perfect example of a hidden gem.","user":"tccandler","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"Mesmerizing","rating":10,"date":"2 October 2019","review":"An outstanding movie that you cannot pull yourself away from, so get your soda &amp; snacks before you start. I loved it so much I watched it twice, in the same night.","user":"rmbbsnrn","rank":[4,10]}]
