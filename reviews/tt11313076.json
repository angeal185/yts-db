[{"title":"Not as good as Travels With My Father, but provides some laughs anyway","rating":6,"date":"22 December 2019","review":"Well, it made me and my family laugh numerous times. Not every joke succeeded though and I found some parts tedious and unfunny; but it kept moving at a decent pace.<br><br>Not as good as \"Travels With My Father\" but part of me enjoyed it. This will be as close to getting in the Christmas spirit as I'll get this year. Father Whitehall provides the vast majority of laughs in the TV series and this show.<br><br>It seemed a bit disjointed at times with the \"Queer Eye\" elements. 'The King's Speech' managed to succeed in being the most offensive thing I've seen in a while. Also somehow inspired me to watch \"The Nightingale\" soon, about a convict in Australia who seeks revenge on her English oppressors.<br><br>The best bit was Hugh Bonneville reading 'The Grouch'. Thought Jack was trying to be some lame imitation of James Corden in the musical finale. Fans will either love or hate this. As for me, I was somewhere in the middle.","user":"maccas-56367","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Wholesome? Who wants that?","rating":10,"date":"16 December 2019","review":"I watch Jack and his Dad for their interaction and family dynamic, which is always hilarious. Here's hoping for more Travels with my Father and other specials!","user":"attorneyschutt","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Not even remotely wholesome.","rating":1,"date":"13 December 2019","review":"For a \"Christmas special\" I had thought they would find a way to keep it funny but not crass. I was wrong; clearly they aren't that talented. Way too much attention was spent talking about Michael's sex life, and the Queer Eye guys wanting to hump him because of his old pictures.","user":"amandahenderson-93295","rank":[12,31]}]
