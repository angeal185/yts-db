[{"title":"Ann Hui's First Movie","rating":9,"date":"22 April 2003","review":"The movie is based on a true story where a young couple was brutally murdered by a madman in the 70's Hong Kong. Sylvia Cheung plays the dead girl's best friend and is trying to find out what's really happened to her friend. As the story unfolds, nothing is what it initially seems. Ann Hui's first and probably her best movie. The movie beautifully captures the atmosphere of the 70's Hong Kong, where the conflicting impacts of East and West were still obvious. A must-see for noir fans.","user":"cunningswine","rank":[3,8]}]
