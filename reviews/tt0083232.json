[{"title":"A heartbreaking classic","rating":10,"date":"13 February 2003","review":"One of the most underrated films of the past 25 years, \"True Confessions\" is worth repeated viewings.  On the surface it's a period piece about a corrupt Los Angeles where sex, money, the police, and the Catholic church all mingle. While at first glance, the film is as lurid as \"L.A. Confidential,\" beneath the surface it is a memorable love story, a story of two brothers, one a detective and one a ranking member of the Church hierarchy. <br><br>\nThe brothers are played by Robert Duvall and Robert DeNiro, in performances that will linger in your mind forever.  The silent moments between these two brothers resound louder than the dialogue. There's one heartbreaking scene in a bar where their inability to communicate despite their love for one another captures all of the complexities of sibling relationships.  I have no idea who won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1984, but whoever it was could not have been better than the two Roberts are here. <br><br>In supporting roles Kenneth McMillan and Charles Durning also shine, one as a corrupt cop and the other as a corrupt businessman.  In fact, I would have loved to see a remake of this film with the two pairs of actors trading roles: DeNiro for Duvall and McMillan for Durning.  That film would have been different but arguably as great.<br><br>The final scene of the film is punctuated by the perfect sound track.  So a great big tip of the hat to all responsible: John Gregory Dunne for the script, Ulu Grosbard for the wonderful direction that allows for those memorable silences, and, of course, a miraculous cast of fine performers working at the height of their art.  Don't miss this film.","user":"sommerjd","rank":[74,85]},{"title":"superb","rating":8,"date":"21 January 2004","review":"I had seen this excellent film when it was first released over 20 years ago. I had forgotten about it completely and came across it on the mystery channel recently. When it first came out I recall that no less a personage than William F. Buckley - not normally in the film reviewing business - raved about it.<br><br>Having just seen it again, I am astonished at what a superb film this is, and that I could have forgotten it. Consider the credits - Joan Didion as writer, and Robert Duvall, Robert deNiro, Charles Durning and and Burgess Meredith.<br><br>Those expecting simply a crime story will be disappointed, for the horrific murder that is the centerpiece of the movie is nothing more than, in Hitchcock's term, a 'McGuffin' on which to hang a richly human tale of corruption, guilt, brotherly conflict and devotion, and redemption. The portrayal of the necessary compromises that even good institutions - e.g. the church - must make to exist and operate in the world is as good a portrayal of the essential sinfulness of the human condition as any. In fact I feel that it is impossible for anyone without at least some semblance of religious sensibility to appreciate the true character of this movie.<br><br>The period setting and flavor is excellent and the production values are superb. Contrary to viewers who were bored I could not tear myself away from the screen.<br><br>This one is truly an overlooked and forgotten - dare I use an overworked term? - masterpiece.","user":"rupie","rank":[49,57]},{"title":"Complex, thoughtful character piece","rating":10,"date":"10 December 2003","review":"Adapted by the talented husband and wife team of Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne from the latter's novel, \"True Confessions\" is not a film likely to please everyone. It is a character study dressed as a detective film, following two brothers, one a priest the other a detective. Both characters are flawed and corrupt in one way or another, but over the course of a murder investigation both men find their means of salvation.<br><br>\nFocusing on atmosphere and characterisation rather than suspense, \"True Confessions\" marked another triumph for director Ulu Grosbard, director of the two criminally underrated classics \"Who is Harry Kellerman?\" and \"Straight Time\". The performances in the film are excellent, with Duvall and De Niro simply superb as the two protagonists, particularly the latter in an effectively subdued role. Loosely based on the infamous Black Dahlia case, the film will madden those expecting the film to follow the structure and pacing of a conventional genre film. Yet for those who want something more intelligent and thoughtful, \"True Confessions\" is a rewarding experience.","user":"carnivalofsouls","rank":[34,39]}]
