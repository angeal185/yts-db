[{"title":"Good movie - Carmine Cangialosi is going places","rating":8,"date":"24 September 2018","review":"This was a good film - a feel good film that lightly addresses issues related to family, friendship, aging, and social issues. For a $3 million film, it is a winner. I expect we're going to see much more of Cangialosi as his films continue to improve and he gets the resources to put some more money in his projects. His directing is very good in this film, and his ability to engage Tom Berenger, Keith David and Bruce Dern shows that some experienced actors have faith in his ability to produce and direct a good flick.","user":"mike-hicks-36579","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"Terrible.","rating":3,"date":"25 September 2018","review":"I was looking forward to this film, and I was very disappointed. Not one interaction between the characters was realistic. Every woman was infatuated with any one of them. I don't know any guy who scores every time. His daughter was angry as he left, but thrilled when he returns with no explanation. Cops are super villains to the point of being absurd. Main character lost his wife weeks again and has the hots for some woman he meets on the road and accepts a date with her. Group of super hot chicks on bikes come upon the scene. Yeah, that happens everyday. Silly bar fight scene. Main character meets a son he never met and right after they are both in tears. Then they both cry and Tom (the lead character) says, \"I need a hug!\" Really? I almost laughed. The acting was actually good, but the script they had to work with was ridiculous.","user":"TheLeftStuff","rank":[13,19]},{"title":"I ride an Indian and I still think this movie sucked.","rating":2,"date":"21 January 2019","review":"I really looked forward to seeing this movie. I ride and I was hoping for a good biker movie as there aren't too many, but this was a horrendous film. Poor acting, awful writing, rediculous situations, the only good parts were the cut scenes when they were riding down the road. Nice scenery, beautiful bikes and no dialogue, if only the whole move was just bikes riding down the road, passing amazing scenery, this movie would have been a whole lot better.","user":"mkratz-84816","rank":[3,4]}]
