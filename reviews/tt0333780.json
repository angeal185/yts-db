[{"title":"Jaw-droppingly awful - one of 2003's worst (*)","rating":1,"date":"20 October 2003","review":"The first \"Legally Blonde\", with its \"ditzy girl with a heart of gold does well\" storyline was basically a rip-off of \"Clueless\", but it wasn't bad. It had a funny central idea, more than a few solid laughs, and a really entertaining lead character.  This sloppy, lamely plotted, cash-in sequel has none of those things.<br><br>Reese Witherspoon, rapidly losing any edginess she used to have, is back as Elle Woods, the pink-loving, fashion conscious lawyer.  She's about to get married to her boyfriend from the last movie (played by Luke Wilson) and in trying to invite her dog's parents to the wedding (that's right, her DOG'S PARENTS - remember what I said about the movie being \"lamely plotted\"?), she finds out that the dog's mother is being held prisoner by a cosmetics company that is pro-animal testing.<br><br>So...Elle decides to go to Washington to take on animal testing.  And I wish I was in a different theater.<br><br>What we have here is a comedy with no good jokes.  Not a single one.  This movie's idea of \"comedy\" is for Elle to find out her chihuahua is gay.  And then in the very next scene, the chihuahua is wearing a studded leather vest.  Sigh.<br><br>Also, it's dumb.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but there's a big difference between movies that go about being dumb in a very smart, witty way (see \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\") and a movie like \"Legally Blonde 2\", which is just plain dopey.  The story is idiotic, characters change their minds and motivations for no reason other than to fit into where the plot is going, and everything wraps up in a way that is nauseatingly phony.<br><br>I've pretty much given up on Reese Witherspoon.  Where is the cool, edgy actress that starred in movies like \"Election\", \"Freeway\" and \"American Psycho\"?  Abducted by Hollywood to make useless, vanilla movies like this, apparently.  <br><br>I, for one, would love to see her character from \"Freeway\" scare the living s*** out of Elle Woods.","user":"Ronin47","rank":[44,54]},{"title":"Sucked in ways I can barely explain","rating":1,"date":"22 January 2006","review":"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie while on a wonderful trip to Greece. As the 'plot' rolled out, I sank lower and lower in my seat. I was actually embarrassed to be North American.<br><br>Consider: Elle goes on a mission to find her *dog's* parents so they can attend her wedding. No, not her dog's wedding. *Her* wedding. Now, think about that. I guess this is sort of a spoiler, except it's revealed in the first ten minutes, because it's the whole premise. Yes, that's the peak. It goes downhill from there.<br><br>I felt particularly annoyed with Reece Witherspoon. Now, she strikes me as a fairly intelligent young woman. I love most of her stuff. I enjoyed Legally Blonde I. I had high hopes. How did this happen?! Was it just about the money? Was it a bet? A dare? Dumb dumb dumb.<br><br>To be honest, I would *rather* have been attending a dog's wedding.","user":"hannah-164","rank":[31,37]},{"title":"Speechless","rating":12,"date":"12 March 2015","review":"I went to a free screening and demanded a refund.<br><br>I was so long ago And it haunts me still. Seriously Don't.<br><br>I mean it The first was OK.. But this.<br><br>I mean, it had a sub plot about some dogs.. And there was some pink clothing.<br><br>I'm sorry. I watched most of it through my fingers.<br><br>I warn everyone about this movie.<br><br>I hope you heed mine.<br><br>Please beware my warning. You cannot Unsee this horror..<br><br>Turn back while you still can.","user":"Jim-reviews-film","rank":[12,13]}]
