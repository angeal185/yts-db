[{"title":"An underappreciated gem","rating":9,"date":"10 August 2002","review":"Among all the Rankin-Bass-Muller holiday treats, this one is an underappreciated gem.  It's clearly not as well-known as several of the others, probably because it's only marginally a specifically Christmas story, is not associated with a popular Christmas carol, etc.  However, in our family we like this one every bit as much as any of the others, if not more.  The plot is more emotionally engrossing, the original songs are terrific, and there are some particularly appealing and fascinating characters developed.  This story works successfully in different ways for different agegroups.","user":"pajoma","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"My friends laugh at me, but I love it!","rating":5,"date":"5 June 2002","review":"I watch this thing religiously no matter what time of year it is!

It also is romantic since Jack Frost decides to become human to conquer a beautiful human girl... The characters are beautifully created, with tons of imagination, their costumes are amazing, the voices too really are charismatic; the scenes are unbelievably unique and creative; it is a moving and humorous fairy-tale... Even though I no longer am a child, I each year look forward to watching this beautiful animation during Christmas!","user":"reglisse54","rank":[7,8]}]
