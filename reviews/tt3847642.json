[{"title":"A waste of time","rating":1,"date":"2 February 2018","review":"The acting is worse than wet cardboard and the plot is written on toilet paper. It's simply a kid getting the shite beat out of him before he hallucinates and his eyes glow and he wins every fight. It's boring. By the 4th fight, I was like, ok, when will his eyes glow? There they are. Now he'll win. And that's the entire plot of the movie. Eyes glow, boy wins. And I say boy.... the hero actor would be fine in other roles, but we're expected to look at the fittest, muscular blokes beat the shite out of this twig of a kid who could unleash a fury of thumb in fist beatings on anyone in a gym for more than 2 months without feeling anything, and we are expected to believe he's a lethal weapon. It's quite unbelievable.<br><br>Save yourself the time, don't watch this. Use the hour to take a walk with your dog, pet your cat, play a video game, or drill your own teeth with an awl, they would all be more pleasurable than having to watch this film.","user":"paq5528","rank":[36,50]},{"title":"Stunning cinematography and choreography in this indie martial-arts action sci-fi film","rating":8,"date":"1 February 2018","review":"Hollywood stunt-man James Mark debuts his first film as producer, director and writer , and casts his also stunt-man younger brother Chris Mark in his first lead role in this visually stunning indie martial-arts action sci-fi film.<br><br>James' directing of this film was exceptional, as was the cinematography and visually stunning sets. Chris' fight scenes (there are many of them) were well executed and got the adrenaline going, and his acting was very decent for his first lead role.<br><br>The writing had some plot and story issues, evident in the screenplay from the convoluted flashbacks and missing pieces of the story. Perhaps the editing department cut some scenes that should have been left in, especially since the film was only 77 min long.<br><br>My other issue was costume department... some of the (ninja?) outfits seemed loosely put together, and for having such eye catching sets, the poor costume choices stood out, particularly the 'Men in Black' sunglasses that were a little overboard and cheapened the production.<br><br>Nevertheless and surprisingly, I really enjoyed this film and would see it again and recommend it. I'm hoping there's a part 2 in the works.<br><br>The Mark brothers have successfully evolved their repertoire from Hollywood stunt-men in this visually captivating indie film.<br><br>A well deserved 8/10 from me.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[25,49]},{"title":"This has been the easiest review I've ever written!","rating":4,"date":"29 April 2018","review":"REVIEW - KILL ORDER <br><br>When I watch a film I make it a point NOT to see any previous reviews or their scores, so upon reading the description of this film I thought I'd give it a look see. <br><br>Lesson learnt, this is a film to avoid, the acting is dire,the story just silly and the ending, whilst leaving it open for a sequel (which I hope never gets made) is just a complete waste of your time watching the film in the first place. <br><br>This has been the easiest review I've ever written! <br><br>One saving grace for this film are the fight sequences which are outstanding, such a shame they were encased in the rest of the film. <br><br>Rating 4 out of 10","user":"markthomassintek","rank":[6,9]}]
