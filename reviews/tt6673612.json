[{"title":"Good family fun","rating":7,"date":"18 January 2020","review":"No, this is not an Oscar contender.<br><br>But all the negative reviews are completely unwarranted.<br><br>This movie is cheesy and fun. It has talking animals. Good guys and bad guys. A love story. Comic relief.<br><br>It's meant for kids, people. And mine loved it.","user":"arthursheds","rank":[291,381]},{"title":"I don't understand the hate this is getting!","rating":9,"date":"18 January 2020","review":"I was worried going into this that it would be awful based on early reviews. It turned out to be a delightful, humorous family movie with CGI that would put most films to shame. Yes, there are cheesy over-the-top jokes. Yes, a lot of it is silly. Yes, the plot is simple. It's a movie for children! Robert Downey Jr was charming, Michael Sheen was every bit that classic mustache-twirling villain, and Antonio Banderas surprised me with his performance! The child actors were impressive and believable, and the voice acting was cute and probably the funniest part of the movie. Again, let me say- this is a movie intended for children that can be enjoyed by adults who aren't expecting a drama of the year. Let your inner kid out and see a movie for fun. I thoroughly enjoyed this one!","user":"stanluvr_lexx","rank":[389,519]},{"title":"Better than I expected","rating":7,"date":"16 January 2020","review":"If you in for a movie that is just fun and relaxing with a good message about families and helping people out while laughing at silly jokes, this movie is for you. The animals were quite fun with their little jokes and silly comments. My kids really enjoyed it and we thought it was a good family film with a good message. Sit back and enjoy the ride. It's a fun film that everyone can enjoy. Suitable for ages 1 to 101.","user":"AZFamilytime","rank":[197,275]}]
