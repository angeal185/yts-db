Took my 3 year old and she enjoyed the whole thing, as did I. Reviews with any mentioned politics are very closed minded reviewers. This has a well delivered heart warming adventure. Enjoy","user":"jblavigne","rank":[110,141]},{"title":"I loved this movie.","rating":10,"date":"14 January 2019","review":"I knew what it was going into it and it did not disappoint. I'll take animals over most people any day. I never saw any of the things these other reviews point out. I was entertained. I cried. I laughed. I went home and hugged my two American Staffordshire Terriers very tight. Thank you for this movie.","user":"karensanto58","rank":[109,144]}]
