Love the location.","user":"gabriela-194-611412","rank":[2,4]},{"title":"Rated 1 only because there's no 0","rating":1,"date":"2 October 2019","review":"As a Brazilian woman, I'm deeply offended by this movie and can't express in words my frustrations and sadness with this production. They should take it offcatalogue and no one should ever see it. Futile, reckless, stereotypical and mean.","user":"cattarinaguanais","rank":[0,0]}]
