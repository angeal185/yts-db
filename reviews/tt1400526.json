[{"title":"A genuine, but flawed attempt to continue the characters stories.","rating":12,"date":"12 October 2010","review":"In an interview after The Tribe Feldman said he had taken the criticism on board, and as producer he would address all of it. well, it seems he actually DID. Don't get me wrong, this is still a low budget badly acted DVD movie, but this time they've done a lot of stuff right. It is much better than The Tribe, but it does have some vital ingredients missing causing it to end up being similar in style to John carpenters vampires.<br><br>Many people will be pleased to know that there's no \"XTREAM\" \"with it\" \"youtube generation\" surfing vampires. The vampires here are properly updated for today, but unfortunately you don't get to see much of them, even in THE TRIBE we had a chance to meet some of the gang and they came across as mildly threatening, in this movie they pretty much keep to themselves. <br><br>Most of the plot revolves around Edgar Frog, his warped childlike obsession with vampire hunting, it occasionally brushes up on the emotional losses of Edgar's friends and there is also a bit of time used to unravel the twisted mess The Tribe left the series in. While the storyline has much more substance than the predecessor it still leaves a lot to be desired, many of the new additions are under written and could have been flesh out a bit more. They did at least try this time, there's a plot twist, which, due to casting was a bit disappointing and one which you can see coming as soon as we're given the pieces to put it together, I was happy to take any kind of plot twist over what the tribe gave us.<br><br>The highlight is Jamieson Newlander's extended Cameo as Alan frog, he has a small part but manages to steal the show and left me wanting much more. Don't expect this movie to be the reunion of the frog brothers; they don't go raiding the vampires den together or anything, all Newlander gets is three present day scenes, one newly filmed flashback and some flashbacks to the original movie.<br><br>Feldman seems to have slightly toned down his over the top performance, he still hams it up as Edgar, but this time the whole cast seem to be having fun, something lacking from The Tribe. Missing from both the lost boys sequels is any younger kids or teens, In the original movie the kids were written for comic relief, acting like brave men, being the accidental heroes and brave in the face of danger, here because there's no kids, a lot of the comedy is missing. It seems Lost kids don't become vampires anymore.<br><br>The movie manages to not take itself too seriously and does get a very small glimmer of an 80's campy movie feel in a few places, though not enough to compare with anything from the original. If you have sat through other Straight to DVD action / Horror movies, you pretty much know what to expect with the acting and pacing (or rather lack of). <br><br>To sum things up, The Thirst genuinely attempted to be a follow up rather than a low budget retelling, it's nothing spectacular but it's worth at least one watch.","user":"Emrabt","rank":[37,47]},{"title":"purely for the fans","rating":6,"date":"11 October 2010","review":"Im a big fan of the original and I really just treat these new films as separate fan films rather than proper sequels and if you do that you can forgive them for some of the cheese that you'll see. Like the other guy said not sure about the ending or where they are going with it but i know Corey hasn't had the best time of it over the years and if it will help him to regain some of his former glory and get him back on his feet again I'm all for it, everyone deserves a second chance.<br><br>If you like the original film and have watched the \"tribe\" then don't stop now you may as well give this one a go but don't expect anything other than a fan film.","user":"camera-shy","rank":[21,29]},{"title":"Second sequel to the classic of the eighties is plenty of noisy action , chills and lots of blood and gore","rating":6,"date":"24 May 2017","review":"The final installment of original The Lost Boys Trilogy . Edgar Frog (Corey Feldman) is stressed as well as bankrupted and he has to sell his valuable comic book collection just to pay rent on a decrepit trailer that is ultimately evicted . Shortly after , a best-selling vampire novelist called Gwen (Tanit Phoenix) approaches with an offer . She needs him to encounter her sibling who has gone missing after getting sucked into a series of underground raves , called The Gathering , run by a mysterious spinner named DJ X (Seb Castang) . As DJ Dusk is the head vampire and utilizing his parties to raise his undead henchmen . Being given a new party , Edgar must assemble a vamp-hunting bunch , being accompanied by Zoe (Casey Dolan) , his brother Alan (Jamison Newlander) who is dealing with his own dark demons , along with a Hollywood participant of reality show called Lars von Goetz (Stevan Van Nieker) and the cameraman Claus (Joe Vaz) . The rave will take place in a slaughterhouse on enigmatic island , there they meet DJ Dusk X , a pack of bloodsuckers and hoodlums . Before the fighting is over Edgar will find out there is a greater evil and must take on his most astonishing fears.<br><br>This eerie picture displays terror , thriller , humor with tongue-in-cheek , violence , chills and loads of blood and guts . The movie contains great load of action , special effects abundant made by 3D computer generator and numerous scenes have you on edge of your seat . However , it fails to deliver either frights or laughs . The screenwriter provides a very serviceable and passable-knit plot with suspense , haunting tension , horror and improbable situations . In this one , there is a spectacular rave party and a powerful drug , known as The Thirst , which resulted out to be a mixture of vampire blood and ecstasy . The title became a direct-to-DVD hit smash , making back its medium budget in just some weeks of DVD sales . Corey Feldman as Edgar Frog again plays a vampire hunter with a sympathetic and enticing attitude . Corey Haim returned as well , but only for some flashback scenes . Despite turning down a role in the sequel , Corey Haim announced he would take part in a third and fourth installment . But he died before anything could come of the project . <br><br>The original and best film of the trilogy was ¨The Lost boys¨ (1987) by Joel Schumacher with Jason Patric , Kiefer Sutherland , Jami Gertz , Corey Feldman , Corey Haim , Dianne Wiest , Barnard Hughes , Edward Herrmann . The first sequel titled ¨Lost Boys : the tribe¨ by P.J. Pesce was starred by Tad Hilgenbrick ,Angus Sutherland , Donald's brother , and Corey Feldman , of course . Due to poor critical as well as public response of Lost Boys : The Tribe , Corey Feldman was promoted to the main character in ¨The thirst¨ . While the other Frog brother Jamison Newlander, only appeared in an alternate ending found on the DVD . The Tribe saw the return of Corey Haim and Corey Feldman , famous couple by that time , in the 80s playing two Peter Cushing teens , both of whom made several films as likable adolescent duo ; however today they only play B movies . While filming ¨The tribe¨ Feldman told that the Frog Brothers will reunite for this third installment , titled ¨Lost Boys: The Thirst ¨ by Dario Piana ; sadly Corey Ham doesn't repeat role being recently dead . The motion picture was regularly directed by Dario Pesce , a filmmaker expert on terror , such as he proved in ¨The deaths of Ian Stone¨. Produced by Warner Premiere , the studio behind the latter two sequels , but it went bankrupt and all ¨The Lost Boys¨ franchise schemes were abandoned . The flick will appeal to vampire genre fans and is especially aimed at juvenile audiences.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[4,4]}]
