[{"title":"Worst Movie EVER!","rating":1,"date":"3 June 2018","review":"So my dad bought this movie at Wal-Mart and I wish I could sue Wal-Mart for selling this piece of garbage. There is, literally, not a single redeeming aspect to this movie. Heck, the only reason I'm taking the time to review this monstrosity is to prevent other people from throwing away their hard earned money and/or their valuable time. I don't know if this movie is actually based on a real serial killer, but if so, they should sue for slander or something. DON'T NOT BUY OR WATCH THIS MOVIE!","user":"sswba2003","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"I'm Good.","rating":4,"date":"12 April 2018","review":"A group of college kids are assigned the task of making a horror film short. They choose the New Jersey location where there was a killing by a necrophiliac serial killer...kill then rape, not my first choice. The film was extremely uneven. At times it was a comedy and a spoof and at other times it attempted to be a serious slasher, which it never was. I loved several of the characters while others needed work. <br><br>It was supposed to have been based on a true story which didn't ring true. Supposedly the man who confessed to the crimes was executed. New Jersey has not executed anyone since 1963. Free legal advice: If you are smoking something illegal, don't film yourself doing it, or any other crime. The clown on the cover doesn't really play into the feature. This is not a clown killer film. PLOT SPOILER: The final girl has sex, which goes against the unwritten code of horror films. The film worked best as a comedy-horror and there wasn't enough of it. <br><br>Guide: F-word, sex, brief corpse nudity (Zaughn Elizabeth Ivins)","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Hahahahah","rating":2,"date":"26 November 2019","review":"This movie was terrible!
