[{"title":"Excellent for low budget.","rating":7,"date":"17 December 2019","review":"It's pretty good movie. I like the story. Acting was pretty much convincing. Special effects are awesome. For low budget production, it's excellent sci-fi movie. Definitely it's worth of your time.","user":"patrikmatrixxx","rank":[104,125]},{"title":"Good, down to earth superpowers film","rating":7,"date":"17 December 2019","review":"It's nice to see a film about superpowers be about \"normal\" people, about the choices they have to make to live their lives. A solid story, good characters, good acting and very well done special effects make this film well worth watching.","user":"emily-583","rank":[92,110]},{"title":"A mutant movie done right","rating":8,"date":"14 December 2019","review":"Code 8 is a mix of Blade Runner (for the music style and the image texture and color) and X-Men for the scenario. It's a very good movie.\nIt's a little bit like if the director and the producers said « ok teenagers have the X-Men saga, let's do something around the same idea but for adults ».\nThe are no jaw dropping special effects, mutants (called \"person with abilities\" in the movie) dont do funky stuff.. every body acts great.. it's the kind of sci-fi movie that will very likely go unnoticed and it's a shame, it deserves much much more.","user":"lstelie","rank":[108,141]}]
