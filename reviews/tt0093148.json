[{"title":"You will fall in love with Harry!","rating":9,"date":"22 May 2000","review":"You will fall in love with Harry and wish that Bigfoot / Sasquatch was real. A funny, endearing movie!  There are several messages along the way:  1) Some humans are more beastly than animals; 2) Forgiveness is a powerful healer; and 3) Protect the wilderness, for it contains many wonderful things that are not always apparent to us.  This movie is a family favorite!","user":"rmb-tn","rank":[37,44]},{"title":"Heartwarming wake-up to reality","rating":27,"date":"27 October 2004","review":"I used to dislike this film. I disliked the mushiness, the story and even the sad parts. This movie was stuck on the shelf, covered in dust, forgotten.<br><br>Only days ago I pulled this movie out and decided to sit down and watch it, expecting the same mushy film that I saw years and years ago.<br><br>However, as I have gotten older I have a greater understanding of what this film offers me and people alike. In fact, it touched me so much to see how something that is often portrayed as scary was so gentle and caring.<br><br>From the introduction when Harry is first discovered (in a rather unfortunate way) to the end of the movie, the Hendersons learn that Harry is more human than they ever thought, and that he has a bigger heart than the human race combined.<br><br>Throughout the film, the effect that Harry has on people's lives is always seen. We as humans are so receptive to myth, legend and rumours. Yet, before the truth is given a chance to be known, we block our ears, close our eyes and run away.<br><br>The Hendersons, Jacques LeFleur -a hunter who has followed his trail for 25 years and Dr Wrightwood -a man whose life has been ruined by his dedication towards the study of Sasquatch, all gain a new perspective on life, as well as a new respect. Their original feelings of the \"Beast\" all quashed swiftly to realize that inside of it lay a big heart.<br><br>Harry's compassion, love for other beings and respect for life made this film an absolute delight to watch. I whole heartedly recommend this for anybody looking for a family film that not only warms the heart, but also teaches a lesson of who is really the monster on Earth.","user":"uranium_death","rank":[33,40]},{"title":"My favorite movie as a kid!","rating":10,"date":"23 April 2007","review":"I've been looking for this movie forever on DVD, my copy on tape is long gone and I hate watching the cut version when it is shown on TV. I was so addicted to this movie as a kid, when our TV broke, I plugged headphones into the VCR so I could hear it. Whats sad is I watched it so many times that I didn't mind that there was no picture, I still knew what was happening because I watched it a least 60 times beforehand. I'm so happy its finally coming out on DVD because I have a kiddo on the way and I can't wait till they are old enough to watch it with me. If you have kids and want to watch a movie everyone will like this is a definite buy. It will be watched over and over and your kids will never get tired of it, which could possibly be a bad thing. I hope this was helpful, I tried not to mention anything about the plot because it best to watch it and form your own opinion.","user":"thefstopper82","rank":[22,26]}]
