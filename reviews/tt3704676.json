[{"title":"I Give Up","rating":6,"date":"22 May 2019","review":"Help! Is there an editor in the house? At times this is all over the place. It is talky and slow at times as the concepts are discussed. I alway find too much discussion means that the visuals weren't planned well. We get a lot of computer graphics and flashing images.","user":"Hitchcoc","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Patchy And Headache Inducing Despite The Great Opening","rating":7,"date":"12 May 2015","review":"A man sits in front of his laptop clearly agitated . He looks out the window and sees a spectral figure standing on the street corner looking up towards him . He goes back to his computer clearly terrified . He gasps \" He's found me\" . He swears and panics and as the picture breaks up something enters his room <br><br>If nothing else THE BRAIN HACK contains a great opening hook . Billed as \"A metaphysical thriller for the digital generation\" the opening scene hints it's going to be great horror short but doesn't quite deliver . It reminded me in some ways of Aronofsky's PI as Fallon and Harper discuss the possibilities of God existing . Of course there's very logical reasons for believing in God . In the foreword of his book The Blind Watchmaker Richard Dawkins easily explains it away by stating that whenever mankind became self aware he made things so it's logical that he jumped to the conclusion that someone also made the seas , sky and sun . Take also the ancient Indo-Aryans who through the seasons changing and the female menstrual cycle believed everything including human life itself was cyclical hence Hinduism the oldest established religion on Earth which has reincarnation as its fundamental belief . Unfortunately the discussion between Fallon and Harper becomes a bit confusing and then turns in to a lot of running about while at the same time giving more than a little nod to Cronenberg's VIDEODROME . Then more running about and confused flashbacks in a short film that obviously thinks it is clever but is nothing of the sort and seems to be a showcase of how to give the audience a headache . Nice opening but nothing much else after that","user":"Theo Robertson","rank":[11,21]},{"title":"Style over substance","rating":4,"date":"9 November 2015","review":"\"The Brain Hack\" is a 19-minute science-fiction short film from February this year. It was written and directed by Joseph White, a fairly unexperienced filmmaker, who, however, also worked on the recent James Bond movie \"Skyfall\". When I read the description already: \"a metaphysical thriller for the digital generation\", it basically says it all. This is supposed to be so smart, innovative and intelligent that it basically only could go wrong. How about setting the goal of making a movie that would appeal to all generations? Anyway, the main idea isn't bad here in terms of the story, but the 2 actors aren't too great really and apart from that, the film soon loses itself in special effects instead of going for a well-written story. The ending is pretty much the negative highlight with the photo effects. Not recommended.","user":"Horst_In_Translation","rank":[7,12]}]
