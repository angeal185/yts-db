[{"title":"First-rate comedy","rating":7,"date":"3 March 2003","review":"This is a comedy that doesn't suffer from time or repeated viewings. It has all the trappings of a true classic. The cast, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Edward Hermann and Roddy McDowall all put in good performances. The 4 child actors all do very well, too. The story is a funny one and it keeps me laughing. All in all, a very funny movie. I own it and will throw it in the DVD player every once in a while.","user":"grahamsj3","rank":[91,102]},{"title":"Like to smile? You'll like this flick.","rating":10,"date":"18 July 2002","review":"Yeah, sure, you know how it's going to end. Yes, it has all been done before. But the heart of this snob turned sweetheart story is relayed with such charm and grace by Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russel, and supported by such a strong cast (Roddy McDowall among others), that it is enjoyable none-the-less.<br><br>Movie snobs, insisting on original plots (as if there really are any) might not love this flick. But anyone who can appreciate proven talent in a good-natured comedy will find these 2 hours time well spent. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to smile.","user":"CLundmark","rank":[58,66]},{"title":"Quite Amusing","rating":10,"date":"5 October 2002","review":"I watched this movie for the first time when I was 10 and still watching it to this day. The cast is excellent and the storyline is silly but you just can't help yourself laughing at all of Goldie's screw-ups or Kurt's incompetent ways of parenting. The supporting cast is great, what more can I say??, if you ever see this in the video store, it's worth renting. GO OVERBOARD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","user":"Bourque77","rank":[66,78]}]
