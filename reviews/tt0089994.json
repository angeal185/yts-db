[{"title":"What a great childrens film that is fun for parents too!","rating":10,"date":"4 October 2002","review":"This is a wonderful film for children ages 8 and under. Parents of children that age will be very grateful for a childrens film which has zero bathroom humor or any other crudity. Now I am no prude, but in a day and age when young children are treated to scenes of wart hogs with gas (Lion King) or the sight of a dog hiking it's leg to relieve itself with a commentary(Homeward Bound), it is just nice to have something completely harmless for the little ones. I had to comment because this film deserved more than just to have a listing of: In Memory of Waylon Jennings. This film is a credit to the wonderful creativity of people like Jim Henson, who put quality children programs ahead of the easier, poorly made childrens fare.<br><br>Michael","user":"Michael1958","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"My first movie!","rating":22,"date":"22 March 2000","review":"This was the very first movie I ever saw at a theater. I was six years old and my grandma took me to see it. We both loved it. My memories are kind of fuzzy, as I haven't seen Follow That Bird since. But I remember being really sad because Big Bird was separated from his loved ones at Sesame Street. And I remember the gang trying to find him. And I remember, when the movie was over, how happy I was and how much fun I had.","user":"Monika-5","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Great for kids....bu eszssxt also great for adults as well!wsxp;//vnb","rating":8,"date":"28 January 2019","review":"\"Follow That Bird\" is a rare sort of children's film...the type that actually will appeal to both the kids AND the parents. Teens, of course, will hate it...because they're teens....but everyone else should have a nice time watching this together.<br><br>The story is about a bunch of do-gooder birds trying to find Big Bird an actual family. They place him with a family of dodos in middle America and he turns out to prefer life back on Sesame Street...and his old friends miss him as well. So, these friends set off to find him...and at the same time Big Bird leaves and wanders about aimlessly looking for Sesame Street.<br><br>So why did I like this one? Well because although the film is oriented towards kids, there are some genuinely funny moments...mostly starring Oscar the Grouch. He opens the film with a cute and funny song and has many great moments throughout the movie...such as when he takes his friends to the grouch restaurant. And, if that isn't enough, there are plenty of other wonrderful cameos by the Sesame Street muppets...more than enough to satisfy viewers. Well written, sweet and enjoyable from start to finish...this is a Sesame Street film that's hard not to love.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[4,4]}]
