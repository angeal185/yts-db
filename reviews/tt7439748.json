[{"title":"If you like British humor and have a sweet spot for everyday romance - you'll enjoy this","rating":10,"date":"25 January 2020","review":"This is a personal favorite so I'll give it a 10 - since I'd love to watch it again! It's a spot on 2nd (or 1st...) date experience for us awkward but funny people. The acting is phenomenal and it has scenes that are so cringe but lovable at the same time! I go \"oh no you didn't!\" from one second to looking starry eyed and giggling like a school girl the next. And I love George MacKay and Alexandra Roach, they are such an attractive couple in this movie. The chemistry is definitely there! Greatly underrated at the moment. If you like British humor and have a sweet spot for everyday romance - you'll enjoy this.","user":"mainnaho","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Great british comedy","rating":7,"date":"4 November 2019","review":"Great acting and very funny for a film mostly set in one house, well worth a watch","user":"lancechoproberts","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"Great British Humour","rating":10,"date":"19 January 2020","review":"Perfectly awkward British humour with great acting.","user":"mackaymaryanne","rank":[4,5]}]
