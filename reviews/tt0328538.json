[{"title":"An inconvenient truth","rating":17,"date":"17 April 2007","review":"One of the most common criticisms of \"Thirteen\" is that it is 'unrealistic'. However, \"Thirteen\" never claims to portray all thirteen year olds, hell, it doesn't even claim to portray a significant number of them. This film is about the select few who choose to take a certain path in life. They have no true parental figures, their lives are in shambles, and they are making a quick and painful transition into supposed adulthood. Notice the other people in the school scenes, they're normal, they're just studying, hanging out with their friends, and going through the motions of school life. Those aren't the people that are being portrayed here.<br><br>Nikki Reed, an immense young talent, plays Evie Zamora, the hottest and arguably most popular girl in school. Evan Rachel Wood plays Tracy, a girl who still keeps her stuffed animals and Barbie dolls on her bed, and whose parents have divorced recently and whose mother works as a hairdresser out of her home to support the family. Tracy goes to junior high completely oblivious of any of the social pressure that's present, and begins to idolize Evie, obviously a terrible role model. In an outstanding early scene, Tracy follows Evie into a shopping mall and is initially appalled at the idea of shoplifting, but in a desperate attempt to fit in with the 'cool' crowd, she steals a purse from a woman who sat next to her, and finds Evie again, at which point she is accepted. Sooner rather than later, Tracy is drawn into a terrible depression which she deals with by using drugs, cutting herself, and being sexually promiscuous. She does all this completely uncertain of whether she wants to, and mostly because she's following Evie's lead. To say that no 13 year olds have experiences similar to this is pure ignorance, and if you're a parent who thinks this is unrealistic- think again, and think hard. In today's world, narcotics are available as easily as candy bars, and pop stars are more like porn stars, putting pressure on today's teens to become promiscuous sooner in life.<br><br>Wood is a terrific, terrific actress who has made some questionable career choices before and since this, but I hope to see her continue to star in films like \"The Upside of Anger\" and \"Down in the Valley\". However, in this particular film, even her tremendously powerful performance pales in comparison with Holly Hunter's Oscar-nominated supporting role as Tracy's mother, and by Nikki Reed, who, in her first ever acting role, is nothing short of stunning. This role is very, very racy for any 15 year old to take on, and Reed, who also co-wrote this film's terrific script with Catherine Hardwicke, takes it on with maturity I've never seen before from an actress of her age. First time director Catherine Hardwicke does a great job here, her work is inventive and adds real grit to this tale.<br><br>The bottom line is, \"Thirteen\" is a great, realistic, disturbing urban drama that you should watch with an open mind and with knowledge that it is based in fact. This is a challenging and brave film, and everyone involved has gained immediate respect from me. One of the best of 2003.<br><br>8/10","user":"ametaphysicalshark","rank":[96,105]},{"title":"Proof that the oscars are rigged...","rating":10,"date":"8 May 2004","review":"How did Holly Hunter not win that Oscar? Why weren't Evan Rachel Wood and Nikki Reed at least nominated, let alone winners?<br><br>I have seen many films in my time, and none have held such great performances as this, and few have spoken to the audience in such a powerful way.<br><br>Holly Hunter, who is always superb, outdid herself in the role of Mel, the caring mother who doesn't know when to put a tighter grip on her daughter, Tracy. Her performance is so touching, and so painful that you want to get inside her and show her what she needs to do.<br><br>Evan Rachel Wood is outstanding as Tracy, the young girl who so desperately wants to fit in, and will go to any lengths to get that. Wood is always good, but she too has outdone herself, and perfectly nailed the role of Tracy. Not once does she come across as a pretentious actress trying to act like a teen.<br><br>Nikki Reed, who was introduced by this film, delivers a performance that is worth the ticket fare alone. Evie is so manipulative, so seductive, and so real that you can't possibly blame Tracy for wanting to be like her.<br><br>Whoever it is who decides who gets the Oscars - wake up and realise that you need to award these to the performances, not the actors who wear the nicer dresses!<br><br>Thirteen is one of the more powerful pieces of cinema around. The camera probes right into the livers of our protagonists, denying anyone the joy if seeing this grim masterpiece from a safe distance. The soundtrack rocks along to the emotions of the characters. The performances create not only a good film, but a little disturbing slice of life.<br><br>Having seen Thirteen, I now understand why people label some films as important. this is certainly one of them.","user":"Freedomisanillusion","rank":[290,435]},{"title":"Scary, Beautiful, Gritty Picture of Adolescence","rating":10,"date":"8 February 2004","review":"Wow.  Talk about a train wreck.  Of course I'm speaking in reference to the life of Tracy, the main character, not the movie itself.  I give props to the cast and crew, they all got mad skillz.  Now for a more intellectual look toward the dystopic view of adolescence and the loss of innocence.<br><br>Now that I've thoroughly confused old and young alike, here's the meat and bones of why I think you should see this movie.  The movie captures the creation of the emotional rift between an adolescent girl and her mother. While the rift is eventually healed, the impact on the viewer is anything but easily forgotten about.  The movie is shocking, don't assume that it won't shock you; these kids do more (insert ANY shocking noun here, i.e. sex, drugs, etc.) in a day than an average college student, at least a college student like me, would SEE, much less do, in an enitire semester. <br><br>\nEvan Rachel Wood, who plays Tracy, gives a (dare I say it about someone so young?) Oscar-worthy performance in her portrayal of an emotionally troubled juvenile.  She captures the mood swings, the dark brooding, the joy of being that age perfectly.  If there was ever a reason for being scared of having a child, much less a daughter, having a daughter like Evan Rachel Wood's character would be it.<br><br>Nikki Reed, the co-writer of the script, deserves notation for her breakout performance.  Her acting was very good, considering that she has never had any experience in the field ever.  Rather than detract from her performance, her inexperience in selling her character to the audience only added to the dark, manipulative side of her character.  If she studies the art and craft of acting, she will be a presence in Hollywood for years to come.<br><br>Holly Hunter gives another stellar performance.  Her character's balance, or lack thereof, between the enforcer of parental-rules and her desire to be involved in her daughter's life perfectly captures the connundrum of every parent.  The climax of the film, featuring Hunter and Wood, reminds the viewer of the intensity that raw emotion can create when you put two amazing actresses together and set the pressure-cooker on Nuclear Meltdown.<br><br>Thirteen is a must-see if you are entering middle school, or if you have a daughter entering middle school.  Better yet, go see it with your daughter; you will both be talking about it for a long time.  I give it a whole-hearted 10 out of 10.","user":"DJExcen","rank":[180,266]}]
