[{"title":"Cute, Harmless Fun","rating":7,"date":"21 February 2004","review":"Being a fan of the first Lion King, I was definitely looking forward to this movie, but I knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original.  I know that many Disney fans are wary of the direct-to-video movies, as I have mixed feelings of them as well.<br><br>While watching The Lion King 1½, I tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie.  Am I going to be so devout about The Lion King that I will nitpick at certain scenes, or am I just going to accept this movie as just another look at The Lion King story?  Most of the time, I found myself embracing the latter.<br><br>The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments.  Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them.  People just love these characters!  My favorite parts of the movie include the montage of Timon &amp; Pumbaa taking care of young Simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos.<br><br>I could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though, like the real reason everyone bowed to baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1.  I guess those types of jokes are for the younger set (which after all is the target audience.  I don't think many kids are really concerned about Disney's profit margin on direct-to-video movies.)<br><br>However, I will say that I was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie.  I'm just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me. Something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract me.<br><br>As for the music, it wasn't too bad, but don't expect any classics to come from this movie.  At least LK2 had the nice ballad, \"Love Will Find a Way.\" As for the voicework, it was well done in this movie.  Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job as always, and even new cast members, the classic comedic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (best known as Marge Simpson), did a great job also.  You can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the Virtual Safari on Disc 2 of the DVD.  That feature is definitely a lot of fun!!<br><br>So all in all, The Lion King 1½ isn't a perfect movie, but it's cute and entertaining.  I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun, lighthearted look at the Lion King masterpiece from our funny friends' perspectives.<br><br>My IMDb Rating: 7/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: B (Good)","user":"travisimo","rank":[34,36]},{"title":"Downright not awful!","rating":7,"date":"8 August 2007","review":"This is a straight-to-video movie, so it should go without saying that it's not going to rival the first Lion King, but that said, this was downright good.<br><br>My kids loved this, but that's a given, they love anything that's a cartoon. The big shock was that *I* liked it too, it was laugh out loud funny at some parts (even the fart jokes*), had lots of rather creative tie-ins with the first movie, and even some jokes that you had to be older to understand (but without being risqué like in Shrek [\"do you think he's compensating for something?\"]).<br><br>A special note on the fart jokes, I was surprised to find that none of the jokes were just toilet noises (in fact there were almost no noises/imagery at all, the references were actually rather subtle), they actually had a setup/punchline/etc, and were almost in good taste. I'd like my kids to think that there's more to humor than going to the bathroom, and this movie is fine in those regards.<br><br>Hmm what else? The music was so-so, not nearly as creative as in the first or second movie, but plenty of fun for the kids. No painfully corny moments, which was a blessing for me. A little action but nothing too scary (the Secret of NIMH gave my kids nightmares, not sure a G rating was appropriate for that one...)<br><br>All in all I'd say this is a great movie for kids of any age, one that's 100% safe to let them watch (I try not to be overly sensitive but I've had to jump up and turn off the TV during a few movies that were less kid-appropriate than expected) - but you're safe to leave the room during this one. I'd say stick around anyway though, you might find that you enjoy it too :)","user":"Relaets","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Another great straight-to-video sequel/spoof, that's worth a theatrical treatment.","rating":7,"date":"8 June 2007","review":"My Take: A funny take on THE LION KING, posing as a sequel. Surprisingly amusing. <br><br>Surprisingly, \"Lion King 1 1/2\" is actually another funny straight-to-video, that's worth a theatrical treatment. I don't see why Disney released this straight to video, and release crappy movies like \"Chicken Little\" and \"Return to Neverland\" theatrically. Those movies are better off seen in the video stores (in the \"new releases\" area), rather than seeing their theatrical posters outside the theaters.<br><br>This one is merely a spoof of the first film (although the events in \"Simba's Pride\" hasn't taken place yet), on Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa's (voiced by Ernie Sabella) point of view. We get to see them make fun of the events in the first film. Original voices from the first film, like Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their voicing roles from the first film, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give some hilarious comedy relief as Timon's mom and grumpy uncle.<br><br>So doesn't this sound fun. Maybe not now, but go watch it for yourself. The fact that it's not that serious in its plot makes it the more enjoyable. It's kinda like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa.<br><br>Video movie rating: ***1/2 out of 5.","user":"vip_ebriega","rank":[19,21]}]
