[{"title":"Fun genre flick","rating":8,"date":"2 July 2018","review":"Obviously no drag queens or indie music in 1930's... ??? Think you might be missing the point dude. I think it's a cool new take on a fun film noir theme. Loved the music! Think everyones missing the point. I thought it was fun to watch. Just for that I'm giving it an 8. It's clearly a genre flick. Good job from first time director.","user":"stephenk-16596","rank":[20,27]},{"title":"Absurdist cool","rating":7,"date":"2 July 2018","review":"Raucous and unique. It's non linear, which I like in films. My two cents is to jump into the world and enjoy. The music is rad. Alice Eve is totally hot as usual. It's like a rocky horror picture show vibe without the set piece songs. There are some really funny scenes, but the language is hard to follow sometimes. I think it's clever though and totally absurdist.","user":"jhaswell-27450","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"Cheeky... Not your typical grieving widow.","rating":10,"date":"3 July 2018","review":"Had fun watching this with my family. Busy and interesting. Incredible set design and felt cheeky the whole way through. Alice Eve jumps off the screen, but the whole cast really delivers great performances. Baz Lurman meets Highclere Castle meets punk rock.","user":"fembell90","rank":[15,20]}]
