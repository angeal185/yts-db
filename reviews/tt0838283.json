[{"title":"Extremely Stupid Yet Extremely Funny Comedy Gold!","rating":8,"date":"3 February 2009","review":"I watched step brothers yesterday for the second time after purchasing it on DVD. For me this is always the tough test when it comes to comedy. I watched it at a packed cinema which as you know in itself can make a film ultimately funny without being so. But i have to say this film still delivered the goods so well.<br><br>First up this film is STUPID it is ridiculous but it's a comedy with Will Ferrell in it what did you honestly expect?! But my god it's funny it really is hilarious Ferrell and Reilly make an awesome on screen team and the comedy moments just bounce off one an other , each man just helps make the others role as funny as it could have been. <br><br>It gives you hilarious jokes , stupidly funny scenes , it's one of those comedy's that so so often tries to catch you off guard and every time it absolutely nails it! <br><br>And underneath all the stupidity bonds are formed , compassion is found and what really matters in life is discovered. You almost feel as if you've learnt a little something<br><br>It's one of my personal favourite comedy movies and goes up there with some of the greats (Blazing Saddles , Burn After Reading , Superbad , Knocked Up , Anchorman etc.)","user":"Dean_Jenkins","rank":[98,127]},{"title":"Plenty Of Laughs With Ferrell And Reilly","rating":8,"date":"14 April 2017","review":"\"Step Brothers\" is a comedy in the vein of dumb and dumber, with a pair of good comic actors (Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly) portraying two losers who still live with their parents and lead irresponsible lives.<br><br>Reilly is the perfect foil and he is fearless when it comes to committing to the role. But no one is better at playing the man-child than Will Ferrell (except maybe Paul Reubens). The nonstop punchlines combined with some physical humor are a feast for this twosome.<br><br>This is not highbrow humor, but its among the best of its kind.","user":"atlasmb","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Yes, it is very stupid and yet I am ashamed to admit I enjoyed it.","rating":7,"date":"2 August 2009","review":"Okay, I must admit that this movie was incredibly stupid, offensive and awful...but somehow I still laughed and enjoyed myself. Maybe it was because the film had no pretenses--it never even tried to be deep or intelligent--just appeal to our baser instincts.<br><br>The reason I watched this film is because I loved TALLADEGA NIGHTS so much. Another Will Farrell/John C. Reilly film sure sounded great--even if it didn't match the quality or laughs of this earlier film.<br><br>The film is about two total losers who still live at home with their parent, even though they are 39 and 40 years old. On top of this, they both have the common sense and maturity of 7 year-olds---very, very slow 7 year-olds! And in both roles, Ferrell and Reilly both sounded like little boys in adult bodies--and this provided a lot of laughs. When both their parents met and married, however, both Ferrell and Reilly handed it like most immature children--they sulked and threw tantrums. Then, in a strange twist, the two losers realized how much they had in common and became fast friends. The problem, however, is that as friends they both had a lot of crazy and destructive energy--and perhaps it was better when they were fighting and arguing all the time! The film manages to entertain because it is well-written, plus the actors seemed to have a lot of fun acting like total idiots. This fun translated to fun for the audience as well. However, I should warn you that the movie is very, very crude--with lots of colorful language, a pair of fake testicles and lots of sexual references. While kids love Will Ferrell movies, I don't recommend this except for older and more mature audiences (that's ironic, isn't it?).<br><br>Overall, lots of primitive and crude humor that manages to make you laugh throughout. It ain't pretty, but it is fun and worth seeing.","user":"MartinHafer","rank":[45,59]}]
