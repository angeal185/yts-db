[{"title":"Enjoyable tale.","rating":7,"date":"14 June 2013","review":"I do not understand the low rating. The film is enjoyable and valuable in several respects. The photo is very beautiful and the actors recite their part in proper way, through a history that goes smoothly until the end. Perhaps it is not a masterpiece of cinema, but it deserves more than 4 stars. It 'a nice love story, with a good pinch of mystery with a remarkable soundtrack. Come on! There are many other films out there that deserve 4 stars or less, yet exceeding the sufficiency according to the reviews here. Maybe nothing new or surprising, but certainly a nice movie, worth to be enjoyed. Just do not expect a horror movie that makes you scream and squirm, or a breathtaking thriller, although it has some interesting moments for those who does not disdain a chill: relax, put on the DVD, enjoy the tale and judge for yourself.","user":"MrAlfa","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"Refreashingly good","rating":10,"date":"22 July 2013","review":"At first I thought the movie seemed silly, but it quickly proved otherwise. It is a very haunting love story. Very well done. Alexia Fast has a great handle on the accent. The progression is slow. It isn't chock full of action, but it doesn't need to be. It's a walk through the supernatural, not running from explosions and jumping through glass. It's nothing like the Blair witch clones or the paranormal activity clones. It's no slasher. <br><br>I won't go into any details, but I was pleased to see a film that was more haunting, less gore and fright. This film is actually believable, akin to many family or campfire tales of the past. It's a wonderful expression of how history can haunt a land. I'm from Kentucky, and stories like this are spot-on. It is really difficult to discuss without completely spoiling the plot. Excellent watch. I will no doubt recommend to friends and family, and certainly watch again.","user":"j-a-hartmanbaker","rank":[19,26]},{"title":"Very Beautiful Photography, But Never Quite Hits the Mark","rating":5,"date":"16 May 2013","review":"Eli (Spencer Daniels) and his father move to the farm of childhood friend Waylon (Brad Dourif). Eli is seemingly all alone, at least until he meets Amanda -- who is not all that she appears to be.<br><br>The biggest complaint I have on this title is the cover art on the DVD. While the poster is beautiful, for whatever reason the cover is instead a cheap image of a woman who looks like she is being kidnapped and tortured. Yet, despite the cover, this is not a horror film or anything involving torture. It is a sort of love story.<br><br>Not that horror fans will not enjoy it -- cult favorite Brad Dourif has a sizable role, and there are a few skeletons and some blood, so they might get that sinister grin at the corners of their lips. I entered into it expecting a horror film -- and while that was not what I saw, it is still a solid film.<br><br>The photography is excellent, and the story is for the most part your standard boy meets girl tale. There are some twists, and some interesting family tension. There is drama, there is mystery... I did not care for the actress playing Amanda (her voice seemed too childish), but overall everyone had that \"everyman\" quality that I feel is important in crafting an empathetic story.<br><br>I cannot get into it much more without spoilers, and I refuse to spoiler this film. Despite my rather low rating, it is not a bad film and worth checking out. I just wish they had used a different cover.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[29,44]}]
