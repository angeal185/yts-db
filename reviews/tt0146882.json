[{"title":"Cusack continues winning streak with this film","rating":8,"date":"5 April 2000","review":"I read the novel when it first came out because the title intrigued me, and I found it quite good.  When I heard John Cusack was adapting it and moving the action to Chicago(from London in the novel), I was a little worried, because I worry about changing things during adaptations for arbitrary reasons, but I needn't have worried; though I have a few quibbles, which we'll get to later, Cusack and Co. have done a fine job adapting the novel.<br><br>First off, I've read one comment which claims it stereotypes \"music geeks.\" The type of people Hornby, Cusack, his co-writers(D.V. DeVincentis and Steve Pink, who also co-wrote GROSSE POINT BLANK, and Scott Rosenberg), and director Stephen Frears are portraying is a very particular type of \"music geek\"; the type who is a snob about music.  Almost all of us, I would say, are aggressive about our likes and dislikes when it comes to music, but not many, I agree, compare liking Marvin Gaye and Art Garfunkel to \"agreeing with both the Israelis and the Palestinians.\"  And probably not many of us would be so cut off from feelings that, when hearing about a person's death, would find no better way of expressing their sorrow than listing their top 5 songs about death.  Yet we do like these people as characters because we see even if they have some snotty attitudes, they do have a genuine love for their music, and they're in a low-paying job because they love what they do. And who among us hasn't turned to music when we've felt sad(or happy), like Rob does, or wished that Bruce Springsteen(and a pox on the person who, in their comments, implied he was passe.  Bruce will NEVER be passe) would talk to us directly like he talks to us through his music?  The novel and the movie captures all of that.<br><br>Another strength, of course, is Cusack's performance.  Woody Allen once said that while American actors were very good at playing virile men of action, there weren't many who could play more \"normal,\" regular people.  Cusack, on the other hand, has carved out a niche for himself playing regular guys.  He doesn't look like The Boy Next Door, and he's neither stereotypically sensitive or hip, but comes across as a guy who feels both at ease and yet still longs for something more.  At his best, like in movies such as THE SURE THING, SAY ANYTHING, THE GRIFTERS, BULLETS OVER BROADWAY, GROSSE POINT BLANK, and this, he plays people on the cusp of growing up, who are able to if they want to, but aren't sure if they want to, and yet he's made each of them different.  Rob's condition may be a little more conventional - he's not sure if he wants to settle down yet - but Cusack, while unafraid to show his unlikable qualities, makes us like Rob anyway.<br><br>The rest of the cast is also quite good.  The well-known names only get short takes(Lisa Bonet, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones), but they make the most of their time.  I've never seen Iben Hjejle before(I haven't seen MIFUNE), but she does well as the most grown-up person in the movie.  But the real stars, besides Cusack and the music, are Jack Black and Todd Louiso as Rob's co-workers.  Black especially reminds me of people I knew.<br><br>As I said, I do have some quibbles.  There are a couple of incidents in the book which don't make it to the film which I would have liked to see(the Sid James Experience, and the lady who wanted to sell Rob a ton of valuable records for a ridiculously low price).  I'm getting tired of movies which use rain as an expression of sorrow, and this is an example of overuse.  And the character of Laura isn't developed as well in the movie as she was in the novel.  Nevertheless, this is well worth checking out.","user":"SKG-2","rank":[84,100]},{"title":"One of the best of all comedies but also a very poignant study of male life","rating":8,"date":"13 December 2004","review":"Having read the very good Nick Hornby novel of the same name I looked forward to \"High Fidelity\" quite a bit, but I never expected it to be as good as it is. This is easily one of the best comedies of all time for its laughs alone - but what separates it from other comedies (particularly new-age ones) is that it's a very poignant multi-layered tale that focuses, primarily, on males - and why we are as we are. Love, life, relationships, music, movies, hobbies, jobs, ticks, ups, downs - everything is here.<br><br>It's to John Cusack's credit that he took a \"classic\" contemporary novel set in London and transposed it to Chicago - and it works just as well (if not better) than the British version. It shows what a universal story this actually is, if so many people from all over the world can appreciate it, no matter where it is set. What we lose here are the abbreviations such as \"mate,\" \"cos\" and other British expressions - but essentially the story is exactly the same, as is the character of Rob Gordon.<br><br>Cusack proves his worth here and there isn't a single bad performance in this film, except perhaps for the love interest who tries to sport an American accent and it's quite uneven at times.<br><br>Jack Black is fantastically funny and reveals once again why he's leagues ahead of other obese comedians like Chris Farley who merely relied on OTT acts and weight for laughs - Black, like John Candy, actually acts and so far in his career has turned out some really good films which is more than can be said for many of his competitors.<br><br>The script has some very funny one-liners and movie/music in-jokes (I love the \"Evil Dead\" bit - \"Because it's so funny, and violent, it's got a kick-a$$ soundtrack...and it's so violent!\").<br><br>But at the end of the day what really haunted me (so to speak) about this movie long after I had seen it was the fact that it DOES stay with you ages after the credits have stopped rolling. It's poignant and really spot-on in many regards - add that to a film full of flawless performances and great direction and clever ideas and one-liners and jokes, and you've got a top-notch comedic masterpiece that places \"High Fidelity\" in the top ranks of American (and British!) comedy - \"with,\" as the DVD back cover says, \"a bullet.\" Highly recommended. 5/5","user":"MovieAddict2016","rank":[132,167]},{"title":"Now this is what I would call a musical","rating":9,"date":"9 October 2005","review":"It was about time someone put together a film with a genuine appreciation for the love/music connection that didn't end up being something along the lines of \"Singles\". For music lovers who tend to put a soundtrack to everything they experience, this film is a blessing. I am one of those people, so I understand that if you're not, you'll get less from the movie. All I'm trying to say is that this is one of those films that demand you to root for the characters and the events if you want to enjoy it. The deeper the affection you feel for them, the more you'll enjoy the movie.<br><br>Personally, I think John Cusack's character is one of the most engaging in the comedy genre of the last decade. This is the kind of character I like: simple and complex at the same time, just like in real life. Somebody likable but annoying at times. Again, I feel a deep personal connection with him, and I understand him every time, even when he acts stupid.<br><br>But he is not alone. The rest of the cast is terrific.<br><br>Anyway, don't forget this is a comedy. You will laugh your ass off with some situations and dialogue. Hilarity comes from many different sources: you've got black humor, silly humor, complex (people would say \"intelligent\", but I despise the term) humor... Special mention goes to Tim Robbins paying a visit to the record store. Genius.<br><br>On a very personal level, I think there's a magnificent scene that sums up the heart and the brains of this movie. John Cusack talks to the camera (something that happens often) instructing the audience on how to make a perfect music compilation for your loved one. If you like that concept, the movie will grab you and won't let you go. If that idea doesn't sound seductive to you, you might just have a good time. If you are a rock music devotee, this flick is heaven.<br><br>RATING: 9.0","user":"Patuquitos","rank":[60,75]}]
