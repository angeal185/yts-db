[{"title":"One Big Yawn Fest","rating":1,"date":"5 September 2019","review":"This is one of those found footage movies filmed with one camera that's on \"night vision\" 50% of the time. Unlike other similar movies, nothing happens in this one, I mean NOTHING! It is so incredibly long and boring...I felt like turning it off several times but hoping something interesting would soon happen, I went all the way to the ending, where I got really angry at the waste of my time. Don't waste your time. It's awful.","user":"ferdmalenfant","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Crappy movie","rating":2,"date":"8 September 2019","review":"I agree with the previous review. This movie has a plot that makes no sense, weird \"interviews\" and overall a crappy script. One of the worst \"found fotage\" movies I've seen i a while. Give it a miss, it's not ever worth watching on a sunday hangover.","user":"mr-akita","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Wildy ambitious and triumphant.","rating":9,"date":"9 April 2020","review":"People are reviewing this as if it were a big budget Hollywood production. Take it for what it is, make some allowances for the fact that it was made on a shoe-string budget by a young, independent filmmaker.<br><br>Yes, the acting is often stiff. Yes, it does often have an amateur feel. But the director clearly has a lot of talent and manages to weave a gripping web of supernatural/occult mystery. (Not to mention plenty of pretty freaky/scary moments.)<br><br>This is one of the most unique found footage/mockumentary films I've ever seen! From the get go, I was sucked into the story and there was never a dull moment.<br><br>I was incredibly impressed and I'm hoping to see more (possibly even a sequel) from this director. In my opinion, this is an instant classic and breathes new life into a genre filled with a lack of originality.","user":"j-nickturner","rank":[0,0]}]
