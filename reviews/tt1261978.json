[{"title":"Insulting","rating":2,"date":"13 November 2009","review":"As a fan of the first two 'Wrong Turn' films, I was expecting this to be a good but not great film with enough gore/horror/comedy to keep me entertained for 90 minutes. How wrong I was. The plot consists of this; four college kids are out rafting in the Bluefish River area, however their fun is abruptly ended when they are attacked by the mutant cannibal hillbilly Three Finger (Borislav Iliev). Only the teenager Alex (Janet Montgomery) succeeds in escaping running through the woods. Meanwhile, a group of dangerous criminals are transported from the West Virginia Grafton Penitentiary in a custody bus escorted by three security guards through the backwoods. Predictably the bus is attacked by Three Finger, causing the bus to crash in the woods and the struggle for power and survival begins. <br><br>Initially, I thought the plot was fairly well thought out and had the potential to work quite well. However, it doesn't work and these are the reasons why; the terrible casting, the laughable special effects and the dire script. I understand that this was a low budget horror movie but it could have been done so much better. The casting of British actors in American parts didn't help the film either with most of the casts accents slipping constantly, Tamer Hassan is particularly bad in his role and often reveals his strong London accent.<br><br>The special effects are beyond cheap and they look like something from the 70s or 80s. But undoubtedly the worst element of this movie is the script which could have been written by a couple of teenagers, the guards and cops have clich√©d dialogue and the other actors have such a poor script to work with you almost begin to feel sorry for them.<br><br>Overall this movie is very poor and most importantly not scary in the slightest. In the end I found it a little insulting to the 'Wrong Turn' franchise.<br><br>I give it 2/10 and I think that may be slightly generous.","user":"re-123","rank":[48,66]},{"title":"Aptly Titled Mess","rating":4,"date":"19 October 2009","review":"I loved the original WRONG TURN and thought the sequel WRONG TURN 2:DEAD END was even better. However, WRONG TURN 3: LEFT FOR DEAD is not very good at all.<br><br>*Characters that you think are going to be vital (Three Toe, the Latino cop pretending to be a convict, the female deputy) are literally discarded a scene or two after they're introduced.<br><br>*There's only one cannibal killer (Three Finger) in the whole movie AND he seems to have suddenly developed the ability to teleport around the (strangely bright!) night-time woods at will.<br><br>*Two survivors go completely against their established characters for a gratuitously mean and grim-ended coda.<br><br>*The acting is pretty bad. Several British actors play American characters, and drop their accents in the middle of scenes Janet Montgomery plays basically the same character she played in the (far superior) HILLS RUN RED- her character exists solely to scream, cry, look like Selma Hayek and be placed in peril to get rescued by the hero.<br><br>The gore is far too reliant on CGI- the amateurish, obvious computer effects completely ruin the kills; it's also painfully obvious that characters \"driving\" are being subject to some woeful rear-projection CGI as well.<br><br>Poor writing, poor execution (and poor executions!) and woeful, overly digital gore. The sole high point in the film is Tom Frederic, who is the only good actor in the picture and manages to turn in a good, likable performance with a convincing accent.<br><br>If there is a WRONG TURN 4, I suggest bringing back Joe Lynch. At least he knows what he's doing...","user":"wirrrn","rank":[22,28]},{"title":"Now I know why it went straight to DVD","rating":2,"date":"15 October 2009","review":"I am huge fan of Wrong turn series, wrong turn 1 and 2 were pure original gore until this crappy sequel showed<br><br>Wrong turn 3, I wasn't even aware of this film until preview teaser came out, and not for cinema, for DVD. I wondered why would such film go straight to DVD. So I watched this film, and it was the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. When I watched the preview I knew it was going to be bad anyway so I guess I was expecting it.<br><br>Actors, scenes, settings, effects were all so terribly made. I found no actors useful, maybe the girl and the police but they weren't so good either. And the prisoners, they made me laugh, especially the scene where the prisoner and the hillbilly fights, that scene frustrated me and I wanted to smash my TV go in to the movie and kill the hillbilly myself. What's up with the voice of that prisoner, I could barely understand him and he came to the point where I found really annoying.<br><br>The effects were so horrible that it was standard \"home-made adobe effect\". An amateur could make this effects using After effects. Such as when the guy gets slashed by the trap in the beginning scene, and he slices off, the effects were totally CGI. It's only real when they cut the camera shot and suddenly it's all real. The movie Cube had a better slicing scene in the intro and it is very old, well older than this<br><br>What I really want to point out is, do not buy this or rent this, it is waste of valuable money. I'd rather spend it on a charity. When you walk into the video store and see this movie on the shelf, say to yourself, \"o look it's another crappy movie made by idiots\". If you want to watch this, download it, like I did, it's only worth downloading.","user":"jameszxcvbn","rank":[64,95]}]
