[{"title":"Potential wasted by stupid plot mistakes","rating":13,"date":"13 March 2019","review":"I love these kind of heist films so I am willing to forgive quite a lot. But some illogical moves done by supposedly professionals just mess up the whole experience. From not using silencers (and the guy had a whole workshop set up exactly for this reason of preparing arms), to greedly destroying walls and no one covering them. Then all of a sudden the main guy gets super greedy and they completely ignore the time for extraction. Not to mention they keep talking and waiting and messing around. Also why the heck did they lower the windows as they drove past the family car so they can see their faces. Or why not tell the boat guy to meet them a few miles down the coast (after scaling the freakin Andes they couldnt carry the money a few more miles to avoid the teenage army?).\nIts just one inconsistency after another that keeps bringing you out of being immersed in the story. I do not understand why they dont give the script to a few military guys for a read through. The ego of whoever wrote this must have been probabily too grand.\nIts unfortunate because the foundations of the story were quite solid.","user":"sumtim3s00n","rank":[909,1]},{"title":"Entertaining but many Holes and Voids","rating":8,"date":"14 March 2019","review":"Overall it was an entertaining movie. Should have been some more back story on the team. The movie needed another shootout with the real cartel instead of a car chase with incompetent kids. There were no cut scenes to show how the cartel reacted to their boss's murder, or money theft. Or what happened to the lady and her brother if they made it to Australia.<br><br>Biggest hole to me.... hey this is too much weight for the helicopter to get over the Andes. Look there is a jungle. Let's drop two guys off here, and half the money. I'll fly over mountain drop off the other half and two guys. Then I will fly back and retrieve the other half and two guys and regroup.","user":"rcroman2004","rank":[550,635]},{"title":"Great start, then becomes unrealistic","rating":5,"date":"13 March 2019","review":"Great start, good acting, good music location etc. But then they all become super greedy, nobody covers when they get the money from the walls, they fly with way too much weight, etc.\nI always think a movie is really bad when you think the whole time \"what the f, that's just dumb\". This is one of those movies.","user":"jonas-wachner","rank":[397,493]}]
