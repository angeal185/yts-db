[{"title":"Remember Carrie Fisher This Way","rating":10,"date":"27 December 2016","review":"I saw this last month at the AFI. Funny, witty, charming, sad, tragic...all of this...now even more sad and tragic with Carrie's passing today. I am so glad I saw this while she was still living. It was filmed over a year ago, but it was so moving and touching. My heart goes out to Debbie, we all thought she'd pass before her daughter. You made a difference Carrie and you left a legacy of your own behind. This documentary is about a mother and daughter, a famous mother and daughter at that. They went through so many hard times, yet there were wonderful times as well. Both are legends in their own right. Two legends in the same family.","user":"heyjay40","rank":[40,42]},{"title":"The Best Kind of Legacy - Honest","rating":10,"date":"19 January 2017","review":"Often documentary films on famous Hollywood 'stars' end up being too polished and show only the sanitized versions of the subject or go the other way and end up being a extended tabloid view - raw and endlessly depressing. <br><br>This was a beautifully balanced and intimate portrayal of the love, friendship and intertwined lives of two people living in one compound but coming from two very different generations - Carrie with her hilarious observational honesty about herself and her experiences and Debbie, with her permanent smile and old Hollywood, studio drilled mantra of 'never let the facade fail'. Yet these two are bonded by their experiences and their true love and respect for each other and the battles they've each endured throughout their lifetimes.<br><br>Seen in light of recent events with the sudden death of Carrie Fisher and then her mother just a day later I now understood why Debbie could not stay on earth without her daughter (&amp; I'm sure the same should the roles have been reversed) they lived for each other, worried about each other and took care of each other. All the bitterness and anger that I'm sure once existed had long since faded away and all that was left was a lifetime of memories and love, great love.","user":"LilyWai","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"A fine documentary about the camaraderie between the two","rating":9,"date":"8 January 2017","review":"When Carrie Fisher passed away unexpectedly late last year, at that time knowing nothing about the health of her mother, Debbie Reynolds, only her age - 84 - I thought to myself, this kind of a shock could do a person in at that age. And the next day it did.<br><br>This documentary shows these two as much more than just mother and daughter, but fast friends. It is a great tribute to both ladies. It talks a little bit about Debbie's past problems - being abandoned by her husband with two small children, then marrying a guy she thought would bring her family some stability and security, but it didn't - he in fact bankrupted them with his compulsive gambling. And she faced all of this with dignity and was a fighter.<br><br>Debbie doesn't do that much talking for or about herself. In fact through most of the documentary it is mentioned how she is feeling just awful, but you'd never guess it. She is always dressed to the nines and smiling - something Carrie said she learned as a recruit in the old studio system at MGM. And then, feeling awful, Debbie books a Las Vegas show and brings her children into the act because she simply can't do the whole show. She just couldn't retire outright because she loved entertaining and loved the audiences.<br><br>Carrie does most of the talking. Like mom, she is a fighter, and also has quite a sense of humor. She fought her way back from a childhood in which she was abandoned by her dad, Eddie Fisher, in every way possible. It's like he just left them behind like they were part of a past life - until Carrie had some success and he came back asking for money. She fought her way back from drug addiction and her failed marriage to Paul Simon, who was much older than she, and during the documentary she is quite open about her battle with her weight as she tries to get the pounds off with the help of a trainer in preparation for the Star Wars film, \"Episode 7\". The trainer keeps trying to take her sodas away from her - which she keeps replenishing.<br><br>Carrie has a visit from old childhood chum Griffin Dunne, and they easily talk about their youth. After all of the awful stuff you have just learned about her dad, Eddie Fisher, and his parental negligence, Carrie goes to visit him, and he does look like death warmed over at this point, and Carrie tells him that she loves him and she seems to really mean it. It is revealed during the documentary that Eddie Fisher was a drug addict too, and I think having that common experience with her dad has made it easier for her to forgive him. What a classy lady. Eddie Fisher passed away in 2010, so obviously this part of the documentary was shot much earlier.<br><br>Todd, Carrie's younger brother, is in the documentary too, but he doesn't have much to say.<br><br>The documentary is not in \"this is your life\" style. It is more just following Debbie and Carrie around and showing the deep relationship and love they had for one another. Dance on in the afterlife classy ladies, you'll both be terribly missed. I miss you already.<br><br>Obviously, highly recommended.","user":"AlsExGal","rank":[21,24]}]
