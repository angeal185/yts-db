[{"title":"A great story we've seen before, copied and made boring.","rating":1,"date":"30 November 2019","review":"Plagiarized shamelessly from the book, \"The Midwich Cuckoos\", John Wyndham 1957, adapted into two movies, \"Village of the Damned\", 1960, and 1995 (both excellent, I thought!)<br><br>None of the kids in this movie can act, but that actually might fall on the shoulders of the director and writers.","user":"rsvp321","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"We don't like bullies","rating":4,"date":"12 December 2019","review":"Following the tragic death of a teacher, Tony Middleton (James Groom) is hired as a teacher at the Henry West Grammar School. Er quickly learn there is a Kabal of students who exert mind control over others. Sarah is the ringleader as we discover the children are being drugged and trained as Alphas as Tony teaches \"Brave New World.\"<br><br>Sarah just wasn't creepy enough for me, maybe it was the missing front teeth. The film seemed to drag. Characters were lame.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[1,3]},{"title":"Didn't expect this...","rating":9,"date":"7 January 2020","review":"Odd choice of title- it doesn't have anything to do with Village of the Damned. But suspect this has more to do with low budget distribution than it does the film makers.<br><br>This film is a lot of fun! Solid opening, great score and an assembly scene jam-packed with extras- I was surprised!<br><br>As the situation develops we see some great characters emerge. Particularly the two lead actors and the teacher of the creepy children.","user":"WelshSergioLeoneFan","rank":[1,4]}]
