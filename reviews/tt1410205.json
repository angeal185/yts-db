[{"title":"Looks like a Sci-Fi channel original movie","rating":3,"date":"29 July 2009","review":"I can't say I got too far into this movie. If you've ever seen a Sci-Fi original movie, that should give you some idea of what you're in for.<br><br>The CGI dinosaurs are laughable; they all look like cartoon cut-outs, which is unforgivable considering the current state of CGI technology. The characters are clich√©. The blood looks like raspberry jam. This wreaks of a low-budget production all around, and worse, it wreaks of low effort. The acting was better than the film's other aspects, but could not possibly hope to redeem it.<br><br>I don't like writing bad reviews when I feel a genuine effort has been made, and/or that there was care for the material, but this feels entirely derivative (even keeping in mind that it's a remake) and hastily slapped together, like a cheap TV movie to fill an empty time slot.<br><br>Just to be clear, no, this isn't a fun B movie that's aware of itself. It seems to want you to take it seriously, as ridiculous as that request may seem to the viewer. I give it 3 stars to offer the benefit of the doubt, as I was too bored to watch very much of it.","user":"equazcion","rank":[33,38]},{"title":"Sweet Jesus this was bad","rating":1,"date":"1 August 2009","review":"This movie fails on almost every possible level:<br><br>Bad acting: check. <br><br>Poor direction: check. <br><br>Hackneyed script: check.<br><br>Painfully bad CG: check. <br><br>Odd pacing: check. <br><br>Timothy Bottoms looking embarrassed and wondering when he can go home and start drinking: check.<br><br>Run screaming, tripping and flailing away from this sad attempt at a movie.","user":"ChimpyMatlock","rank":[35,44]},{"title":"Ouch!","rating":3,"date":"2 August 2009","review":"I really wanted to like this -I've enjoyed this story since I was a child, and was looking forward to a more modern telling of it. Sadly, the acting was so forced, so deplorable, that it was actually painful to sit through this. Perhaps the movie actually improved toward the end -I'll never know. I wasn't able to handle watching this sad excuse for shovelware of a movie. I didn't go into this expecting a special-effects extravaganza. I just expected competent acting. I mean REALLY, when they insist on remaking movies, shouldn't they actually try to improve the performances? Sigh. I couldn't give it anything less than a 3 because the story itself is a timeless classic -the writing didn't fail here, the acting did. Not really worth the time. Thats about all I can really say.","user":"nightbiker-1","rank":[21,25]}]
