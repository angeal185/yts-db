[{"title":"What Separates It","rating":1,"date":"3 June 2018","review":"Watching this film feels like as if something was missing. It had all the potential of an adult film, minus the sex.<br><br>This film has a story which is full of cliches. Here a good girl full of potential fell in love with a bad boy. And that is it, there is nothing more to the story.<br><br>The acting was so bad that it felt like watching an adult film but without the good bits. The camera work was quite sloppy, locations selection was terrible and the supporting characters was a complete joke.<br><br>Watching this film will be a huge mistake.<br><br>Not Recommended.","user":"niaz_islam","rank":[2,5]}]
