[{"title":"Elevator Kiss 10 Stars","rating":8,"date":"8 November 2018","review":"What a great elevator scene. One of the best ever. And one of the most believable proposals... you rule dude ! WOW","user":"debejere","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"bland remake of a 2011 Christmas movie","rating":4,"date":"9 December 2017","review":"The earlier Christmas Kiss had successful theme, plot, Christmastime philosophy, casting and generally worked. This remake follows the plot but not the theme as the rich are not focused and realistic while the ordinary folk are not enticing in their fictitious characters. This film is primarily for those seeking more and more choices of seasonal movies on the Christmas theme but in no way one of the better ones other and Elisabeth Roehm shining in both in a secondary not the heroine role.","user":"Dunham16","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"No magic like the original.","rating":4,"date":"27 December 2014","review":"Meh. I am not a fan of the cheesy, predictable TV Christmas movies but the original however, was well-made, had a rich look production wise and was more than adequately acted. Its' predictability was easily forgiven because the journey to the inevitable end was so charming. This one barely makes it to acceptable. The acting by most is not good. Some is quite bad like the tarty girlfriend and Dad while others do well, ahem - Jonathon Bennett (Sebastian) and Elisabeth Rohm. The boss lady was alright, too. The love interest man (Cooper) carries a dopey smile throughout the whole film and isn't nearly slick enough to be a worldly, charming Lothario. The make-up level for the actors was also set to soap opera level. Overall, it's one to skip.","user":"asmithee23","rank":[6,9]}]
