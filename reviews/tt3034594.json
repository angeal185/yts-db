[{"title":"Excellent, excellent, excellent!","rating":10,"date":"25 July 2017","review":"This was such a good movie! Can't understand the other reviews. Good for all kids who use cell phones. Telling untruths can DESTROY someone's life, and even make them consider something horrible to stop the pain. Dove family films gave it five stars. Acting is really good, and believable. I checked this out through interlibrary loan, and am considering purchasing it. This is a feel good afterward movie! Please make your own decision about this film, and don't listen to the negative reviews.","user":"gramma_elaine","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Cute, slow, and a little bit unexpected collagemovie","rating":8,"date":"15 March 2015","review":"I always liked collegemovies. There is something about that contained world, telling a story within that \"set\" that is enjoyable, watchable, communicatable.<br><br>This one is a bit unexpected as far as collegemovies go. The stereotypes break their own molds a little bit, which is unusual. But they do not break them so much that they lose the value of being stereotypes. It is a gentle play with stereotypes, letting them be stereotypes but sort of bringing forth the humanity from the stereotypes. <br><br>The message of the movie is also very sweet and humane and especially important for us that live in this day and age of political correctness.<br><br>I really did enjoy this movie.","user":"martin-andersson22","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"After-School Special on Cyber-Bullying","rating":1,"date":"6 December 2014","review":"I have no idea how this film even received 5 stars out of ten. The website I watched this film from showed that IMDb rated it at 8 stars. I was shocked. Anything with Jamie Kennedy carrying anything above a 4 or 5 star review was certainly worth my time. So I watched it. I waited and waited for something about the movie to cause me to agree that it deserved the 8 star IMDb rating it had claimed to achieve. In fact, at the film's mid-point, I might have given it a 5 star review, but the ending was ridiculous. The film floated the notion that absolutely ANYTHING posted on YouTube will go viral in matter of minutes. As well the film perpetuated the myth that everyone is gullible and believes everything they read onlineâ€” refusing to understand, let alone believe that fictitious Facebook pages can be created to defame a person. And how easily the tide turned against the lies and bullying once everyone discovered \"the error of their ways\". If that wasn't bad enough, the only two distinguishable actors, Natasha Henstridge and Jamie Kennedy close this unbelievable After-School Special on Cyber-Bullying, with the most forced and unnatural looking lip-lock it has ever been my discomfort to see. My lord, what a bad film. If there is a hell, it would be forced viewing (eye-lids peeled back and held with clips) of this sort of stuff for an eternity.","user":"tim-arnold777","rank":[17,30]}]
