[{"title":"Nice movie to have a break out of ordinary life.","rating":7,"date":"18 January 2006","review":"This is a typical \"just fun to watch\" movie. Nothing for hardcore movie freaks, more but i find it rather well done. Not to much clichés, some gags are very good and some nice lines of text... The action is also in balance and sometimes rather funny. The 2 Bandidas are of course quit sexy and nice looking, but especially Penélope Cruz (Maria) performs well and has that very groovy \"archtype\" Spanish look that makes you wonder where to hide if she ever get's mad at you. The story and characters are not so well developed, but that's hardly a problem for this type of movie. So if you are looking for a fun movie to relax with and have a good time with your girl/boy/pet and you like some humor and action, check it out. But don't expect a \"cinematic masterpiece\".","user":"gunther-vermeir","rank":[110,147]},{"title":"Harmless Fun!!!","rating":7,"date":"19 February 2006","review":"Bandidas is a conventional, predictable cinematic product and yet, it manages to be a laughing out loud experience and a great time at the movie theater.<br><br>The story of the two opposite mexicanas played by Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz kicks off when both meet personal tragedy and seek for revenge (first, for themselves and them for the whole people of Mexico).<br><br>Hayek and Cruz are great to watch as the film highlights their comedian and physical talents quite well.<br><br>Technical work on the film is also top notch and Steve Zahn/Sam Shepard's supporting roles bring both masculinity and humor to this laugh-fest.<br><br>Overall, this movie will not win any Oscars but it will definitely win the heart of the audiences.","user":"mechanicalanimal","rank":[81,109]},{"title":"Just a funny movie","rating":9,"date":"19 September 2017","review":"Some people rate movies as if all movies were made to win the best picture of the year. Apparently they don't think movies can be made just to be fun and entertaining. This is one of those movies. OK, there are goofs. OK the plot is pretty simple. But there are tons of great sight gags, fun special effects, great dialog, and a couple of \"supper smart\" horses that make this a really fun shows. I always like to read the reviews by people who \"hated\" the movie and rated it 1 or 2. Sad they can't just watch sit back and enjoy movies like other people. Bandidas is just a funny movie. If you haven't seen it, watch it.","user":"redwhiteandblue1776","rank":[6,6]}]
