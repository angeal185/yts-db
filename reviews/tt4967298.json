[{"title":"An excellent account of one of Ufology's biggest embarrassments","rating":10,"date":"16 November 2017","review":"Cosmic Whistleblowers is an excellent documentary concerning Simon Sharman's encounters with several high profile UFO researchers. His objective is to try and discover the truth about the alleged UFO crash at Roswell in 1947, but this becomes a fascinating entanglement with the announcement, by aforementioned researchers, that they have photographic proof of an alien body recovered from Roswell and their subsequent unveiling to the world. These are what became known as the infamous Roswell slides, one of the biggest embarrassments in Ufological history. Sharman's film is a tightly made and riveting watch as he finds that even the most famous and respected of investigators can be guilty of the most monumental cock-ups with, perhaps, not the best interests of the subject at heart. Thoroughly recommended.","user":"pilsky","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Interesting.
