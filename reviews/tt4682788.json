[{"title":"If you watched Narcos, don't bother...","rating":6,"date":"22 May 2018","review":"On it's own this may be a decent movie. But if you watched Narcos before this movie, it only seems like a hasty summary of the series, told from the viewpoint of one of the less interesting characters. This, combined with the fact that it should have been in Spanish, and the annoying voice over, makes it a pain to watch. One upside: Javier Bardem is actually good as Pablo!","user":"nvansilfhout","rank":[109,124]},{"title":"A different point of view.","rating":7,"date":"27 August 2018","review":"If you have watched Narcos, this film is going to be like a brief summary for you. The plot is based on the book \"Loving Pablo, hating Escobar\" written by Virginia Vallejo. According to her point of view, she gives her version of Escobar's story and his crimes. Bardem and Cruz give an extraordinary performance in this film, Bardem looks like the real Pablo. For this reason, I agree with the other users who are saying that the film would have been better in Spanish (like Narcos). Apart from that, I recommend this film if you are interested in Escobar's story.","user":"Kratistos_94","rank":[24,25]},{"title":"That film should be in Spanish","rating":18,"date":"18 February 2018","review":"Why anyone (the director?) made Spanish actors speak bad English in a story which is supposed to take place in a Spanish speaking country with Spanish speaking characters is a mysterious to me. It makes the otherwise well intended film unnatural and completely unbelievable, in my mind it turns the film into a B-movie, frankly unbearable to watch. What a waste of good actors! In an age when even HBO has understood that subtitles are indispensable when you want to make your story to be authentic and credible, I think that decision is the worst flaw of the film.","user":"bruitsarthur","rank":[166,197]}]
