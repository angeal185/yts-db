[{"title":"Beyond obscure and inane and awesome","rating":7,"date":"29 October 2018","review":"Say what you will about Claudio Fragrasso. From the films he co-wrote with his Rossella Drudi for Bruno Mattei, like Robowar, Zombi 3, Rats: Night of Terror and Shocking Dark to the films he's either co-directed or directed, such as Scalps, Troll 2 and Beyond Darkness, he's created films that you can see as inept and strange films created by someone who has no understanding of how human beings think, act or speak. Or you can see it my way - they are works of pure genius, the fruits of a demented mind that doesn't need to be grounded by such concerns as budget, traditional storytelling or common sense.<br><br>Fragasso saw this as a tense psychological thriller with little to no gore and the original cut of the film resembled his vision. However, the producers wanted more violence, so they brought in Bruno Mattei to add the gore. Those very same producers also retitled the film Non Aprite Quella Porta 3 (Don't Open the Door 3) so that it would appear to be another film in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series (yep, this is getting into La Casa/Demons territory).<br><br>Within the first eight minutes of this movie, we've seen nudity, aerobics dancing on stage while a director has a near meltdown of amateur acting proportions, the killer disembowered two women and the director falling off a balcony to her death, all set to some of the most chipper synth turns you've ever heard. Buckle up - this movie gets even weirder from here.<br><br>This movie is utterly confounding. This is why traditional movies end up boring me, because they make too much sense. If you're looking for narrative jumps that leap into orbit, if you're seeking out the unhinged, if you have ever wanted to watch a movie that goes from Elm Street to giallo to pre-Seven box related ending five years before that film was released and if you watched Troll 2 and said, \"But what if the same people made a movie that makes even less sense?\", please consider this a strong recommendation.","user":"BandSAboutMovies","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Obscure - but not in a good way..","rating":3,"date":"17 July 2019","review":"This Giallo Slasher from Italy is rather unknown, even for fans of the genre. The plot is simple with a lot of scenes that make no sense at all. Leading actress Tara Buckman is best known for her small part in the classic \"Silent Night Deadly Night\" and she also starred in the awful \"Xtro II: The Second Encounter\". The rest of the cast in unknown but not bad. That cannot be said when it comes to the dialogue which is painfully bad and laughable.<br><br>There is some nudity and there is a scene in the beginning where Buckman goes topless for no reason at all. The scene makes no sense and it that same scene her sweater is miraculously on and off her shoulders during different takes. Talking about some bad editing.. you have to see it to believe it.<br><br>There is no tension or any scares. The gore is limited and fake, apparently is was added later and it shows. The effects are bad, certainly considering that this was made in 1990. the \"Friday the 13th\" films did it so much better a decade earlier. The killer has claws on his hand and it is obvious that they're made of rubber and couldn't even cut through butter. But somehow he's able to slit a woman's throat and ram it right through your body. That last (poor) effect was considered effectively enough by the makers to repeat it again and again..<br><br>For a Giallo (whodunnit) picture, \"Night Killer\" also fails miserably. You can pinpoint the killer from the moment he's introduced. When another (obvious) suspect appears you know not to fall for it.<br><br>I've been watching Horror and particulary Slasher films since the '80's and I had never heard of this one. But now I know why because it's hardly worth your time. For die hard fans of the genre only but don't get your hopes up because \"Night Killer\" has not much to offer.","user":"homecoming8","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Obscure Italian horror","rating":7,"date":"28 February 2015","review":"This obscure Italian horror (my copy has Portuguese subtitles embedded!) has an appalling start with a group of late eighties dancers jerking about to just as appalling music, whilst the slasher style violence and nudity commences. It recovers, however, despite the low budget and average acting and whilst it becomes rather confusing, we never loose interest and in the end the film wins out. Much is mundane and predictable but the central performance is very good and there are impressive scenes including a sexy take on Red Riding Hood and a most enthusiastic, tying to the bed, sequence. As I say from the beginning you will wonder if this is worth sticking with but gladly it is and there are some decent twists along with the occasional hysterics.","user":"christopher-underwood","rank":[8,10]}]
