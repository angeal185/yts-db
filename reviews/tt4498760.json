[{"title":"A mess","rating":1,"date":"2 December 2017","review":"He's a hit-man. He's suppose to be a culinary master, but his kitchen is empty. He's suppose to be Latino, but he doesn't speak Spanish. Terribly written and with a fake 70's style that is grating and laughable.<br><br>Obviously written and directed by someone who doesn't know anything about Latinos. Pathetic.","user":"loritalk4","rank":[11,22]},{"title":"Western meets roller-coaster Crime Drama","rating":9,"date":"12 November 2017","review":"The opening scene of the film sets expectations for savage brutality at any moment. And with that tension Jon Matthews is able to insert cathartic, playful humor to great effect. The score, which channels American Westerns, is a surprisingly perfect fit for this unconventional crime drama set in LA. <br><br>Richard Cabral fills his role so completely and convincingly that it came as no surprise to learn that Cabral has roots in gang culture. The only thing not believable is that his character doesn't speak much Spanish, because he has the pronunciation of a native speaker. But his powers of sensibility and fearlessness create so much emotional authenticity that it's often easy to forget you're watching a work of fiction. A strong supporting cast and unexpectedly subtle cinematography results in some stunning storytelling for a highly relevant story.","user":"machucao","rank":[7,16]},{"title":"Almost As Funny As 'Meet the Mobsters'","rating":8,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"I'm not sure if this film glorifies homicide or just shows what life can be like as a repentant murder. Whatever the case, I became quickly empathetic toward the hit-man Khali even though I'm introduced to him while he's killing four or five Cholos who have first been tied up and gagged. There's loads of humor in this film, which keeps it buoyant and from being a real downer like so many gang films these days. Watch this one only if you like movies about L.A. or gangs, maybe. I lived just south of Melrose at Vine and Willoughby back in the late 80s. Not sure what it's like now, but back then it was a war zone.","user":"beorhhouse","rank":[2,3]}]
