[{"title":"Not a good dog or Christmas movie","rating":3,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"Unlike recent dog movies this one isn't saved by cute dogs. The story of two single parents bonding is tedious and boring. She has to work and the spoilt kid can't understand how a single parent puts food on the table. The leads are okay to look at though there isn't much romance.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Family bonding film","rating":2,"date":"29 November 2019","review":"My family had fun hating on this awful film one evening, and we're diehard corgi lovers.","user":"mattroberson-04963","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Not Good","rating":1,"date":"9 December 2019","review":"This is not a good Christmas movie or a good dog movie. The scenes are awkward, boring and slow. The dog scenes are especially poorly done. The acting is not great but that could be due to the terrible script including some especially bad dialogue, even by dog-Christmas-movie standards. Hard pass.","user":"gregberne11","rank":[2,3]}]
