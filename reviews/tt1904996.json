[{"title":"This films is excellent good job..","rating":8,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"Statham plays a Professional criminal with morals that....wrll, he plays his normal role and you get the idea. despite having the usual roles he always does a decent job at the movies and they manage to entertain each time. Statham and Lopez are both good in this and without them I don't think it would of been as good. decent little action flick.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[38,39]},{"title":"Statham Doing What He Does Best - Kick Ass","rating":7,"date":"5 February 2013","review":"Many people say the same things about Jason Statham, He's a typecast or he doesn't do anything different. Which is partly true, but he is good as an action star and in my opinion hes a better actor than what some say. I don't think he does get enough credit seeing how he got into movies almost by accident. <br><br>Anyways Parker has a good revenge/crime story its about a professional thief who lives by a simple code, don't steal from people who can't afford it and don't hurt people who don't deserve it. After a successful heist our man is left for dead by his partners. The movie has good action throughout. lots of hand to hand combat, and violent ones at that. It also has a better than usual cast and director for a statham action movie (Good villains + hot leading lady). <br><br>Overall, I got what I was expecting for $10 as a fan of Jason Statham and would recommend it for a good popcorn flick.<br><br>7/10","user":"ActionFan-Reviews","rank":[74,98]},{"title":"Crime thriller which keeps its schizophrenia under control","rating":7,"date":"15 March 2013","review":"Robber with morals Parker (Jason Statham), shot and left for dead, wants only to recover his share and teach people how to behave properly. Having tracked those who owe him money down to Palm Beach, he poses as a Texan businessman in order to get a real estate agent to help him identify the property they may be using as a base. He may not have reckoned with the real estate agent having her own agenda, and the crew who owe him money having high powered connections... <br><br>This crime caper movie starts off firing on all cylinders. It opens as a robbery gets under way and then stays in full action mode for the best part of an hour. Then Parker arrives in Palm Beach, encounters Jennifer Lopez's hard-up real estate agent, and something really weird happens. You can feel that, at this point, the film badly wants to become a comedy. It never does - it remains a violent, hard boiled crime thriller throughout, but there is always this strong urge for it to be something lighter and frothier whenever Lopez is around.<br><br>For all that, I enjoyed it especially given that it didn't always do what I expected it to. It was, as always, a mistake to get Statham to do accents - as well as a generic American accent, he is saddled with having to have a go at a Texan accent, and accordingly he wanders around all over the place - US tough guy, Texas, and (mostly) London, sometimes all in the same sentence. The action sequences are well staged (Statham exhibits powers of recovery on a par with Wolverine's healing factor), with one especially satisfying moment during a fight which produced an audible, \"Oof!\" from the cinema audience. Good fun, if a little odd in places.","user":"neil-476","rank":[31,41]}]
