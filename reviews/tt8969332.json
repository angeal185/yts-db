[{"title":"Amazing!!!","rating":10,"date":"15 November 2018","review":"I had the privilege to see this great documentary at the Napa Valley Film festival 2018. It had me tearing up with emotion throughout the whole movie. 8 years of hard work &amp; love. See this on a big screen if possible because the animal and nature scenes are beautiful &amp; unbelievable. Actually the whole story is amazing. Loved it!","user":"bphammond","rank":[44,54]},{"title":"Great story, well constructed narrative and stunning cinematography.","rating":10,"date":"19 January 2019","review":"Saw this at the Palm Springs Film Festival and it stood out as one of the best docs I've seen. Lot's of good life lessons for all, delivered with imagery that's hard to imagine you could capture.

This film is a potent tool to address the ecological crisis in our time from the angle of possibility, accessible and whimsical for children and deeply moving for adults.<br><br>John and Molly got a dog...who got them evicted from their LA apartment...but who also launched them into the pursuit of a dream bigger than themselves to build a farm that truly lived in harmony and equilibrium. It becomes a place where the land is healthy, and the animals live in ways connected to their most true way of being. The humans involved are transformed as well through submitting to the rhythms of the land and the hard but satisfying work of nurturing earth into its health, finding their own health and life in the process.<br><br>The film, with stunning cinematography of nature as a feast for the eyes, takes the viewer on a rollercoaster ride with the tickles in one's stomach at the sight of newly formed buds opening or piglets being born and then plunges into the tragedy of loss inherent in the cycle of life. But the commitment to live in harmony, avoiding violence even at the hands of seeming predators, teaches these new farmers and the viewers that even what seems lurking in the night might be a friend trying to make its way in a hostile world, looking for a place to call home.<br><br>In the Jewish and Christian traditions, shalom connotes an sense of utter peace, of wholeness and completeness where all are living in harmony, tranquility and mutual welfare. This is the invitation found in this film, a gaze at a vision of wholeness of which the soul deeply longs especially in a world torn by war, destruction and violence. Instead of painting the grim picture of ecological destruction, the film rather invites into hope and a way forward that lifts the heart in its beauty. Might the earth be our teacher on what it might mean to live in harmony with one another and with itself?","user":"klmcg707","rank":[24,32]}]
