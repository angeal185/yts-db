[{"title":"Bore Dream","rating":1,"date":"21 April 2017","review":"Even in your dream you cannot imagine how boring this film is. Everything about the movie is dull and listless.<br><br>Casting was just horrible, actors and actresses hardly knew what is acting, not only they failed to deliver proper expression but also did not grasp the tone of the scene, as a result they were unable to put any emotions in their dialogues. <br><br>The script was the worst, it was full of clich√©s. Screenplay was not good either. Comedy scenes were pathetic, their effort to make the viewer laugh was so sad that I felt bad. <br><br>Don't waste your precious time watching this film.<br><br>NOT RECOMMENDED.","user":"niaz_islam","rank":[5,8]}]
