[{"title":"horrible acting and filmed with either an old cell phone or a potato.","rating":1,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"I was tricked into watching this because the good reviews on imdb. I'm not even sure why I didn't just turn it off..I guess I figured nothing could be this bad. I doubt there was a budget at all, just some people thrown together and filmed with a phone. My question is how did this get a 7.5 rating. There are very good movies that have good actors that only get a 5-6 rating.","user":"raynick","rank":[41,56]},{"title":"DIE!","rating":2,"date":"13 June 2019","review":"The film opens with a group of clowns who live at a motel near a gold mine. Some rednecks set the place on fire and the goldmine doesn't enter the story again. Years later, a group of young adults stays there, get stranded, and become fodder for killer klowns from inner space.<br><br>The premise isn't bad, but the acting and dialogue were a joke. They created characters and didn't know what to do with them. Joseph Kelly cannot write or direct.<br><br>Guide: F-word. Sex. Ugly butt crack nudity","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[24,32]},{"title":"zero entertainment value","rating":1,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"The worse movie experience of my life. absolutely nothing positive to say about it. feels like it was made on one of those old super 8 movie projectors.","user":"stehartley","rank":[23,31]}]
