[{"title":"\"The Stepfather\" on a farm. In England. With less tension.","rating":6,"date":"3 October 2011","review":"For all those Terry O'Quinn junkies, who fondly remember The Stepfather, there's another clone of that venerable \"family in peril\" thriller. Again, a messed-up guy with a dark past suddenly ingratiates himself into the lives of a struggling family. Appearing too good to be true, the eldest daughter remains skeptical, not trusting him or his motives, despite the rest of the family's wholehearted acceptance. It plays out exactly the same as The Stepfather, though with somewhat less tension. It's not much of a spoiler to say that bodies start piling up rather quickly.<br><br>It's not a bad movie, but it's a complete rehash. I chose to be a bit generous with my rating, since I thought the film was fairly well done, even if the story is a complete and utter ripoff of a cult classic. It's an inoffensive way to pass the time, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who've never seen The Stepfather -- to them, the plot will probably seem fresh and exciting. I'd recommend that they check out the original 1987 classic, though. Terry O'Quinn was amazing.","user":"krachtm","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"This is what it is","rating":14,"date":"14 November 2011","review":"This is a solid little indi film about a family who are terrorised by a nutter out in the countryside. That is pretty much it.<br><br>The acting, camera work and set is very good considering the tight budget. There isn't much substance to the movie and the plot gets a bit frayed (it seems bodies pile up unnoticed in the countryside quite easily) but it is tense in places and although annoying you do engage with the central characters.<br><br>The film is not terrifying there is no gratuitous gore or nudity -must admit we were a little disappointed on that point as Kierston Wareing oozes sex appeal.<br><br>Don't expect too much from this and you won't get let down. I enjoyed it but I wouldn't recommend selling the farm to watch it.","user":"thekarmicnomad","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"\"The Stepfather\" in the Countryside of England","rating":6,"date":"24 September 2011","review":"In the countryside of England, the lonely farmer Nancy (Kierston Wareing) raises her daughters Hanna (Skye Lourie) and Amy (Maisie Lloyd) with financial difficulties in her farm with her only employee Cooper (David Bradley) since her husband has disappeared a long time ago. Her neighbor Karsten (Terry Stone) and his son intend to buy her farm and is pressing the family in an abusive way. <br><br>Out of the blue, the wanderer Aden (Vincent Regan) appears in the farm and helps Nancy with the delivery of the offspring. Aden explains that he was a friend of her husband Dean in an offshore rig and he offers to work for food and lodging. Nancy accepts the offer and sooner she has a love affair with Aden. But either Nancy or Aden have dark secrets and Nancy finds that Aden is actually a psychopath and her family is in danger.<br><br>\"The Holding\" is a rip-off of \"The Stepfather\" that takes place in the countryside of England. The plot is predictable and uses the clich√©s of the genre, but the acting is good and raises tension with the dangerous situation. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Passado Obscuro\" (\"Obscure Past\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[28,38]}]
