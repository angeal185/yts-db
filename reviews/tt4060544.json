[{"title":"Cringy","rating":4,"date":"30 June 2019","review":"Oh, I didn't watch the trailer to be surprised! And I was really surprised! It was a typical, usual plot, and it made me cringe in some scenes. The dance steps are not catchy either. But overall, it was a good film if you have watched it in DVD/Blu-ray.","user":"benjch_1130","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Sooo unexpected","rating":1,"date":"11 July 2019","review":"The moment that I heard of Step Up I rushed to the cinema without even watching the trailer and I was really surprised that the movie wasn't as I expected it was really really disappointing and it was really boring at some points. I wouldn't recommend it at all","user":"rawanadawi-07099","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"21 July 2019","review":"The worst movie of this serie.
