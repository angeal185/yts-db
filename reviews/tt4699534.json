Straight away in love with the entire cast. Tenemos que hablar is a beautiful film which is genuinely funny, natural and true in regards with life and relationships. A film you can see multiple times and never be tired of it.","user":"bikaever","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Unlikeable Characters in Tedious Situations","rating":4,"date":"10 September 2016","review":"Like most romantic comedies these days this film was neither romantic nor a comedy. The entire premise should insult the intelligence of any adult: Fatuous idiot Nuria has to talk with her estranged husband (Jorge) about finally getting a divorce after two years so that she can marry her new boyfriend but she doesn't want to hurt her ex's feelings, especially after he has an accident so she goes through a huge process of having a dinner with her parents—who her ex misses since he split with Nuria and doesn't know that the parents have also split. Does that sound tired and stupid enough as a plot? It gets worse.<br><br>Ugh, comedy should have jokes and not just a string of uncomfortable (and stupid) situations. Falling out of a window definitely isn't funny at allunless he would have died. That would have been hilarious because that is just the way humor works. How about bad jokes about auto-erotica asphyxiation? Actually, they weren't really jokes they just talked about the subject as if that in itself is humor so they could set up a later scene that was just completely stupid and predictable.<br><br>I think that this movie started out on the wrong foot by imitating the worst of Hollywood in depicting such a bourgeois group of upper 1% people and money-obsessed cretins (her mother left her father because he was swindled out of all of their money through no fault of his own—what a freaking hag!). She buys a 500 jamón, champagne, and caviar to impress upon her ex-husband that her folks are doing fine since Jorge ruined them financially. She was going to return it all after the dinner uneaten and then the big joke is that the mother doesn't play along and they dig into it—a long way to go for nothing in the way of humor.<br><br>All of the absurd situations the characters find themselves mixed up in were just painful to watchand not a bit funny.","user":"leftbanker-1","rank":[3,10]}]
