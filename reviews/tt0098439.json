[{"title":"I'd pay Cash to see this Tango","rating":7,"date":"2 December 2005","review":"Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone are the reason why this run-of-the-mill action flick actually works. There's nothing innovative or special about the film, it's nothing we haven't seen before (maybe just Russell in drag) but the film is entertaining as hell thanks to it's two stars.<br><br>Stallone is Tango and Russell is Cash, two cops who get set up and sent to jail. They break out and go after the bad guys to clear their names.<br><br>The film has got some excellent action scenes, particularly inside the prison and during the break out. It's got some nice eye candy courtesy of one Teri Hatcher. The script also delivers some very funny lines now and then. Couple that with the fact that I actually do like Stallone do comedy and Russell has always been somewhat of a mini favourite; Tango and Cash is very worthy of my time every once in a while.<br><br>Downsides; Excellent actor Jack Palance is horrible in the clich√© ridden bad guy role (I can't figure out if he's trying too hard or not at all) and the film has a really silly final 10 minutes where the action goes from cool to basically slapstick. Still, early 90's action fans should enjoy this flick.","user":"ODDBear","rank":[69,79]},{"title":"not real in the least...but still fun","rating":7,"date":"17 March 2002","review":"A lot of the reviews for this film use the word \"fun\", which is code for \"unreal\", \"ridiculous\", \"silly\".  That pretty much sums up this umpteenth foray into the cop/buddy flick.  The slight difference is the two guys aren't partners, but city rivals.  But, as usual, they detest each other, battle a big bad guy, and have a sexy girl caught between them.  One of the zillion unreal elements begins with these two guys constantly grabbing headlines in LA.  Now, I've lived near LA all my life.  Not once has there ever been an officer who was a superstar/celebrity type of superior abilities.  And, as we usually see in movies, these guys are non-uniformed, fancy car driving studs.  Anyway, off to the plot.  The two guys are hated by an aged, wealthy drug runner (Palance).  For reasons only known to him, he doesn't want the two simply capped in the head and out of the way.  I assume he wants to physically and mentally torture them, so he orchestrates a, yet once more unreal, frame-up that lands the two in jail.  There's even an obligatory \"You're goin' down for this\" from a fellow officer at the scene of the crime.  Then, on the inside, ALL the guards are corrupt, which allows prisoners to roam the grounds at will, the powerful drug guy to pay visits, Russell and Stallone to be tortured in a boiler room, etc.  Each guy has a friend on his side, Russell the warden, Stallone his captain.  Now it's odd that the captain, who knows Stallone is innocent, fails to share this with other authoroties.  Even the address of a henchman that he's obtained.  After a prison break, there's the big bad finale where the two take on armies of machine gun blasting toadies of Palance's.  Then a dopey final gunshot that puts an exclamation point on the list of unreal moments. Now, with all that said, why did I still like this?  The dynamite script. Feldman provides a ton of one-liners and comic moments, which aided the implausibility of the proceedings.  Not to mention some nicely shot moments of action.  So, for a good \"turn off your brain\" adventure where you'll be asked to go easy on quality, give this a shot.","user":"mcfly-31","rank":[34,38]},{"title":"Lovely piece of kitsch from the 80's","rating":7,"date":"4 June 2005","review":"Back in the 80's, kitsch cinema had two main sections - gory horror movies and daft action films, of which this film obviously fits into the latter. While the gory horror movies of the eighties often lacked credibility, that section of kitsch movies beats the daft action films because of the much higher content of inventiveness; but more often than not, the daft action movies make for good entertainment, even if they're somewhat less than brilliant. Tango and Cash is a notable action movie because it stars two of the eighties most popular action stars - Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, whose antagonistic partnership makes up the core of this movie. The plot device to get the maverick cops to work together is hardly important, but nevertheless it follows the two as a corrupt state buys into a plot by a criminal kingpin to land them both in jail, which promptly sees our hero's in with the masses of criminals they themselves have sent to the clink. As you can imagine, they're not the most well liked of inmates. Especially not by 'Maniac Cop' himself, Robert Z'Dar...<br><br>The action in the movie comes thick and fast and this, when combined with the one-liner packed script make the movie feel more like a parody than a serious take on the genre. This is all good, however, as this movie is pure entertainment, and seeing two of the 80's hottest action stars fire off silly dialogue at one another is a treat to say the least. The action is over the top, and we get to watch our hero's do such things as slide down electrical cables and drive a souped up SUV around an explosion packed warehouse, and it makes for great entertainment. Of course, what the movie packs in action and snappy dialogue, it lacks in other areas such as credibility and depth; but nobody tunes into a kitschy 80's action movie for plot depth and sophistication, so blaming the movie for not offering these things is ridiculous. On the whole, if you're after a good two hours of solid action fare, you could certainly do a lot worse than Tango and Cash. This movie packs a lot of punch, delivered by two strong leading men.
