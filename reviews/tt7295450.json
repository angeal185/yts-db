[{"title":"Ghosts of Direct to Video Horror","rating":1,"date":"11 December 2018","review":"It's truly an incoherent mess with a haunted Lolita theme going on. Cage proves he's willing to take on a role in any video as long as he gets to be the lead and show off his bizarre facial expressions and suffering emotions. If you're into seeing a scruffy hobo Nick running around the house in tight underwear, and behaving like a sexually frustrated redneck trucker, high on crack and bourbon, then this is the movie for you. It's a surreal experience.","user":"pete1-2","rank":[91,106]},{"title":"5 minutes in and I was hooked by how awful it was.","rating":1,"date":"8 April 2019","review":"Was it awful on purpose or by accident? It was like watching a car wreck - mesmerized by how bad it was.

He hits the man and rescues the woman, but she explains that her daughter Billie (Penelope Mitchell) is in coma and she needs to die since her spirit needs to save Billie. They head to the hospital, Joe helps Julie and Billie is saved. But soon they realize that BillieÂ´s body was possessed by the spirit of Mary and they do not know how to fix the situation.<br><br>\"Between Worlds\" is a lame film with terrible and messy melodrama, awful acting of Nicolas Cage and unnecessary long sex scenes. This overrated movie has many fake reviews to promote the flick, many of them with one or two lines, and is a waste of time. The manipulated IMDb is no longer a reference to movie lovers. My vote is four.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[63,79]}]
