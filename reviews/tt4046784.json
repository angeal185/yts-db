[{"title":"How to make an entire book fandom hate you","rating":3,"date":"11 September 2015","review":"I am so unbelievably unhappy with this movie! The writer of the script has completely dissed the original most exciting plot from the books to some stupid ridiculous mainstream apocalyptic story.<br><br>None of this happens in the book. None of it makes sense. It's called \"The Scorch Trials\" as in trials from wickd. Not some stupid escape adventure! I was so excited for this movie and I'm going to be honest, I left the cinema fuming with anger. If you're going to create a movie based on a book, actually go by the book plot. Don't make you're own and expect everyone to be happy with it. I'm sure the writer of the movies just ticked off an entire fandom.","user":"maddisonfield","rank":[341,453]},{"title":"Original Story Line Butchered so Badly the Film Lost it's Cohesion","rating":1,"date":"26 September 2015","review":"It is as if the concern of the producers and story writers were so focused on the movie's DBOX worthiness that they forgot to include the story line.<br><br>I went to this movie with two friends that have not read the books, as I have. Both walked out of the movie confused...\"Where did the virus come from?\" was the first question that they asked. <br><br>The beginning of the movie should have included the reason why W.I.C.K.E.D. created the Maze, explained what the Flare is, and introduced both groups of Maze runners. Instead, the audience is lost in visual effects without knowing why the action is happening. To add insult to injury, the writers turn the virus infected people into inhuman, biologically altered zombies. The immune are now a commodity for a short term fix to the virus problem. So much has been lost by these adaptations that the result is a vague and confusing zombie flick. I almost walked out.<br><br>This was a wonderful book that should have been an incredible movie.","user":"femmegirl-97666","rank":[149,196]},{"title":"Just one word","rating":4,"date":"3 January 2016","review":"First movie was interesting but this one is;<br><br>Cliché..!!<br><br>Same apocalyptic disease scenario, same walking dead scenes, classic action scenes and all clichés are in this movie.
