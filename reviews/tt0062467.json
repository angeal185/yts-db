[{"title":"Menace surrounding Hepburn in the dark","rating":8,"date":"20 September 2008","review":"To be blind, deprived of the power even to see the danger that threatens you, is a frightening experience... It also, obviously, gave director Terence Young the opportunity to carry out one of the most important rules of suspense: let the audience discover more than the principal character...<br><br>When we can see imminent danger which the victim, by definition, cannot see, the emotional impact is increased on the viewer... We desire earnestly to cry out in warning, but we cannot... We can only sit helplessly, and wait to see what become apparent... And when the sightless is a young and lovely woman, there are many twists and turns, disturbing moments, claustrophobic atmosphere, great suspense...<br><br>Most of the drama is played out in Hepburn's apartment in NewYork, and there is an outstanding development when Susy Hendrix (Hepburn), alone with her telephone cord cut and awaiting the return of the gangs, decides to use her disadvantage as a defensive weapon... Her one advantage in being blind was that she required no lightand she methodically destroyed all the light-bulbs...<br><br>After three brutal murders, only the master-criminal, a merciless villain (Alan Arkin) is left to confront her He selected the most terrifying way of terrorizing her... Susy lost her sight in a car crash or really the fire from the crash <br><br>Audrey Hepburn earned her 5th and final Academy Award nomination for her brilliant performance","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[32,35]},{"title":"Leaping Loungerooms!","rating":8,"date":"22 February 2004","review":"Never in my life have I ever seen 800 people fly off their seas like I did the night I saw WAIT UNTIL DARK at the cinema in 1970. And I was up there with them. Moaning away in shock. Screaming! (and I don't scream) ............In the run up to the final 20 mins the cinema management slammed the foyer doors, switched off all the aisle lights one by one all around the cinema, and turned up the volume; ripples of creepiness washed over the audience....and then....whammo! The noise from the audience, the screaming and the shifting about in our seats.....I haven't heard shocked noises like that in a cinema since. Do yourself a BIG favour...........get the DVD and watch this at home, by yourself, in total darkness! You will scream your head off and tell everyone you know what a great thriller this is.","user":"ptb-8","rank":[58,77]},{"title":"Great thriller, great acting, great music, great directing.","rating":10,"date":"7 July 2000","review":"My title sums it all. I was very surprised at how good this film was. I found it very similar to a movie like \"Rear Window\". One other person's comments was titled \"The best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never made\". It think that is very true. Most of the film is shot within this basement apartment unit. And the thriller is so great because of Hepburn being blind and these three bad guys freely walking into her unit and introducing themselves as her husband's friends, or police, or some neighbour. But they all forget one thing: She uses her ears like no regular person does, she doesn't need eyes. But that is where the thriller kicks in. Sometimes it is pretty painful for us to watch (us who can see) because she seems so vulnerable. Wrapping around of all this is Henry Mancini's music. He is using a technique that he also used in the film \"Night Visitor\" where there is this melody on the keyboard and after everynote there is the detuned note following it. Pretty cool effect. One thing I didn't get though, There is a scene where the room looks pretty dark and Alan Arkin still has his sun glasses on. I loved this film, 10 out of 10.","user":"Semih","rank":[75,105]}]
