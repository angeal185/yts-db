[{"title":"Acting Workshop","rating":4,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"Watching this movie is like being inserted into the middle of a psychiatric ward 1 hour after meds have been handed out!\nTransparent effort at trying to create bon homie among a disparate group of oddballs in small town America.\nEach character was given a 300 square foot stage to perform whatever character they wanted for 90 mins. You could tell they were \"acting\" as nowhere in this world would anybody ever come across this group of mentally unstable people.\nEach actor tried way too hard at being effortless in their craziness, too much going on.\nThis type of movie has been done before with much more grace and real humanity.","user":"jimmyjoe583","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"southern quirk","rating":5,"date":"2 October 2019","review":"Walt Prior (Andrew J. West) returns to his home town after his father's death. He gets a job at the antiques store where his father used to work. It's filled with a cast of quirky southern characters including the beautiful Ellie (Ashley Greene). He goes see therapist Dr. Margot (Mary Steenburgen).<br><br>At seven minutes in, Dolores flashes her titties at Walt and it's obvious that this movie is filled with wacky southern characters... except for Walt. Even the parrot has to be wacky while Walt is one of the blandest character by comparison. It doesn't help that West has no big screen personality. The juxtaposition is tiresome although the arrogant Japanese cook and stripper are hilarious. The writing is funnier in some doses. In larger doses, the script is trying too hard. Also the plot needs a point. Walt needs a goal. Without one, the movie meanders. I guess Ellie becomes the goal. The car crash is the central point. The movie needs to start with the car crash. It needs to make that more central. Instead, this is basically a troupe of improvisers doing wacky things with a shocking unprepared reveal in the third act. This is missing the intro. Even crashing two cars in the intro would be so helpful in this movie.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"very boring","rating":5,"date":"31 January 2019","review":"In think it was one of the most boring films I've seen in the past 2 years.\nA guy goes in a boring town to see how was his father living when he was alive.\nSo he decides to do what his father did.\nSo since it was a small town where no one had no future and the jobs limited, he went to work in a shop/mall where his father used to work.\nDialogues are boring, the main character is the most boring.\nA film about how people end up being losers because they chose to remain in a city where nothing ever happens.\nA film about common losers who decide to stay instead of changing something in their lives.","user":"aglooka","rank":[11,25]}]
