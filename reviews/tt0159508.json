[{"title":"Gundam at it's most average","rating":4,"date":"10 May 2007","review":"Well, This is a movie version of the OVA, Gundam 0083 and it hasn't been released outside of Japan and for good reason.<br><br>The problem is that this movie pretty much cuts out the Earth part after Gato steals the gundam unit 2, Burning doesn't die but sort of disappears, and important plot points get removed so the movie can be 2 hours long. Other than that there is really no substitute for watching the 0083 OVA episodes as they cover more important information, you get to know the characters even more, and it's only 13 episodes long which is 6 hours but they are 6 hours well worth it as opposed to the 2 hours of this movie.<br><br>Watch at your own discretion.","user":"Shanqio","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Excellent!","rating":10,"date":"2 July 2002","review":"In UC 0083,three years after the One Year Year(Orignal Gundam) Zeon ace pilot Anavel Gato steals a prototype nuclear equiped Gundam from a secret Federation testing facility of the behalf of a Zeon remant force known as the Delaz Fleet.Test Piolt Kou Iraki tries to stop him in another prototpye gundam but fails.Kou and the Gundam are then assigned to the Federation Assault Carrier Albion which is despatched to retrive the gundam and stop the Delaz Fleet's plans.This series is very good in that like the orginal,captures the ambigoious, unglamorous attitude towards both sides of the conflict.In many ways this could be called \"The Principility strike back\" because it is extactly that.The mecha designs are lovingly done and animation too is top notch.The only flaw? The characters are incredibly weak.Other wise a great series ****1/2/*****","user":"dbarakat101","rank":[1,2]}]
