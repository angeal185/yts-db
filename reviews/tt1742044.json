[{"title":"If you Love Music...you will Love Jersey Boys","rating":22,"date":"22 June 2014","review":"My wife and I were extremely and pleasantly surprised. I've never been into musicals...ever...my favorite up to this point was \"The Sound of Music,\" which inspired me to get into the film industry in the first place, yet, we found ourselves seat dancing and bopping in our seats. We really enjoyed the interpersonal approach of having the characters each expressing their takes and their understanding of each situation, which brought a lot of comedic character moments to the storyline and subplots. <br><br>But the the thing that impressed us the most, was the decision to make the film NOT feel like a musical. No-one busted out in song at the wrong time...and the singing moments felt completely unforced. It was like watching a living biographical film. Great Directing job by Clint Eastwood.<br><br>Lastly, we didn't realize how many great hits Frankie Valli &amp; the Four Seasons had. We thoroughly loved this movie....and can't wait to buy the soundtrack.<br><br>The theater was pack...and it was the biggest theater in the Tampa Bay area.","user":"JimmyAFitz","rank":[97,119]},{"title":"Our Eyes Adored it....our hearts ached for more","rating":10,"date":"22 June 2014","review":"Great movie...great music...great actors...what more could you ask for. I knew Eastwood began his life as a musician, but I didn't think he would do such a great job with a pseudo-musical. Great job Mr. Eastwood! <br><br>I've never seen the musical, but I gotta tell you, if you love 60's, 70's &amp; 80's Frankie Valli songs, your eyes too will adore this movie... and your ears... and your heart... and the entire rest of your body.<br><br>It was heartbreaking at times...and I got chills several times while finding out how they came-up with some of their songs...like the death of his daughter. But, it was also very insightful into the lives of kids with dreams and how committed one has to be to make it in the music industry.<br><br>If I could give this movie a higher score I would. Our theater was packed-full and everyone clapped afterwards like we were watching a living bio-pic. I even saw a few people with tears in their eyes from being so deeply affected by the beautiful music and memories in this movie....so many great memories...that the songs take you back to.","user":"CrazyCoconuts","rank":[101,125]},{"title":"Blew me away!","rating":10,"date":"11 June 2014","review":"So here's the thing: Saw Jersey Boys tonight. Now I've never been interested in the stage version (I think musicals should have original music) and I didn't really trust in Clint Eastwood directing a musical; in short - I was ready to hate it (I've been called snob and pretentious more than a few times). But let me tell you, I was dead wrong.<br><br>It was AWESOME!!! The actors are stellar, the music is fantastic and the film completely engrossing. I had a big goofy smile plastered across my face from beginning to end. The audience clapped twice during the movie (it was that good). It would not be hyperbolic of me to say that this WILL get Oscar nominations. <br><br>I will be seeing this movie again and again when it comes out June 20th. Do yourself a favour and do the same.","user":"HoneyBunny_181","rank":[136,175]}]
