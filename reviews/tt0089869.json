[{"title":"Hope over Hell","rating":26,"date":"26 July 2004","review":"This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Instead of being yet another it's-the-end-of-the-world-so-let's-kill-everyone-left movie it beautifully illustrates human hope, self-realization and sacrifice.<br><br>We begin with Zac in his depressed, selfish self. On day one, we get a taste of how Zac must have treated the world when people were in it. Now that the people are gone a happier Zac moves through the Kubler-Ross stages, to the audience's amusement. Eventually he meets another person, a woman - Joanne. Joanne is the embodiment of nurturing, femininity and compromise, herself having been alone as long as Zac. <br><br>Once they find each other, Joanne and Zac form an alliance that quickly becomes romantic, quirky and easy. Then the third player arrives, Api, who seems far better prepared for living after the world has gone empty.<br><br>Two men and one woman - from the moment they all meet it's strained with only Joanne bridging the distance. Jealousy and suspicion begin, there are poignant examples of human frailty and attempts to reach out to each other, except with Zac. Zac knows something that neither Joanne or Api could possibly know and eventually, he has to tell them. <br><br>The tension of the living situation builds and hits an apex when Zac finally tells the truth, the horrifying secret that is not only the answer to how the people vanished, but to what is about to happen. The ending, Zac's decision to change who he was, to love Joanne and Api enough to put himself aside turns weirdly mystical in the final scenes. <br><br>Overall, the story is an allegory of what we do to ourselves, how we can overcome our tendencies for base, selfish behavior and learn to love. It's one movie I walked away from thinking about so much more then when I began it.","user":"thorn-19","rank":[56,61]},{"title":"Still walks through my my memory after all these years","rating":20,"date":"20 March 2003","review":"I'm another person who saw this movie in a small art theater on Balboa Island, CA, in 1985. \"Quiet Earth\" was so haunting that, while channel surfing 15 years later, I saw just a flash of the image of Zac awakening and recognized the film instantly.  I settled in to watch the film again--even knowing the ending--and its impact was still incredible.<br><br>Maybe it's not for serious sci-fi fans but definitely for people who like movies with apocalyptic themes, such as \"A Boy and His Dog\".","user":"andersox","rank":[16,16]},{"title":"Engaging","rating":7,"date":"30 July 2001","review":"An engaging sci-fi drama about a man who awakens to find himself, seemingly, the last person alive on earth. What does he do? What would you do? Everything's free. You could drive what you want. Wear what you want. Live in the fanciest hotel or simply pick a house to move in to. No laws to obey except those imposed by reality.<br><br>But might it not get lonely? And what if you did find someone else?<br><br>\nI plucked this movie off the rental rack on a whim, not expecting much really, but I was pleasantly surprised. By no means was it a 'great' movie, but I think virtually anyone would find it interesting--certainly more so than the claptrap currently being churned out by Hollywood.","user":"BlackMonk","rank":[99,113]}]
