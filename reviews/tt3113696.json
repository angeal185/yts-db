[{"title":"I enjoyed it.","rating":8,"date":"2 March 2017","review":"It wasn't perfect, by any means, and Dolph Lundgren carries this film, but, I was kept entertained. It was almost like ASH VS EVIL DEAD meets I COME IN PEACE.<br><br>Sure, it was a little rough around the edges having a demon with extremely limited vocabulary but able to communicate physically which got a little tiresome, but Dolph's struggle to catch it jumping from person-to-person added a comedic effect. <br><br>Also, the small town ambiance made up for lack of a big budget, sort of like, THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN or THE ZODIAC KILLER. And, it didn't take itself too seriously either.","user":"Delrvich","rank":[32,45]},{"title":"Bloody fun!","rating":7,"date":"1 March 2017","review":"As a horror genre fan...I really liked this film. The plot is hard to swallow and the acting by Dolph Lundgren was almost robotic but Anyone who enjoys a good splatter fest will like this film. I gave this film a 7 just for the bloody good special effects alone. Dolphs Texas swag left me saying...What in tarnation? But in a good way. I recommend this to fans of the horror/splatter genre.","user":"randibee","rank":[31,45]},{"title":"Bloody fun time","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2017","review":"It been such a long time since i enjoy a good Dolph Lundgren movie that not staring him as a one man army but instead a sleazy demon hunter in this movie Don't Kill It.For a B-movie this is the best example you could get with a horrible script full of plot holes and corny dialogues,a ton of bloody gory action screen enough to satisfied any horror fan out there.Beside all that the rest of the cast also did a fantastic job when they introduce many interesting and wacky characters with the highlight is the on-screen charm of Dolph Lundgren and Kristina Klebe.The movie is not mean to be taken seriously so just go to see it with a open mind","user":"phanthinga","rank":[18,27]}]
