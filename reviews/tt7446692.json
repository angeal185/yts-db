[{"title":"Another skippable no-budget snoozer.","rating":2,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"Like most of the horror today, it's clearly made on cellphones by a 12 year-old whose uncle runs a not-for-profit community theater. There is no notion of cinematography, especially in camera movement or lighting. The music is generic. The acting is cheesy. There are dumb masks.<br><br>Avoid. I don't even know you but I am kindly sparing you a wasted hour-and-a-half of your life. Avoid. this. \"movie\".","user":"Otkon","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"total waste of time","rating":2,"date":"31 August 2019","review":"Watched this before the bad reviews starting coming in and the rating was higher. We kept thinking that something was going to happen to explain what the heck was going on, why is this doll killing people, but it's not! The Arthur doll was ok and sort of creepy. The \"effects\" such as blood were extremely bad, did they just find red paint and pretend it's blood? We were 45 minutes into it and said \"let's stop\" but then saw there wasn't much time left (1/2 hour) and thought we'd soldier through it. Oh well, I've seen worse in the past and will probably see worse in the future, but definitely cannot recommend this to anyone.","user":"jstlucas","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"The stuff being made today now is just horrorBLE.","rating":27,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"Let's face it, horror films with low or high budgets being produced today, are the worst they've ever been. I have not seen one decent horror film in three years. The stuff being made now is just horrorBLE. And after watching the trailer for this film, I can further conclude that it's another film that should be avoided. Gone are the days of good horror movies, nowadays it's nothing but stupidity and bad acting... especially for horror movies.","user":"whitemanfromtowne","rank":[8,10]}]
