[{"title":"Good movie essentially ruined by horrible pacing...","rating":5,"date":"31 July 2019","review":"For some reason, then I actually watched \"Gui mi 2\" before I got around to watching the 2014 \"Gui mi\" (aka \"Girls\") movie. And I must say that the 2014 movie is slightly better than the 2018 sequel.<br><br>The storyline in \"Girls\" is actually pretty good, and writers Skipper Cheng, Barbara Wong Chun-Chun, Silver Hau and Erica Lee were definitely on to something interesting. However, it just got abruptly cut down to mediocrity as the movie was way, way too long and slow paced. There were a lot of great moments and aspects to the storyline, but the pacing of the movie made it feel like you were sitting through a four hour movie. It was just unbearable, and that really dragged the movie down.<br><br>The leading actresses Ivy Yi-Han Chen (playing Xiwen), Zishan Yang (playing Xiaomei) and Fiona Sit (playing Kimmy Han) carry the movie quite well, and they put on good performances. It was just a shame that they had to fight an uphill battle against the prolonged storyline.<br><br>While the movie is listed as a romantic comedy, there really isn't all that much comedy in the movie. Sure, the beginning was loaded with comedy, then it sort of ebbed out and gave way to drama, romance and heartache.<br><br>\"Girls\" was watchable for sure, and it also was entertaining. But it was a difficult movie to sit through given the incredibly slow pacing to the movie. Watchable, yes, but hardly a movie that you will watch more than once, given the fact that it was difficult enough to sit through the first time.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[0,0]}]
