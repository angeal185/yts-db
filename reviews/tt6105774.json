[{"title":"Hilariously bad","rating":1,"date":"25 October 2019","review":"Heavy handed evangelism, confusing leaps in the plot, inhuman characters, hilariously bad acting. Casual violence mixed with gun worship. Honestly no redeeming qualities.","user":"jacobteasdale","rank":[44,69]},{"title":"Ugh, it never ends...","rating":1,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"This movie is just plain boring. The plot makes no sense, the acting is wooden and it just never ends! To be fair, production value is decent. They did not cheap out.<br><br>Note, the person who wrote this movie has the top voted comment here... that should tell you something...","user":"Lost_cow","rank":[50,82]},{"title":"Cringey and horrible direction. Garbage!","rating":1,"date":"30 October 2019","review":"I hated this movie so much. It doesn't even know what it's doing half the time. It's like they didn't care they just wanted a \"Christian 'edgy'\" movie that completely missed the point of what it was trying to say.","user":"samzlind","rank":[31,49]}]
