[{"title":"A MAGNIFICENT, UNDERRATED FILM THAT'S LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER SEEN!!!","rating":10,"date":"17 July 2001","review":"\"sex, lies and videotape\" is a low-key drama that REALLY showcases Stephen Soderbergh's true talents.  The film was made on a modest budget and is mainly dialogue-driven, yet I was deeply fascinated from start to finish. This is another film that sends out a message to all aspiring directors: You don't need a large budget to make a truly great motion picture! Soderbergh hasn't received worldwide fame until recently with the hit \"Traffic.\"  As much as I loved \"Traffic\" I urge everyone--who's curious of Soderbergh's work--go check out this initial effort.  <br><br>The element that impressed me the most was the succint, yet brutally realistic dialogue.  I've never been more impressed with a film's dialogue and actually screamed out, \"Now THAT'S how people talk!\"  The interactions between each character are so intense and down to earth, and gets the audience deeply engaged.  James Spader shines in this career-making performance as a documentary filmmaker who gets his rocks off filming women talking about sex.  We never know why he developed this unusual interest, but that's what's so great.  And the way Spader carries his character is so subtle and powerful.  His character is quiet and mysterious, and he expresses this enigmatic role perfectly with every silence, every facial gesture, every tone of voice.  That's another element that I loved. Soderbergh expresses to his audience that people don't always mean what they say.  And you can tell by every hint of body language.  During these character interplays, you get a feel for what the characters are really thinking with their every subtle nuance.  And that's what creates most of the film's tension.  <br><br>And of course, the film has great depth and treats its subject with the greatest of maturity.  In one scene, Spader interviews this young woman who talks about her first experience with masturbation.  That could've easily been transformed into something gratuitous and heavy-handed.  The subjects of sex and infidelity are treated with a sense of reality, and I'm sure many couples who are involved in relationships where one of the mates are cheating will find the whole situation with Andie McDowell and Peter Gallagher haunting.  Everything is low-key and some might find the rhythm slow-moving, but that's what I liked about it.  It slowly unfolds and takes its time developing the characters and their situations.  Many filmmakers would've taken the subject of infidelity and made it into a melodramatic soap.  But Soderbergh is very patient.  He never once thinks, \"Maybe the audience is not interested anymore,\" and speeds things up.  He goes at his own pace, and works with it consistently.<br><br>I don't know if others will get the same effect I did out of this movie, but appreciate a film that respects its characters and respects its dialogue. Sure, I also appreciate a film with massive entertainment value, but other times I'd rather watch something with depth and realism.  This is one of those films that just has a subtle energy.  Looking at \"sex, lies and videotape\" from the outside, it's hard to explain the power of Soderbergh's masterpiece.  All I say is go see for yourself!  I hope you'll be just as astounded.<br><br>My score:  10 (out of 10)","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[143,180]},{"title":"The same as you learned in Sunday School, only the exemplars are different","rating":25,"date":"25 July 2003","review":"Sex, Lies and Videotape will probably strike the average viewer as irredeemably degenerate, maybe even perverted, since voyeurism is still considered aberrant behavior.  But as far as this film is concerned, that's the appearance, not the reality.  Whereas the drama revolves to a certain extent around the voyeuristic masturbation of an impotent man, the heart and soul of the film is an unrelenting, hard driving psychological siege on the biggest erogenous zone of all:  the brain.  <br><br>This film is about sex.  But it's not about the frothy swapping of fluids and feelings.  It's about honesty, without which one can't have intimacy, which is to sexual stimulation what the water valve is to the hydrant.  From beginning to end, we see this theme brought into focus by the dramatic contrast between two different relationships Â– the one based on lies and deceit, the other based upon honesty.  And guess which one wins out in the long run?  <br><br>In a sense, it's what your mother and Sunday school teacher taught you all along.  But what makes this movie way more interesting than your mother or Sunday school teacher is the level of honesty it suggests is necessary as the basis of a healthy relationship.  Ann (Andy McDowell), for example, an acceptably moral person tells the voyeuristic masturbator `You got a problem.'  He replies by adding that he has a lot of problems.  But, he says, `They belong to me.'  <br><br>Somehow, the openness about one's problems renders their bile and poison ineffective.  `Lilies that fester,' said Shakespeare, `smell far worse than weeds.'","user":"csm23","rank":[59,79]},{"title":"a terrific, slowly unfolding debut with sublime performances","rating":9,"date":"4 July 2004","review":"Steven Soderbergh, as observed by other reviewers and critics, did take inspiration from the kinds of films Eric Rohmer's been making for decades. These kinds of films, as Sex, Lies, and Videotape is at its core, about people in morality crises, and how they get out of them or linger with how they act is the point.  Some people may not like the film, therefore, as nothing incredibly outrageous or spectacular will occur.  For all the attention Soderbergh received (Golden Palm, Independent Spirits, Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, immediate recognition), he's made a small film, and it's not as ambitious as some of his later, greater works like Out of Sight and Traffic.  But as a revealing, intimate character study, with an often clever and controlled mis-en-scene, Soderbergh shows his skills were already honed at twenty-six.<br><br>Without good acting the film would be like a hopeless rendition of a foreign film, but with the four lead performances from McDowell, Gallagher, Gia Como, and Spader (his is most under-stated of the bunch for me) these are as fully realized characters as Soderbergh could get.  They all must've taken something about the characters in the script, because for all the flaws and misconceptions and fears these characters carry, they are human.  Even Gallagher's John, who's the conniving husband and lawyer, is recognizably as he is even when he's comparatively lesser than Graham and Ann.  Only one side character, the barfly played by Steven Brill, gets the film to immediately halt with uncomfortable humor.  But the rest of the film, loaded with innuendo (there's not one shot of nudity, similar to a Rohmer film like Chloe in the Afternoon, where the cover art of the film is rather misleading to those looking for a film with breasts and other parts) and involving drama, doesn't shake its foundations until maybe the last five to ten minutes.  And when it does, it does not make the film a lost cause, at least for me.  Begs to be seen again, though with maybe a year or so between viewings.  A-","user":"Quinoa1984","rank":[43,60]}]
