[{"title":"Could have been so much better","rating":5,"date":"22 August 2018","review":"The premise is intriguing, and you can tell it tried it's darn hardest to be a successful supernatural, suspense drama/thriller, but this film just could not weave together these elements well enough to tell a captivating story. The actors were great, but the writing and character development was lacking. The cinematography and grand setting was beautiful, but was not accompanied by a well written story. The first act had promise, the second was questionable and then the final third just fell flat on its face. By not layering successful elements of supernatural horror in a consistent method, the final act's horror reveal, which should have been thrilling, just look plain weird. I was really looking forward to this movie, but it failed to deliver a decent film despite having all the right ingredients.","user":"liv303","rank":[75,87]},{"title":"The Example of Faltering Acts","rating":4,"date":"25 August 2018","review":"This is all you need to know about this movie:\n<ul><li>First Act shows promise and intrigue, with decent and well-acted characters.</li><li>The Second Act treads upon questionable ground, straddling somewhere between \"Umm, maybe?\" and \"Umm, No.\"</li><li>The Third Act is a complete mess, from start to finish, where the movie tracks off the rails, where the wheels fall off the wagon completely and utterly. </li></ul><br><br>The end leaves you with a firestorm of garbage (literally); a story that was told so poorly; with throwaway characters and plot lines that leave you regretting you stuck around.<br><br>The perfect example of work that starts well and finishes terribly, just as so many movies and novels before it. I simply don't think most people understand how to tell a complete story. Usually because most people have a good idea, and start that idea before finishing it, only to try and make up a slapdash ending before they run out of time or simply become bored with their work. There's obviously more to it than that with movies ... but who cares the cause and reason, this one is just more suffering of the same. Terrible.","user":"matdemon","rank":[53,65]},{"title":"Another Journey into \"Meh\"","rating":5,"date":"20 August 2018","review":"I had high hopes with the one after seeing the preview.\nThe Flitting shadows that disappear had me intrigued.\nBut no, it was not to be.\nThere was a whole lot of movie, but really a whole lot of not much.\nWhen I rate horror movies I usually give a little leeway as there are so many bad horrors out there.\nSlowly but surely though there are so many horror movies entering the realm that are just nothing.\nP.S.
