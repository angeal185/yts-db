[{"title":"Fairly complex thriller for Lifetime","rating":5,"date":"11 September 2018","review":"A slightly overly drawn out mystery keeps things interesting in this thriller for a while. A woman gets engaged to her boyfriend but he gets involved in a shipping scandal that results in murder. Unlike other LMN movies there is a nautical setting here. Finally when the reason for his silence is revealed it's fairly satisfactory. The twist at the end was a bit unexpected. Taylor colemia pretty as a reporter. \nOK but not great.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"**1/2","rating":6,"date":"16 July 2016","review":"After all, the guy was a direct participant in what was going on in dishonesty among a retiring police chief and his anchorwoman daughter, the latter living on a high life style requiring lots of money.<br><br>The nature of the scheme is minutely discussed here, but when anyone comes close to finding out the truth, they are conveniently done away with by the group of nasty people.<br><br>It appeared in the film that the guy serving as the lookout in the scheme wasn't all that bad and that is just plain hogwash.<br><br>The beginning with the discussion of Nazi subs here around 1942 added little to the dimension of the film.","user":"edwagreen","rank":[0,2]}]
