The entire movie is just three planes flying in place in front of still backgrounds while they TALK about facts about planes. Each scene is like ten minutes long, including super long boring stories about such aviation minutiae as how the Germans designed and built fighter planes at the Dutch company Focher then won their first victory over the French on July 1, 1915. That story but with ten more minutes of talking. Possibly the worst thing I've ever seen, and I do not say that lightly.","user":"gregberne11","rank":[0,1]},{"title":"I'm scared","rating":10,"date":"19 July 2019","review":"This movie makes it hurt to live.
