[{"title":"It's Just Plain Funny","rating":10,"date":"22 August 2001","review":"Is it dumb? Well, it's definitely low-brow, but it also has some gags that are undeniably clever. Is it racist? Yeah, a little, but it's also satirizing old stereotypes about \"Dark Africa.\" Is it immature and and gross and sophomoric and over-the-top? Yes. Yes, it is.<br><br>But someone (well, me) once said the only thing comedies have to be is funny. And this movie is dang funny. Need I remind anybody of the scene where Ace insists on dropping a slinky down the hundreds of steps leading up to a Buddhist temple? (\"It was RIGHT there!\") Or the slideshow in which Ace's hand appears to greedily devour a poacher's crotch? That's just hilarious!<br><br>The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't settle for outlandish set-ups that only seem to be jokes. This movie gets full bang for its comedic buck. Do we have a fight with a crocodile presented in-and-of-itself as humor? No! In a lesser film, perhaps. But Ace Ventura goes the extra mile, bringing us childish schoolyard taunts (\"Stop hittin' yourself! Stop hittin yourself!\") And is it enough to have Ace chasing the villain through the jungle in a monster truck? No - he actually pulls up next to him and utters a bon mot worthy of Groucho. Also, where did that monster truck come<br><br>from?! The sheer resolve not to explain the truck's presence is a sublimely satirical dig at movies that might place monster trucks in the jungle just for cheap, lazy wackiness.<br><br>This movie is anything but lazy. Jim Carrey, like no actor before him, pulls out all the stops as Ace Ventura. Is he milking things? Oh sure. He's milking things like Paganini milked the violin, or like Michelangelo milked the Sistine Chapel. He's inventing a manic persona so complete and fully realized, that it transcends standard comedy and achieves something mystical and poetic and truthful. And that's how it keeps from being annoying.<br><br>This film is too casually dismissed because it looks like a terrible movie. I was hesitant to watch it. But maybe, years and years from now, it will achieve the kind of subversive cult-film status it deserves.","user":"rexodus","rank":[77,88]},{"title":"oh my god, you gotta read what I found this movie to be...","rating":10,"date":"5 March 2006","review":"I don't normally respond to these kinds of things, but after reading some of the negative responses I couldn't help myself. There is a movie out there for everyone, something everyone NEEDs to laugh at and who can relate to. This movie is the opidemy of my humor and the extreme way it portrays the upper crust world of stuffy, snobby, self absorbed unrealistic people who think the world revolves around their view and opinions is classic and makes me laugh in a way that is honest for me.<br><br>I read that some people were offended by it and want to get others to share their view. All I gotta say is, \"If you didn't like the first one, why did you go to see the second one? Just to complain?\" Do all of us \"Friends\" of Jim Carey a favor, if you don't like his humor, just go find some stuffy anal retentive \"fluff\" film, and write reviews on them that we will never read since those movies are for stuck-up self absorbed types. Sorry I just didn't think it fair that these people are \"Flameing\" this as if there are no other possibilities.<br><br>Thanx for reading.","user":"SiTH_MaSTeR","rank":[160,210]},{"title":"Great sequel!","rating":10,"date":"26 February 2002","review":"Despite most views of this movie, I thought it was just as good as (and in some aspects better than) the original.  Of course there was a lot  of recycled humor, but there was also a lot of original humor too.  I was a little bummed to find out that Courteney Cox wasn't returning in the second installment, but they did just fine without her.  I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see an Ace Ventura 3 someday.<br><br>I thought the scene where Ace is trapped inside the animatronic rhino was the funniest scene in the movie, but the film is filled with other great scenes too.  I also loved the fact that he is a lover of all animals, except Bats.  I thought that was such a funny idea for the character.  I mean, what does that say about bats if a lover of all animals can't even stand them and finds them revolting.  Just thinking about it makes me laugh.  I just love the irony I guess.  Anyhow, there isn't much more I can say about this film other than if you liked \"Pet Detective\", you should see \"When Nature Calls\". \"Bumble-Bee Tuna\",<br><br>-Chris","user":"LebowskiT1000","rank":[64,83]}]
