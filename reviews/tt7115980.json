[{"title":"Interesting film","rating":7,"date":"14 December 2018","review":"The story starts slowly but once you realize what's actually happening you'll enjoy the characters and plot !<br><br>This is a look into a group of people who are facing that transition in life we all must face one day. The bowling alley was once a thriving community spot but now those days have past. And along with it the employees must face that nothing is forever. We see the results of that thought when the old man is found living in the bowling alley back room.<br><br>It's a good look into common everyday people who won't change until something comes along to force change. Even Jeff realizes he doesn't need his medication!<br><br>A thoughtful story!","user":"cekadah","rank":[22,27]},{"title":"A great indie film!","rating":10,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"A sincere and beautifully crafted film. Joh Heder gives a layered, affecting performance. It's a small personal story that sneaks up on you with emotional oomph. I highly recommend it to lovers of indie film, bowling, or anyone who's ever had to struggle with change in their lives-- so, everyone.","user":"shlatimer","rank":[14,22]},{"title":"Life-Affirming and Heartfelt","rating":9,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"Had the privilege of watching this film in theaters. The story is so well-crafted, that while there are some borderline incredulous moments, it has just the right amount of quirk and emotion to carry itself all the way to the last moment. Beautifully crafted and well-performed, this film ought to be an example for all up-and-coming indie filmmakers. Highly recommend.","user":"latacogitandi","rank":[11,19]}]
