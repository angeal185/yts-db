[{"title":"When it comes to thrillers, I love Korean films.","rating":7,"date":"20 May 2018","review":"Saw this recently on a pirated dvd. The moment I read its a Korean film about a serial killer, I bought the dvd without watching the trailer.\nGod bless the Koreans for making some of the best thrillers.\nThis is a predictable but entertaining film.\nThere r no bloody kills n fast paced action. It's a bit humorous regarding old geezers aka senior citizens.\nThe guy who played the grumpy old landlord acted well. The Alzheimer detective was good too.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[37,37]},{"title":"The Koreans doing what they do best","rating":7,"date":"31 March 2018","review":"THE CHASE is another fine example of the South Korean serial killer genre, with a complex story to keep you on your toes and enough twists and turns to make the outcome totally unguessable. Quality-wise, it's not I SAW THE DEVIL - few films are - but it's still light years ahead of most rival Hollywood fare. There's another weary, unlikely protagonist in the style of THE CHASER's pimp; this one's a belligerent landlord who realises that his tenants are going missing. The trail leads to a spate of brutal murders that took place 30 years previously, sparking fears that a historical serial killer may have resumed his old profession. Like most Korean thrillers, the actors are excellent in their roles and the direction is top notch. There's a good blend of character work, action, bloodshed, and mystery, and it's the kind of film that gets better and better as it goes along, building to a fine edge-of-the-seat climax.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Another great Korean drama/thriller","rating":7,"date":"31 March 2018","review":"Some of the same type of writing and ideas as other Korean thrillers I've seen, no that is not a bad thing. Great acting as well as character development.","user":"cpd874-344-143183","rank":[9,11]}]
