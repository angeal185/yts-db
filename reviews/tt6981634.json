It's not your standard cookie cutter Hollywood crap. I utterly enjoyed the quirky characters and the male lead was very good. I loved it.","user":"writingv","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"A Shy Man's Quirky Adventure","rating":8,"date":"24 April 2018","review":"A light-hearted adventure of a man lost in search of a relaxing weekend. Alex's strange encounters with various off-beat strangers was comical as well as uplifting. The walk with Hope was particularly funny (watch that rock). There were quite a few chuckles along the way to finding Penelope again. The pointy-headed gnome made two appearances as well. Do I have you wondering now?<br><br>I would recommend seeing this movie for anyone who needs a little cheering up. It was a nice getaway with some rather odd happenings. A true delight.<br><br>One thing that was strange, though. Alex took the bus home without ever wondering what happened to his car!","user":"largrizzly","rank":[2,4]}]
