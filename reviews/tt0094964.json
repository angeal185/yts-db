[{"title":"\"No, you're right, he's not alone- but he's lonely. Even with me.\"","rating":10,"date":"4 March 2002","review":"While I like \"The Brood\" quite a bit, Dead Ringers gets my vote as Cronenberg's best work. <br><br>Follow along as the twin brothers spiral out of control when they unsuccessfully try to break free from each other. One's more confident, the other more timid. But they depend on each other, and at middle age neither has the psychological strength to be their own person; they still don't have a sense of self. Among many favorite moments, I love the scene where Elliott, the more confident twin, tries to kiss Claire. It's his way of trying to synchronize himself with his brother Beverly, whom Claire has a true connection with. \"I'm sorry but I can't\", she intones. Elliott turns to the mirror, disturbed. \"Am I really that different from my brother?\". He absolutely does not know who he is. <br><br>Although it's not without some humor, Dead Ringers is very bleak. It has an emotional intensity that most movies can't touch. It is sad AND beautiful.<br><br>The movie itself *looks* great. Good script, and AWESOME performances from both Irons and Bujold. As another reviewer suggested, watch it twice if you don't like it the first time- it might grow on you. <br><br>This is my all-time favorite movie.","user":"latherzap","rank":[80,93]},{"title":"Typically Cronenberg but yet accessible as well; a great script and plot is made all the more compelling by the director and two fantastic performances from Jeremy Irons","rating":19,"date":"19 September 2004","review":"Growing up together as social outcasts with only each other for company, twins Elliot and Beverly Mantle become very close. This closeness becomes more like them both sharing one self in two bodies as they study in the same area and eventually become experts in the field of gynaecology. They share everything and few can tell them apart; an arrangement that works well until Beverly falls for a patient (Claire Niveau) and finds that there are things he doesn't want to share with Elliot. As Bev confronts the idea of them being separate for the first time ever, he starts to fall apart mentally and, when Elliot tries to reach out and help him he too is drawn into confusion over identity and an inability to find where one of them stops and the other starts.<br><br>Being a Cronenberg film I knew to expect body horror and, shall I say, an 'unusual' theme and in many ways the film delivered in spades but in a much more cerebral fashion. The plot is not easy to explain but it is a totally convincing breakdown of both Elliot and Beverly as they lose contact with the lines between them (if the lines ever really existed). Of course it is rather extreme but it is relentlessly interesting in terms of the script and the characters. The gynaecological part of the film allows Cronenberg to explore his more usual body horror stuff but this all came second to the much more interesting material that exists in the script. Cronenberg appears to be as fascinated as me by the characters and he directs with a cold eye, letting the creepy atmosphere come from not only the story but every shot, every set and every performance; not only this but this is one of his more accessible films without losing much of what makes Cronenberg Cronenberg.<br><br>Of course a massive part of the film working is two perfect performances from Jeremy Irons, who I have not seen better in any other films. Using special effects as well as the old 'over the shoulder' technique, Irons is able to convincingly be on screen in two characters at the same time, but it is not the shot framing that makes it convincingly two characters, it is Irons' performance that does that. His Beverly is so feeble and has a convincing breakdown; while his Elliot appears much more together but suffers in a different way from the same struggle. Obviously being identical, it is due to Irons that the two characters come across so very different but yet seem just like the same person. In every little scene he manages to stay in character no matter what  it's hard for me to describe, you need to really see it for yourself. Bujold is good in support early on but, as the twins' story gets more complex, her characters feels a bit intrusive and uninteresting, but generally she is good. However, to talk about anyone beyond this is to suggest there is room for them in the film  there isn't. Instead the film is pretty much dominated by two people  and they are both Jeremy Irons, producing two great performances that were vital for the film to work.<br><br>Overall this may be a little too weird for some viewers but many more will find it to be one of their favourite Cronenberg films on the basis that it has the qualities that makes him him but is also a lot more accessible as well. The body horror is there in the background but it is the psychological scarring and confusion that is of much more interest; the script is great even if the plot goes to the usual Cronenberg excesses but it is two perfect performances by Irons that makes it all come together in a compelling and interesting film.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[77,91]},{"title":"\"Separation Can Be A Terrifying Thing\"","rating":24,"date":"24 January 1999","review":"Identical twin brothers Beverly and Elly Mantle are successful gynaecologists in Toronto.  Their relationship is intense and very close - perhaps too close.  The Mantles experiment with sex, drugs and personal identity, to the detriment of their practice, and ultimately of their psychological health.<br><br>This is a David Cronenberg film, so we are in the familiar realm of horror, mind games and perverted science.  The director/producer/writer appears in the credits above the title and even ahead of his stars, Irons and Bujold. Essentially, the 'dead ringers' of the title are the brothers, who regard their mental and emotional oneness as being something more.  They see themselves as siamese twins, bound by their flesh, and fated to share every experience, even unto death.<br><br>Irons does wonders to play two complex characters in one movie.  A new technique called 'motion control' allows the actor to appear as two people in the same frame, but there is also plenty of the old 'body double' method, filming over a shoulder, then reversing the angle.<br><br>As teenage boys, the Mantle twins are clearly very bright, and display a precocious interest in surgery and women's reproductive apparatus.  They are also creepy geeks.  By the late 1980's they are handsome forty-somethings, and hailed as brilliant gynaecologists by everyone in the medical profession.<br><br>The screen actress Claire Niveau becomes Elliot's patient, and the brothers are soon sharing her.  They frequently swap places without her knowledge.  She has a unique uterus, and as Beverly (or is it Elliot?) explores this feature with his fingers, it is difficult to tell whether he is examining her or masturbating her.  Before long, both brothers are doing both to Claire.<br><br>Elliot is a few minutes older than Beverly, microscopically taller and a nuance darker in colouring, but by nature he and 'baby brother' are utterly different.  While Beverly is shy and diffident, Elliot is a callous, manipulative smoothie.  When Claire, still unaware that she is sleeping with two men, expresses an interest in mild masochism, Beverly recoils but Elly enthusiastically obliges.  He uses surgical tubes and clamps to tie Claire down for sex, and as he releases her after orgasm, we sense that for him the experience has been 'surgical' - almost a dispassionate experiment.<br><br>If Beverly is Jeckyll and Elliot is Hyde, we are always conscious that both personalities inhabit one awareness.  \"You haven't had any experience until I've had it too,\" Elliot tells Beverly, and the twins certainly seem to share everything, treating each other's patients (without telling the patients, of course) and working in tandem on research papers.  The twins have a twin obsession in common - work and sex.  Beverly sums it up with, \"We do women - that's our speciality.\"<br><br>Identity is at the core of this film, and the dualities and ambiguities of personality recur with brain-teasing frequency.  The twins are interested in female genitalia, both professionally and recreationally.  Claire attracts them because of her dualities - she is a big personality who adopts other personas for her work: a strong woman who is turned on by being submissive: a gynaecological 'star' who happens to be infertile: and the French Canadian 'twin' to the English Canadian brothers. Elliot sleeps with two call-girls who are twin sisters, and identifies them by getting each to call him either 'Bev' or 'Elly'.  The film has layer upon layer of these dualities.  Genevieve Bujold is a French Canadian actress playing a French Canadian actress.  We see her being made up for a movie, but when we see her left side, the make-up is of cuts and bruises.  The Mantles prescribe drugs to each other, and each to himself, criss-crossing the doctor/patient demarcation lines.  They take pills to cure their addiction to pills.  Cary is having a relationship with Elliot, but when she gets both brothers at once, she is deeply aroused.  The film, like the brothers, oscillates between oneness and separation.  \"I want to see you two together,\" says Claire, confused by their duality.  So do we.","user":"stryker-5","rank":[50,62]}]
