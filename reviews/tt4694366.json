What i got - a fairly cliched but well acted drama dealing with loss, grief and the rebuilding of friendships. Worth a watch if you have a spare 89 minutes.","user":"mark-2705","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"My Review Of \"Mail Order Monster\"","rating":9,"date":"1 December 2018","review":"The story is well written, and the cast are superb in their portrayal of such loveable, recognizable characters. It is a soft sci-fi , kid-friendly film with contemporary, and yet timeless concepts. Although the subject matters and heavy material leans a bit dark toward the end, the director never crosses the line from G/PG entertainment. It can, at times, feel a little too sugary, but in away that is part of \"Mail Order Monsters\" charm.<br><br>The special effects are done nicely, blending graphic novel animation with both practical and CGI on a level that inhances the overall family friendly vibe. The creature design and concept is equal to comic con excellence that can even draw in older sci-fi fans. Overall \"Mail Order Monsters\" is a great kid flick that will hit home with families and especially preteens into some sci-fi fantasy movies.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[5,11]}]
