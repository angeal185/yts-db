[{"title":"Very enjoyable movie","rating":9,"date":"11 March 2020","review":"If you like Latina women and if you find it heartwarming when women are genuinely sweet and can cook then you will love this movie...and you will most definitely fall in love with the female lead. I really enjoyed this movie. If you like movies like Fool's Rush In then it's a lock that you will like On The Menu as well. It's a feel good late night flick for men and women.","user":"jjrasile-93766","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"SWEET, CUTE, AND WHIMSICAL","rating":9,"date":"23 June 2018","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I laughed out loud at the scene in the restaurant with Javiera and Joel, when Javiera confronts the kitchen staff. I also appreciate that no impact was shown when punches were thrown. I LOVE happy endings and this one had it.","user":"Samuela55","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Cute","rating":6,"date":"29 May 2018","review":"Cute movie focusing on the heir to the Tortilla Hut franchise looking for their next big dish. On his culinary tour he comes across a fiery local chef that cooks with love. He gets stranded and learns way more than he bargained for. Will he be banned from her restaurant and her heart by duplicitous dealings from his sister? Cute premise and actors. Lovely movie for the whole family.","user":"kz917-1","rank":[7,9]}]
