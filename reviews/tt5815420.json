[{"title":"Some actors career sunk to new lows","rating":1,"date":"4 March 2020","review":"This movie was pretty bad in all aspect of the term.. but Madesen and Baldwin who must have gained 100 pounds and is far from the hot young men he once was.... are awful in every way.","user":"kaefab","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Just Awful","rating":1,"date":"4 March 2020","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this horrific and nonsensical film.<br><br>It becomes a cliche to say that a movie is the worst of all time, but this has to be one of the worst I've ever seen. Excruciating to even sit through it all but I did finish it so I could write this review.<br><br>As you might expect, plenty of violence and crude language throughout. Not that it would matter here, but there were no subtitles on the DVD.","user":"larrys3","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Don't waste your time on this stinker!","rating":1,"date":"8 March 2020","review":"It is truly unbelievable how this movie managed to get released. It is with all honesty really really bad. The acting was probably the biggest disappointment. While turning on this movie I didn't have many expectations. It was supposed to be the movie you play in the background while doing something else. But this movie could not even fulfill this role. It was cringe worthy and honestly just sad to look at.","user":"psxexperten","rank":[3,3]}]
