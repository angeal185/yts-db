[{"title":"Hard pass on this snooze fest","rating":3,"date":"18 February 2020","review":"I love Terry Crews. Even his amazing draw and enthusiasm could not save this awful script with a $10k budget. Story is about drug war with a victim caught in the middle who seeks refuge with Crews and his dad. Pretty straight forward but just a bad script. Wouldn't recommend it.","user":"iamjamalwhite","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Worst Film I Have Seen In Many Years","rating":1,"date":"10 February 2020","review":"Everyone involved in this film should be embarrassed. It has a terrible story line, unnecessary extreme profanity, and is overall a two-thumbs-down candidate for \"worst film ever made\". It is an atrocious assault and assassination of the character of John Henry who was deemed a legendary hero and this movie is so awful it seems like it is a deliberate attempt to do so.<br><br>Terry Crews should be much more selective about the movie roles he chooses in the future or his career is going in the toilet where this movie belongs.","user":"denverdaveonline","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":1,"date":"4 February 2020","review":"I love all the Terry Crews movies, but this was the most boring and terrible movie i have ever seen.","user":"hekuranrama","rank":[7,9]}]
