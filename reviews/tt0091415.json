[{"title":"The chimps are too good to be in this movie","rating":5,"date":"16 July 1999","review":"This movie started off very well, and I was beginning to think that I had stumbled across a pleasant surprise.  Unfortunately, things weren't nearly as interesting in the second half, and so I can't quite recommend this one. The best scenes are when the chimps are displaying their remarkable talents. In fact, the pleasure of watching the chimpanzees is almost enough to make up for the otherwise mediocre story.  The novelty does wear off, though, and the film suffers badly as a result.  Shue and Stamp are both effective, but the script simply runs out of steam in the second half.  Watch only if you love chimps.","user":"Tito-8","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"A great movie!","rating":10,"date":"13 October 2003","review":"Link is a very good film. The acting by Elisabeth Shue and Terence Stamp was very good especially by Stamp but the real stars of the movie are the apes! The great ape that played Link was excellent! I couldn't help but laugh at him because of the way he acts, the things he does, the faces he makes, and the way he moves. I know it isn't suppose to be funny but he makes this classic a very serious but a hilarious film! The chase scenes with Link were cool! The music by Jerry Goldsmith is excellent! A very good theme he composed and the entire score is perfect for the movie! Link is great and is an entertaining movie! I strongly Recommend it!","user":"Movie Nuttball","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Link for president...","rating":10,"date":"5 May 2003","review":"Best monkey horror movie ever - no other comes to mind so its not like there is too much competition. But who cares, this movie is great fun especially for us monkey fans. And who ever you might be, there is no denying that Link is one funky monkey.<br><br>All ye nay-sayers stop your monkey buisness and vote Link for president.","user":"dag_nabbet","rank":[21,30]}]
