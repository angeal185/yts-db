[{"title":"Amazing Animation","rating":8,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"A young boy finds himself hanging from a tree by a parachute, with no idea of how he came to be there. He sees an enormous amorphous shape coming toward him and instinctively knows it means him no good; he manages to escape the creature by cutting the straps of the parachute and makes his way into a temporary refuge. There, he is kind to a baby bird, encounters a motorcycle and a knapsack with handy items like a water canteen, compass, blanket and a map. Soon, he and his bird companion must follow the map to return to humanity, while the monster follows inexorably behind him, getting closer.... The amazing thing about this animated 75-minute feature is that the entire thing was made by one single person, Gints Zilbalodis, everything from the story to the direction to the animation to the music and sound effects. Another amazing thing is that the entire film is without a word of dialogue - it's just the boy, the bird, the monster and a variety of creatures they meet along the way. I found it to be both suspenseful and beautifully gentle, a film perhaps a little intense for very small children but gorgeous and inspiring for everybody else.","user":"alisonc-1","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"Not for those who take everything literally","rating":10,"date":"12 January 2020","review":"First of all, those who think the movie is about a boy running from a monster with a little bird sidekick, don't comment on what you don't understand. Second, if you have a chance to watch it in a cinema, don't watch it on a computer screen or TV. It requires total immersion.\nBeing a psychotherapist, I have to say this is a must-see for anyone delving into their own psyche, dealing with their own mortality (come on, surely you realize the \"monster\" is a symbol for death?), their own emotions. It's not about a bird and a boy, don't let those shallow comments keep you from having a totally transcendental experience. It's about the choices we make, the relationships we build or choose not to build (the bird, the tortoise), about bravery, helplessness and awareness.\nYou can be a cat that just spends its life waiting for a new dose of dream-inducing liquid, and death will come after you. You can spend your journey walking slowly after a tortoise just to turn it around from time to time - or you can help just once and then be on your way, not creating co-dependent relationships. You can find your wings and fly with other birds, and the connection you've made with another being doesn't mean you have to stick with that being forever. You can pull someone out of the death's grip and still not take responsibility for what that individual does next.\nAn amazing, brilliant film. The author is an absolute genius - I'm sure even he, being so young, does not consciously realize the depth and beauty, and impact of what he has created.","user":"dianaancupane","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Words can't describe that which is speechless","rating":9,"date":"1 October 2019","review":"Not a single word. Only music and sounds fill th ears while the narration of the frames and the imagery pull us forward. Does it work? If the fact that I took my 8 year old son who has never seen a silent film nor \"art house\" film before is any indication, this a beaming film of success. It's beautiful and full of emotion and expressive of so much that we have all known, faced or overcome in life or our very dreams. It is a powerful film that will surely leave a laying imprint on our family for years. Thank you.","user":"dales-11","rank":[13,18]}]
