[{"title":"THIS THING IS HILARIOUS!!","rating":8,"date":"11 June 2018","review":"This is as funny as Sharknado! This musical number is funny enough to carry the whole movie. DO NOT take this movie seriously, just let go, and let the stupidity flow into you like a bad street drug. Eric Roberts, you are a genius!","user":"bhetommy","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"Bad movie but maybe on Purpose?","rating":3,"date":"18 June 2018","review":"It's ridiculously bad but I feel like it's maybe on purpose? Eric Roberts and his \"double\" is absolutely ridiculous. He also struggles with his dentures the whole time, any time he speaks that was all I could hear. Seemed like he just got fitted for them or something and couldn't figure out how to speak without sounding like he had a mouth full of cotton lol.","user":"ratfink_17","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"Unbelievable","rating":3,"date":"21 June 2018","review":"I can't believe this movie ended the same way the previous 2 did. I guess I was hoping for a conclusion and see him get his just rewards but it seems the producers want to see how far they can go with this ridiculous character before the viewers finally decide that enough is enough and stop watching. And Eric Roberts is creepy, too.","user":"NoNYRFan","rank":[6,8]}]
