[{"title":"Would You Like a Macaroon?","rating":10,"date":"3 July 2004","review":"Right from the start, I wish to say that this is a wonderful film. I caught it on cable television here in Tokyo several years back. Like so many others remarked in their own circumstances, the film just \"accidentally\" presented itself. Willing to give it a chance, I kept it on for a few minutes. When I heard Michael Jayston's comically sarcastic comments in the opening scene, and the magical Topol \"hiding\" in his office, I was certainly hooked. <br><br>Hal Wallis produced, Carol Reed directed. If that weren't good enough for most film buffs, add John Barry to the list of those involved in this gem of a film. That's right, the same Barry who scored all of the great Bond films. You can hear his signature strings and brass right from the panoramic opening title sequence of London from the air. <br><br>\"Everything's got to be earned.\"<br><br>The story is laid out as an explanation, a highlighting of the history of a couple to a private eye hired to investigate an alleged infidelity. Very cleverly done. <br><br>\"Who's Aldous Huxley?\"<br><br>The film touches on those precious difficulties couples face when both partners stem from different backgrounds. As an American living here in Tokyo for many years, I can deeply empathize with the situation portrayed in the film. <br><br>\"I don't much care for Tuesdays.\"<br><br>Mia Farrow is captivating as the young American living in London. Michael Jayston is marvelous as the upright British accountant. As the \"Public Eye\", Topol is as addictive to the viewer as his character is to macaroons.<br><br>\"He who locks his door locks his heart.\"<br><br>London is featured in all its bygone glory. I was impressed with the raw freshness of the street scenes. These are slightly reminiscent of the work of Richard Lester and his \"mod\" style of filming actual Londoners in action, such as in \"The Knack\" or \"Help\". Here, Barry's scoring of \"The Public Eye\" made these whimsical scenes a pure treat. Nothing less than soul moving cinematic moments are in store for you.<br><br>There is a charming, nice touch thrown in: a tip of the hat to Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and their work in Hammer Films. <br><br>I understand it is difficult to get a copy of this film. The fact that it was shown on Japanese television at least, means that good prints exist and are out there. Luckily, I was able to record it when it was shown again in that same week. <br><br>\"The Public Eye\" or as it is also known, \"Follow Me\", is a truly marvelous film. See it.<br><br>Addendum: A little bird told me the above version, recorded from Japanese TV, is online at Google Video.","user":"humbleradio","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"What a delicious movie","rating":9,"date":"19 February 2005","review":"It's almost criminal that this lovely sweet film isn't available in any medium. Topol is hilarious. Mia Farrow is sweet and childlike. It isn't an action film; it's a character study and, as such, reveals the attitudes, emotions, and desires of the characters slowly and gently, allowing the viewer to savor the developments. One of the biggest stars is the city of London itself. It plays a major role and does it beautifully. Peter Shaffer of \"Amadeus\" fame shows how well he can reveal the essence of his characters. I don't really understand how anyone could see it and not love it. I can hardly wait for someone with insight and sensitivity to get this out on DVD!","user":"hew1","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"A wispy little gem of a film","rating":8,"date":"30 January 2010","review":"Small spoiler: a quotation from near the end of the film.<br><br>I first saw this film when I was about 12, on a late-night movie series, a year or two after it came out. Years later I got a chance to record it, and I cling to the fading video tape and will do so until someone brings it out on DVD. I loved it then; I love it when I watched it again tonight. It is one of my half-dozen favorite films ever.<br><br>Note that I don't say one of the best films ever. It's not in that class, despite the talent in front of the camera (Michael Jayston, Mia Farrow, Topol) and behind it (Peter Shaffer, Carol Reed, John Barry). To boost it too high is to risk disappointing the viewers who eventually find their way to this film, because it isn't a masterpiece. And, as a few naysayers have said, it IS predictable. (Or, at least, it can only go in one of a very limited number of directions.) But it is sensitive, charming, literate, well-acted, and beautiful to look at. It is a celebration of taking joy in life's small moments. And, I might add, a celebration of free-spirits that doesn't try to make us admire labored wackiness. For what it is--slight, conventional in structure, a typical one-act play--it is a beautiful little character piece.<br><br>The joys of this film are threefold: It is a valentine to pre-punk London, with gorgeous photography helped along by John Barry's lovely (if repetitive) music. The dialog, from Peter Shaffer's one-act play, is both witty and poignant. Why not have a movie that is mostly talk, if the talk is this good? And the actors doing that talking are up to the challenge. Even Michael Jayston is good, although something of a weak link because he is the sole element of the movie somewhat lacking in charm. (He has a mouth like the slit in a letter-box.) Mia Farrow is luminous: skinny and odd, sure, but definitely a \"glorious girl,\" bright, dreamy, and sensitive. <br><br>But the movie is really Topol's. Looking a bit like Ringo Starr, his Anglo-Greek Julian Christopherou is at first glance, as Farrow's character describes him, \"a goofy little man in a white raincoat.\" By the end of the movie he has revealed so many facets to himself that many women will think him a model of romance. I would run away with him in an instant.<br><br>I'm 50 years old, and since I was 12 I have been influenced in my view of life by a passage of dialog near the end of this movie: \"Beware: there is no sin in the world more unpardonable than denying you were pleased when pleasure touched you. . . I gave you joy. Not eternal joy or even joy for a month. But immediate particular bright little minutes of joy--which is all we ever get or should expect.\" And that's exactly what this movie gives: immediate particular bright little minutes of joy.","user":"WinterMaiden","rank":[5,6]}]
