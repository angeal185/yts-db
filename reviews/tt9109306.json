[{"title":"Poor on every level","rating":2,"date":"10 February 2019","review":"I believe I read some people connected to the Final Destination films had a hand in this, but the only connection I see is the word \"Final\" and Tony Todd in a very small role. He's a good actor and so is Lin Shaye, at least they're pros, but the other actors in this are awful, I mean \"reading off a cue card\" bad. The script stinks, the plot is the too-often done \"be careful what you wish for\", the editing is bad and the direction is so amateurish you can almost hear the director yell action. The lead character is completely unlikable. The camera work is unremarkable. While Michael Welsh is particularly uninteresting in the lead , Melissa Bolona deserves a special mention for some of the worst acting ever committed to film. Some of her dialogue is delivered as if her mouth were numb. This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities, except maybe for a chuckle or two I got from how bad it was. 2 stars for 2 chuckles.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[39,46]},{"title":"not good and simply boring","rating":2,"date":"9 February 2019","review":"I love movies in horror/mystery category. And i am actually not very harsh critique when it comes to mysteries. But this one is not good. Was too slow, boring, and wasn't even sure in the end what is the twist. Just no, you can skip it unless you really have nothing else to do.","user":"mageh","rank":[38,47]},{"title":"Horrendous","rating":2,"date":"11 February 2019","review":"My seventh wish would be not to have ever watched this movie.","user":"diabladtasmania","rank":[32,39]}]
