[{"title":"Fresh Off the Farm for Mr. Oscar","rating":8,"date":"27 August 2007","review":"When Loretta Young beat out Rosalind Russell in the Academy Award sweepstakes of 1947 it was considered one of the great upsets in the history of Oscar. Russell had gotten a lot of acclaim for her dramatic breakthrough performance in Mourning Becomes Electra which was RKO's prestige picture of the year. The O'Neill drama flopped at the box office. Young was nominated almost as an afterthought to round out the field in 1947. Of course RKO didn't care because The Farmer's Daughter was also one of their films.<br><br>Young worked hard to get her proper Swedish accent for the film and the results would have made Greta Garbo proud. I can't see Garbo appearing in a film like The Farmer's Daughter though.<br><br>Young plays Katie Holstrum who leaves the family farm to study nursing and in an almost Forrest Gump like set of circumstances winds up working as a maid in Congressman Joseph Cotten's home. She's not working for just Cotten. Presiding over the home and the state of Minnesota itself is Cotten's mother Ethel Barrymore. Ethel's not only queen of her own roost, but she's a Senator's widow and still one formidable power in her state of Minnesota. And there's Charles Bickford the family butler who got an Oscar nomination himself in this film for Best Supporting Actor as Young's gruff, but kindly mentor.<br><br>Although at the time this film was made Young was 34 years old she does manage to convey youth here. It worked in this case because in 1947 a lot of people were starting their careers late. It's pointed out in the story that she stayed on the family farm while her beefcake brothers, James Arness, Keith Andes, and Lex Barker were all in the service during World War II.<br><br>A long running television series was adapted from this film with the tragic Inger Stevens in the lead and William Windom in Cotten's role. Cathleen Nesbitt was the grande political dame. The butler's role was dropped and Windom was made a widower with two boys. Even with a genuine Swede like Stevens playing Katie, Young still comes out the better.<br><br>Too bad Rosalind Russell never got an Oscar, but Loretta Young was one of the great survivors of Hollywood and her award was as much an award for a lifetime as for the still fresh and funny, The Farmer's Daughter.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[28,28]},{"title":"Poignant story","rating":8,"date":"8 October 2004","review":"Not having seen the movie before, it was a complete surprise to watch it on cable the other night. This film shows that little, if nothing, ever changes in the world of politics. In fact, it could well be compared to this year's presidential contest. The only thing that has changed from the time where this film was done is that in order to win an election in this country, the candidate must be independently wealthy, or have benefactors that are willing to put up the money in exchange of favors down the line, or not be able to run at all.<br><br>H. C. Potter's film shows us a slice of what on the surface was an ideal time in America during the 40s, but deep down, this film speaks a lot of what was wrong then, in a subtle way. <br><br>Young Katrin Holstrom arrives in Capital City wanting to be a nurse. She has to change plans because when she arrives in the city, she has no money because an unscrupulous man had swindled her out of it. She begins working as a maid at the Morley's mansion. They are the local big name in politics. Mrs. Morley makes candidates, or destroys them. Her own son, Glenn is a Congressman.<br><br>All this atmosphere contributes to the growth of Katrin, or Katie, as she is called. She takes an interest in politics and she shows that she can speak and ask the right questions the candidates don't want to answer. The movie shows the dirty side of campaigns, in general, as is the case of with what's happening in 2004 in America. <br><br>Loretta Young was perfect as Katrin Halstrom. In this film she out charms everyone that she comes in contact with. Joseph Cotten is as effective as she always was in whatever he appeared in. Ethel Barrymore is Agatha, the rich woman behind the political machine. Charles Bickford is also excellent as Joseph, the butler.<br><br>Most movies from that period are sadly dated, but this one keeps the ideals of democracy in check. Bravo to Dory Schary for bringing this movie to the screen.","user":"jotix100","rank":[24,25]},{"title":"Fish For Sale!","rating":10,"date":"2 January 2006","review":"This one's a winner all the way, not a silly comedy but a wry comment on American politics then, before, and since with some humor sprinkled in every now and then. Too bad there aren't more like Katrin Holstrom and Glenn Morley on Capitol Hill. Strange this movie based on a play and directed by a man noted more for stage direction than for film direction should play like a movie should play and not be just another stage play on celluloid. Also the romantic attraction between Katrin and Glenn seems natural with no saccharine added.<br><br>Talk about a cynical approach to mass political rallies to introduce new candidates for popular vote: Joseph Clancy (Charles Bickford) seeing that Katrin Holstrom (Loretta Young) is confused about what is happening before her eyes remarks that the crowd will approve thunderously of anything said aloud. He proceeds to stand up and yell \"Fish for Sale\" and the entire auditorium roars with unequivocal approval.<br><br>And what acting down to the minutest part. Loretta Young deservedly won best actress. Charles Bickford was nominated and should have won best supporting actor. He stands tall above them all and competition is heavy in this flick. You have to be on your toes to out act the likes of Ethel Barrymore and Joseph Cotten, two of the finest acting talents ever, but Loretta Young and Charles Bickford succeed in doing just that.<br><br>This is one of those pictures that Hollywood used to make that is fun from start to finish with surprising twists and turns from time to time. Though all comes out well in the finish, getting there is worth the journey. Plus this happy ending fits and is not just tacked on for custom and tradition. This little film actually speaks more appropriately for what is good in America than movies with more ballyhoo such as \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.\"","user":"krorie","rank":[22,23]}]
