[{"title":"Another Norm Movie","rating":1,"date":"27 February 2020","review":"Norm is back again, and this time, he is trying to prepare for the Northern Jubilee, an important event as king, which causes him to not spend time with his family. However, the crown is stolen while he sleeps, and a killer whale named Tiny tells him an ice ship is taking it to Harbin, China. However, his three kids, Maria, Quinn, and Chase, eavesdrop on him, they join him alongside their mother and Norm's wife, Elizabeth, who think this is a surprise family vacation.<br><br>Yeah, this is not a good movie for kids. Despite the Dove Foundation's Family Approved Seal, it has some crude humor that some parents may not find appropriate for their kids. Also, the film brings in more pointless characters, like Tiny the killer whale, whose voice is irritating, and Master Fu, who is the father of two boys, Pete and Repete (Yeah, those are original names for twin characters). The story sounds poorly written, and the movie has a lot of pointless scenes that take up too much of the running time of the film, with the plot only being dealt with in the last few minutes. I do not recommend this for kids.","user":"jeremycrimsonfox","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Not kino","rating":28,"date":"28 February 2020","review":"As you may not know I'm a huge Norm of the north Stan.
