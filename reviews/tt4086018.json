[{"title":"Cute at certain moments but simplistic and forced at too many others","rating":7,"date":"22 July 2018","review":"Yes, Charming does have certain charm, it's very beautiful as far as its design goes, and most of the jokes do work. All of the cast performs very professionally, but still. The plot doesn't advance naturally, it doesn't flow it stumbles ahead very predictably, as we all knew it would, to the not surprising end. On the road it hits every cliche in the book, many of them are mentioned as if jokingly, but they move the plot forward despite of making us all aware the scriptwriters know it's a cliche. <br><br> So basically, as I stated in the title, the end result is simplistic and forced. Can't say it was painful to watch, but I did cringe in my chair more than once, and its just plain shame, cause I can see here potential for a better movie.","user":"ayoreinf","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Wanted to love this but just couldn't","rating":5,"date":"15 November 2018","review":"Demi is amazing. I wanted to love this movie. The soundtrack was great Demis voice acting was on point but the writing just left something to be desired. There just felt like there was stuff missing. We needed an adorable 3rd party to bring in more comedy and sass the bird was great but the part was so small. The story felt as though part of it was left on the editing floor almost like a book adaptation where you're expected to already love and care for the characters and are there for the highlights.\nAll in all the idea was good, I loved how they pulled so many well loved tales together to feature in this but it is a forgettable movie.","user":"Samanthamjones","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"It might have charm, but it is not irresistible.","rating":6,"date":"3 December 2018","review":"This new fairytale themed comedy by Dreamworks might not be the new \"Shrek\", but it has a fair amount of charm to stand out on it's own. The plot starts out with some really unique ideas, but becomes a bit more predictable and cliche as it goes on. The comedy does not always stick the landing, but when it does, it is undeniably funny. Some characters are properly developed and likeable, but the same can't be sayed about all of them. In conclusion, this movie can be considered hit or miss depending on how you view it.","user":"leoxatzian","rank":[4,4]}]
