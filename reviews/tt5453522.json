[{"title":"Far Better than I though it would be","rating":7,"date":"16 June 2018","review":"I went into this with the knowledge that it was a low budget movie, but not sure what to expect and enjoyed it far more than I expected to.<br><br>Kyle Gallner and Azura Skye, who I did not recognise did an exceptional job with their characters and held my attention throughout, they are both actors I will be looking out for in the future. Mary McCormack was as always solid and believable as a Government Agent, a role she has played regularly in the past.<br><br>This movie started out slowly, but quickly built, grabbed and held my attention through to the end.<br><br>The acting overall was very solid and way above par for a low budget movie.<br><br>Recommended viewing, I would watch this one again.","user":"nowego","rank":[49,52]},{"title":"watched yesterday","rating":13,"date":"13 June 2018","review":"I watched this movie because I really like Kyle Gallner. He's an amazing underrated actor. This movie held my attention, He does a great job of making this character likeable,and the girl who played Beth did a great job too. Have to say I found the science stuff interesting and even googled some information on time travel theories afterward. The ending was not what I wanted, but this movie was worth a solid 6 out of 10","user":"deedee-17957","rank":[24,26]},{"title":"Pretty decent B movie","rating":6,"date":"3 July 2018","review":"I was not expecting much, but every now and then a low budget film surprises me. This was one of them. Some ideas were really fun, even if already done before. The acting was really good., the lead actor was especially skilled.","user":"rchrdrdr","rank":[17,18]}]
