I was actually angry that i wasted time on this. I was warned from the beginning though and i watched it anyway, as the protagonist's blatant exposition pretty well gave away the whole movie. There were scenes that didn't advance the plot, the cinematography was bad, and it didn't build suspense well nor execute a payoff for it. I dearly hope this is the last summoning.","user":"Delareese","rank":[22,23]},{"title":"The crackling!!!!","rating":4,"date":"30 July 2019","review":"I like found footage and forgive a lot of stuff normally. I don't expect the lighting to be great and the sound to be perfect. The acting just has to be better than student film acting and if they can pull off some scares, then it normally wins me over. But man, how did they put this out with those sound issues? Every time the camera was moving, there was a crackling noise. Were they using an empty Cheetos bag as a windscreen for the microphone? It was so distracting. Was going to give it a 7 but that noise issue dropped it down a whole 3 points for me. And if I were a hyper vigilant person, it probably would have dropped it to a 1.","user":"jbisch-27933","rank":[27,29]}]
