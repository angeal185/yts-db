Then make sure that everyone is firing from the hip, and all of their M4s have full auto select fire. Then put an eagle globe and anchor (USMC emblem) on an SAS uniform. But wait....there's more, imagine a service where a Sgt can write and submit his own discharge papers, and voila, he's out! I wish I would have written this movie's discharge papers, but without any viola, I am out.","user":"jcmlb","rank":[8,9]}]
