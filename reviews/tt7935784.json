[{"title":"Documentary of the Year","rating":10,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"Folks go on and on about how 'fearless' a given film is in its unflinching approach to some subject or another. Sure, there are a lot of brave films making the rounds, but to me Transformer sets a new standard. This film is far from a superficial topic treatment of gender identity crisis and transformation. It is in fact a deeply personal story of the struggle to reconcile one's own identity amid manifold, countervailing forces.<br><br>How does a person who has lived their life building and supporting a false identity to protect their psyche from the hatred they feel toward their own body set about building a life around who they've always yearned to be? The answer, it seems, is that nobody knows. Transformer manages to simultaneously challenge what it takes to be a man, what it means to be a woman, and what is required to be truly human.<br><br>Astonishingly honest, deeply emotional, peppered with intimate takes and salted with a sawtooth wave of tiny triumphs and existential setbacks, Transformer is a documentary masterpiece for the modern age. Janae Marie Kroc is ultimately more heroine than we likely deserve, but perhaps precisely the one we need.","user":"jonah-86907","rank":[27,44]},{"title":"Seems honest, but also seemed incomplete","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2019","review":"Saw this advertised on Netflix, and thought it looked like an interesting story. It came across as a very honest portrayal of the conflict that Matt/Janae was going through, but I also think there was much missing, particularly at the end. We never do see a live image of Janae after the surgery, which I found puzzling, and we never know what happened to her career-wise. Also, once she commits to transitioning, we don't see any reactions from family and friends. It almost seemed to me like the filmmakers were eventually very restricted in what access they had and what topics they could cover. Did she fully transition (i.e. breast implants, bottom surgery), or is she content to remain caught in between?<br><br>I find this case particular interesting because, to me, Matt did not come across as fully committed to being one sex or the other. He apparently took testosterone at the same time he was trying to transition on a number of occasions, and his mannerisms as a female seemed faked. And he admitted in one brief scene that he was sexually attracted to women. Far be it from me to deny what is going through someone else's head, but I do wonder if this wasn't something different than a purely transgender situation. Regardless, hopefully all works our for Janae in the future.","user":"jordan2240","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Struck a cord","rating":8,"date":"10 March 2019","review":"I had recently been in a FB argument with people judging Charlize Theron and her raising her son. They assumed she allowed her son got his way because he was dressed as a girl and she allowed it. I defended that her son was doing no harm to anyone, as a boy or girl and not every parent is going to treat their child the same. So I applaud Janae and her tenacity. It definitely cannot be easy and it was interesting to watch.","user":"reneereives","rank":[3,4]}]
