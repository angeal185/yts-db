[{"title":"Not recommended","rating":1,"date":"26 May 2018","review":"I do not have much to say about this film except it was extremely disappointing in ever way!\nActing was sub par and the story was plain stupid. I am sorry to say this movie did not have any redeeming qualities at all. Movies on Lifetime have been much better!","user":"charvelstrat81","rank":[19,23]},{"title":"OMG Don't watch, trust me you will save some time out out of your day...","rating":1,"date":"10 June 2018","review":"This film is terrible to say the least. I couldn't even follow after the first few minutes. Scenes seemed extremely disjointed, story line was confusing, and the acting was really really forced. Just not a good movie at all...I agree lifetime movies are more engaging with better acting than this! I've seen low budget films on youtube better than this! This is horrible!","user":"ajmoore-12677","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Ending bad","rating":1,"date":"29 January 2019","review":"I sit and watched it and thought it was ok until the end. It ended like it wasn't a end. To me I wasted my time watching it.","user":"piglet9663","rank":[2,2]}]
