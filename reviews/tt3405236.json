[{"title":"Must Watch For Shahrukh Fans","rating":9,"date":"24 January 2017","review":"Gear up for a throwback to the great Salim-Javed blockbusters of the Seventies, where the hero grows up mid-action,breaks the tension and action sequences compel you to whistle. Carrying that legacy forward, is Raees. Shah Rukh Khan plays the titular character of a spectacled goon who hates being called \"battery\"; he starts from harmless Ponzi schemes but graduates to pre- planned rackets and becomes the top bootlegger of his town. Shah Rukh Khan has never looked better; he's full of fury and for once, isn't spreading his arms, but breaking others'. The film lies entirely on his shoulders and he carries the weight most of the times. When he doesn't, the ever-so-reliable Nawazuddin Siddiqui steps in with his crackling performance. In the trademark Nawaz style, he delivers some comic relief. Mahirah is restricted to songs and a few emotional scenes, but doesn't really add much. If her purpose was to soften the baddie, it's lost on the viewer.Action Scenes Are Like Every Other Bollywood Movie. The first half is well- paced; it draws you in and makes you root for the SRK, But the second half plunges into a weird Robin Hood zone where the antihero's morals are suddenly defibrillated and he becomes a messiah. The movie takes a rough path there on, and the long runtime makes the ride bumpier. The movie can feel a bit long, but if you're going for a great Shah Rukh performance and some good old popcorn- entertainment,And It Gives A Good Message To Viewers. it might just 'raees' to the occasion.","user":"adarshbohra69","rank":[91,151]},{"title":"SRK and Nawazuddin's performance makes it a brilliant must watch","rating":8,"date":"28 January 2017","review":"Finally the day arrived after 3 years if wait, the day arrived. RAEES . Miyan Bhai SRK stole the thunder with his power packed performance. He has nailed it this &nbsp;time. Raees SRK has shown and proved \" Form is temporary, Class is permanent \" Shah Rukh Khan and Nawazuddin 's bravura performances, Action sequences, Well researched script, Music, Screenplay , Editing, and Climax. <br><br>The first half is well placed; Majmudar's one liners and the music is fabulous and the Laila Main Laila sequence ups the ante. The second grips the audience in their seats and the smoke scene is the show stealer. The dialogues are just bang on.WOW ! The part where SRK says \"dhanda Karta hun, dharm ka dhanda nai karta\" is the best one.<br><br>It's tough to maintain a character's ferocity and vulnerability in equal measures, but this is what SRK does best. <br><br>Full of tightly-choreographed action sequences and a brilliantly written script, <br><br>On the whole , Raees is a full on Masala Entertainer packed by power full performances and adrenaline charged action sequences. Made for Classes and masses alike. Action , Acting, Romance, Violence, Music and Masaledar dialogues all add up to the genre. A classic masala flick, Best movie of it's genre. A must watch movie.

Rukh. Khan. One of the finest actors that India has ever managed to produce has come out with yet another masterpiece in which he excels in every single category. The actors supporting him, from Mahira to Nawaz are also fabulous and hats off to the national award winning director, Rahul Dholakia for making the film. The screenplay and dialogue delivery in this film is amazing as well. After 25 years, Shah Rukh has played another negative role which honestly is something that I've wanted to see for such a long time.I don't want to give too much away, but \"Raees\" is in line for one of the best films of the year, and thankfully I have gotten the chance to watch it.","user":"ahsanimtiaz","rank":[116,225]}]
