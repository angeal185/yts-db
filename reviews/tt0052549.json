[{"title":"It's just not easy bein' green.","rating":27,"date":"27 July 2001","review":"You have to like a movie that offers the heroine (Beverly Garland in this case) running through a swamp during a rainstorm wearing high heels. Okay, to be fair watch this scene carefully and you will notice her heels change into sneakers in the long shots.  Anyway, this very unusual plot offers a scientist (George Macready who was the villain in the 1945 Columbia serial THE MONSTER AND THE APE) who believes he can help crippled people to grow new limbs by injecting them with serum from alligator glands.  Guess what happens. Richard Crane (from TV's \"Rocky Jones, Space Ranger\")is a war hero who was literally blown apart but who healed overnight thanks to the serum but something goes wrong and he start mutating into a . . .but then you saw the title of the movie didn't you?  His new bride (Beverly) follows him to the forboding bayou mansion where his mother lives (Freida Inescourt from RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE, 1944) and soon uncovers the truth about the bizarre experiments.  She tries to tell hubby that she will stand by him no matter what but that's kinda hard when every day he looks more and more like a 'gator. Also around to complicate things is Lon Chaney Jr as Mannon, a drunken Cajun (without a French accent) who hates alligators.  Lon wears a hook on his left hand that he is constantly adjusting on camera.  he also shoots at some (real) alligators from all of 10 feet away and misses! Sure the premise is silly, but if injecting a person with alligator glands can turn them into a gator remember that George Zucco created a werewolf by injecting a man with wolf blood in THE MAD MONSTER (1944).  If THE ALLIGATOR PEOPLE had been made 15 years earlier I'll bet it would have come out of Monogram or PRC.  Give it a try, you just might find yourself having fun.","user":"reptilicus","rank":[34,38]},{"title":"Not too bad.","rating":2,"date":"2 June 2017","review":"This movie is definitely above average for a sixty year old horror flick. It actually has a plot that makes sense and isn't full of holes. That's rare for the genre. It does have some dumb moments. Like Lon Chaney shooting at alligators that are about ten feet away and constantly missing them. He screams to them that he will never stop killing alligators but he couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. Of course when it's dark outside it's actually brighter than the day time, that's never cool. The woman \"stumbles\" through the \"dark\" swamp, easily avoiding and stepping over everything except the alligators. That's a bit lame too. The alligators appear to be real but they never try to attack anyone so I don't know. Other than those dumb parts, it's not too bad. Give it a shot.","user":"TheMeanGreenMidget","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Imaginative and VERY Weird","rating":8,"date":"8 September 2005","review":"You can criticize this film on many issues, including the cheap special effects, the melodramatic piano-playing, the outrageous overacting of Lon Chaneybut you certainly can't say that the movie doesn't have any imagination.<br><br>The movie is told entirely in flashback, as a woman under the 50s wonder drug sodium pentathol remembers her troubled past for two psychiatrists (Bennett and Kennedy) during an extended hypnosis session. Paul Webster (Crane) disappears suddenly on his honeymoon, and his wife (Garland) spends years searching for him, finally ending up at a mysterious (and very damp) plantation called The Cypresses in the bayous of Louisiana.<br><br>Frieda Inescort plays The Cypresses' tyrannical matron, and is accompanied by her unhinged hired hand Chaney (who else?), the local \"swamp doctor\" Macready, and an assortment of other household helpers. Everyone keeps telling Garland to leave, so of course she stays, and eventually finds her husbandwho has been partially turned into an alligator (no tail, just lots of scales)! It seems that Macready has been trying to help accident victims with some kind of alligator extract, and while the victims recover, well, there are some pretty bad side-effects. Besides being scaly and green (presumably, because this is a B&amp;W movie), Crane also has a very deep, rumbling voice, which apparently happened when he received too much alligator hormone.<br><br>Macready has a bright idea that he can \"cure\" Crane through \"massive radiation from a cobalt bomb\", the usual fun 1950s radiation treatment. But when Macready says, \"No more than 30 secondsI determined that with my test alligator!\", you know something is going to go wrong. At the critical moment during the treatment, Chaney bursts in, punches out the doctor, and manages to electrocute himself on Macready's space-age equipment, but not before Crane has been turned into a true \"gator-man\": big alligator head and scaly chest. The gator-man does, however, still have his neatly pressed trousers and belt on.<br><br>Crane runs into the swamp, followed by Garland (who apparently still loves him, even in his reptilian condition). A monstrous explosion destroys The Cypresses, and the gator-man promptly disappears in a convenient quicksand pit, leaving Garland to sit screaming in the middle of the swamp. Cut to Bennett and Kennedy, who have listened rather incredulously to the whole storythen simply decide to do nothing about the situation, thus ending the movie.<br><br>I have to admit, I've never seen a movie with a remotely comparable plot. Garland is her usual steady self, Crane hams it up as the gator-man, and Chaneywell, he chomps through the scenery with great enthusiasm. Macready, apparently thinking he may never again get the chance to play a mad doctor, becomes intensely philosophical at every turn, often staring off into space. Kennedy and Bennett spend most of the movie being baffled by Garland's story, then after discussing it to death, just ignore the whole affair! Even with all of its weird ideas and strange acting, I liked The Alligator People. The bayou settings drip with perspiration and humidity, and the story is very imaginative. Every time there's a slow spot, Chaney seems to burst in and liven things up. I just wish that the filmmakers had gotten a slightly better alligator suit.","user":"mrb1980","rank":[26,29]}]
