[{"title":"Bleak, Brutal and Gruesome Slasher Film with a Brainless Heroine","rating":6,"date":"5 January 2014","review":"SPOILER: In 1989, the boy Martin Bristol (Spencer List) has congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), a rare neural disorder, in which the patient does not feel pain, heat or cold. He is abducted by the deranged serial-killer Graham Sutter (Brett Rickaby) and brought to the Sutter Meat &amp; Poultry, an abandoned meat-packing plant in Minersville, Pennsylvania, where Graham slaughters young women that he kidnaps. <br><br>Five years later, the stubborn seventeen year-old teenager Allison Miller (Alexandra Daddario) loses her parents and moves to the house of her uncle Jonathan Miller (Michael Biehn) that is located near to the decrepit plant. Jonathan, his wife Karen (Kathryn Meisle) and their little daughter Wendy (Peyton List) welcome Allison, but the teenager does not give much attention to her new family. Allison likes to run alone on the road and she passes by the meat-packing plant and then she meets the mechanic William \"Billy\" (Nolan Gerard Funk) and has a crush on him. Jonathan advises Allison to avoid running near the old factory and Billy, who is a problematic teenager. Allison does not listen to her uncle and brings tragedy to the Miller family.<br><br>\"Bereavement\" is a bleak, brutal and gruesome slasher film with a brainless heroine by Stevan Mena. The storyline is cruel with children and most of the directors of horror movies avoid this approach to make the film more commercial. Allison is the key character, but she is too stupid to make the movie work. Her attitude toward her guardians is awkward for an orphan without resources. She is an athlete with big breasts that runs without brassiere, which is unusual. But he worst is to follow an unknown boy through the underground and gruesome basement of an abandoned building seeing jars with blood and weird chains (imagine the smell) without any fear of being raped or attacked by a stranger. Last but not the least, this unpleasant movie is recommended for very specific audiences only. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Below par slasher partially salvaged by nipples","rating":6,"date":"14 April 2013","review":"This nutjob kidnaps a small boy to be a kind of mute companion / trainee / witness to his bloody murders. He kidnaps a screamy teenage girl (one of many, this one is particularly screamy, though), but her family (all people who have never seen a horror film before) come to rescue her one by one, and don't notice that the nutjob is creeping up behind them as he despatches them in unpleasant ways (except for Uncle Jonathan who he murders quite nicely with a shotgun). But the nutjob gets killed and the teenage screamy girl escapes, except she doesn't because the small boy knifes her multiple times, the end.<br><br>This generic mad killer / slasher horror is slightly below average of its type, but gives the impression it thinks it is actually rather good, which it isn't. Michael Biehn and John Savage, a couple of decent actors, are both in it: this doesn't help. Brett Rickaby (of whom it has been said, \"Who?\") plays the nutjob. He is not very good (this is me being kind about his performance). Alexandra Daddario plays the main protagonist / victim. You will notice her very very blue eyes, her constant ear-splitting screaming and her impressively proportioned and vigorously nippled bosom. And not necessarily in that order.","user":"neil-476","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Much better if you know what it is","rating":8,"date":"23 October 2011","review":"Did ANY of you prior reviewers realize this movie doesn't need an explanation because it IS an explanation? This movie is a prequel for the movie Malevolence. And a good one. The acting wasn't top billing actors (take a look at the budget), but it wasn't the worst I've seen by far. Not sure how anyone could say there's no plot. It won't replace my favorite horror movie, but I did enjoy it. Either watch Malevolence first, or watch it knowing what it is. I can see how confusing and open ended it would seem not knowing that, especially since, as far as I saw, IMDb didn't bother to mention it, either.<br><br>This movie does a great job telling the background story of how Martin became the psychopath he was in Malevolence. There were still surprises along the way. It would be nice for it to be more obvious what this movie is, because it really is not a stand alone movie like some other prequels and sequels are.","user":"ace61502","rank":[30,43]}]
