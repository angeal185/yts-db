[{"title":"I was expecting a thriller","rating":3,"date":"20 September 2018","review":"What I got was a drama and an uninteresting one at that. I kept waiting for something to happen. If a slow-paced drama with a let-down ending is what you're in the mood for, then this is your movie.","user":"gaterocker","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"An overdrawn version of a Twighlight Zone episode.","rating":5,"date":"20 September 2018","review":"What we have here is a script writer who is a big fan of The Twighlight Zone or some similar show but found at the current time that there is no show like it to submit it to. So instead it's stretched out into a full length feature film that ends up as a \"meh\" watch with no replay value. Had it been trimmed to a 30 minute episode and been part of a season of TZ like tails it would have been much better.","user":"MikeHunt1075","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"Yawn.","rating":3,"date":"19 September 2018","review":"Not sure the point. The lesson? If there isn't one why bother making this bad movie? Pointless plot.","user":"seandiamondryan","rank":[8,15]}]
