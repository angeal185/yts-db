[{"title":"Creepy...Disturbing But in a Good Way.","rating":6,"date":"2 April 2020","review":"A Lil Indie fun revolves around a mother and son who move to a small town to live with her father, comes across a serious of disturbing mutations in the area which doesn't only affect the wild life in the area but may also threatens the town residents.<br><br>Strange Nature is a small budget horror which means some cheap visual effects are to be expected! Yet putting this fact aside while having a proper plot, cinematography and directing Strange Nature can be described as an enjoyable fun - yet sometimes creepy - experience that takes you back in a journey to the 80s creature horror flicks.<br><br>I give the filmmaker props for being self aware about the major social humanity and environmental crises we are facing almost daily in our society, from nature poisoning to general prejudice and ending up with the condescend look to whoever is different which exposes the hypocrisy shell of being called, civilized humans. Strange nature is all these components added together in an odd yet fun mix bowl of mutated animals, humans, weird behaviors and creature feature horror.","user":"Impartial-Critic","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"What Hollywood thinks about flyover","rating":2,"date":"8 March 2019","review":"First: I found it interesting that all the 8/9/10 all come in one cluster and all single review profiles.\nI don't recall hearing about this \"true life event\". It may have happened. This trope has been done better.\nHowever the film is what we are here to talk about.\nFor having several known stars and assumably a decent enough budget. The production values were worse than most of the stuff on the SciFi channel.\nThe horror is the acting and writing.\nSave yourself don't waste your time.","user":"bobbywell","rank":[18,27]},{"title":"My Review Of \"Strange Nature\"","rating":8,"date":"9 October 2018","review":"\"Strange Nature\" sets up an eco-horror with classic tropes, exaggerated outcomes, and a sense environmental awareness that culminate in a nicely passed creature feature. The film is reminiscent of the classic 70's nature nightmare \"The Prophecy\" and a heavy dose of 80's terror \"The Curse\". The story is as poignant today as similar films in years past. Probably more so since it seems everyone in charge is either asleep at the wheel and lacking oversite.<br><br>Anyway James Ojala does well with his first feature. He creates a community filled with characters that you like, or you hate. Either way you become invested. At times the story does seem to lag a little but not in the \"I'm bored\" sense. Just that there is a lot of story and drama unwrapped in \"Strange Nature\". I almost forgot it was a true horror movie until the horror happened. You get bits of the creature feature nightmare as the story builds, but the climax to the real nightmare is stellar.<br><br>The special effects and horror elements are quality. The mutations , the atmosphere and the actual creature design all are done nicely, kudos to Ojala. Those scenes where we see the effects, are realistic, graphic moment of awesomeness. The settings and music score are somewhat basic but work well with everything else happening.<br><br>Overall \"Strange Nature\" is a great creature feature drama. For full throttle action horror fans, this film will fall short. But it is worth watching. The story is full bodied, with classicly cool characters. The message is timeless and plays a bit as an homage to eco-horrors from the 70's. Plus the overall watch is entertaining.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[18,29]}]
