This to me was gut wrenching and sad but in the end beautifully written about a boy whom saved his family. I cried lots but I also felt relief. This story humbled me and made me realize that I too need to be grateful daily for those around our world have less but make the best out of each day. Incredibly written and told. I am so glad Netflix had this incredible, well written story.<br><br>All should view this and take a step back to see we can do more for others.","user":"iampeaceful","rank":[68,75]},{"title":"This is as real as it gets","rating":9,"date":"2 March 2019","review":"This was an incredible movie. It does not hide the brutal realities of life as an African farmer. As someone who was born and raised in the continent, I can tell you that everything is legit. They even went the extra mile and incorporated the local language into the majority of the dialogue instead of having it be all in English. This is a powerful and inspirational film. I highly recommend it.","user":"jackreacher-57542","rank":[78,88]}]
