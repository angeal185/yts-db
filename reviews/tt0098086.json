[{"title":"A delightful fairy tale from Sweden","rating":10,"date":"29 October 2017","review":"Gunnar, a boy of about seven or eight, has trouble speaking or reading in class, in spite of the encouragement from his teacher, so all of his classmates think he's backward. As a result, he has no friends. That is until two new children join the class. Peter and his sister Petra are only six inches tall, but Peter's cheerful confidence and Petra's quiet sweetness have everyone enchanted. The pair choose Gunnar as their best friend, sitting on his desk, and helping him to speak in class, which proves to everyone that he is not backward at all. The film assumes some intelligence in the viewer, as not all events affecting the characters are actually shown. The acting is perfect, and makes you believe that the actors are just as adorable as the characters they are playing.","user":"p.newhouse@talk21.com","rank":[0,0]}]
