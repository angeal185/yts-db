[{"title":"It's one of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen!","rating":10,"date":"16 November 2019","review":"At first I thought it would be dumb, but omg it was AMAZING! The story was awesome (I won't give any spoilers) and there were parts that made me laugh so hard and parts that made me cry. I don't usually cry during movies, but I'm sitting here writing this review with tears in my eyes. I think it is going to become a new movie to watch every Christmas with my family!","user":"evilmonkey226","rank":[501,524]},{"title":"Haven't cried after watching an animated movie in so long.","rating":10,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"One of the sweetest, emotional and best Animated film of the year. Netflix please keep bringing us movies with great script such as this.","user":"mmehedihopuu","rank":[321,334]},{"title":"Wholesome and Original","rating":10,"date":"17 November 2019","review":"Klaus was a heartwarming animation with a very unique take on the \"Christmas origin\". I originally put it on as background noise for folding laundry but caught myself sitting on the bed for the entirety of the movie. The animation was really well done and the characters were memorable. I loved the similarities with Tim Burton films. It's nice to have a different Christmas film but that has the spirit nevertheless.\nOne of the best Christmas animations in awhile. Great film!","user":"arcticerika","rank":[188,197]}]
