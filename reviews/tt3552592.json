[{"title":"Even Carrie Keagan as Bettie Paige couldn't save this turkey.","rating":2,"date":"14 October 2018","review":"Looking like it was shot on a cheap camcorder, and sounding like the dialog was recorded by the camera's mic, the dialog audio swaps around with nearly every cut, making it hard to follow anything the actors say.\nThe burlesque performances have a look like there was no music playing in the room for them to work off of.\nA student theater group with a smart phone and some LED Panels could probably do better,. I feel a swell of sorrow for the poor soul that had to try and soundmix this film.\nEven if you're a die-hard Burlesque fan, you'd be better off going to see a local performance then sitting through this one.","user":"pidstr","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"6 April 2019","review":"The only thing that I found enjoyable about this movie was Tristan Risk.","user":"sweems13","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"What FUN!!!","rating":10,"date":"4 October 2018","review":"What a wonderful way to escape from reality life for 70 minutes! The ladies are simply stunning, and the burlesque was on point! I was entranced, and loving how this low budget independent film simply made it all work! Kudos and two thumbs up! SEXY!!","user":"janlopreste","rank":[11,21]}]
