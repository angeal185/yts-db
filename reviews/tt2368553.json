[{"title":"An film that fills with so much emotions that its flaws are easily overlooked.","rating":7,"date":"1 June 2013","review":"I am compelled to write this review because I am completely disgusted by all those biased reviews written by people who let their predisposed opinions about the director or the actor dictate their feeling towards the film. I am not a fan of Uwe Boll but I don't agree with a lot of the nasty stuff people put out there. I know people are entitled to their opinion but I also know that we can become better at what we do.<br><br>With all that said, I was genuinely surprised by the amount of emotion put into this film. The acting was superb. Dominic Purcell does a great job playing an average individual, Jim, a loving husband who is desperately trying to survive in a world full of greed. It is hard for anyone not to feel for Jim as injustice and greed gradually consumes his everything and pushes him closer and closer into the world of evil. Erin Karpluk does a great job portraying a loving wife whose unfortunate destiny is worsened by the flaws of capitalism. All others minor characters all did their best to help the audience understand the difference between good and evil. I don't understand why people think Dominic Purcell is a bad actor, I really think he is one of the few action stars who can be tough yet full of emotions at the same time.<br><br>While there were no major flaws in acting, the plot does suffer some major setbacks. Since I don't want to spoil anything, let me just say I didn't think any of those was a major distraction to the movie but they were somewhat noticeable. Overall, the story might be a bit too straightforward to some people and the ending twist which may or may not fit everyone's taste, the great acting should keep you entertained throughout.<br><br>Quick note, if you are watching it with a kid, please make sure to explain the role of violence and the importance of consequence and blah blah blah. This movie can be too deep for kids.<br><br>To conclude, please watch this movie with an open mind. Do not blindly hate it because of Uwe Boll's history as a director and do not love it simply because of it's an bloody revenge towards Wall Street greed.","user":"recollectionY","rank":[80,93]},{"title":"Good movie, watch it.","rating":8,"date":"10 July 2013","review":"Not what i expected, in a good way. This is not just a \"run and gun\" movie. I find this movie to be comparable to \"Falling Down\" from 1993, or Law \"Abiding Citizen\" 2009. Only a bit better! I would give both those movies 7, i give this 8. <br><br>The reason for this is the build up, or rather the hard hitting decline. It is not only hard hitting, but it is highly relevant and indeed, highly believable. The acting is good, Erin Karpluk does an excellent role, and really gave me a \"puch in the heart\". Eric Roberts does the slick lawyer very well indeed. Dominic Purcell does a good job, but i have a bit of an issue there. There is a bit to much \"stoneface\" going on. If this is due to the actor or the director is probably a discussion for the learned of such things. But he carries the movie well.<br><br>Im looking at Uwe Bolls movie list and i have seen six or seven of his over 30 movies, so i am no expert. If you look the Bloodrayne series it is quit entertaining, but they don't mean anything, if you catch my drift. I find Assault on Wallstreet to be quite a different animal. Yes there is shooting, executions and blood. But this time the \"scenery\" is different, it is relevant. <br><br>Assault on wallstreet surprised me and therefor i might be overly entusiastic by giving an 8, but i do recommend this movie. Yes you might \"have seen it before\".. Well let me tell you, i have seen Superman, Spiderman, Avenge me this and Avenge me that so many times that the my eyeballs starts to bleed by just accidentally seeing the commercials for the bloody things.. OK, the new Spiderman was better than the last one, but thats besides the point! (cough cough)<br><br>I say give it a go :)<br><br>Appreciate a yes or no for helpfullness, so i know if there is a reason for me to writing these comments.","user":"blizz007","rank":[133,160]},{"title":"Uwe Boll! you did it this time.","rating":6,"date":"12 May 2013","review":"Uwe Boll is known as one of the worst directors ever known to be in the film industry for making movies for big budgets and making absolutely nothing back from them.hes hated by all the directors in Hollywood and is mocked by people all over the world.his last few movies have been universally panned by critics all of them adapted from popular video games.after owners of well known game metal gear solid refused to sell the rights to Uwe Boll because his history as a director.<br><br>i think he finally woke up and smelled the smoke because his latest film Assault on wall street is actually good.The film stars Dominic Purcell and Erin Karpluk .the film starts as Jim a security guard for an armored truck who is struggling to pay for his ill wife who is recovering from cancer and Jim must find ways to pay for his wife's treatment after his disastrous investment his stockbroker advised him to make.he soon looses everything he has and decides to take extreme measures to get revenge on the rich and greedy people who got him into the situation hes in.although the film starts off slow it somehow manages to keep you interested and you sympathize with Jim and actually start to root for him even though you know what hes doing is wrong.it picks up near the end and to be honest it impressed me even though Uwe Boll has gone really dark for this one.with a A+ performance by Dominic Purcell and Erin Karpluk<br><br>this is a film Uwe Boll can actually be proud of and not have to worry about being universally panned.many people will watch this movie and give it a bad review just because of Uwe Boll past and because they quite frankly don't like him or his methods but thats not what film is about.the film is a huge improvement over his previous films and all i can say is Uwe Boll keep it up stay away from the video game adapt ions and concentrate on your own work.now I'm not saying this film is amazing but it is a damn good film.6.5/10","user":"waqarr40","rank":[116,146]}]
