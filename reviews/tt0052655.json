[{"title":"\"Walter Paisley Is Born\"","rating":24,"date":"24 November 2001","review":"Purportedly made in five days, A Bucket of Blood is one of those films that just seems to grow on you after each viewing(beginning with the first!). Dick Miller plays his most substantial role in his long and varied career as a very stupid, amoral busboy for a beatnik cafe.  His name is Walter Paisley and he wants to \"fit\" in with all the other cool cats at the cafe like the pompous Maxwell who recites poetry, the two clowns higher than kites that just take space and never order any coffee, the cafe owner Leonard that wears the trappings of being a beatnik but is more concerned about making a buck, the lovely artist Carla that wants to be surrounded by creative and artistic people, and a host of other beatnik types.  Walter, by a set of bizarre and ridiculous circumstances, takes a cat he accidentally killed and covers it with clay.  He brings it in to his \"friends\" and that laud him as a great and gifted artist.  From there Walter works his way up to human sculptures.  The story is filled with loads of black humour including a heavy dose of fun poked at the beatnik culture.  Miller plays Paisley wonderfully with a certain innocence.  All the acting is pretty good with a few stand-outs.  Anthony Carbone as Leonard adds a lot of credibility to the film with his more realistic performance, and he has some of the best lines and facial expressions.  Barboura Morris is beautiful and credible.  But the top acting honors easily go to Julian Burton(where is this guy now?) as Maxwell.  He is the poet that makes every word sound as if art were dripping from his tongue.  He recites lines like, \"Life is an obscure hobo bumming a free ride on the omnibus of art\" and \"ring rubber bells, clang cotton gongs, strike silken cymbols.\"  He is wonderfully over-the-top in his whole portrayal and always makes me laugh with that garbage he utters.  Director Roger Corman has little budget to work with here, but he makes a minor masterpiece with what he did have to work with.  Walter Paisley is Born. And he lives on in video and dvd!","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[50,53]},{"title":"When Beatniks Go Bad","rating":8,"date":"17 August 2005","review":"Very funny B movie by Roger Corman about a hapless busboy who works in a fifties coffee shop and wants more than anything to be accepted by the beatnik in-crowd. He is prevented from doing so, however, by his complete lack of artistic talent (not that most of the regulars are particularly gifted either). After accidentally killing his landlady's cat (rigor mortis setting in immediately, apparently), he decides the best way to cover up his crime is to cover the critter with clay and pass it off as avant-garde art. His hep cat customers are blown away; Walter is delighted to be accepted at last; only to hold their interest he has to keep making sculptures <br><br>The film is not particularly scary (and probably wasn't meant to be), but it works very well as a horror spoof and amusing, if occasionally heavy handed, satire on beatnik culture and the modern art scene (although considering that today rotten meat and crucifixes immersed in urine are taken seriously as art it's as though reality has caught up with and outdone satire). The bearded poet Maxwell who writes of cotton gongs and the sour cream of circumstance is, as others have commented, a dead-on parody of the type of writer who to this day can be found at café readings. (He is strangely likable, though, maybe because he is so genuinely enthusiastic about his pretentious poetry). And for some reason I can't quite put my finger on, I thought the final scene where Maxwell leads a bunch of other earnest beatniks in a chase after a now completely crazed Walter one of the funniest episodes I've ever seen in a movie.<br><br>If you've never seen a Corman film before, this is a good place to start.","user":"pocca","rank":[18,18]},{"title":"Corman's first black comedy","rating":7,"date":"7 May 2000","review":"In Roger Corman's autobiography, he credits himself to creating the sub-genre \"black comedy\". His version of \"black comedy\" featured gruesome elements, that were sometimes played for laughs. With BUCKET OF BLOOD and LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, he furthered this along, and although I'm not sure if he did indeed invent the \"black comedy\", he sure had a good run with it.<br><br>BUCKET OF BLOOD is near-perfect. Which is saying a lot when you think of some of Corman's films. BUCKET OF BLOOD stars Dick Miller in his only starring performance. He plays a struggling busboy/artist, whose only real desire in life is to impress the local beatnik girl (the talented Barboura Morris). Miller works at the same coffee house that Morris frequents. The place, run by Anthony Carbone, features poetry and art. There are also pretentious beatniks, drug dealers, and undercover detectives.<br><br>I don't want to give much else away, aside from that the film itself has a life of its own. The energy is high, the camera and editing work are effectively polished, and the dialogue is uniformly crisp. Corman's direction is fluid. Next to LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS and maybe a few of his Poe films, BUCKET OF BLOOD is his best film.<br><br>Dick Miller, has never received such a juicy part to play as this. He handles the jokes well, and his interplay with Carbone, and especially Ed Nelson, is great.<br><br>The sets are cheap, the conclusion is rushed, but BUCKET OF BLOOD made me giggle, and unlike some horror films, it is supposed to.","user":"silentgpaleo","rank":[29,31]}]
