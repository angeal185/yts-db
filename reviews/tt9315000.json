[{"title":"Met my expectations which weren't super high","rating":7,"date":"12 September 2019","review":"I immediately wanted to watch this after knowing the cast. And I was not disappointed in the acting department of the movie. I've seen almost every actor in this movie in really different roles and I was immensely impressed by their acting here. Although, I'm not sure if people who are unfamiliar with the cast will enjoy it as much as I did.<br><br>The characters' personalities were very eccentric as most Japanese teens in dark disturbing movies are (which actually makes me wonder: are there really Japanese teens with these dramatic and over-the-top reactions and principles or is this just a reflection of anime/manga characters?). However, each character's experiences are a great representation of the different reasons for suicide. That was also one of the best parts of the story: how characters have conflicting reasons on why they want to end their life.<br><br>The ending, for me, was great but could have been better. However, the actors made it convincing enough for me to accept it.<br><br>I think the movie was overall beautifully shot although I did feel that they achieved it with struggles. In terms of the pace, it's slow as it should be (maybe a bit too slow in the beginning but it did add some tension). It also felt a little bit incomplete.<br><br>In summary:\ngood points - fair representation of suicidal teens, cinematography, acting\nnot so good points - it's hard to take the situation seriously if you're not familiar with this kind of genre of japanese film (this hardly counts as a con)\nbad points - it's not the greatest film but it's on its way to be if they pushed harder (specifically on the ending)","user":"shazam_granger","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Good Enough","rating":6,"date":"28 August 2019","review":"12 suicidal teens is not a light movie, but it has a nice ending. At least, a nice enough ending.<br><br>What I liked was the individual stories and how different each character was. The mystery thing was intriguing as well. However, the movie felt like there was no theme behind it and no point watching it. Plus, the main story got confusing.<br><br>The performances, however, were really good from all actors and actresses. Though one should expect that much from a cast packed with some of the best young stars of Japan.<br><br>So, overall, six out of ten.","user":"pennyelenabooks","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Dark Drama","rating":7,"date":"24 November 2019","review":"Twelve teens go into an abandoned hospital to fulfill a suicide pact but on arrival, they find the body of a boy and set out to find out his circumstances.<br><br>Great representation of dark, moody teens. Each with their own stories and reasons for being where they are, they are unique and keep you interested.<br><br>I liked it. It was a bit slow starting out but it is well acted and written. Not a bad watch.","user":"Foutainoflife","rank":[0,0]}]
