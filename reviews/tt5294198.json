[{"title":"Not Another Teen Comedy (Thank God!)","rating":7,"date":"3 March 2017","review":"The best thing about Catfight is that it offers a fairly unique and hard to find change of pace from many of the current crop of teen and young adult comedies.<br><br>Also on the plus side, it moves from a clearly satirical base into one of the most bizarre and (arguably) violent little feuds ever filmed (in the history of the medium) between two female characters who, presumably, should know better.<br><br>\"Adults behaving badly\" ... on steroids.<br><br>Which of course is its charm.<br><br>It also boasts performances from Heche and Oh which are not merely good but extraordinary. No matter how bizarre the character, no matter how over-stretched the script and dialog, these two actresses are fully committed to their portrayals.<br><br>It is the job of the reviewer to identify analogs of a story to better compare and contrast the production.<br><br>In the case of Catfight, this is not as easy as it looks.<br><br>While the overall plot can perhaps find resonances (for example) in something like Bad Santa 2003 (the first one, not the sequel) the overall tone and wickedness of the story, the complete disregard for anything resembling a normal dramatic narrative -- such as for example the over-utilization of \"coma\" as a continuity device? -- would require a trip back in time to the so-called experimental films of the 1960s.<br><br>Overall the final effect is remarkably like a car accident that attracts rubber-neckers, moreso than a cinematic breakthrough that attracts fans.<br><br>In other words, it is fun, novel, and interesting on first viewing. Something to tell your friends about.<br><br>But whether you would ever want to see another film just like it remains an open question.","user":"A_Different_Drummer","rank":[57,74]},{"title":"Makes \"The Duellists\" look like a child´s play.","rating":7,"date":"22 January 2018","review":"I think it was Kapuscinski who wrote \"war is but a series of revenges with an untraceable origin\", then there´s Gandhi and his famous \"eye for an eye and the world will go blind\". Some might despise this film for being such an obvious allegory but it´s just too rich. It might lose some balance at times between its despicable characters and their meaning but nonetheless, it does work on both levels, personally and globally. A tight structure allows the film to expose its point with sharpness and confidence. It´s able to settle years of war debate in a 30 seconds piece of dialogue. It goes from social critique to symbolism to downright comedy in a matter of seconds, totally in control.<br><br>Comically, it works, oh yes. There´s something oddly funny about two people grudging obsessively over the years. I think \"The Duellists\" had a lot of unintentional humor. This one embraces the absurd concept. It ironically glorifies violence featuring ridiculous punch sound effects and it never gets too close to the character´s misfortunes. It´s a comedy, first of all. <br><br>Conceptually, it stays neutral, and that´s no joke. Aggresions and affronts are equaly terrible on both sides. That is extremely important not to lose its validity. One can argue that Catfight has a few missteps but it´s certainly not clumsy. Better than that, it´s absolutely hilarious.","user":"axapvov","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"2 great actresses in a bizarre original satire","rating":8,"date":"7 June 2017","review":"Nothing can prepare the viewer for what a roller coaster ride this movie is.<br><br>I found myself laughing at the cat fights between the 2 college frenemies - over the top punching sessions.<br><br>Interspersed throughout the movie there is biting social satire and commentary about the war on terror, class and money, how we treat people, karma etc.<br><br>Unsettling and unforgettable. Watch it - but be prepared this is no typical indie comedy.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[13,16]}]
