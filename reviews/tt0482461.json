[{"title":"'Barry Munday' is a surprisingly poignant and introspective comedy","rating":9,"date":"1 April 2011","review":"In this comedy directed by Chris D'Arienzo based on the novel Life is a Strange Place by Frank Turner Hollon, Patrick Wilson plays Barry Munday, a suburban wanna-be ladies man, who makes up in the hospital with both of his testicles gone after being attacked in a movie theater for hitting on the wrong girl. To make matters worse, a paternity lawsuit is filed by a woman he can't remember having sex with. Realizing this being his last chance to ever be a father, Barry decides to take on the responsibility on being a good father.<br><br>My initial impression of the concept of this film was that this film could either be a feminist revenge fantasy or a raunchy comedy. Thankfully, this film was neither of those, but turned out to be a surprisingly poignant little comedy, with a honest, introspective look at what being a man entails beyond having the body parts, if you will. Given it's a comedy, there were many predictable directions this film could have taken at the expense of Patrick Wilson's character, Barry. Surprisingly, the film avoids the obvious and portrays Barry in a sympathetic and real way. Barry starts off as an irresponsible loafer, whose main interest involve bedding women, who soon after loses his most prized asset and what he feels makes him a man. He goes through a slump until he finds out that someone may actually be carrying his child (from a previous fling he had no recollection of). In a sense, he realizes being a father may be the only thing left that connects him to his manhood.<br><br>Barry meets the mother of the child, Ginger Farley (Judy Greer), who isn't particularly a looker, to put it nicely. Her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Farley, as played by Cybill Shepherd and Malcolm McDowell, seem to agree that Ginger hadn't quite lived up to their expectations, in beauty and otherwise, unlike their model daughter, Jennifer (Chloë Sevigny). There's noticeably a bit of a sibling rivalry between Ginger and Jennifer. As we get to know the characters, we see personal baggage behind both Ginger and Barry which perhaps contributed much in how they viewed themselves and their lifestyle. With Ginger full of bitterness and resentment toward Barry, the relationship between Barry and Ginger is often awkward and comic as Barry is honestly trying to know her better for the first time. Advertisement<br><br>Patrick Wilson (Watchmen) is close to perfect in the role of Barry, where he deftly milks the comic aspects of his shallow character as well as his eventual change to a deeper, sympathetic, and more serious side. Judy Greer plays the awkward Ginger Farley with caustic wit and consistency. Cybill Shepherd and Malcolm McDowell in their supporting roles as Ginger's parents, the Farleys, turn in expectedly seasoned performances. Bill Dee Williams (do I even have to mention Empire Strikes Back?) is his usual charming self as Barry's Delorean-driving boss, who happens to be close to the Farleys. Jean Smart is great as the blunt, yet sharp-minded, Carol Munday, Barry's mother.<br><br>This independent film marks Chris D' Arienzo's directorial debut and it is a strong one. The comedy feels natural because it's fairly close to life for the most part. The emotions of the characters feel genuine. It is unexpectedly touching. Patrick Wilson does great work in his role as the titular character. It's not what I would call a laugh-a-minute comedy, but a deeper, thoughtful film that happens to have much comedy—usually the type of films I gravitate toward. This film left me with some thoughts long afterwards, which says a lot about a comedy, let alone any film. <br><br>For more of my movie reviews, you can also follow me at http://twitter.com/d_art","user":"d_art","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"Balanced, Funny, Poignant","rating":8,"date":"10 December 2010","review":"A Man might argue a story about losing testicles would induce a cringe and protective leg-crossing. However, it's not testicles that make a Man, it's responsibility and maturity. And therein lies the core of this tale; balls, it turns out, are not balls.<br><br>Barry Munday is a dim bulb, breast-obsessed horndog searching for gratification at every possible turn. One drunken night he impregnates a mousy, bitter woman... and completely forgets until the (celibate?) woman's lawyer delivers a paternity demand. In the interim, an angry father has de-testiclized him with a trumpet. The end of the Munday lineage?<br><br>The comedy is quite subtle and placed squarely on the shoulders of the stellar cast. Supporting standouts are Jean Smart who genuinely shines and a number of oddballs, including every member (pun intentional) of a genital mutilation support group. Sadly, Cybil Shepherd and Malcolm McDowell are nearly non-entities. Chloe Sevigny (the woman's sister) has a great turn as the family favorite, stripper, female horndog equivalent to Barry.<br><br>This film belongs to Patrick Wilson, but particularly Judy Greer. In other films her edgy sidekick has been one-note abrasive. Here, in a tour-de-force, she juggles that same edge, bitterness, sexiness without sex appeal and near naked vulnerability. Her performance is an eye opener. Judy Greer fans (I was not really one of them) will rejoice.<br><br>If a laugh riot filled with obvious penis jokes is your bag (pun again intentional) you will be disappointed. The production designer clutters the background with quite funny visual clues underscoring the issue at hand (and again intentional). For example, hanging in the office of Barry's boss is an antique graphic with large text reading 'Seamen'.<br><br>Then there's Judy Greer's weird, mysterious, Japanese male neighbor. Despite Ms. Greer's protestations she's a virgin (before Mr. Munday), is the neighbor truly the father?<br><br>Great comedy creates a tapestry of the human condition between the laughs. \"Barry Munday\" delivers in spades. While not earth-shattering, the revelations - sibling rivalry, emotional and physical abandonment, true sadness, ego gratification, family denial at any cost, irresponsibility - in this comedic (left-handed) spin of \"Taming of the Shrew\" presents a beautifully crafted arc for the two main, emotionally damaged characters.<br><br>With multiple layers, smart writing, fine acting and terrific direction, \"Barry Munday\" is a wholly satisfying comedy light on the didactic, heavy on the weird, right on target overall.","user":"Cinnyaste","rank":[19,24]},{"title":"Can you keep your manhood after you lose the family jewels?","rating":22,"date":"22 June 2011","review":"I sought out this movie for one reason, it has Marc Tubert in a brief role as a maternity doctor. I met Marc last month as we walked the fairways of the Texas A&amp;M golf course, watching his daughter and other University of Arkansas golfers contend for the NCAA championships. He is a very nice guy, and after meeting him there, it was fun to see him in a movie role! <br><br>I like Patrick Wilson, he is a very talented singer and an actor able to tackle a variety of roles. Here he is simpleton and slacker Barry Munday, seemingly spending all of his waking energy minimizing the amount of work he actually does, while chasing \"tail\" at every opportunity. One fateful day he meets a randy young lady, well actually a teenage girl, and they end up in the movie theater together. When the girl's father shows up, with a trumpet in his hand, and assaults Barry to protect his daughter.<br><br>Barry wakes up in the clinic, not certain at all what happened to him. He soon is told that he lost his testicles, both of them were damaged during the attack and could not be saved.<br><br>Barry is coping as well as he can in succeeding days, when he gets word that Judy Greer as Ginger Farley is pregnant, and Barry is the father. He asks \"how sure are you that I am the father?\" She is sure, she was a virgin before she met him, and he is the only one she had been with.<br><br>Wilson and Greer are remarkably good in this different kind of romantic comedy. This premise could have gone into the slapstick gutter very quickly, but it didn't because of an intelligent script. For the first time in his adult life Barry had something to care about, and for the first time in her adult life Ginger found someone who seemed to genuinely care about her.<br><br>We enjoyed it.<br><br>SPOILERS: Barry and Ginger grow on each other, he is there for childbirth, it appears that they are becoming a close-knit family as their child begins to grow up.","user":"TxMike","rank":[5,5]}]
