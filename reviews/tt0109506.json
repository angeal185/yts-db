[{"title":"There must be an angel ...","rating":23,"date":"23 August 1999","review":"I approached this film after reading the hype and controversy surrounding its making and release, not really expecting very much.  Surprised to find it an intelligent, beautifully-filmed, engrossing and touching thriller. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a fondness for weird gothic mythological stories.  I didn't find the horror aspect overdone - in fact it was believable, and the script was superior to other films of this genre I've seen.  As for Brandon Lee, this really was a superb performance and it is a terrible tragedy that his life ended so abruptly.  This film is a fitting memorial to what could have become a major star.","user":"didi-5","rank":[101,117]},{"title":"the best Gothic comic book movie ever made","rating":10,"date":"4 February 2005","review":"This movie is fantastic. plain and simple. Brandon Lee delivers his lines to the point they were instantly memorable after seeing the film only once. The casting of both Michael Wincott and Tony Todd was inspired as these two guys have two of the most instantly recognisable voices in the movie industry. If i could ever be a movie or a lead in a film this would be it. I was initially put off the idea of the movie as i am a big fan of the graphic novel and there was an awful lot of hype around this film on its release. this proved to be my loss as i have only seen the film on the small screen. however i now have the 2 disc special edition DVD and watched it 3 times in succession the day i bought it and must have watched it at least 100 times since. my own personal opinion is that a movie should suspend disbelief, capture the imagination which this does in spades. it is truly a film that you can lose a couple of hours watching and at the end feel like you have spent a worthwhile couple of hours. would recommend this to anybody.","user":"Sean68","rank":[119,141]},{"title":"The only thing...","rating":10,"date":"21 June 2005","review":"The only thing i can say is that when i left the movie theater then i had no comment to give... This movie got to me deep! I was 14 and now i am 25,and still i remember it so well and i still watch it sometimes.. Brandon Lee did a great job as an actor like everyone else, but the story about his death is totally insane, which made me worship the movie even more. What an irony. I like the movie cause it's dark, but also lighted up with true emotions..there is action, horror, love, even poetry for god sake! I have never seen so many genre's in one movie. Anyway for me it has been one of the best movies i have ever watched. And one more comment, lots of of other movies got ideas from The Crow, meaning the setting, the action, music, whatever it is the crow was their start up. I am not going to name them, Crow fans probably know what i am talking about.. My favorite quote: \"Can't rain all the time\" By the way the soundtrack's are awesome, The Cure's best song ever made is in it! P.S. The Crow II and III sucked, i hated it. They just ruined the conception of the first one.. totally..","user":"yusandra79","rank":[210,261]}]
