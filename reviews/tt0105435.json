[{"title":"Wonderfully scored, thinking ahead of its time . . .","rating":15,"date":"15 November 1998","review":"Despite its relative obscurity, Sneakers is quickly becoming a cult favorite of the internet generation.  It's a perfect blend of romance, tech and adventure that highlights the increasing importance of information.  The always beautiful Mary McDonnell as Liz doesn't hurt, either.  The soundtrack is arguably the best of James Horner's film scores pre-dating Braveheart, with an ethereal jazzy feel that sets the mood from the opening credits.<br><br>For an early nineties movie, Sneakers was remarkably forward thinking in its script and plot.  Many of its themes have only become more relevant with the flowering of the data network.  All in all a great film for those of you who enjoy flicks like Hudson Hawk or Mission Impossible.","user":"Jonnyboy","rank":[42,46]},{"title":"The last good hacking movie","rating":10,"date":"11 July 2003","review":"I was saddened that this movie had such a low rating.  I've watched it many, many times over the years, and it continues to entertain.  It is, perhaps, the last good \"hacker\" film (well, 23 (1998) also comes to mind, but that isn't widely available in English).<br><br>The math is believable (Janek's lecture makes sense), as is the technology (except for the Hollywood-ish decryption displays -- but that's forgivable). The characters are among the most realistic in any of these movies (with the exception of Joey the lamer in Hackers (1995) -- most accurate character in a hacking movie I've seen yet).  They're each composites of well-known people from the 80s security scene.  The techniques they use are the techniques of the business, especially in that era.<br><br>Now that computers have become such a big thing, I don't think it would be possible for Hollywood to produce another movie like this.  Anything made now would have to be far more glamorous and unrealistic.<br><br>What's this movie got, if you don't care about any of that stuff?  It's tremendously funny, cleverly written (every scene works overtime to say and do more than one thing), and beautifully shot and scored.  (The opening scene and transition is wonderful)  The acting is priceless. I've never met someone who didn't love this film.  See it.","user":"tek-9","rank":[137,160]},{"title":"An endlessly watchable movie. 10/10","rating":10,"date":"3 August 1999","review":"This film is the one film of the nineties which I can watch again and again without getting bored. That's not to say it's the best, no no no, but there's something about this movie which I just can't get enough of. It's easily the most frequently used tape in my limited video library.<br><br>Mainly it's the cast; quality names down the length of the list, and each one, from Robert Redford heading the motley crew of good guys (Dan Ackroyd and Sidney Poitier especially good) to Ben Kingsley as a deliciously cool but insecure villain. They're all clearly having such a good time as they're making the movie that you can't help but join them; it's infectious.<br><br>It's also surprisingly timeless. Seven years have passed since this movie came out, which is a long time in the gadget world in which this film is based, but none of their equipment or techniques (except a brief glimpse of a now outdated version of Windows but that's REALLY nitpicking) seem out of date; it could still be today.<br><br>And then there's the moments. This is a film based on a whole load of brilliantly memorable moments. When they find out what the mysterious black box actually does, it's truly chilling. All the little tricks of their trade on display are each a delight, from setting off fire alarms to being on the other end of the phone when the fire service is subsequently called. And the ending, in my opinion, is one of the most satisfying, and hilarious, conclusions ever captured on film.<br><br>In case you hadn't noticed, I love this movie. A great score, a great cast, and a whole lot of fun. Whether you got to these comments because you want to know if this film was worth seeing, or whether a training shoe web-search somehow ended you up here against your will, you really should see this film. It's a hugely entertaining piece of the nineties. And Robert Redford has done nothing better since.","user":"Tim Gomersall","rank":[114,138]}]
