[{"title":"More than just a guilty pleasure of a movie . . .","rating":10,"date":"18 July 2001","review":"Siskel and Ebert once ran a special show entitled \"Movies I'm Embarrassed to Admit I Liked.\" I suppose that if I composed such a list of guilty pleasures, this one would be one of them . . . but upon reflection, it's really a lot better than that. Fifteen year-old science prodigy Mitch (Gabe Jarret) is recruited by ambitious college professor Jerry Hathaway (William Atherton, in yet another of his patented roles as a loathsome character) to work on the professor's prize laser project, not knowing that Hathaway is really developing a government weapon. Along the way, Mitch is mentored by Chris (Val Kilmer), another prodigy a few years his senior who teaches Mitch how to loosen up.<br><br>This could have degenerated into nothing more than just another teen revenge comedy, but there's so much more: the dialogue is laced with sharp wit; there are some lovely scenes that have nothing to do with the story yet are carefully set up, almost as blackouts (e.g., Mitch goes to a lecture at which a few students have left tape recorders instead of attending; later, at another lecture there are more tape recorders than students; and, in a final scene, one large tape recorder gives the lecture to a room populated by nothing but other small recorders!); and throw-away scenes that make you want to stop and back up the story to watch again (e.g., Chris off-handedly cutting a slice off a bar of dry ice to make a slug for the coffee machine). <br><br>It's also one of the few movies to boast the presence of the memorable Michelle Meyrink -- as Jordan, the \"girl-nerd\" who made being smart and female (and still quite sexy) something to emulate. And there's Tears for Fears' great song, \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" providing the perfect coda as the closing credits begin to roll . . . . Yes: really now, what's there to be embarrassed about?","user":"Aldanoli","rank":[76,82]},{"title":"A High IQ version of Animal House","rating":13,"date":"13 June 2003","review":"This movie is in the genre of Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds but features a cast of geniuses working on a laser, with one of the professors and his minions being the opposition.<br><br>It is in my top 10 films of all time list.<br><br>The humorous dialog goes on between ALL the characters but Val Kilmer has center stage even though the story seems to be about Mitch, the new 15 year old, premature college geek.<br><br>It is a magical movie that can truly lift your spirits if you are depressed. You can watch it over and over again because its power is not so much in the story but in the superb and genuinely captivating interaction between Val Kilmer and the rest of the cast.","user":"wally-70","rank":[31,33]},{"title":"Terrific nostalgia trip down 80s memory lane - loved it!","rating":9,"date":"13 November 2005","review":"Had very fond memories of this film as a kid in the 80s. Still holds up even today. DVD widescreen format shows off how well directed this movie is. Val Kilmer is terrific as the genius slacker hero. The whole cast gel well together, and the dialogue is very sharp and well-written (reminded me of TV show Scrubs in places). Had me laughing out loud in many places - rare for a modern version like American Pie. Lots of tasty 80s musical montages scattered throughout. Something really likable and positive about this movie, leaves you feeling really good at the end. Highly recommended - really hasn't dated at all. An enjoyable trip down 80s memory lane!","user":"heisenberg83","rank":[39,44]}]
