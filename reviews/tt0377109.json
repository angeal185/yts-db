[{"title":"The Ring 2 Made Me Swear At My TV","rating":1,"date":"3 September 2005","review":"The one sentence review of this movie is that it sucks. Pretty straight up. But no one likes the criticism \"sucks.\" They want reasons. Allow me.<br><br>CGI deer. A whole whack of them. A whole whack of unexplained CGI deer. One wonders if they couldn't find horses to continue the story from the first movie so they figured fake deer was the way to go for part 2. And just to try to make it seem like it wasn't 100% lame and irrelevant they toss in antlers at the Morgan homestead. Oh, well then, it all makes sense now. Or not.<br><br>Did anyone even listen to what Samara's birth mother said? She tried to kill her baby cuz the kid told her to in her head. Just like Rachel's son told her to in her head. To get rid of the thing inside her. So the \"thing\" in Aiden isn't even Samara, it's just some damn nameless thing the writer's never explain beyond a casual line about some watery world beyond that possessed Samara as a baby. OK....whatever...<br><br>Samara wants a mommy. You know what I want? Some friggin Vicodine to slip me into a drug induced coma so I can wipe the memory of that lame as lame plot contrivance out of my head. But wait, it gets worse... she wants to watch TV with her mom. That's about it.<br><br>Excuse me, I need to go yank some of my hair out.<br><br>This thing from some nether world that can make things happen with the power of its mind gets killed in a well, comes back from the dead through VHS tapes and murders people within 7 days of witnessing said tapes then inexplicably possesses a living boy.....cuz she wants to watch TV with her mom? Who the hell wrote that? What drooling, mittens-pinned-to-his-coat, Scooby-Doo-lunch-box-carrying, lazy-eyed, fat-necked, Lysol-huffing, ice-cream-smeared-on-his-face, laughing at the antics of Uncle Joey on Full House idiot wrote that? That is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen in my life.<br><br>Does she want to kill millions? Does she want to inflict suffering on mankind? Eat the living? Make a race of obedient slaves? Reign in darkness? No, she wants to watch friggin cartoons from the 50's and eat sammiches with ma on the sofa. The mind reels at the absolute idiocy.<br><br>So, to reiterate, this movie sucks. Do yourself a favour and stay away. If you hated the first one, this one will make you wish you were stricken blind by burning embers before you put the DVD in. If you liked the first one, this will make you mourn for a half decent story and a film that doesn't induce bile production. And if you saw this one and liked it we clearly can't be friends. I'm sorry, I'm sure you're a nice person though.","user":"fortey","rank":[73,89]},{"title":"Did Anyone who made this POS see the original movie???","rating":1,"date":"23 March 2005","review":"Did no one who made this mess ever see the first Ring movie? I mean, how many years was Samara at the bottom of that \"SEALED\" well and she seemed to have no problem getting out and about when she felt like it. Having Rachel thinking at the end of the movie that the only way to stop Samara is to seal the well...wasn't she the one in the first one who un sealed it? Why would sealing it now stop her? And when did Samara ever have a problem finding someone she was looking for? The kids in the first movie watched the tape at the cabin and then went back to their homes and I doubt that they left a forwarding address for Samara to find them. When in The Ring 2, Samara grabs Rachel's arm and says \"I found you.\" Please...did Samara loose her Map Quest? I could go on and on with the HOLES in this POS movie....I was a big fan of the first Ring and also the original RINGU, but this was just TRASH! This movie was not creepy or scarry at all...but just down right CRAP! I thought if they did this right the studio may have a nice franchise on their hands like a Jason, Freddy or Michael Myers...but did they ever blow it. Sure it made 36 million the first week...but I bet it will fall so fast you will hear the studio heads spinning.","user":"Poohbair67","rank":[53,75]},{"title":"Ridiculously Ridiculous...","rating":1,"date":"4 October 2006","review":"The story goes like this:<br><br>An evil spirit presumably from hell possessed a baby called Samara. Despite she was only months old she had managed to transpire her Mom to kill her so as to save her from being possessed.<br><br>Failing this, the Mom was institutionalized and the baby grew up. She was adopted but despite all her supernatural powers she had allowed her step mom to drown her in a well.<br><br>She is now a ghost, or whatever. She made a funny tape, and whoever saw it will receive a phone call stating they will die within 7 days. From experience, mankind know if they pass the tape onto others the curse will be passed onto them too. Otherwise, Samara will climb out from their TV sets and scare them to hell.<br><br>At times and just for fun she drove crazy some deers and sometimes horses.<br><br>Occasionally, Samara did some direct killings bypassing all these \"red tapes\", example, Max and Dr. temple.<br><br>But the police didn't even bother chasing up Temple's death at Aidan's house probably because mysterious death was no news in those days.<br><br>Now Samara wanted to return to life through Aidan, because she fancied watching cartoons with a beautiful Mom.<br><br>Despite all her powers, Samara still got tricked by Aidan and Rachel and she got out of Aidan's body. She could have easily got in again but she had chosen to drag Rachel into her well.<br><br>Unfortunately Samara hadn't practiced well-climbing lately because she has been busily climbing in and out of TV sets, otherwise she could have stopped Rachel from closing the well entrance. After all this shouldn't bother Samara who could get through walls, doors and TV sets.<br><br>Having solved all the problems, Rachel was so relieved that she decided to commit suicide. She jumped over the cliff, but found herself suddenly in bed with Aidan, who actually looks creepier than Samara.<br><br>Dear viewers, if you are still with me at this moment you are quite qualified to see this ridiculously ridiculous movie!","user":"dcheng-7","rank":[23,30]}]
