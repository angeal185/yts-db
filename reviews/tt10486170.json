Numbnuts had to put an ad in the paper for 2 hot babes he wanted to plow, build a lousy flick around them at a cost of $5,000, take MONTHS filming it while plowing them doggie style between takes, then releasing it on YouRube (or Sci-Fi channel) claiming \"Theaters won't show it, sorry babe but thanks for the BJ's and BLT's the last 4 months\".<br><br>Hmm, maybe I should place such an ad! We do have lots of greedy airheads in this country, waiting to suck something in exchange for the self-delusion of stardom.","user":"asus-kybd","rank":[16,26]},{"title":"Beyond bad!
