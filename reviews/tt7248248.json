[{"title":"Some people aren't getting it","rating":8,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"This was a fun movie and the acting was great. Yes, there was some weird unnecessary attachment to pulp fiction (25 years later!) but I'm pretty sure that was intentional. I can tell Roger Avary was almost doing an homage to Pulp Fiction and it didn't weaken the film for me. Crispin Glover was awesome, the actor that played Red was solid, the female lead was great too. The over-the-top bits were perfectly executed, finding the balance between absurd and comical while keeping the story flowing. I didn't know what to expect going into this, but I left the theatre wanting to see it again. It packed a lot of action and great acting into a film that was probably 10 mil budget (low in this day and age.)","user":"dtnmusic","rank":[27,39]},{"title":"Quite a fun crime comedy","rating":15,"date":"15 December 2019","review":"I think this is quite a fun crime comedy. There's blood, action, love and jokes. The French madman is a memorable character, while the art by the wife quite resembles what I think of the modern art world. I enjoyed watching this film.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Pulp Fiction Style...","rating":7,"date":"13 October 2019","review":"Very enjoyable movie. Crispin Glover played the perfect crazy killer looking for revenge.","user":"antique-modern","rank":[18,25]}]
