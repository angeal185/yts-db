[{"title":"Minor Chabrol Inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet","rating":5,"date":"5 February 2018","review":"After the death of his father, the weirdo Yvan Lesurf (André Jocelyn) believes his mother Claudia Lesurf (Alida Valli) and his uncle Adrien Lesurf (Claude Cerval) have poisoned him since they got married to each other. Completely disturbed and insane, the cruel Yvan decides to make a film based on Shakespeare's Hamlet to expose the wealthy Claudia and Adrien to their friends in their community. He also calls his sweetheart Lucie (Juliette Mayniel) Ophélia in a tragedy foretold. <br><br>\"Ophélia\" is a minor film by Claude Chabrol inspired by Shakespeare's Hamlet. The plot is weird, with subplots that go nowhere such as the factory strike, and not well developed. There are also strange characters, such as the mentally handicapped security guard and the joyful gravedigger. My vote is five.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Ophélia\"","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Ophélia","rating":6,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"Ophelia is not one of the best Chabrol films but its still entertaining; It has some of the charisma of the early nouvelle vague films such as breathless and 400 blows but lacks the personality of those as the characters in Ophelia , especially the lead are shallow and sometimes redundant.\nI just wish Chabrol didn't forget about the whole strike subplot, i think it would've been interesting to see the relationship between Ivan, Adrien and the workers.","user":"RaulFerreiraZem","rank":[2,2]}]
