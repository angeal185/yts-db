[{"title":"Cheesy but I love it","rating":8,"date":"9 January 2020","review":"A portion is poorly acted although still funny and heartwarming in many aspects. I always found it odd how it has multiple F bombs for a PG-13 film they kinda broke the rules with that. I enjoy anything with Tom Arnold in it he's awesome and Hugh Grant is decent to top it off even better Chris Columbus is a legendary director! Despite so much negativity Nine Months is great in my opinion!","user":"UniqueParticle","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Romantic Comedy","rating":7,"date":"28 March 2006","review":"I saw this film was on TV last night, and decided to check it out on IMDb. After reading the numerous negative comments, I was pretty skeptical and didn't really make an effort to get to the TV in time for it starting. What a mistake that was. My word, this was one funny film! Perhaps it's an acquired sense of humour, but in some parts I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt! It's certainly not a film that requires thought or is deep and meaningful in any way, but if you want a giggle, then Nine Months will definitely put a smile on your face. It did mine! The only downside is perhaps having such high profile stars in not very challenging roles. Aside from this, Nine Months is a light hearted comedy that really got me laughing.","user":"xkatie_pearsonx","rank":[33,45]},{"title":"Has its Moments, Has its FLAWS","rating":6,"date":"6 December 2007","review":"'Nine Months' is another typical romantic comedy. It has its funny moments. It has its unfunny moments (especially the toilet humour). While, in my opinion, the film could have been a great comedy, some of the humour is just flat and forced into the screenplay. Generally speaking, it's not a bad film.<br><br>Chris Columbus's direction isn't exactly bad as he does manage to make 'Nine Months' a feel-good film. Hugh Grant doesn't seem like the ideal choice for the role. I just didn't find him convincing enough, even though he's known for his rom-com movies. Julianne Moore is a delight to watch even though her role is less comedic and challenging. Joan Cusack is hilarious. Tom Arnold is quite annoying but sometimes he's okay. Jeff Goldblum is adequate in a supporting role. Robin Williams's character seems forced.<br><br>While things are a little light and slow in the beginning, it's in the last half hour that the writer puts a little too many comedy, most of it falling flat on its 'face'. With a cast like this, one would have expected better. I'd still say it's far more enjoyable than the likes of 'Runaway Bride' and 'Pretty Woman'.","user":"Chrysanthepop","rank":[24,33]}]
