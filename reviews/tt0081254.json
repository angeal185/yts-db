[{"title":"worthy","rating":9,"date":"6 January 2019","review":"It's a bit hard to watch alongside the whole 261 minutes at the same time. I watched it in two steps and i think it was the most complex movie i have ever seen. First of all the story is unique (owing to Weöres Sándor), the characters are perfectly matches with the actresses and all of these has an experimental, artfully visual world. In this movie there are actors who are one of the most magnificent artists of the age, just like Erdély Miklós or Hajas Tibor. I think Bódy Gábor is not only a good director, but a real artist, too.","user":"borbelyadel","rank":[3,4]}]
