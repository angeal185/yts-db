[{"title":"Polar","rating":7,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"The only exceptional thing about this film is Mads Mikkelsen, who is always worth watching. Otherwise, the film is mediocre, predictable, schmaltzy in parts, your typical beat-em-up shoot-em-up extravaganza, complete w/closeups of wounds and dead people. Too much money was spent for a mediocre movie. Surely Mikkelsen doesn't need the money this much, does he? He can afford to be more discriminating.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[41,42]},{"title":"Has no one seen a comic book film before?","rating":10,"date":"27 January 2019","review":"I very rarely write reviews, but seeing the initial reviews here I couldn't not say anything.<br><br>Yes, it's silly. Yes, it's over the top. Yes, there's a lot of gore. It's a movie based on a comic book!<br><br>I, for one, absolutely adored all of the silliness, ridiculous fight scenes, blood splatters and gruesome moments.<br><br>One of the best Netflix originals I've seen for a while!","user":"MrandMrsWorley","rank":[574,716]},{"title":"Action & Brutality","rating":7,"date":"27 January 2019","review":"First of all, the film shouldn't be a movie you'll definitely take seriously. Please leave your brain if you decide to watch this movie. Because this film is a crunchy film that focuses entirely on the action and the charm of ferocity. So there is no deeper meaning nor a deep scenario.<br><br>The visuals are great, the color palette is so good that even the nature looks modern. It looks like an Instagram filter has been applied to a picture taken with a proper camera. The girls are beautiful, the main character is charismatic, the bad character is a fat asshole. There are plenty of clich√©s. You can predict what's going to happen. Predicting what will happen is a problem in such films because it eliminates the thriller factor.<br><br>You don't have to pay much attention to, it's a fun movie. If you love action you can watch. 7/10","user":"ahmetkozan","rank":[371,459]}]
