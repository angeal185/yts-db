[{"title":"This one goes down smooth","rating":9,"date":"26 August 2006","review":"Many critics are heavily scolding this movie as a stupid, drunken frat-boy romp filled to the brim with crude humor and bad taste. I'd tend to agree with them, aside from this one addition -- it's absolutely hilarious.<br><br>From the truly side-splitting opening scene with Grand-papa to the final confrontation before the credits roll, you'll be entertained. The acting and gags are right on the mark for the admittedly low-brow appeal that this movie is shooting for. In that regard, it's no surprise that BeerFest won't get any Oscar nods. But to those of us who appreciate the suds and debauchery of five cartoonish characters embroiled in \"a super secret international beer drinking contest to take on the Germans for national pride\", this is an instant classic.<br><br>To be fair, BeerFest utilizes a much feebler narrative than some of it's gross-out contemporaries, such as Van Wilder, but definitely has a much stronger vision than something like Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle. Within this genre, the latter is a fine movie as well -- BeerFest simply stays on track a little better, instead of being a slapdash montage of funny scenes. That said, BeerFest really triumphs by giving us characters so lampoon, you are able to sit back and enjoy two hours of gaseous gaffs without too much mental investment. And that's a good thing every now and then, right? If not, I feel very sad for your sedate, austere funny-bone.<br><br>For the rest of us, a toast. Raise your mugs for BeerFest, the drunken orgy of comedy that will keep you laughing!","user":"exmortis-2","rank":[138,176]},{"title":"I just don't understand...","rating":9,"date":"26 August 2006","review":"Let me start by saying that I loved Super Troopers. Club Dread on the other hand was not one of my favorites. So i was hoping that this would be better than Club Dread but I did not think it could even compare to Super Troopers. But was i wrong. This movie was absolutely hilarious.<br><br>I just don't understand why people are giving it terrible reviews. It was the funniest movie I have seen in theatres in a long time(as well as Clerks II). I understand the lack of plot but who says lets go see Beerfest, it will probably be a great epic? I went to see people drink beer, get wasted and do stupid things and thats exactly what I got.<br><br>I laughed from the beginning to the end of the movie, there was not a dull moment in the whole thing. And when the American team was competing against the other countries, I was cheering as if i was watching a real professional sport.<br><br>So, if you are looking for a good laugh and an all around good time go see Beerfest you will not be disappointed.","user":"Pigman44","rank":[195,268]},{"title":"fun, with quite a few laughs","rating":7,"date":"26 August 2006","review":"Its not brilliant and it doesn't try to be. If you go into this movie knowing you are watching a movie called beerfest, you should have a good time. A lot of jokes flying fast and does not take itself seriously, which is a good thing sometimes. I mean, there was a lot of hyped movies this summer that really let down and took themselves too seriously, so sometimes its great to get a movie that knows it's dumb and revels in it. Lots of gratuitous nudity, cursing, and stupidity make this one a lot of fun. It may not have the great jokes like super troopers did, but it's just as funny. Perfect type of movie when you just need to let go for a couple hours. So, if you like broken lizard, watch this movie. If you don't, stop watching their movies and complaining that they're not funny. I give it a 7 just cause it took my mind off reality for a while and I laughed quite a bit.","user":"sackjigler","rank":[41,63]}]
