[{"title":"Amateur hour + fake reviews = don't bother","rating":3,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"Actor, producer, writer and director Jerry G. Angelo wore all these hats, as one would in a high school drama class to create a project that's been done many times before, and thus also over-cliched. The directing is the only fairly decent quality of this film, and even that felt amateurish. The acting is sub-par, even for c-list actors, probably from the lack of directing the cast effectively. None of the cast were convincing, and they all seemed to struggle in the acting department. The screenplay was all over the place and the slow dragged-out pacing made the 105 mins feel like 3 hours. The sound was way off and distant, no boom mics? The score was too evident and annoying. A huge pass on this one, and ignore all the fake reviews. It's a very generous 3/10 from me","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[60,67]},{"title":"Don't believe the positive reviews","rating":1,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"Nonsensical rubbish, rotten acting and actors that simply don't fit in many of the scenes. It simply is unconvincing. Sad to say, this movie's current 8.7 rating appears to be yet another colossal up-vote by cast, crew and all their extended families.","user":"Netjer-y-khet","rank":[75,88]},{"title":"yet another colossal up-vote by cast and crew","rating":1,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"\"current 8.5 rating appears to be yet another colossal up-vote by cast, crew and all their extended families.\" I Agree.","user":"omidebran","rank":[59,74]}]
