[{"title":"Great movie from a guy's perspective","rating":28,"date":"28 July 2001","review":"Flashdance is one of my Top Ten Films.  I don't care that it has no twisting plot.  I don't care that Jennifer Beals used a body double.  I REALLY don't care that it's a chick flick.  I love this movie!! Some people, after seeing Flashdance, choose to see a movie about exotic dancing.  For one reason or another, I see a movie about chasing dreams, taking chances, and maximizing life.  <br><br>Jennifer Beals' character Alex Owens's dream of attending a formal dance school and becoming a ballerina is the central theme of the film.  Her friends Jeanie and Richie are aspiring figure skaters and stand-up comedians, respectively.  However, Alex is the only dreamer receiving any encouragement.  Her senior citizen friend Hannah, a former ballerina herself, gives Alex practical advice and unconditional faith.  Jeanie's father openly criticizes Jeanie's dream as well as her beau, Richie. Richie, a cook at Mawby's Bar, is put down by his boss for wanting to go to Hollywood and being a comedian; \"You're too short.  They don't let short people into Hollywood.\"<br><br>The sub-plots facilitate Alex's dream to create a captivating story.  To support herself (and possibly, to keep life interesting), Alex holds 2 jobs: a welder by day and a dancer at aforementioned Mawby's Bar during the night. Her welding boss Nick takes a liking to her and pursues her.  Alex resists his charms but gives in eventually.  Johnny C., the sleazy strip bar owner continually tries to lure Alex into dancing for him.  As mentioned before, Alex's friends Jeanie and Richie have dreams of their own, and we see where their dreams take them.  <br><br>The factor that made Flashdance a hit was the music, of course.  \"What a Feeling\" took away an Oscar for Best Song.  \"I'll Be Here Where the Heart Is\", sung by Kim Carnes (\"Bette Davis Eyes\") fits Alex's personal-crisis scene perfectly. <br><br>The first time I watched Flashdance was 4 years ago; I bought the video knowing I'd like it.  After 20+ viewings, I still love it.  Flashdance is for anyone who has a dream but not the courage to pursue it.","user":"dek1158","rank":[40,43]},{"title":"Amazing Soundtrack of 80's","rating":7,"date":"4 May 2016","review":"What makes a good film for me is that it is enjoyable, entertaining, gripping, likable and emotional. Flashdance without a doubt ticks all these five boxes. Flahdance is a very retro, cheesy entertaining film that is at no point boring and never drags, and is also a very clear symbol of the great 1980's and the night club exotic dancing scene of the time. Jennifer Beals puts down an amazing performance, as a dancer and as an actress. I guess the story comes down to the fact that reality bites, that life is tough, but if you push hard you just might make it.<br><br>All in all, Flashdance despite its few undeniable faults is a very decent and enjoyable film in my opinion. As it mostly meets all of my requirements I am happy to give it a positive review. This film is one of the quintessential 80's films, that works well as a symbolic artifact of its time. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves 80's.<br><br>Overall rating: 7 out of 10.","user":"PredragReviews","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"A surprisingly charming film!","rating":17,"date":"17 October 2002","review":"So here's this movie \"Flashdance\" which has been staring me in the face for years, both in pop culture for over half of my life and on the video rental store shelves, and yet I've never gotten around to checking it out until now.<br><br>I was fifteen when this movie was first out and popular. I heard the soundtrack, of course, and loved it to pieces... but I had never been able to watch the movie because it was rated R.<br><br>I had grown up having it be, in an odd sort of way, both a part of my life and at the same time *not* a part of my life. I was familiar with its music, images, and even its basic plot outline, but had never seen the movie.<br><br>And as an adult, I felt extremely dubious about checking it out. Over the years, I had heard that people either loved it to pieces or hated it. I've heard critics both call it uplifting and fun while others called it nothing more than a string of glittering little music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot (a creation device for a LOT of MTV-era movies such as \"Top Gun\", \"Footloose\" and \"Purple Rain\").<br><br>To add to my confusion about whether or not I should give it a try, I had had the same experience with \"Saturday Night Fever\": I grew up loving the soundtrack to pieces but having never seen the movie... and when I finally did I felt utter disappointment at first, discovering the film to be far darker than expected. Oh sure, I later liked \"Fever\" okay (actually, I should use the term \"appreciated\") but still preferred the gorgeous soundtrack to the actual film that was the basis for its existance.<br><br>Would I have the same experience with \"Flashdance\"?<br><br>Tonight, I finally decided to, as one character in the film puts it, \"hold my breath and take the plunge\".<br><br>As it turns out, I found it to be a surprisingly charming, entertaining and uplifting film. I was fearing it to be something raunchy, but at it turns out it has a very special, starry-eyed sweet innocence that is difficult to define.<br><br>The performance of the equally starry-eyed and innocent Jennifer Beals helps, of course. She brings a wide-eyed sparkle and hopefulness to her role, plus a determination to keep her life on the right track precisely as she feels it ought to go without any major morality screwups, and this adds a wonderful flavour of hope and childlike wonder to her character Alex that just simply grows on you.<br><br>Now, it IS true that there are a few flaws here and there, and a couple of editing flaws as well. Plus, the other characters aren't really as developed as hers (but they are developed just enough to demonstrate to her personally the various dos and don'ts regarding attitudes to have while pursuing a dream, voices for her to observe and learn from representing both directions). But none of that matters because the film has a charm all its own. Looking at it today, I can easily see why so many out there loved it: its a beautiful and very encouraging little film. It has a heroine whom anybody could relate with and like; it has wonderful music in it; it has a delicate and lighthearted touch to it which, language and a couple of scenes aside (such as the film's most heartbreaking scene in which Alex saves a desperate friend from throwing life away in a strip joint (a sequence which only lasts about two minutes long--but it's sad and disturbing, not \"Oooh, let's put this in to grab male members of the audience!\"--which is most likely the only ingredient to earn the film its R rating)), is nevertheless still so pure and true that it could have come straight out of a '70s-made Walt Disney Productions movie (!!!); it's touching and moving... and, of course, it has dance sequences which are fun to watch.<br><br>In other words, it was a comforting and uplifting movie released during a time when people, youngsters with career goals in particular, needed one. And if anything, folks still need movies like that out today. It's a happy little film with a happy ending which isn't overdone or unconvincing, and precisely the sort of flick which should be perscribed to those suffering severe depression. Heaven knows that I myself certainly felt encouraged about my own career and life in particular after watching it!<br><br>It might not be for everybody, but if the above description I've written voices the sort of movie you personally enjoy then do yourself a big favour and give it a try. Chances are that if you are as naturally starry-eyed and hopeful as Alex is--and believe me, *I* certainly am--then you will easily relate to this delightful little fable.","user":"San Franciscan","rank":[94,128]}]
