[{"title":"The best sequel my favorite Amy Steel is the best heroine of the 80's ever","rating":10,"date":"24 September 2017","review":"In my opinion this sequel is my favorite Friday the 13th film it is It is one of my personal favorite horror movie because of Amy Steel! I am a big fan of the actress and I love her to death in Friday the 13th Part 2. This movie is my number 4 favorite slasher Friday the 13th film in the series and I love Amy Steel so damn much as Ginny Field! She was the best heroine in the slasher films in my opinion. I love this film to death and I enjoy it and love it the same as the first one I love the atmosphere in the film. It has the best kills in the series. Characters are fairly well-developed and likable, at least for this franchise, and there are plenty of thrills. One of the most memorable final shocks rounds everything out.<br><br>It is Jason Voorhees first outing as the murderer and the image of him wearing the potato sack over his head is burned into my retinas as one of the most memorable in the franchise.<br><br>Amy Steel is a brilliant addition to the cast, a great heroine I love her to death in \"Friday The 13th part 2\" and I also love her in April Fool's Day she was excellent in those two films. She is always my favorite lead and I really enjoy Friday the 13th Part 2 more then the first one.<br><br>Friday the 13th Part 2 is a great sequel great horror slasher movie that made Jason Voorhees memorial cool horror icon.<br><br>This time the film was directed and produced by Steve Miner who I thought did an excellent job directing the film. This time for the special makeup effects was Carl Fullerton who did the right job like Tom Savini did with the first one.<br><br>I love how Amy Steel defend her self against Jason Voorhees who was this time played by actor Steve Daskawisz with a potato sack. Amy Steel used chain saw on Jason that scene was copied by Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning and was also used and copied in Maniac Cop 2 I just didn't like it. Watch the climatic fight between Jason and Ginny in which Ginny imitates Jason's mom Pamela (Betsy Palmer) and then she swings with a machete towards Jason and Jason raises the mattock to block Ginny's machete swing this was an epic Climatic fight in the movie.<br><br>Ginny Field with working tool fork in the hands is just memorial all over Amy Steel's picture we see her on IMDb and every where.<br><br>Mrs. Voorhees is dead, and Camp Crystal Lake is shut down, but a camp next to the infamous place is stalked by an unknown assailant.<br><br>Adrienne King and Walt Gorney did return that was a surprise for me and the were the first characters to die in the beginning of the film.<br><br>Adrienne King wanted to reprise her role as Alice, but she said that she wanted to be on screen for a short period of time because there was an obsessive fan who was stalking her, broke into her apartment, and she feared for her life. So I respect the actress and her decision since this film she never return on TV screen but she lend her voice to animation movies. Adrienne King filmed all of her scenes in two days then she run faster as she could.<br><br>Amy Steel has stated that she found shooting the \"window scene\" difficult. The shot required three takes and her frightened reaction is genuine. Because the shot was in slow-motion, a high-speed camera was used, and every time she heard the film start running, she would tense up and get scared. Amy was very upset with the director for the window scene and it was really annoyed cause director keep shouting they have to repeat the scenes.<br><br>Great horror slasher suspense entertaining 80's movie my all time favorite horror film I still going to watch it. I watched this film 7 years ago when I was a big fan of Supernatural and I heard Jared Padalecki auditioned for his lead role in Friday the 13th reboot and I was curious so I went watching this film alongside with the first original film and Jason X before I watched reboot that was my fourth film I saw.<br><br>I remember seeing this movie on DVD in the video store when I was in high school. I wasn't interesting seen it that time but today I am glad I have this film on Blu-ray, just got it this Thursday all 11th films and I watch it in Friday 22th this is the 3d time in the row I saw this film and i still will.<br><br>This is one in my top 5 favorite Friday the 13th films it is my number four favorite slasher Friday the 13th movie and it is the best one. The movie it self's get's my Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval 10/10 Amy Steel is the queen of screamers and she is way better then Jamie Lee Curtis in my opinion.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[97,111]},{"title":"Whoa! A good sequel!!","rating":6,"date":"5 April 2003","review":"I say that, of course, in reference to the expected quality of a movie like this. In general, horror series like the seemingly endless Friday the 13th series are composed of one hugely successful original film (generally, by today's standards, inexplicably so, despite the abysmal standards of today) followed by a lot of stomach-turningly awful sequels that try in vain to recapture the success of the original film. The first sequel in the Friday the 13th series, however, seems to escape that trend, although it never manages to be much better than the original, which wasn't that great in the first place. But at the very least, even the Austin Powers series went more precipitously downhill than Friday the 13th.<br><br>The movie takes place several years after the original ended, and since Mrs. Voorhees was the real killer in the original (which we all know because we've all seen Scream) and was beheaded at the end, we now have to have a real killer. The thing that helps this movie escape the treacherous realms of the sophomore effort is that it presents the story so well. Jason has lived in the woods since his mother was killed (a horrifying event which the young Jason witnessed), not interacting with a human being in any way in all those years. In order to seek revenge for his mother's murder, he has been savagely stalking and murdering anyone who comes close to his area of the lake.<br><br>Not exactly the most intricate storyline, but at least it's not some mindless killer running around killing any teenager daring enough to get involved in any kind of sexual behavior (an extremely popular motive in cheesy horror movies). In this case, promiscuity is punished because Jason supposedly drowned because the counselors who were supposed to be watching him were making out when he was screaming for help.<br><br>There is a cheesy fireside scene where one character explains this whole thing to all of the teens who are out there training to be counselors, which obviously ends with one person in disguise jumping out of the bushes screaming and scaring the hell out of everyone around the fire. The movie then jumps into auto-pilot for most of the film, becoming your typical slasher movie, but at least they took the time to explain why all these killings were happening, right?<br><br>This makes me wonder, however, why they would cover Jason's face with a cheap piece of bedsheet with a little hole torn in it for one of his eyes. They've seen Halloween! They know the effectiveness of an expressionless mask, so why not be a little more creative here? The only reason I can think of is that Jason lives in the woods and doesn't exactly have access to things like the costume store where Michael Meyers got his mask, but he did have access to axes and machetes and candles and whatnot. Surely in all those years he could have come up with something at the very least a little more comfortable to wear or easier to see through.<br><br>At the very end of the film, by the way, we are treated to a close up and slow motion look at Jason's real face (something that we never get to see of Michael Meyers, although we almost do in one of the films), as he leaps through a window to grab the last girl left alive. And what a face! No wonder nobody wants to play with him!<br><br>As far as the killings themselves, Friday the 13th Part 2 fits in with most other 80s slasher films, which are little more than exercises in coming up with new and interesting ways to kill people, because we already know the formula from countless slasher films made before. In this case, there are certainly some creative murders, and the film even confused me with feelings of sympathy for Jason near the end, particularly when he is holding his arms up trying to get away from the chainsaw.<br><br>The poor guy! Someone killed his mom for avenging his death, and he's lived in the woods alone his whole life! He's the victim here! Okay, I wouldn't go that far, but I definitely felt badly for the poor guy when he fell off the chair and then almost got chainsawed. But luckily he's soon back on his feet (even after almost being cut completely in half with a weak swing of a machete) goring people with big scary knives and reminding us of the dangers of messing with him. Or, as it were, being anywhere near Camp Crystal Lake.<br><br>This is also, by the way, the last time that any sympathy can be felt for anyone dumb enough to go up to the lake. The rest of the sequels are filled with people who deserve to die anyway for being so dumb. Well, at least his mask improves from this point on.","user":"Anonymous_Maxine","rank":[30,33]},{"title":"Arguably the best of all nine sequels.","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2002","review":"So many refer to this as the debut of Jason Voorhees. It wasn't...simply the debut of him killing people. He left that to his mom in part one! Steve Miner didn't mess around too much with Sean Cunninham's successful formula simply adding some quite inventive kills and bloodletting.<br><br>No-one could be accused of using method-acting here, truth is its all pretty embarrassing. The high-school script though probably isn't that much out of place - they are schoolkids after all.<br><br>Jason himself, though still slightly diminished of stature is one creepy little dude, still without his hockey mask but wearing a burlap sack with holes cut out for his eyes. What appears to be his demise is of course anything but...as parts 3 to 10 will attest. The final 15 minutes are quite tension-filled and better than anything in the original.<br><br>A must-see for devotees of the series.","user":"uds3","rank":[41,55]}]
