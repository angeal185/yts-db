[{"title":"A waste of time","rating":1,"date":"9 June 2019","review":"Worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was HORRIBLE, the plot was stupid and ridiculously unrealistic, the jokes (if you can call them that) weren't funny. I think I laughed 2 times the entire movie and it was simply because it was a \"Wait, what?!!?\" moment because somone said something so dumb it was actual comical. You could seriously make a drinking game out of how many times the characters said \"he dead\" or \"my daddy died\". I'm so glad this is the last of the Madea movies.","user":"c-rturner","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Horrible, we walked out and got our money back","rating":1,"date":"30 March 2019","review":"It was extremely low budget, the comedy was worse than dry. It was was horrible. The characters forced their lines. I felt like it was a movie that could've been filmed in the 80's. If you are a die hard fan, enjoy! In my 49 years it's only the second movie I couldn't endure.","user":"brionesmark","rank":[33,44]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"10 June 2019","review":"There was nothing funny about this movie unless the racial police exploit is funny, multiple unfaithfulness within a family and not being able to understand a lot of the dialogue is funny. If it is, label me old, senile, grouchy or just plain disgusted with this movie. Sad disappointment!","user":"kimbok-62793","rank":[9,10]}]
