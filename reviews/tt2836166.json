[{"title":"Worst Film I Have Seen This Year","rating":1,"date":"6 April 2016","review":"First off let me start by saying that this holds no candle to the first one. This film is probably the worst film I have seen this year. I don't know which was more terrible, the soundtrack, the bad acting or the terrible costumes. The wigs alone looked old and cheap. This is NOT a punk movie. The acting is so bad, just as bad as Michael Goorjian's fake mohawk (which you can clearly see the line of across his forehead. BTW Bob's mohawk was never that long in the original movie, something they must have overlooked, but die hard fans of the first would never overlook. Bob did not even sound like Bob anymore. His voice was not edgy as the Bob in the original. Big fail on Michael's part. They call that a punk soundtrack? Really? It sounded like mainstream bullsht to me. When did 'punk' become mainstream? There are so many fails in this movie that I could go on for hours about, but I won't. <br><br>In my opinion, this movie should have never been made. It was horrible! The plot was horrible, the wigs were horrible, Bob was horrible, and it was a cheese fest. Avoid this movie! It is a waste of time, money, and I cannot believe they did this to what could have been something really good. I would give it zero stars if I could. Everyone in this film looked and acted like posers! No Steve-o, no film. BIG FAIL!","user":"nunobettencourtfan","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"If punks dead this killed it.","rating":4,"date":"3 March 2016","review":"I wanted to like it. For gods sake I have heroin bob tattooed on me. the shallow time of a hour and fifteen made me nervous from the start I know this movie didn't have a budget like the last one but if Kevin smith can make clerks I'm pretty sure James could have rubbed a little bit of a better especially with the time he took to make this too. It felt overly rushed I almost can't describe it. The characters were barely there. The whole plot of the movie takes place because of a event described for a few minutes. bobs skull cap was horrendous especially in the opening sequence. Little things for the time period were off (again low budget not necessarily in his control) but this is supposedly the early 2000s then why are they using 2010+ cell phones that's just poor direction. Also the fact of no mention whatsoever of Steveo seemed weird. Shawn drew it together and was the only character and maybe Trish that I enjoyed seeing again very well written stories for those two. In the end it tried too hard to capture on slc punk and grow and yet start something new with Ross and his two friends if it had more time to develop it would have been better. If your a die-hard SLC punk fan see it once to see some old faces again then forget about it.","user":"Smooperpooper","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"I was glad when it was over.","rating":1,"date":"26 October 2016","review":"I was glad when it was over.<br><br>I wonder why anyone would make such a listless movie.<br><br>The characters each seem indulgent yet none are developed to the point where they provide any interest.<br><br>The usefulness of a car ride as a sort of journey device is marginalized by the redundant and boring settings.<br><br>The production value is mix and match mediocre.<br><br>The narrator's bad acting is creepier than the creepiness of employing a dead narrator character.<br><br>The climax of the story is not even anti climatic, but at least you know the end is near.","user":"sdvmynyrzfpc","rank":[5,7]}]
