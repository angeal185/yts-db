[{"title":"One of the better Iraq films","rating":9,"date":"6 February 2020","review":"I have always been a bit confused that this film was thought of mere jingoistic propaganda by a certain segment of the left. I understand how that impression could come about because of the ending/credits. The ending is the weakest aspect of the film and much more should have been made of how Kyle died and the credits are pretty overtly chest thumping. The final few minutes greatly simplified the overall film and the principle reason why I can't fully recommend this film. However, everything that occurred before that is pretty darn interesting in how Eastwood and his writer are trying to reconcile competing tensions.<br><br>There is a troubling ambiguity at the heart of the film about what the film itself thinks of Kyle's military service. He is shown to be reactive and to be blunt not very self-reflective. He ends up joining the military in response to the embassy bombings in 1998. The decision comes across less because of a sense of patriotic duty than because of personal issues he was having on the very night the bombing occurred. In any case it is not a deeply felt ground project of Kyle's. Or how the film's central battle is ultimately \"won\" by Kyle only to have this Pyrrhic victory places his unit in greater danger. The film repeatedly shows the US's actions creating more insurgents. There's even a sarcastic invoking of Bush's \"mission accomplished\" in the film. The domestic scenes-especially in the car dealership-show a man deeply damaged by his experiences and he is largely unable to process it. The film is deeply paradoxical in the way it tries to square disapproval with the war in Iraq while sympathizes with a down to earth guy having the impulse to protect home and kin.<br><br>I think viewing the film in the larger context of Eastwood's filmography is important. In particular, Unforgiven (in the that essentially peak American genre of Westerns) is a pretty stark condemnation of how violence begets violence. Furthermore, the Eastwood sympathies towards Kyle are pretty much the same sort of sympathy he has had for boots on the ground displayed in Flag of Our Fathers and *critically* Letters from Iwo Jima. The film is fascinating in how it tries to reconcile the various tensions embedded in its narrative.<br><br>The film is technically stellar. (well fake baby aside) Eastwood continues to be one of the best restrained directors working today. There is a rawness to this film that sells the war scenes. Cooper really gives a fully engaging and heartbreaking performance. This is a film that may be too subtle for its own good.","user":"CubsandCulture","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"Good ol'Murican propaganda","rating":1,"date":"20 January 2015","review":"When American Sniper first came out I ignored the film thinking that it was the usual war propaganda Hollywood delivers once a year. <br><br>After it received a couple of Oscar nominations I got a little curious and decided to go watch it. I am a big of Clint Eastwood and appreciate most of his work as a director, I am aware of his right-wing views and as I sat down in the theatre I was expecting a very patriotic story on the war in the Middle East.<br><br>But what I got was 2 hours of pure biased war propaganda. The story is supposed to be about a war hero, but what we get is a ruthless southern who kills \"bad guys\" because he saw some terrorist attacks against his country on TV. Not once are the his intentions questioned by either the character himself or others. The entire film just follows a one-track minded perspective on a \"just\" war. There is no morale to the story, there are no grey areas where the viewer is allowed to have an opinion and decide for himself what is right and what is wrong. <br><br>Now if this was satire, it would have been brilliant. The story of a redneck cowboy who after seeing some footage on TV about terrorist attacks decides he needs to protect his country by enrolling in the Navy and killing 150 people over 5000 miles away from where he lives, and without the slightest hesitation. But unfortunately it was not.<br><br>It is actually quite sad to see how low American cinema has stooped. The fact that people might actually believe this crap (and most Americans do) makes me lose hope for the future of a once great country.<br><br>There was a time when Hollywood war movies raised important questions on the righteousness of war (such as Full Metal Jacket, Thin Red Line, Apocalypse Now) where the viewer was given the clear picture that all war, justified or unjustified, is wrong.<br><br>Nowadays most war movies are just commercials to get the American public behind the idea that invading a foreign country is a God given right.<br><br>The fact that it got nominated for the Academy Award just shows how much a once acclaimed award is quickly becoming a pat on the shoulder to the most politically correct motion picture of the year.","user":"davidec23","rank":[1,2]},{"title":"'American Sniper' is very good","rating":8,"date":"4 February 2020","review":"A beautifully made film regarding a remarkable individual in Chris Kyle. Bradley Cooper plays the lead role tremendously, as Clint Eastwood &amp; Co. set everything else up expertly. One or two, minor, pacing/editing issues aside, 'American Sniper' is very good.","user":"r96sk","rank":[17,22]}]
