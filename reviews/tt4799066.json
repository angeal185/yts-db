[{"title":"Dreams come true at night...","rating":8,"date":"7 June 2018","review":"Midnight Sun, follows teenager Katie Price who has a rare disease called XP which makes her stay out of the sun because being in the sun is fatal and can result in death. She stays looking out into the world from her window and one night meets her dream guy Charlie whom shes been watching since a young age. The film follows her journey through her first love, first parties, and the one life she has. The film is important as it follows a real life disease and also represents a teens curiousness and their eagerness they have to explore the world and how as teens we can feel trapped. Katie is a strong character who sacrifices a lot and goes through so many trials. I recommend you give this a film a try. My thoughts at first was that the film was cheesy and the story was just like the film Everything, Everything. Well news flash for me, the film is nothing like Everything, Everything and the story was good, the acting was good,the music was heartwarming, and had me in tears. I recommend the film no matter what your thoughts are on the film.<br><br>\"I'm really busy during the day, but I can be free at night.\"\n-Katie Price, Midnight Sun","user":"FandomFanatic21","rank":[45,49]},{"title":"Nice sad romance","rating":7,"date":"6 June 2018","review":"Not really a fan of Bella Thorne but she was excellent in this, enjoyed the film very much. some beautifully sad moments. would recommend.
