[{"title":"Boring and in many occasions it's insufferable to watch.","rating":2,"date":"4 October 2019","review":"This is probably the most insufferable movie that i saw this year. I didn't had any expectations before watching it and i didn't even heard about the movie from anyone and after seeing it: it's not surprising that no one mentions it at all.<br><br>The story is very average and there are some moments that are very dumb and predictable; horribly written characters that it's hard to relate to; weak cinematography that doesn't have any appealing, great or memorable camera work; dialogue that was OK at best; the music was average and forgettable; the practical effects look OK, but they are not amazing or fantastic, so that it can make the movie watchable or worth watching; the sound is alright, but it does have some stock sound effects, which were distracting in some moments; very weak acting from the adult actors, but unfortunately it also includes horrible child acting, especially the little girl, who is impossible to take very seriously when she is on screen and gives the worst performance in the entire movie.<br><br>I was trying to find something positive that i can say or give to the movie, but it was impossible. It's a movie that i'll probably never going to watch ever again. So do yourself a favor and just skip it.","user":"Martinito_08183","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"An Ambitous, Both Hit & Miss Creature Feature","rating":5,"date":"30 August 2019","review":"\"Itsy Bitsy\" is a creature feature &amp; a mother/children relationship drama all in one, and, well, there's both ups and downs in it. Now, I don't have arachnophobia, and while the movie didn't make itchy much, it sure did creep out my little sister. Controversial opinion, but it's quite a true stereotype - women and children being afraid of spiders.<br><br>I always start with the things I liked, so here goes: Practical FX! Yes, there's no cgi, you're in for a treat if you like gooey &amp; squishy old-shcool horror effects. Performances are, in my opinon, the next best thing - besides Bruce Davison I didn't know any of the actors &amp; had to check 'em out here on IMDb during the watch, because, honestly, they were pretty good at what they were doing. I surprised myself by concluding that my favorite parts of \"Itsy Bitsy\" were actually the conflicts between the mother and the son or simply the spider-less parts of the story. Not all of them, but some.<br><br>The dissapointments are as follows: It's a much less spider-oriented movie than You probably think, I'd say it's 50/50 that and a relationship drama. Secondly, I thought the intro of the story was pretty wonky &amp; could've been anything else, really. Thirdly, the pacing can get slow at times, eventually making those 90 minutes feel pretty stretched out. Also, while the practical FX are awesome and all, it doesn't get much crazier with the passing runtime, my expectations for the climax were bigger &amp; I suppose Yours might be too.<br><br>\"Bloody Disgusting\" stated that \"Itsy Bitsy\" keeps Arachnophobia alive and well &amp; while it may be so, the summary of it is a pretty average horror flick that shows great effort, but comes out as equal parts awesome and whacky. My rating: 5/10.","user":"TwistedContent","rank":[19,24]},{"title":"More like a family drama than a creature feature","rating":5,"date":"26 September 2019","review":"This was more like a dark family drama with a subplot involving a big ancient spider.","user":"Willzu666","rank":[10,12]}]
