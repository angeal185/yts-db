[{"title":"Silent film with added music track","rating":3,"date":"13 August 2017","review":"In trivia someone has stated this was the first British sound film in colour.This is wrong on both counts.Firstly it is not a sound film.It is a silent with an added music track which includes some songs,not synchronized in any way.Secondly Pathe colour was only stencil colour.Kinema colour was a red green process that was used from well over 100 years ago.I think the first British colour sound film would be Wings Of the Morning.Turning to the film itself it is only 58 minutes long but feels a lot longer.It is terribly dull and I doubt that BIP got much further mileage out of this by reissuing it in this form.The acting style would have been outdated then,and having to read so many inter titles must have put people off going to see it.","user":"malcolmgsw","rank":[0,0]}]
