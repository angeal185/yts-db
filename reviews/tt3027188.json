[{"title":"Typical, typical, typical!","rating":4,"date":"3 September 2014","review":"Not a horrible way to spend 1.20h but it will be pure blood deja-vu. Absolutely nothing new, different, just a tired old formula, same plot, same \"find me\" ghost message and a very slow problem solving.<br><br>Any pros? Well they made the best of its budget, the \"spirit\" was OK overall, the acting was decent, some tension and pretend scare jumps and then the solution. Could I possibly recommend this tho? No way, no point in wasting too much time when you can do a lot better with some indies, so go and throw an eye in that direction. Some actually have better plots or executions: \"It's in the Blood \", \"Deep in the darkness\", or \"Savaged\". These ones are better and you'll get a kick or two. Sure, nothing out of the usual, but still, at least the plot is more complex, it does try a lot more and succeeds. <br><br>So, \"Find me\" could actually be directed towards the viewer, as this little movie does wanna be found and watch, but bare in mind, it does have something in common with The Ring: you see it, you might die! Boredom hits hard with this one!<br><br>Cheers!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"Haunting - in more ways than one","rating":6,"date":"5 September 2014","review":"It's winter in the American Mid West. A young newly married couple, the husband a teacher with a new job at the local school, the wife unemployed, move into their newly purchased first house in the wife's home town. Almost immediately things start to go bump in the night. That suggests a pace the film doesn't have. It's a melancholy, bleak, almost artsy ghost story with shots of empty winter scenery, open skies and dripping icicles. The characters are well played, likable and intelligent, the horror mostly peripheral and special effects sparingly used. There are some genuine unforeseen twists in the plot. It's not a classic of the genre but, considering how bad many films in the genre are, I found it difficult to dislike. Nothing to write home about but, if you don't go in expecting a CGI filled gore fest, it has a bleak charm. 6/10.","user":"nabokov95","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Predictable and generic...","rating":3,"date":"7 September 2014","review":"\"Find Me\" is like a soup boiled on a bone that has already lost all flavor. And by that I mean, that the movie takes a concept that has already been used beyond the point of reasonable usage and then brings nothing new to the genre at all.<br><br>The story is about a young couple, Tim (played by Cameron Bender) and Emily (played by Kathryn Lyn) who have come to buy a house at a really low bargain price. As luck would have it, the house is in Emily's old childhood neighborhood. Gradually things start to happen in the house, and they couple come to realize that they are not alone in their new home.<br><br>Right, well story-wise, then there is nothing new to be had here if you have seen these kind of haunted movies within the last 10 years or so. In fact, the storyline was actually predictable and you will have the movie figured out not even halfway into it. And the ending, well you will see that coming a mile away as well.<br><br>What \"Find Me\" has working for it was the acting and the camera-work. It was lacking scary moments and anything that even remotely would resemble anything spooky.<br><br>So why watch this one? Well to be honest, then I can't really come up with a reason, unless you have been missing out on haunted movies for the past 10 years or so. But be warned the movie follows the stereotypical guide of 'how to make a haunted movie' guidebook page by page, so don't expect anything innovative or surprising here.<br><br>Because the movie is so linear and predictable, I am going to have to rate it a mere 3 out of 10 stars.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[7,9]}]
