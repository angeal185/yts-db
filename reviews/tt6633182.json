[{"title":"Terrific and Extremely Important Documentary","rating":10,"date":"27 January 2018","review":"My wife and I watched this marvelous documentary at the Sundance Film Festival last night. It is extremely well done and it presents a compelling narrative about the role of \"dark money\" (political funds that cannot be traced to their source) in contemporary American politics. Flawed campaign financing laws lie at the heart of many of our difficult political problems. Kudos to Kimberly Reed and everyone involved in producing this gem.","user":"dhubin","rank":[65,77]},{"title":"Insight into what is happening in American government","rating":10,"date":"9 September 2018","review":"It was fascinating to realize how corporations and oligrarchs have figured out how to take control of our government. And it was sad to underrstand that most of our representatives and senators owe allegiance to Dark Money, even though every one of them would deny it. I am devasted that there are so many people who are willing to align to corruption in order to get elected.","user":"kmckennamn-77635","rank":[22,28]},{"title":"Corporate campaign finance under attack!","rating":9,"date":"3 March 2019","review":"Nice documentary on US political campaign contributions and disclosure laws","user":"bsaltzm1","rank":[5,7]}]
