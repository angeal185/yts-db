[{"title":"Not to be forgotten!","rating":8,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"Directed by Clive Barker and based on his 1988 novella Cabal, this movie was a commercial and critical failure. Barker has always claimed that the producers tried to sell the film as a run of the mill slasher, when it is anything but. In 2014, he finally was able to release a director's cut that fixed many of his issues.<br><br>Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer, Fire in the Sky) dreams of a place called Midian where monsters are accepted. His girlfriend Lori has convinced him to start seeing a psychotherapist named Dr. Phillip Decker, who is ably played by David Cronenberg of all people. All along, Decker has been setting Boone up for the murders that he's been committing, giving his LSD instead of lithium and filling his head with details of the murders.<br><br>Decker urges Boone to turn himself in, but he's hit by a truck and sent to the hospital where he meets Narcisse, another man who knows about Midian. He explains to Boone how to get to the hidden story while he cuts off his own face.<br><br>Boone makes his way to Midian, where he meets the creatures who make it their home like Kinski (Nicholas Vince, the Chattering Cenobite from Hellraiser) and Peloquin, a demonic creature who smells Boone's innocence, letting him know that there's no way that the murders could have been his doing. He bites Boone, who runs into a police trap led by Decker and is shot and killed.<br><br>He'd be dead if it wasn't for Peloquin's bite. Soon, he returns to life in the morgue while his girlfriend decides to come looking for Midian herself. Boone becomes part of the Nightbreed thanks to their leader Dirk Lylesburg (Doug Bradley, Pinhead himself) and from the touch of their god, Baphomet.<br><br>What follows is a battle between the police and clergy versus the Nightbreed, ending with Boone rallying the supernatural creatures and destroying their home to stop the attacks. Decker is stopped, Baphomet discusses that this was all part of the prophecy and he renames Boone Cabal.<br><br>There are two different endings of the film, depending on the original and director's cut that change the story significantly. One raises Decker from the dead while another places Lori into the Nightbreed. Both set the stage for further adventures that never happened, sadly.<br><br>Barker wanted this to be the Star Wars of horror films and envisioned a trilogy of stories. But the film wasn't marketed well and never made back its budget. Barker said that the producers expressed a concern that \"the monsters are the good guys,\" to which he replied, \"That's the point.\"<br><br>Marvel's Epic imprint put out several comic books and there were serveral video games, but soon the film slided away into obscurity, Luckily, with the excitement around the director's and Cabal cuts of the film being released, SyFy, Morgan Creek and Barker have announced an entirely new series based on the movie.<br><br>Interestingly enough, Filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky spoked well of Nightbreed, calling it \"the first truly gay horror fantasy epic\", as he saw the movie being all about the \"unconsummated relationship between doctor and patient.\"<br><br>There are plenty of music ties in this film, as the role of Ohnaka was first intended for singer Marc Almond and Suzi Quatro was in the film, but her scenes were cut. It's also one of the first films that Danny Elfman scored after Batman. Barker stated that \"The most uncompromised portion of that entire movie is the score.\"<br><br>Nightbreed has more than held up, reminding me of the convention season of 1990 when you could see buttons and shirts of this movie everywhere. My excitement was at a fever pitch and I thought, \"This is going to be huge.\" Shows how smart I was.","user":"BandSAboutMovies","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Intrigue, mystery and monstrosity.","rating":10,"date":"13 July 2002","review":"It is interesting to see what people think of this movie, since it is, in fact, quite unique (though it bears some of the trademarks of Clive Barker's writing). Even though it might seem a bit cynical to say so, the movie is just intricate enough to deflect those that need standard Hollywood plot hooks, and layered, so that if you expect to be fed, you will see a normal monster flick with lots of monsters and a disjointed plot.<br><br>Those who need a linear, specific and untangled plot line will hate this movie, because the story lies, like in the novella, partially between the lines, or in this case, partially off screen, in comments and the imagination.<br><br>Another possible hang-up is the ending, of which I can say, without spoiling it, that it is not entirely good and not entirely bad. It is, in fact, not very defined at all, which I know sends some people into raging tantrums about that they didn't get to know what happened, but to me, and to many others, I'm sure, just adds another dimension to the story - the dimension of speculation, and, in addition, the point that great disruption has a tendency to cause ripples that extend quite far.<br><br>There is definitely moral here, but of a rather different kind than the standard Hollywood in-your-face-at-the-end-of-the-movie sort of display. Summing that moral up is simple, even though it is not quite that simply displayed; prejudice and the human tendency to hate the different.<br><br>I love this movie, even though, as many of the reviewers have noted, the expressions of the actors (with the exception of David Cronenberg, who does a wonderful appearance) are rather tacky. I'm not sure they are entirely to blame for their rickety appearance and lack of depth, though, seeing that these are common problems in converting literature to screenplay.<br><br>All in all, this is a great movie, provided that you do not expect it to be a standard horror movie.","user":"Ahnion","rank":[67,89]},{"title":"Not a horror movie: A monster movie, with affection.","rating":7,"date":"15 July 2000","review":"What's fun about Barker's Nightbreed is that it's the story of a human on a rampage, a deadly threat to monsters everywhere.  In this one, the monsters (the night breed of the title) are the \"good\" guys.  It shares its sense of celebrating the different, the twisted, and the dark with the first Addams Family movie, and much of Tim Burton's work.  It also has the goriness that one expects from a piece by Barker.<br><br>Especially fun is the performance by Cronenberg as the truly evil human doctor who is bent on destroying the Nightbreed.  As happens in most classic monster movies, the villagers surround the monsters' castle with torches and pitchforks.  Only this time, the modern setting replaces the castle with an old mausoleum and the rustic \"weapons\" with guns and bombs.  And this time the sympathy you felt when you saw Frankenstein's monster burned in the windmill is the very center of the movie.<br><br>This isn't a masterpiece, and even Barker has done more interesting, and certainly more chilling, work.  But it's pure fun, it looks great, and remains light without mocking itself.  Worth a look!","user":"erichvm","rank":[33,42]}]
