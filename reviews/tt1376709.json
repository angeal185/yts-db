[{"title":"I Love You Too","rating":8,"date":"16 September 2010","review":"It's not everyday that we see an Australian romantic comedy on Singapore screens, so if you're game for a smaller film that takes a more heartfelt look at modern love and relationships, with lovable characters each with their own quirks, then look no further than I Love You Too, its title playing on the 4 words that the commitment phobic try to avoid all the time. For some, asking them to proclaim their love for another is sounding the death knell, with Freedom being kissed goodbye...<br><br>Peter Helliar's story is perhaps what made I Love You Too quite refreshing, focusing on various aspects of love instead of a sole romantic one, such as that between two siblings who have to fend for themselves for almost two decades when their parents perished in a car crash, a married couple facing a new entrant into their lives, the brotherly love between two best buddies, and that instant connection and bond shared between two strangers who start off on the wrong footing, but find in each other's company strength and the beginning of a genuine friendship. Such is this tale that we'll find nuggets of character aspects that will appeal to, and identify with.<br><br>Essentially it's the story of a break up between Jim (Brendan Cowell) and Alice (Yvonne Strahovski), two unlikely souls who meet in a bar and their one night stand had carried onto 3.5 years. With that kind of a relationship comes the expectations of progressing further, such as uttering that three word phrase, a long awaited proposal, and marriage. But to Jim, a man-child who refuses to grow up and works in what was once the largest miniature train in his father's co-owned theme park, having to commit means getting Alice a commitment ring at best. Disappointed, Alice breaks up their relationship on Jim's birthday, and so begins Jim's quest to try to woo her back.<br><br>The beauty of the story comes from the many friendships and relationships between the ensemble characters. There's Jim and his best buddy Blake (Peter Helliar) who more often than not plays his wingman when they hit the bars, and opens up that blokes like him can only hope to feed off the scraps that Jim passes of. Blake is the kind of tragic character who does a lot to get noticed, and like all best buddies know how to pull the other up when the chips are down, although sometimes leading to hilariously disastrous situations.<br><br>While that between Alice and Jim is supposedly set to be the strongest relationship on display here since this is almost primarily their story, the one that I enjoyed most was that between Jim and Charlie (Peter Dinklage), a vertically challenged man who got to know Jim when the latter broke into his car. Reading a letter Charlie made out to a \"Francesca\", Jim is adamant that Charlie assist him in being his Cyrano, pestering him to come up with the perfect letter to woo his lady love back. These two soon grow in their friendship, and in a tit-for-tat manner, Jim decides to return the favour by hand delivering Charlie's letter, which opens up a delightful yet bittersweet subplot that runs parallel to Jim's quest for love. Saying anything more will ruin the surprise package, but I suppose one will be hard pressed not to experience some heart-wrenching moments, especially when we see how Charlie, through no fault of his own, constantly become the butt of harsh comments, and him having a heart way larger than his physical stature.<br><br>Blessed with a wonderful soundtrack, I am growing to admire Peter Dinklage's performance, where he brings forth that quiet dignity of a character given receipt of the short end of the stick in life, and his Charlie's story arc turned out to be more engaging as you'll inevitably root for good things to happen in his gamble, versus the one that Jim has to win back, to which feminists out there will probably go up in arms over with how the finale was treated, treading very close to a combination of implausible coincidences and convenience. Still, I Love You Too is recommended, for its take on friendship, relationships, and how a network of family and friends help to provide some sanity check, as well as to pick you up when you fall down.","user":"DICK STEEL","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"This isn't just a romantic comedy – it's a sincere and entertaining movie about life","rating":8,"date":"16 September 2010","review":"A question that will plague you for the rest of your (pardon the obvious here) life is: What is life all about? We seek out the answers in books, in academic theses, in movies, and yes, in life itself. As we walked out from the theatres after watching the preview of this movie, we were somewhat convinced that the past 109 minutes have presented us with a rather poignant portrayal of life.<br><br>Surprise, surprise - the movie wasn't manufactured from the Hollywood's ingenious machines and computers. This time round, it's the kind mates from Down Under who have managed to make a film that is emotionally engaging, as well as enjoyably entertaining.<br><br>Our protagonist is 30 plus year old Jim, who is unable to commit to Alice, his girlfriend of three years. Like every other girl, Alice wishes that her boyfriend would say the three magical words – you know which ones, don't you? One situation leads to another, and Alice considers leaving to take up a job in England. Elsewhere, Jim meets the vertically challenged Charlie who gives him a new insight into what love really means. In this somewhere there's also Jim's best friend Blake, his pregnant sister Marie and her rough edged husband Owen.<br><br>We acknowledge the fact that the synopsis doesn't really sound exciting, but think about it – how exciting is life itself for most of us? What triumphs for this movie is its nice blend of comedy and affecting drama. We hate to say this, but if this screenplay was taken up by a money raking Hollywood studio, or for that matter, a local TV production house, things would have turned out to be a dreary drab of a mess.<br><br>Maybe you can call it first time lucky, because here we have first time writer Peter Helliar penning the screenplay. It is also the directorial film debut of Daina Reid. They may not be familiar names with us in this part of the world, but trust us, there is really a lot of heart in this one.<br><br>While watching this well written movie, you'd be reflecting on the various aspects of life – love, friendship, kinship and the little episodes which play themselves out amidst these larger grand themes. Helliar have managed to capture the little moments in life which define the greater moments – from the quibbles in a restaurant, the wild parties in a club, to the efforts taken by a friend to cheer his pal up, and a simple desire to connect with someone through writing letters. These setups are written with a fresh touch of humour, which remind of life itseld. Reid has also done a decent job of directing her cast in the various situations, never at once making them caricatures which we are so used in Hollywood movies and TV productions.<br><br>The cast delivers fine performances here. Brendan Cowell plays Jim, a familiar man in his 30s who is emotionally diminutive. – not just because he works at a miniature railway. The Australian actor exudes an underachiever charm that is both charismatic and empathizing. Helliar takes on the role of Jim's best friend Blake, who may seem rough and tough on the surface, but has one of the best lines in the movie when he tells Jim what he really feels about their friendship. Yvonne Strahovski plays Alice, the girlfriend who has to make a really important decision about her own life. The sweet looking actress puts her appealing looks to good use here. Fellow Australian actors Birdie Carter and Travis McMahon also display their acting chops in the roles of the wife and husband who are experiencing some bumpy times while expecting their first child.<br><br>Watch out also for Peter Dinklage's unforgettable performance as Charlie, the American who changes Jim's life. The actor has achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, which naturally makes him different from the rest. But that doesn't stop us from commending his moving performance – it's one of the best we have seen this year.<br><br>You end up feeling and caring for all the characters in the movie, and that's because you are living life.","user":"moviexclusive","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"At best a standard Australian comedy of good but unremarkable intentions","rating":6,"date":"20 May 2010","review":"Jim (Brendan Cowell) and his best friend Blake (Peter Helliar) are in their early thirties and still enjoy hitting the clubs together. Jim is far more successful in meeting women than Blake is but his encounters rarely last more than a single night. When he meets Alice (Yvonne Strahovski) in a club they both happily expect to be together for just for an evening but their relationship continues for another three and a half years. Jim works in the largest miniature railway station in Australia, while Alice is contemplating an important job offer back in the UK. She is frustrated in seeing other people strengthening their romantic entanglements, while Jim has still not proposed to her. When Jim embarrasses Alice over dinner and cannot bring himself to say that he loves her, she decides she will leave him and take the job offer. Distressed, Jim hits the bottle and the clubs once more and ends up sleeping in someone else's car. The vehicle belongs to Charlie (Peter Dinklage), who is initially going to call the police, but he decides he will try and advise Jim on how to make it up to his girlfriend.<br><br>For almost a decade now Australian cinema has seen both the very best and worst comedies that an industry could offer. The fluctuations in quality can largely be attributed to the types of the scripts that are produced. There are some like Kenny (2006) that are perfectly tuned to Australia's unique brand of humour and present colourful but wholly relatable characters too. Then there are those like The Extra (2005), so painfully devoid of laughs, that they tarnish Australian films collectively as being lacklustre. I Love You Too, directed by Daina Reid and written by co-star Peter Helliar, falls somewhere in the middle of the Australian comedy spectrum. It is a frequently crude and improbable film but it at least knows where its heart lies. Its predictable narrative offers familiar and transparent themes of mateship and the importance of responsibility, with sporadic laughs along the way. The film's main setup in having to win Alice back is problematic because it is difficult to accept that someone so beautiful would be willing to tolerate a buffoon like Jim. Jim's dialogue in the restaurant scene is so obnoxious and unsubtle that it strain's the audience credibility in believing that this relationship could have existed for so long. Helliar's crude brand of humour works wonderfully in small doses on TV shows that offer similarly crazy tones, but here it is cringing rather than witty. A scene where he decides to introduce Jim to a fifty-year-old hooker because he thinks she looks like Alice is indicative of the lowbrow humour that he has become accustomed to.<br><br>Rather ironically, what buoys the film is also its small ingredient. The casting of Peter Dinklage, a dwarf actor who was so convincing in Death at a Funeral (2007), is an inspired choice. Helliar has admitted writing the part specifically with Dinklage's voice in mind and as such the role fits accordingly. Dinklage is not only funny but he grounds his performance where the other actors cannot. He offers a sense of class and astuteness to his character and his final moments on screen are surprisingly poignant. Given how obnoxious and lowbrow his character is, Helliar thankfully only has a minor role to play himself as the boofhead friend. To his credit, he does have one single great line where he concedes that some men like Jim have an aura that lets them have any girl they want, whereas someone like him can only hope that a woman will look past all his flaws. Cowell is an unlikely romantic lead and even by the end of the picture he still does not have the level of sincerity to convince us that he belongs with Alice. His chemistry is best shared with Charlie and together their scenes bring some laughs. Megan Gale has a solid debut, playing an Italian model and she is a gorgeous inclusion.<br><br>I Love You Too is a familiar and lightweight romantic comedy with occasional laughs and a sugary, predictable conclusion. The material here, particularly the characterisation, is largely insubstantial and too often does the film aim for cheap laughs rather than anything particularly smart or witty. It is at least rescued by the professionalism and charisma of Dinklage, who makes this at best a standard Australian comedy of good but unremarkable intentions.","user":"Likes_Ninjas90","rank":[3,3]}]
