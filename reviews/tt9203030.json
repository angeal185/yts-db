[{"title":"It's The Story of Life, and Maybe More","rating":9,"date":"14 November 2018","review":"I have blessedly enjoyed the music of Loudon Wainwright III for as long as I can remember, and his father's writing in Life Magazine long before that. The younger Loudon spins stories and song in this Netflix concert film, weaving the two together in a remarkable way on a solo theater stage. It's ninety minutes of poetry, really, in which the singing Loudon shares his fathers \"The View From Here\" columns from Life magazine, and then sings his own songs about fatherhood, and shared and broken lives. It's beautiful theater, and a wonderful concert, and a must watch for anybody who still remembers the elder Loudon, or enjoys the music of his son.","user":"emailtombuchanan","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"An unusual experience","rating":10,"date":"13 November 2018","review":"I'm not familiar with Loudon Wainwright III, and I'm not sure why I decided to watch this special. I'm glad I did it.\nThe show is a mix of music and narrative, and it's truly beautiful and honest.\nWorth the time, and I recommmend it to everyone.","user":"oakdude101","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Not Enough Focus On Music","rating":8,"date":"16 November 2018","review":"I thought the concept intriguing, and the production values were extremely high. Oddly, the show doesn't feature much of Loudon's extensive catalog of original songs. I thought the focus on his writer father was a great focal point for the first half, but the second half wanders a bit. Too much monologue and not enough music for my taste.","user":"tomweberfilms","rank":[2,3]}]
