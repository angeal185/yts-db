[{"title":"The trailer is misleading, kind of...","rating":8,"date":"10 September 2019","review":"The trailer is awesome. Makes you want to watch it. Kudos to whoever edited it. But it is misleading in the fact that this movie is so much more than the trailer. It has a massive story to it. Its not just a slasher film like the trailer makes it look. The movie is a bit long for my taste but it kept my interest. Acting is pretty good. Definitely a few stand outs. The cops where my favorite. Very classic old jaded cop and rookie cop pairing. They played well off of each other. The Little girl was awesome also. Great writing, awesome cinematography, suspenseful at times, a few very cringe worthy and surprising scenes. I am glad I stumbled on this one. Definitely worth a watch.","user":"stevejonesisking","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Not bad at all","rating":7,"date":"9 September 2019","review":"At the beginning it is a little confusing. If one has the patience to continue watching it, it turns out to be a good film. There is something of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction in the dialogues. The end could have been better, though.\nActors play fine.\nConsidering it is an independent, low-budget film, i would defintely reccomend it.","user":"robertopoletti","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Marmite movie!","rating":7,"date":"5 September 2019","review":"You're either gonna love it or hate it... It's not for everyone. Forget mainstream, forget hollywood quality acting and just go with the trippy flow! Brilliant.","user":"beccaboo-99800","rank":[3,5]}]
