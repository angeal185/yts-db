[{"title":"Remains with me long after viewing","rating":10,"date":"7 December 2017","review":"While rating and writing reviews about more recent similar films (I'm writing this in December, 2017) like Greta Gerwig's \"Lady Bird,\" the Julia Roberts vehicle \"Wonder,\" and Brooke Shields' turn in \"Daisy Winters\" (all films about young people struggling to cope with a variety of obstacles as they try to find their place in the world), I realized I was comparing them to how I felt when I exited viewing \"The Book of Henry.\" I hadn't realized until now just how much \"Henry\" has stuck with me long after viewing, so I was surprised to find in checking my list of reviews written I had rated \"Henry\" but not written a review of it. I'm doing so now to alert those who may be wondering whether it's worth their time that it is, as I know it has gotten mixed reviews and didn't do well financially in theaters--but I'm also going to refrain from writing about any plot points or spoilers, as I was lucky enough to see \"Henry\" without knowing anything about it, not having even seen an advance trailer, and I recommend the same for you as the best way to see it: knowing nothing about any of its twists or even its core story. I found the cast perfect, in an ensemble kind of way, and remember the warmth and kindness generated by the film overall as I exited the theater. It has turned out to be one of my favorite films of the year, and I want to make sure to say so here because it was so terribly under-appreciated on its initial release, and barely seen by anyone, making it one of those films that, in my opinion, many people will be discovering on streaming or on DVD, and, after then watching it and enjoying it, wondering why they hadn't heard of it when it was released in theaters. It truly fits the \"under-appreciated gem\" label so many of these kinds of character-study films eventually end up with.","user":"2001ASOfan","rank":[42,54]},{"title":"Untold treasure.","rating":10,"date":"6 April 2018","review":"Has you laughing and crying, very human. Didn't know what to expect when I started watching this, stumbled upon the title. The richness of the characters, you could feel the love in the family through the acting.","user":"mark_oflaherty","rank":[37,53]},{"title":"Surprisingly good with excellent performances, writing and camera work","rating":7,"date":"16 June 2017","review":"I had no expectations going into this movie. I knew I like the director, the leading actress and it had an interesting premise. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this under-the-radar film and am sure general audiences will as well. The Book of Henry is an emotionally affecting film with a few fine messages about parenthood and altruism. <br><br>The movie actually surprised me. Perhaps it's because I had no prior knowledge about it, but the twist (I don't think it's supposed to be a twist per se) in the movie is reminiscent of Psycho, in that the seeming protagonist has an interesting cinematic journey. That provides the basis of our catharsis. It's actually very solid writing. We become invested in this character who has a charm and wit about him that's irresistibly likable and we fall for him. We become invested in his relationships with his mother, his little brother and his neighbor. The plot is already in motion and then the twist happens. <br><br>After this twist, the true protagonist comes to the forefront and we become invested in her because we feel for her and root for her cause. The only issue - her cause happens to be literally unbelievable and predictably improbable. However, we find ourselves nearly believing it. I mean, there's a sequence that's utterly Hitchcockian, when there's cross editing between two separate scenes. One scene is used as the musical background for the other and the tension is palpable. It's reminiscent of the concert scene in The Man Who Knew Too Much. It all comes to a satisfying ending that we all knew was coming and yet, isn't any less smile inducing. <br><br>The performances are very good. Naomi Watts is one of our generation's most consistent actors and the youngsters Jacob Tremblay and Jaeden Lieberher hold their weight and then some. However the score and direction deserve a lot of credit. The film is very well paced and switches between tones so seamlessly. Never are we pulled out of the film because it gets boring or it goes too quickly or it switches between genres. <br><br>A lot of reviews are bashing the film. Don't get me wrong, it has its flaws. The foundation of the character is never told and is a glaring hole. A few plot elements are improbable, definitely. However, those are forgivable in the grand scheme. This film has charm and intrigue. I believe it'll go down as one of those films where critics and general audiences just don't agree. With that said, I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18. It can be seen at a local theater when it opens June 16, 2017. <br><br>Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST!
