[{"title":"A missed opportunity which was totally predictable","rating":5,"date":"19 June 2017","review":"Big fan of the first movie and went into this movie with no expectations having never heard of it. The Good; the CGI was respectable, the acting was god, Patrick Stewart is always a win; and root story was decent and had one decent plot twist. The Bad; it felt like the movie was in slow motion in the story telling much of the time. On one hand they needed to spend more time with the development of the early story, but the mid story dragged. The Ugly, too many plot holes and things the director and writers did to just move the story on without explanation. The Other, had they pursued more of the angle with (Slight Spoiler) the female lead character emboldening the women and wanting to be a good queen, I believe they could have made a much more rewarding ending. The ending, as is, was just ho-hum so what; predictable, leaving many questions from the final battle unanswered.","user":"davemfawcett","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"A Dragon-Fueled Garbage Fire","rating":1,"date":"20 June 2017","review":"Absolute sludge. This movie though it does not deserve to be called as such, is an unrelenting war on the senses and intelligence of the viewer. The effects of the film are baffling in its own incompetence, with horrific CG dragons and hilariously bad fire being all over the place. If you had told me this movie had come out in 2017 i would've called you a liar. The plot is boring and predictable, the characters are frustratingly incompetent and the visuals being a balance between drab and really bad CG.","user":"kingdok-42313","rank":[18,27]},{"title":"Too much satire not enough dragon fire.","rating":3,"date":"16 June 2017","review":"Movie starts with mythological elements that are poorly explained, presumably relying on the audience to have watched the previous movies to understand the implications of what is being presented. It rapidly devolved into what I would call a \"feminist narrative on modern society\", first by painting a satirical image of \"the man\", a boy with privilege and all the good things in life coming easy to him simply because he's male, contrasted to \"the woman\", a girl who is no different but has always been denied acceptance and love for things that were not her fault and because she was a girl. The role of the mythology in the story really doesn't add anything to the narrative, other than to draw the viewer's attention to the characters that you are supposed to pay attention to. At times it represents the mystical forces of the universe that magically prefer and promote male domination over women.<br><br>In addition to the feminist agenda being presented, there is a noticeable anti-Christian theme, where the church is portrayed as an unintelligent priest whose role is to be a yes-man to the patriarchy and has nothing useful to provide his kingdom, aside from very rudimentary medical care.<br><br>Despite not appreciating much about the underlying message of the movie, I did enjoy the music and some of the special effects. Overall I did not feel like it gave a very unique or interesting plot, or left me with anything new to think about or imagine. The hidden agendas that I believe were in the script took away from my enjoyment as well.","user":"sbabudro","rank":[17,27]}]
