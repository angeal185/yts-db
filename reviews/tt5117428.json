[{"title":"Life Is About Compromise","rating":8,"date":"18 November 2019","review":"\"Wild Rose\" is perhaps a little formulaic, but I really liked the message it lands on at the end, which is that life is a series of compromises, and while few of us will ultimately achieve our dreams (if we have any to begin with), the alternative is not necessarily a life of dullness and misery.<br><br>No, despite what movies would have us believe, there is something in between. \"Wild Rose\" wraps things up a bit too patly -- in my actual personal experience I have not seen people as selfish as this film's heroine is suddenly turn things around and re-order her priorities. But it's nice to think that it's possible, and this is one of those films that reminds me that sometimes I turn to movies not to show me how things actually are, but how things could be.<br><br>Jessie Buckley is phenomenal in the title role. It takes a special actress to make a pretty unlikable character sympathetic and worth two hours of your time. Julie Walters is also wonderful as her fed up mom. Sophie Okonedo is stuck playing the film's most unrealistic character, a woman who is simply too good to be true.<br><br>I also liked that this movie, even if cursorily, examines the gulf that exists between people's romanticized perceptions of the entertainment world and the harsh realities of it. Anyone with an ounce of talent thinks they're special and the entire world will recognize it if they can just get their break. The reality is that talented people grow on trees, and you're most likely going nowhere if you don't know the right people and how to play the game.<br><br>Grade: A-","user":"evanston_dad","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Three chords and the truth","rating":8,"date":"26 July 2019","review":"A young Scottish woman comes out of prison with the firm intention of fulfilling her dream and becoming a country singer in Nashville, Tennessee.

Firstly I'd like to apologize for how late this review is. It's been a very busy week and now is my chance. For the second film for the Inaugural Northwoods Film Festival, Wild Rose was chosen for a screening. This came out back in June. I debated on going to see it at some point but there was no time since I'd have to drive two hours to go and see it. I'm so happy to have seen this. Wild Rose is one of the best films of the year. It's such an interesting screenplay and inspiring. Jessie Buckley's character of Rose-Lynn is a very complex character. She has her dreams but is restrained with the stresses and disappointments of life. She's also not afraid to hide her true self. I'm very confused why Buckley hasn't really been talked about in the Oscar race for later this year. On Gold Derby I've been checking daily on my Oscar nominations predictions (yes I'm already doing that and so are many people). Jessie Buckley isn't even listed as an option for the nominations so I can't even put her on my list for Best Actress. She's absolutely amazing. Definitely in my top five for best performances of the year. She's also a really good singer. The songs in the film are very good and on my mind. In particular one of the later original songs called Glasgow is brilliant. I really hope it can get into Best Original Song. The scene with that song is also just so emotional and brought tears to my eyes. I purposely decided not to listen to it until I saw the film. Listen to this song! For other performances, Julie Walters plays Rose-Lynn's mother and brings another strong performance. Her scenes with Buckley are very good. Their conflicting views bring for an interesting plot and great scenes. Sophie Okonedo plays Suzannah, the woman who Rose-Lynn works for as a maid. She was so enjoyable to watch and it just made me happy that she was actually interested in trying to help her with her career. I loved her. It's just a shame that when an event happens she's kind of out of the film for a while and nothing much with her anymore. I wish they had a little bit with her when she's back again. The acting in this is just superb! The screenplay by Nicole Taylor is very good. The only thing I'd say is some parts I could just tell how they would play out but I still liked it. Side note: I don't know if this was written in the script but sometimes when Rose-Lynn was singing by herself we'd get beautiful cinematography showing her singing, walking around and people were just playing instruments in the background. That was just a perfect way to see her view. If it wasn't in the screenplay then Tom Harper had a beautiful vision with his amazing directing. This is an overlooked film this year in my opinion. I don't want to spoil anything else. Everyone in our audience just adored it. The two people I saw it with really liked it as well. Here's some comments from Landen Alft who thought this was a perfect A+ film: Amazing acting, emotion and comedy. Amazing cinematography especially the singing scene in the house with the band appearing. Amazing everything. Definitely check this out when it comes out on digital and blu ray. I just really hope it's considered in the award race.<br><br>My Grade: A-","user":"sweidman-28016","rank":[13,16]}]
