[{"title":"Absolutely Horrendous!","rating":1,"date":"23 March 2013","review":"DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! I AM WARNING YOU! <br><br>My husband and I went this afternoon and it was absolutely horrendous. I should've known before going seeing a 2.8 rating out of 10 but I thought what the heck, the trailer looks funny. There were only 8 people in the theater and at least 6 of them left early. I couldn't stomach another second of it. Do yourself a favor and stay as far as you can away from this movie.<br><br>I wasted an hour of my life on this movie and will never be able to get it back.<br><br>If I were able to give this less than 1 star, I would. Unfortunately it doesn't let me do 1/4 or 1/2 stars or even negative stars. This is an absolute waste of time.","user":"trishasuebays","rank":[106,153]},{"title":"I'm Not Certain They Could Have Made It Worse if They Tried","rating":28,"date":"28 March 2013","review":"InAPPropriate Comedy (2013) <br><br>BOMB (out of 4) <br><br>I must admit that I was looking forward to this film. After all, earlier in the year I sat through and mildly enjoyed MOVIE 43 so perhaps a second dose of raunchy humor would be worth sitting through. Sadly, this film here makes the other look like the work of Laurel and Hardy. INAPPROPRIATE COMEDY is a \"film\" that has a man playing various apps that are videos for raunchy, racist humor but sadly none of it is funny. Some of the so-called comedy features a Dirty Harry spoof with Adrien Brody playing a tough but gay cop. Rob Schneider and Michelle Rodriguez play a Siskel and Ebert type who review porn movies. Ari Shaffir plays a reality host known as The Amazing Racist who goes around picking on Mexicans, Jews and blacks. And yeah, there's Lindsay Lohan taking up about two- minutes worth of screen time as Marilyn Monroe. INAPPROPRIATE COMEDY starts off with a spoof of 127 HOURS, which is so unfunny and such a disaster that it pretty much sets you up for everything that's about to follow. Watching this movie you can't help but be somewhat entertained from how bad it is and you often ask yourself what the filmmakers were thinking. I mean, did they not realize half way through production that this thing was horrible? If they didn't realize how bad this was then they shouldn't ever be allowed to make another movie because they're just wasting money. If they did realize how bad it was then they still don't need to make another movie because if they're smart enough to know it's bad then they should have been smart enough to stop production so that they didn't waste more money. I'm not going to lie and say that I never laughed. I can recall three smiles and one laugh that would rate a 1 out of 10. Everything else is just so bad that you can't help but wonder what they were trying to do. The Amazing Racist sequences might have worked if they actually felt real. They all come across as very staged. However, to be fair, even if they weren't staged then they still wouldn't have been funny. There's a take-off on 'Jackass' except done with black people and this here is just so unfunny even though it seems they're wanting to be both racist and offensive. As for the cast, this here is probably the worst thing Schneider has ever done and that's saying a lot. I'm not sure why Rodriquez is here but perhaps the producers had something on her. It's sad to see where former Oscar-winner Brody is with this type of film. With Lohan, let's hope she got some good \"stuff\" with her paycheck. Again, I thought MOVIE 43 was hilarious at spots and I enjoyed sitting through it. If anyone thought that film was bad then I dare you to try and make it through this thing.","user":"Michael_Elliott","rank":[44,60]},{"title":"A new low has been reached","rating":1,"date":"13 April 2013","review":"I work at a movie theater so I see almost all movies come and go. I've seen good ones bad ones and downright awful ones come through. I was able to get through Jack and Jill and was able to even handle Gigli and Bucky Larson, but this movie finally did it for me, its the First movie I've ever walked out of. I lost exactly 48 mins of my life and I will never get it back! I can honestly say without a doubt, this is the worst movie I've ever seen!!! Battlefield Earth looked like Citizen Kane compared to this \"film\" if you can even call it that. <br><br>Whats wrong with this film? Whats right with this film???? Every single attempt at a joke falls flat on its ass, the \"story\" is.....no there is no story. Every attempt at a parody fails, and the dialogue is probably the worst I've ever heard ever! His name is Flirty Harry Get it? Cause its Dirty Harry only he is gay! Adrian Brody should have his Oscar taken away after this movie and Rob Schneider should never be allowed to grace the Silver Screen ever again.<br><br>But there is one thing this film does right. When the credits roll Thats the upside if you can even make it that far! This movie was only in my theater for a week if that and now I understand why, this is the worst movie of 2013 and possibly the worst movie of the 21st Century. If its still in theaters anywhere Avoid at all costs and if you see it on DVD run away or buy it so you can set it on fire!!!","user":"final-fantasyxcjo","rank":[35,47]}]
