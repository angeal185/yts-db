[{"title":"what is wrong with the people giving low ratings?","rating":10,"date":"8 January 2018","review":"This film was positively wonderful. I am dumbstruck at it's IMDB rating. \nFor crying out loud it's a magical children's tale with a soundtrack that includes Brian Eno/Robert Fripp and 70s soul jams. It's disability-positive, the way the sound is done to convey deaf children navigating NYC is extremely creative and well done. The art and scenes are what I worshipped as a child - my greatest fantasy was to find a secret room in a museum and stay the night! And the dioramas and the incredible way they wove them into the storytelling! The people saying \"nothing dramatic happens\" are seriously off their rockers - a kid loses his hearing!!! two deaf children run away to NYC!!! how on Earth is that not dramatic? \nThis film made me cry and laugh and feel like a child again. It's beautiful. If you have a child, watch it with them. If you don't, like me, watch it and feel like a kid again.","user":"Dollyrkr","rank":[93,122]},{"title":"love it","rating":10,"date":"20 July 2018","review":"I absolutely love this movie. David Ehrlich wrote:\"This is a soul-stirring and fiercely uncynical film that suggests the entire world is a living museum for the people we've lost, and that we should all hope to leave some of ourselves behind in its infinite cabinet of wonders\". I couldn't have said it better myself. Of course it is a bit slow and maybe too complicated for a kid (it's definitely not for everyone). But A LOT of people actually love The Greatest Showman or another rubbish...I am 25 years old - I watched it with my mother who is 60 years old and we enjoed it. The ending is quite outstanding in my opinion. Everyone involved did such a beautiful job.","user":"asrashid","rank":[28,36]},{"title":"If you stay with the movie the greatness and the tears payoff.","rating":10,"date":"11 March 2018","review":"I'm very sad to see all the dislike reviews to this Todd Haynes film. Since he made Safe also with Julianne Moore. It was both there first films together. You'll like this film. I'm not going to give any of it away. I just want to save it from all the bad reviews I see here. It's a 2 hour Todd Haynes film. You have to stick with it even for me it was hard but sometimes with a film you have to go with it. And like the other films I see him do. There always beautiful and the tears for this one was hard to hold back. It all makes sense in the end. And it's a interesting story. The 1970's songs he picked were great. Anyway Todd great job on this. I didn't even know about it. Till today.","user":"nameismike69","rank":[32,45]}]
