[{"title":"Better than expected","rating":7,"date":"31 March 2014","review":"Not a masterpiece by any means but as far as kids movies go, it's pretty good. Cute and harmless, and it does have the feel of the old Little Rascals. The plot is simple, the kids try to come up with ways to make money so \"grandma\" doesn't lose her bakery to the bank or Waldo's dad, and trouble ensues. The young actors are adorable (especially Camden Gray as Porky!) and fit their roles quite well in my opinion. Casting Eden Wood, the spoiled \"star\" from Toddlers &amp; Tiaras complete with her own homemade music videos and dolls, as Darla was a curious choice but surprisingly it works.<br><br>Obviously this won't be winning any Oscars, but it's a cute movie that I'm glad I checked out despite the extremely low expectations.","user":"K-A-B","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"Great movie for kids","rating":9,"date":"22 June 2014","review":"this movie really hit it off with my kids ages 4, 7, and 9. i watched it with them and found some scenes and lines a bit silly. some did make me chuckle. i thought the child actors played their part really well, a bit of over-acting but hey they're kids!! and my kids are happy and occupied the next two hours, so that's good enough for me too. oh i have to write at least 10 more lines for my review to be accepted... OK so i thought the rating of 5 stars was kind of low it deserves to go up a bit..maybe upto 7 or 8. but i'm giving it a 9 coz i liked the musical aspect of the movie. it had my little girl singing. im not really familiar with the original rascals so if this movie did not stick to the original... we don't really care.","user":"carol-abella","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Just What I Needed To See","rating":9,"date":"13 April 2014","review":"First off, Im 16 years old and a huge fan of the original Our Gang comedies. I grew up watching them with my grandfather and knew each rascal like a brother or sister. So, when I heard about The Little Rascals Save The Day coming out, I was thrilled, yet scared. I was nervous about their ability to restore the personalities of the original gang. In the 1994 return of The Little Rascals, some of the characters were not like the originals but I am thankful that Alfalfa and Spanky were good. So, back to this movie, like any other curious fan; I went out and bought the movie the day it came out. I popped it in the DVD player and started watching. Not even 15 minutes into the movie, I saw something that made me smile and gave me respect for the whole movie. When the kids are excused from class for different reasons, the teacher lets them go and just as they are walking out feeling accomplished, the ice cream man brings a cake in. THIS IS ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED IN ONE OF THE 1930'S SHORTS. As I watched the movie, I saw many little references to the shorts that without watching the shorts, no one would recognize. But Im so glad they included these! The characters are portrayed reasonably well which makes the movie is just like any other Little Rascal adventure, regardless of the era :)","user":"tb19981","rank":[4,6]}]
