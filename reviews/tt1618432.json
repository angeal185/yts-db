[{"title":"I'm in Love with Materialism","rating":3,"date":"28 December 2013","review":"After a recent view of \"I'm in Love with a Church Girl\" this reviewer can readily see what is happening with American Evangelical Christianity's love affair with the materialistic world-view. From the very first scene one can tell directly that the film was made as an evangelistic tool to draw in a certain element of society caught up in the very real world of drugs and crime. However the portrayal of this world is presented in such an unrealistic way that it is hard to imagine that any goal could be accomplished in reaching this certain target audience. <br><br>What is clear, is that this movie sets out to establish that American Evangelical Christianity can give you more than the world has to offer; in fact, it can beat the world at its own game! <br><br>From the very first scene of presenting 'cool' Christian rap music that is portrayed as just as good if not better than the world's music without 'sounding lame' we can see the setup. Christian Rap is hardcore after all. When the main character Miles went to church as a kid, it had lame music after all. What? Not anymore. Christians got the cool music. Everyone wants to be cool after all. Duh!<br><br>How about the cool worship pastor with the white Lamborghini and gangsta clothing? Looks to me like he made it bigger than Miles with this game! He didn't even have to sell any drugs! Again, Miles was bored out of his mind as a kid with traditional worship, but now he has a cool guy that can relate to him! WERD! I need to get me some of that! <br><br>And the 'church girl'? It's okay to go date a thug, because missionary dating is cool! In fact, girls, get out there and get to work! It will all work out in the end! Just ignore your crazy strict mom when she asks your non-Christian boyfriend some simple questions. She does not understand! Mom, it will turnout all right! Don't worry so much! <br><br>To top it all off, once you get caught for your wicked lifestyle you can always just say a prayer, and it's all good! You can even keep your material goods! Because, it's all about you!<br><br>What's not to love about a Materialistic world-view?","user":"DeusWar","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"Bad acting, no tobyMac, unfortunate movie overall","rating":1,"date":"26 October 2013","review":"As a Christian this movie horrifies me. Vanessa is basically Miles' counselor, and whenever they have conversations she has this \"all-knowing\" look as if she already knows the answers to the questions that he's asking and she's so much better than him. The actors are really bad at subtle emotion, and I feel as though this movie was highly unprofessionally made and produced - i.e, all of the aerial shots of the scenery and buildings. Do we really need a bird's-eye view of every scene? Also, the plot was confusing in the fact that the movie starts off with Miles being an active drug dealer and then immediately moving two years later to when he is supposedly a concert manager. There was no warning and the jump was without transitions. The music was too loud at some points in the way that it was less subtle than it could have been. Yes, we know this is a dramatic scene, but we don't need emotional classical music blasting through the speakers. Vanessa is a very skin-deep character and there is no chemistry between Miles and Vanessa. It seemed artificial when Vanessa didn't question Miles' million-dollar home and multiple cars, and was shocked when he tries to stop the fight in the parking lot with the others. Like, yes, he was a drug dealer, obviously his past hasn't completely disappeared. Sorry that this is long, but definitely don't take the time to see this.","user":"aprilsweetpea26","rank":[25,33]},{"title":"Church girl dresses to kill","rating":4,"date":"27 October 2013","review":"I'm In Love With A Church Girl gets an \"A\" for sincerity, but only maintains a \"C\" for the final result. Rapper Ja Rule stars as the real life Miles Montego of San Jose, California who through new found faith in God comes all the way out of his former life as a drug seller and a gang banger.<br><br>Now he's into concert promotions which is legitimate unto itself, but certainly is still an atmosphere in which Ja Rule's former profession flourishes. But Ja Rule meets Adrienne Bailon who is a nice church going girl and pretty soon he's not only liking her, but her wholesomeness and purity stemming from her devout Christian upbringing.<br><br>Of course law enforcement isn't quite buying Ja Rule turning over a new leaf and they've got Stephen Baldwin on surveillance checking him out throughout the film.<br><br>I'm In Love With Church Girl borrows from the old master of religious spectacle Cecil B. DeMille. Not that this film has a DeMille like budget, but DeMille was a big believer in selling religion with a little sex. Somehow I could not quite buy Adrienne Bailon as a church going born again with those skirts up to her privates and showing a most ample buttocks. Maybe I'm just a Philistine, but somehow I think that's what got Ja Rule's attention.<br><br>The cast gave some good performances and how much of it happened to Miles Montego in real life is a source of speculation. I know DeMille would have approved this picture.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[15,20]}]
