[{"title":"Cool. Killer Cool :-)","rating":7,"date":"17 December 2011","review":"This is one very funny &amp; quite racy action thriller with a lesser known star cast to the worldwide viewers but who gets together to entertain us well.<br><br>There are F's and B's flying from all the characters' mouth so many times that it's futile to keep count but when all the filthy language is mixed with loads of humour, we end up having a fun time.<br><br>Most of the acting is forgettable but the movie covers up for that, thanks to the fast-paced action scenes, the hand combats, the humour and of course the nudity :) <br><br>Only the female actors really stood out here. Janet McTeer as the hired assassin Helen Bingham shows a deadly balance of motherly care and ruthless violence! Paz Vega as the escort Catalina is just crazy HOT! <br><br>Verdict: I never expected Cat Run to be this fun. But ya, adult viewing only ;)","user":"manjodude","rank":[22,30]},{"title":"Heavy Handed Direction and Lack of Humor in a Rip-off of Guy Ritchie Style","rating":5,"date":"10 January 2012","review":"The Andorran call girl and single mother Catalina \"Cat\" Rona (Paz Vega) is hired to participate in an orgy in Montenegro with other escorts and powerful men and the American Senator William Krebb (Christopher McDonald). Something goes wrong with the politician and all the girls are murdered by the security of the host to avoid witnesses. However Cat escapes and brings a hard-drive with classified information with her. There is a manhunt for Cat and the cruel assassin Helen Bingham (Janet McTeer) is hired to retrieve the HD and kill Cat. <br><br>Meanwhile the Americans Julian Simms (Alphonso McAuley) and Anthony Hester (Scott Mechlowicz) decide to open a detective agency to raise money. When they see on the newspaper that Cat is being chased, they decide to seek her out expecting to receive a reward. However, they cross the path of Helen and they end protecting Cat from the killer. When Helen is betrayed by those who had hired her, she decides to help Anthony, Julian and Cat to retrieve the HD and their freedom.<br><br>\"Cat Run\" is an action-comedy with a heavy handed direction and lack of humor in a rip-off of Guy Ritchie style. Unfortunately the plot is silly and absurd and never works. In addition, Alphonso McAuley is not funny and Helen Bingham is a clich√© of other assassins. My vote is five.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Gata em Fuga\" (\"Cat in Flight\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[17,25]},{"title":"Sort of Entertaining","rating":3,"date":"3 November 2011","review":"This movie was a classic B Movie that just fell short of propelling the stars to A status. The totally forgettable 3 main actors were out of character as this was neither a comedy or a thriller, so the way they portrayed it was just wrong. The leading assassin who stole the show with her portrayal of a cold blooded killer was the best part of the movie but it was over acted and it was only 2 steps away from being Austin Powers. It could have been so great but the poor acting ruined it, it could have been funny but the poor acting ruined it, it was badly scripted but the cinematography was excellent, it had so many good points but far too many bad points to recommend it.","user":"swedish_chef_dave","rank":[27,44]}]
