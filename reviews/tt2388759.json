Sara Paxton steals the show!","rating":7,"date":"6 July 2015","review":"This was surprisingly good! The story of this movie is a bit different from your typical romantic comedy. Some of the jokes are really bawdy, so be prepared.<br><br>The actors are all good but Sara Paxton really steals the show. She's amazingly talented. She has played many different and diverse roles by now and has always done a great job in my opinion. She is equally good with comedy, drama and horror. It think she deserves much more recognition and needs to get more lead roles.<br><br>I'm really baffled that currently less than 600 users have rated this movie even though it has been out for almost one and a half years. More people need to see this!","user":"the_bluesman","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Taut RomCom","rating":8,"date":"18 April 2018","review":"Taut modern romcom with fine cast especially Creeper and Paxton. Pulls no punches when it comes to sex. Not everyone will feel comfortable watching the antics going on. Nevertheless, a romp. Does America have AirSex competitions? Amazing! Also known as \"Love Is In the Air\" and \"Love &amp; Air Sex.\"","user":"JohnnyLee1","rank":[0,0]}]
