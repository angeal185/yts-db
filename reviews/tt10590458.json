The acting was incompetent and the plot was ridiculous.<br><br>Don't bother with this feeble attempt at a horror film! You're are just punishing yourself if you do!","user":"contactmaz","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"horrible","rating":1,"date":"18 March 2020","review":"I created an account just to leave this review. HORRIBLE movie.. I can deal with a bad movie if it has some good parts to it.. bad acting but good special effects? sure, ill deal with it.. great acting but horrible everything else? sure, ill watch it.. But what good part does this movie have? not a single thing.. TERRIBLE acting. TERRIBLE special effects, TERRIBLE costumes, Terrible EVERYTHING!!!!!!! even something as simple as them making a flickering light due to power loss they screwed up.. on the screnes where theres a flickering light, it looks like someone is flicking a light switch on and off at an even pace.. for a half hour straight.. A dying light doesnt look like a strobe light!!!!!!!!! The monsters were just people in costumes made out of rubber.. the elongated fingers were rubber and floppy when they moved.. These monsters that supposedly hunt their prey by sounds dont react when theres someone 2 feet from it breathing loud and making noise?<br><br>I turned this on because i thought it was the part 2 of \"A Quiet Place\".. This was an hour long waste of my time.<br><br>I rate this ZERO stars<br><br>Literally, NOT exaggerating, Worst movie i have ever seen in my life.","user":"jstagzsr","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"DON'T WAST YOUR TIME","rating":1,"date":"21 March 2020","review":"Go away this movie will waste your time\nBad story\nBad actors","user":"yazanhq","rank":[5,7]}]
