[{"title":"6-7/10 The Game (1997) meets Run Lola Run (1998) etc","rating":6,"date":"17 September 2016","review":"In short: This is \"The Game (1997)\" adapted to the society we live in now (1984) with some extra (read; unnecessary) layers that makes it feel a little as inception. It tries to be several things, and it does quite a decent job at it. This is not a bad movie and for me it is a strong 6.<br><br>In long: The lighting is good, the editing is alright and you can't fault the soundscore. It really only misses a binding soundtrack and using one would negate the feel of reality of the movie (though urgency can be expressed with music quite well - Run Lola Run 1998, which is likely to be another movie that has inspired this movie).<br><br>The downside is that it has a somewhat weak ending (where the several layers come in and a badly hid undertone about who's surveilling the ones doing the surveillance in the first place) - which is out of place even though it is in line with the message - question what the reality is and how you affect it.<br><br>Pro's  Cast (unknown which is in line with the plot line)  Action sequences (and not forcing it on the movie every time possible)  Rationality is alright and better depicting the notion of what manipulation of actions has the potential to do.<br><br>Con's  Messy ending  Could build tension better  Acting performances aren't top notch ALL the time (which is important in building tension and urgency)<br><br>End notes: Not top notch but overall a solid watch.","user":"shide_85","rank":[15,23]},{"title":"Do you really want to do this?","rating":3,"date":"9 October 2017","review":"Matt (Josh Bowman) stays at home and plays video games while his wife works. He is addicted to them. He becomes part of a bad film, the old \"do what we tell you\" or your wife (Leila Mimmack) dies. He gets instructions from a cell phone. Is this related to his video game play? Did his wife do this to get him out of the house? Who knows and who cares. Josh Bowman's character had no special abilities to go after the bad guys as is the formula for these films. Without that predictable aspect, the film becomes boring, watching Matt frantically run around London.<br><br>Guide F-word. No sex or nudity","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"I feel like i have seen this many times","rating":2,"date":"16 May 2018","review":"I don't even know where to begin.<br><br>The premise is ok, yet seen many times But in this movie, it is executed very poorly<br><br>The main flaw is the same as in Nerve (2016), which has a similar plot. There is NO WAY something like this could exist without the police noticing it, or someone denouncing it.<br><br>Another major flaw is in the begining. Bad guys say they kidnap the girlfriend. So Matt takes his phone and tries to call her, but no answer. We learn later in the movie that it was a lie all along, and that the girlfriend has been at work the whole time. What a bad luck! Had the grilfriend answer her phone, or just send a simple text message during the day, it would have crushed the whole movie. <br><br>The behaviour of the main character also makes no sense. During the whole film, he disobeys the instructions, risking his girlfriend's life. So why not call the police?<br><br>The worst scene is when he goes in a restaurant and finds a laptop with the whole stuff, the website, the streaming, the viewers commenting...etc. Then he runs away. Geez, just take the bloody laptop to the police!<br><br>The ending gives almost no answers but we saw it coming. Who were the kidnappers? How and why do they do this? We won't know...<br><br>Overall: an already-seen movie, but badly executed, with too many inconsistencies to take it seriously.","user":"rudygerst","rank":[5,7]}]
