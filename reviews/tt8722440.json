[{"title":"Amateur","rating":3,"date":"18 December 2019","review":"There are a lot of good mafia movies. This is not one of them.\nThe whole films feels like a school project. Slow story, slow dialogues, experienced actors acts like this is their first time on screen.. 90 minutes wasted..","user":"homerkaro","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Great topic, poor execution","rating":3,"date":"18 December 2019","review":"There's no drama, tension or action in this. It's goofy without being funny. There's no reason given why a group of mobsters should be arrested. It's explained later on what they charged with but... ugh. Lots of nice cars in this film though.","user":"aeongale","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"terrible","rating":2,"date":"13 December 2019","review":"If your in to learn about the history of the american mafia, this is unfortunately the wrong place to start. its inconsistent already from the start, and the story development feels like walking on starch to avoid drowning., the only positive to say about this flick is the collection of maity fine shining automobiles from the era.<br><br>the worst to say about this product must be the dialouges, they bark like john wayne and kirk douglas in their 1950's movies which means both how they say it and what they try to say. the cinematography are either standstill, or far too close up, and the fill in shoots of the environment are stolen from ''america in colours''.,<br><br>the grumpy old man felt stained by this doggybag product, i did think saban films knew better than this and its a no recommend from the flufilled north.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[17,26]}]
