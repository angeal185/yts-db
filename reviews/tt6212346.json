[{"title":"Stop or I'll shoot","rating":8,"date":"5 July 2017","review":"This is the second of two films that utilize the same characters and is part of a TV series. It is in Polish with English subtitles. The film spends time creating characters through subplots. The main plot centers around Sugar (Sebastian Fabijanski), a complex criminal who is scheming and diabetic. Zuza (Joanna Kulig) is a woman who joins the police force after discovering her husband is gay and cheating. She ends up sleeping with Sugar who has a wife and child in prison. Russian oil is being transported into Poland disguised as...something else in order to avoid VAT tax. Sugar becomes involved and there is a lot of money involved and a lot of crooks in and out of the police force. Sugar is also part of the GTM biker gang and is tasked to kill a policeman, another subplot. The police discover the plot and give him protection, which his wife enjoys, picking out suitable young men for her daughter, While the film is mostly a crime drama, it also has numerous comedy and dark comedy moments that translate very well into English, like the moronic prisoner who messes up the Pinocchio joke and then complains his \"girl friend\" is an idiot. It is funny, long, and complex.<br><br>Guide: F-word, sex, and nudity","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[8,10]}]
