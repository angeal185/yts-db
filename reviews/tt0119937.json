[{"title":"Inspiring And Haunting","rating":9,"date":"3 April 2004","review":"This is the real-life story of Oregon runner Steve Prefontaine who, despite physical imperfections, draws on inner strength of character, to set American track records, and race in the 1972 Munich Olympics.  As a runner myself, I found this 1997 docudrama inspiring.<br><br>But \"Prefontaine\" is far more than a cinematic pep talk for runners.  It's a character study of an extraordinary young man from an ordinary background, his personal relationships, and his date with destiny.  It is a story that has lasting value.<br><br>The film's visuals and music effectively convey the look and sound of the early 70's.  The acting is above average.  Jared Leto is superb as Steve. Just as good is R. Lee Ermey as Steve's coach, the legendary Bill Bowerman, a man who found a way to make running shoes with the help of a waffle iron. Ed O'Neill, Breckin Meyer, and the lovely Amy Locane are good, in supporting roles.<br><br>Leto's acting, combined with a clever script, portrays Pre as gutsy, determined, intense, charismatic, vulnerable, at times reckless, self-absorbed, brash, and arrogant.  One of my favorite segments of dialogue has Steve and his teammate Pat Tyson jogging along, and talking about the great runner Jim Ryun.  Steve comments: \"Forget Jim Ryun; he's done; I'm gonna be the first Steve Prefontaine\", to which Pat responds: \"It must be nice to want to be yourself\".<br><br>Later, Pre frustratingly says to his girlfriend Nancy: \"All of my life people have said to me: you're too small Pre; you're not fast enough Pre; give up your foolish dreams Steve.\"<br><br>Pre's story is told in another film: \"Without Limits\"; both now available on DVD, and both good, though I prefer this Steve James directed movie.<br><br>Often and rightly compared to other sports films, \"Prefontaine\" reminds me of a film one might not think of.  Pre's life was similar in some ways to another notable person from an ordinary background, one who set out bravely on a personal quest, of sorts, and who, in the process, like Pre, made a powerful and lasting impression: Karen Silkwood.<br><br>Coincidentally, Pre's fate and Karen's fate were tragically similar, and only six months apart.  In both \"Prefontaine\" and \"Silkwood\", the message to the rest of us ordinary mortals is: don't underestimate your life; do your best; and make each day count.  You never know when \"fate\" may intervene.","user":"Lechuguilla","rank":[29,31]},{"title":"Excellent Sports Film","rating":10,"date":"12 July 2002","review":"I saw this last night on the BBC--I don't think it ever had a theatrical release in Britain--and thought it was excellent. I remember this film and its rival, Without Limits, when they were released in 1997 but never saw them. Users have commented on how much this film resembled the '70's era, right down to the soundtrack and overall style of the film, as if that kind of authenticity is to its detriment. It does remind one of that '70's TV movie classic, Brian's Song, but then, what other era should this film resemble?! It's no surprise that the documentary storytelling style works so well since the director and writer, Steve James, made one of the most acclaimed documentaries of the '90's--the basketball flik, Hoop Dreams (highly recommended as well). But shooting a documentary and recreating the style of one are two different things and though they probably both have their perils, recreating that style in service to drama must have much steeper pitfalls. Steve James (and company) completely succeed here. Jared Leto gives a compelling performance as Pre and forces the viewer to sympathise with him in very unique ways. He's not immensely likable but when he runs...one understands that great athletic performers, like Steve Prefontaine, did not win races on personality alone. But it's the way that the rest of cast responds to him, their admiration completely palpable and on the surface, that moves the viewer to embrace him as well. He's heartbreaking when he asks, \"Do I look like a runner?\" American sports films usually obscure their central figures by ladling on heavy doses of heavy-handed inspiration. Not so with this film. Pre emerges a gifted, young, confused but determined individual who inspires not through his athletic performances but through the strength of his character and what he did for amateur athletics. The ending doesn't so much jerk tears from the viewer as it allows them to flow freely and copiously. An underrated, lost gem of a film.","user":"bliss66","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"Captures the spirit of his times","rating":8,"date":"4 March 2003","review":"I was a grad student at the University of Oregon in the early seventies when Steve Prefontaine made his mark as a runner there. This film captures his life and times reasonably well, and Jared Leto's performance does a good job portraying the Steve Prefontaine the general public like me knew, though Leto has more of a preppy/Abercrombie &amp; Fitch appearance than the somewhat craggier Prefontaine. Those who knew him then personally can make a better, further assessment. Despite the limitations of its budget (for example, they shot the film in 16mm--Super16 actually), it's one of the better sports films made and should have had a stronger theatrical run. If memory serves, the release also had a woefully limited marketing budget.<br><br>An athletic apparel store in Boston has a glass case which displays one of Steve Prefontaine's running singlets. It made me pause to see it there, an inanimate object which once clothed someone so highly animated. This film does a decent job of bringing life to that persona.","user":"Tom-207","rank":[12,12]}]
