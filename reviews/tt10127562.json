[{"title":"Just stunning.","rating":9,"date":"13 February 2020","review":"At the moment i am seeing that the movie had the score of 4.9 and this is really unfair , the movie is absolutely stunning visually , a classical hero story for the all time fan of the franchise the Jrpgs, or classical shounen animes. Watching it in HD is an absolute delight, the 3D is top noch with the textures ,details and movements in most of the film that it kept me on my toes all the time looking at all the small details. Sometimes there s some small things that set me off like some scene when the are running or some of the textures... Anyway again the film is a lovely nostalgic yet modern trip especially for the fan of the series or the japanese animation fan in general.\nI gave it a 9 ,a score I wouldn't give all that easily .","user":"darkapple","rank":[28,33]},{"title":"It is AMAZING for fans, but might not be for everybody","rating":9,"date":"14 February 2020","review":"First of all. This movie has it's strongest impact if Dragon Quest 5 was a part of your childhood. I'm not sure I can recommend this to anybody doesn't have a strong emotional attachment to the source material.<br><br>Despite what you may have heard. The biggest issue is not the ending, it's the pacing. This movie has severe pacing issues. These issues come about from trying to cram too big of a story into an 1 hour 40 minutes movie.<br><br>For example. The movie cuts out the childhood section between the protagonist and and his childhood friend Bianca. Without such, why would anybody who's not familiar with the source material, care about who Bianca is when she's introduced. The movie jumps all over the place, so much so I would imagine for someone unacquainted with the game, it's hard to care or have any level of investment.<br><br>I feel like if this was an animated series, cutting the budget into more screen time and less visual work. Despite possibly losing how beautiful this movie looks, that extra time in the oven could've made it a way better overall experience. Not only for me, but also for people who had no idea what this movie is based on.<br><br>Speaking of beauty, yes this movie is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. Easily, one of the prettiest 3D animated movie's that I have ever watched. It's just so nice to look at. Backgrounds are so vivid and full of life, and the characters despite not using Akira Toryamas art, still look great.<br><br>This movie is brilliant, I didn't even care about the ending and the butchering of the source material. The original ending was boring anyway. Grandmaster Nimzo is a very hollow villain, who has no build up, besides his name being thrown around. The twist ending, although it shocked and confused me at first, was a much wiser choice.<br><br>Ultimately, I feel like the movie really doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting. It's looks so visually beautiful, makes amazing use the Dragon Quest music to enhance so many moments. It was very entertaining, and an amazing nostalgia ride. Overall a great watch all the way through.","user":"deltakerebus","rank":[20,25]},{"title":"A fanfare for people who played the game years ago","rating":9,"date":"16 August 2019","review":"As someone who played Dragon Quest V, long ago the story beats and characters are there. After the fact, I really appreciated the efforts that provided the excitement and with the context of your story.<br><br>All the bits and pieces of what makes Dragon Quest is present, and if you have played the game I'm sure it'll recall the moments and emotion that'll yearn for the world you know and love. Which is the point.<br><br>This isn't going to change your experience with your adventure, only reignite it.","user":"chibilola","rank":[18,28]}]
