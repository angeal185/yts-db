[{"title":"Not a family movie","rating":1,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"This movie was in the family section and it talks about his best friend \"banging\" his wife, he indicated he slept with \"Timmy's mom\", some unnecessary language. It just was disappointing to watch with my 3 kids and husband we ended up shutting it off after the \"banging\" commentary. They were coaching a little league \"bad news bears\" team and all the added drama made it in appropriate to view as a family. I NEVER wrote reviews but upsetting this was rated PG and in the family category.","user":"kandimcgeary","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"PG Adult feel good movie","rating":10,"date":"30 November 2018","review":"The story is more meant for adults. Its not a \"bad news bears\" story. Baseball is the staple but isnt the primary focus of the story. This is about a couple guys coaching a little league team which dialogue that borders on the PG/PG-13 line. The topics are mostly adult themed. Couple guys, have some issues both in the past and present they have to work through while also coaching a ball team. Dont take the baseball aspect too seriously. John C McGinley andGarret Dillahunt do an excellent job.","user":"bakerct78","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Very enjoyable. Recommended.","rating":8,"date":"7 November 2018","review":"McGinley and Dillahunt work well together in this drama/comedy. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments. I enjoyed the movie; it was engaging and pulled me in. The child actors are good and very good, but the movie is more about the two coaches (McGinley and Dillahunt) working together than it is about the kids. Overall, good movie. Watched the movie with teenage son and my wife...everyone enjoyed it. Give 'er a whirl.","user":"waderiniker","rank":[3,4]}]
