[{"title":"Powerful Drama From Ingmar Bergman","rating":10,"date":"27 February 2001","review":"Writer/director Ingmar Bergman examines the strained relationship between a mother and daughter in `Autumn Sonata,' starring Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullmann.  Eva (Ullmann) has not seen her mother, Charlotte (Bergman) in seven years; a successful concert pianist, Charlotte has spent a good portion of her life on the road, but after losing her long-time companion, Leonardo, Eva invites her to come to the parsonage where she and her minister husband, Viktor (Halvar Bjork), live, for an extended visit. Charlotte accepts, but soon after her arrival, old wounds and feelings begin to surface, and the film becomes an intimate character study of the life-long dysfunctional relationship between Charlotte and Eva, during which director Bergman intricately examines the causes and effects of all that has passed between them during their lives.  It's an in-depth look at the emotional damage human beings are capable of inflicting upon one another, and how fragile the line between love and hate becomes when subjected to incessant neglect by even one of the parties involved.  As the story unfolds and the principals bare their souls-- at last revealing a lifetime's worth of repressed feelings-- it becomes an emotionally devastating experience for the audience, as well, for there is much contained within the dynamics of this situation that most viewers will be able to identify with and relate to within their own lives. \tIngmar Bergman is a Master of presenting life as it truly is; reality-- and portraying it on the screen-- is his domain, and throughout his career he has veritably created almost a genre of his own in doing so.  With a microscope of his own design, he scrutinizes the basic instincts of the human condition, what makes people tick and how and why they relate to one another as they do.  Much of what he presents is startling, and always emotionally involving, because he penetrates so deeply and succinctly into the heart of the matter, as he demonstrates so superlatively with this film. His methods and style are unique, his talent unequivocal; many others have attempted to capture the essence of that which Bergman has perfected, but few have succeeded.  Interestingly enough, Liv Ullmann is one who, as a director, has probably come the closest to achieving that classic `sense' of Bergman, with her films `Private Confessions,' and `Faithless,' both of which were written by Bergman. \tIn her role as Eva, Ullmann gives one of the best performances of her career, for which she should have at least been nominated for an Oscar; that she was not is nothing less than a gross injustice.  She so skillfully conveys the depth and complexities of her character, and the differing emotional levels to which Eva is subjected, that it creates a lasting impression and makes her someone with whom it is easy for the audience to sympathize.  It makes you realize, upon reflection, what a truly gifted actress Ullmann is.  And, as good as Ullmann's performance here is, it is equaled-- though not, I would say-- surpassed, by Ingrid Bergman's portrayal (in her final theatrical appearance) of Charlotte; and in a renewal of faith that there is some justice in the world after all, she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress for it.  In retrospect, it seems somehow inevitable that the two Bergmans came together at last, though it's somewhat lamentable that their career paths did not cross sooner.  There is some consolation, however, in the fact that when they did finally join forces the result was such a powerful, memorable film. \tThe supporting cast includes Lena Nyman (Helena), Gunnar Bjornstrand (Paul), Erland Josephson (Josef) and Linn Ullmann (Eva as a child).  An intelligent, thought provoking and emotionally wrenching film, highlighted by outstanding performances and beautifully photographed by Sven Nykvist, `Autumn Sonata' is an example of filmmaking at it's best; it's a lasting tribute, not only to the immense talents of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, but to Ingrid Bergman, one of the most beautiful and gifted actresses ever to grace the silver screen.  I rate this one 10/10.","user":"jhclues","rank":[78,86]},{"title":"A Bergman Masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"22 December 2000","review":"Generally, either \"Seventh Seal\" or \"Persona\" is the film that a critic will name if s/he is stuck with the task of naming Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement.  A couple others might be named, but rarely do you hear a critic espouse the brilliance of \"Autumn Sonata.\"<br><br>The first thing I noticed about this film is that it is, like \"Cries and Whispers,\" nothing less than a painting.  The textures, the warm reds and the close-ups of the faces of wounded souls, all combine to make the viewer realize that s/he is witnessing High Art.<br><br>Then there's the shot of  Liv Ullman's wounded profile as she stares at her mother, Ingrid Bergman, while mother shows Liv how the Chopin piece should be played.  It is an eloquent scene.  Truly heartbreaking and unforgettable. One can feel Liv's pain begin to show itself: it is the painful shame of inadequacy and mediocrity made all the more shameful because it is mother inspiring these feelings in her.<br><br>Later, it's Liv's cruelty toward her mother in that unforgettable late night diatribe.<br><br>And finally, it's Liv's crippled sister and Ingrid's disgust at the thought that not only did mediocrity crawl out of her womb, but so did deformity and suffering.<br><br>The film is bleak (obviously) and the resolution is only slightly hopeful. It is however a masterpiece -- a film that reveals that what the world needs now is not Love, as the song proclaims, but Compassion and Grace.  Liv Ullman is the only actress who can say these things without opening her mouth.  Ingmar Bergman is the only filmmaker who can make a seemingly banal story into an eloquent prayer for redemption and reconciliation.<br><br>(CAUTION: Dont take mom to see it on mother's day ... unless...)","user":"bdpennington","rank":[72,80]},{"title":"One of the very, very best","rating":9,"date":"21 January 2003","review":"This is one of the very best Ingmar Bergman films I have seen, and therefore one of the very best films.<br><br>Ingrid Bergman and Liv Ullman are simply amazing together as a mother and daughter combination from hell.  Ingrid Bergman is terrific, despite a deliberately naff hairdo which makes her look like Queen Elizabeth II of the UK rather than the faded beauty she is.  Liv Ullman also has visual nuances to enhance her character - the glasses, platted hair and jumpers enabling this beautiful woman to look frumpy.<br><br>The acting is simply amazing, even through the subtitles you can tell. Fortunately Scandinavian vocal nuance is similar enough to English to enable us non-Swedish speakers to appreciate the acting.<br><br>Of course, it has the Ingmar Bergman darkness to it.  The sister with the horrible degenerative disease, the drowned toddler, the selfishness of the Ingrid Bergman character.  If you get depressed along with the characters in films like this, you might be better off giving this one a miss.<br><br>But for those with a taste for this type of claustrophobic drama, this is one of the most powerful films you will ever see.","user":"ian_harris","rank":[85,97]}]
