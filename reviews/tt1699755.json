[{"title":"Much better than the negative word of mouth it's gotten.","rating":6,"date":"11 September 2013","review":"'PEEPLES': Three Stars (Out of Five)<br><br>Two former TV comedy stars clash in this family relations film produced by Tyler Perry. Craig Robinson (of 'THE OFFICE' fame) and David Alan Grier (of 'IN LIVING COLOR' fame) play a children's song writer and the father of the woman he wants to marry (who takes a disliking to him). Kerry Washington (of 'DJANGO UNCHAINED' fame) plays the woman they're at odds over. The movie is a lot like 'MEET THE PARENTS' (except for the obvious difference of a black cast rather than a white one). It's funny, even though it's not that original in any way. Definitely not a bad film (like reviews and some cinephiles like to make it out to be). <br><br>Robinson plays Wade Walker, a man who makes a living writing and performing songs for children (as a sort of therapy). He's been dating his girlfriend Grace Peeples (Washington) for over a year now and she still hasn't introduced him to her family. The weekend Wade plans to propose to Grace she informs him she's going to her family's annual reunion in the Hamptons (for 'Moby Dick Day'). Receiving advice from his friend Malcolm (Chris Walker) Wade decides to show up at the Peeples reunion unannounced in order to ask Grace's father Virgil (Grier) for his daughter's hand in marriage. Things of course don't go as planned as Virgil immediately dislikes and distrusts Wade (and no man has ever been good enough for his daughter). <br><br>The film was written and directed by first time feature film director Tina Gordon Chism (who had previously written the 2006 comedy/crime-drama film 'ATL' and the 2002 marching band comedy flick 'DRUMLINE'). When I first saw the film advertised as 'TYLER PERRY PRESENTS PEEPLES' I had no desire to see it. I'm not a fan or Perry's; I think he sucks at drama and is even worse with comedy (I hate his 'Madea' character). I was intrigued by the pairing of Robinson and Grier though and thought it was great that Robinson was starring in his own movie. I think Robinson was great on 'THE OFFICE' and is awesome as part of the Seth Rogen/Judd Apatow team. He's a talented comedic actor and he's great in this as well. Grier is perfectly paired opposite him (as his antagonist) although it's odd to see him playing the grey-haired older fatherly character. I grew up watching him share the screen with the likes of Jim Carrey, Jamie Fox and the Wayans brothers on 'IN LIVING COLOR' and he doesn't seem like he should be that old already. He's not, he's only 58 (57 at the time of filming) and just 16 years older than Robinson. Still he's perfect in the part. The movie is funny, not hilarious or extremely memorable, but it works and it's much better than the negative word of mouth it's gotten.<br><br>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUymXeqlea0","user":"Hellmant","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"\"The cinematic equivalent of flat soda\"","rating":2,"date":"18 May 2013","review":"Tyler Perry Presents Peeples is a bad movie, but it's not a bad movie for a special reason. It's a lame, tired trudge through the kind of cutesy, \"look at me\" romantic-comedy genre of cinema that almost never feels as if it is trying. Films like these are usually an easy-sell to the public because there simply isn't a whole lot to stomach. Even during the climatic parts of the film does it feel that there isn't a whole lot going on in terms of development and plot progression. These pictures exist to provide audiences members with the kind of ninety-minute material that will not better them in any way, but not make them think too hard or burden them in any way.<br><br>If that's what you want, Peeples delivers on a level that pleases. For those seeking more intelligent fare, all I can say is seek on. The film feels like an urban redux of Meet the Parents, this time focusing on the likable but bland Wade Walker (Craig Robinson), a good-intentioned soul who makes a living off of singing songs to kids urging them to use their words and not their bodily fluids (?). He is dating the cute but equally bland Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington), who seems to be light years out of his league. Wade feels upset and unfulfilled that he hasn't been acquainted with Grace's family and decides that, in order to propose to her, he should crash the family's weekend stay in the Hamptons.<br><br>The head of the family is the bitter, mean-spirited Virgil Peeples (David Alan Grier), who sees Wade's good-natured but ill-fated attempts at connection and resonance as foolish ways to climb up the ladder of likability. He is more won over by Daphne Peeples (S. Epatha Merkerson), Grace's mother, and \"Sy\" (Tyler James Williams), their younger son.<br><br>What unfolds is a series of predictable and lame antics from a textbook of what a comedy can do to go from mediocre to nearly unwatchable in record time. The cast has all been cheery and capable before, but throw them together with some of the worst writing of the year in terms of realism and tonality and you have an affair that is just incredibly difficult to stay in-tuned with, even if only for ninety-five minutes.<br><br>Returning to the point of realism, the film seems to predicate its humor off of the unrealistic way the Peeples' respond to Wade's charm and affection for their daughter. They react in a way that no parent, ever, would respond to their daughter's boyfriend's acts of kindness. Much of this played-out, unrealistic cynicism comes from Grier's Virgil, who is so lowly human and condescending to Wade and his family that his character never comes close to the line of being funny or entertaining.<br><br>There's a scene that absolutely slayed me and that involved Wade, Grace, Virgil, and another member of the Peeples' distance family sitting in the living room and talking about what Wade wants to do in his future. After they take turns belittling him and treating his \"play it by ear\" plans as lunacy, Wade stands up and is about to propose to Grace when Daphne calls for suppertime. Everyone remarks about how excited they are for dinner and leave poor Wade standing alone in the living room, interrupted and with a lesser-ego. If Wade had done that to, say, Virgil, he'd be crucified.<br><br>It's that kind of instance we're supposed to regard as funny or entertaining. Maybe my humanity for characters in films has increased since I began reviewing, but it's scenes like that I find inexcusable and implausible. If the family hadn't been so unbelievable, acting like compulsive cults with military precision wearing raincoats at the smallest mention of rain and boasting Timex watches day-in and day-out, that scene alone would've been enough to regard every attempt the film has at emotional resonance or relatability has not only facile but completely unbecoming.<br><br>The film was written and directed by Tina Gordon Chism, who is responsible for writing the charismatic film Drumline that featured a young Nick Cannon and unmissable energy. While Tyler Perry's name is featured prominently at the forefront of the film's title, I don't blame him for the turnout. He can only fund money and input so much creative control into such a project. If he had manned the production ship, I would've at least respected earnest attempts at creating drama. Not implausible ones.<br><br>If you want a more unconventional film, with real human-interest, ethical issues, complex family relations, and even a romantic subplot try and seek out Jeff Nichols' brilliant Mud as your weekend diversion. It's a truly beautiful picture with themes and a wonderful sense of adventure - the kinds of things cinema was erected off of. Peeples is the cinematic equivalent of flat soda.<br><br>NOTE: My video review of Tyler Perry Presents Peeples, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF9o5GqyppQ<br><br>Starring: Craig Robinson, Kerry Washington, David Alan Grier, S.

It was light, amusing, and very entertaining. Finally a movie in which black people are like the black people I know. Professionals, that all use correct English, that are middle to upper middle class and have their own funny quirks. No the movie wasn't seeking the cheap laughs from portraying African Americans in the typical Hollywood skewed context. None of the black women \"went off\" or did the whole neck thingy. No one was selling drugs or eating fried chicken or living in the hood. <br><br>If you have any experience with African Americans like the ones portrayed here then you will enjoy the movie. If you want every African American movie to follow the stereotypical blue print that it seems directors and production houses insist upon promulgating then you might not. Excellent, smart, well written and completely undeserving of that 3.8 rating.","user":"shannon-684-884001","rank":[15,25]}]
