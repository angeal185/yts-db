[{"title":"Hilarious for the right audience","rating":10,"date":"4 November 2019","review":"Is this movie silly? Yes. Is it packed with toilet humor? Yes. Do you see the erect (and later, flaccid) penis of a monster? Yes. Is there an important take-home message you get from watching it? Absolutely not.\nSo why am I giving it 10 stars? Because it made me laugh uncontrollably.\nMaybe I'm different but even cheap laughs are good laughs.","user":"dr_faristuta","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"THE END didn't come quick enough for me","rating":1,"date":"27 June 2013","review":"I don't want to waste time dragging down this review like the movie did, so I'll mention some key elements.<br><br>Most of the movie was ad lib, they've admitted it. These are not theater actors, they're film actors. They're not trained to be good at doing things \"off the cuff.\" There WERE parts that were funny, but they were too few and far apart. The humor was sort of a slap in the face to my intelligence. I was more offended that I was expected to be entertained than I was the actual raunchy jokes. It was like a high school project with a really big budget.<br><br>Slap in the face #2. It was like watching a really long commercial. The characters actually fight over who gets to eat the milky way and describe why they love the product so much. Seriously? Aside from those things, there were a lot of little crappy plot devices that were way too forced. Why is Noah suddenly getting raped by Satan? Why does Franco's new multi million dollar concrete \"fortress\" home collapse within minutes catching fire, and why does it have a basement you can only access from outside? The overwhelming success of this movie in only its second week is proof that the standards of young movie goers is almost non existent. Better movies get drowned out because the industry is so over-saturated by crap like this, so in a sense, you can say that movies like this really are actually part of \"the end.\"","user":"blackismylove","rank":[508,879]},{"title":"A devil put aside for me","rating":9,"date":"12 June 2013","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the film, though in retrospect, I am not sure if it is really a great film--there's not much to compare it to. One thing's for certain: this film is not \"just like\" any other film you could name. It is one of the funniest films I have seen in quite a while. And I am probably going to miss the Rapture as a result of my enjoyment.<br><br>The film has graphic sex talk and graphic violence. The dialog could hardly be any nastier. And of course, hardly more sacrilegious. However, despite all of that, the film is surprisingly good-natured.<br><br>This is not a film for children or for family viewing. Anyone who is squeamish or easily offended should stay away.<br><br>And don't automatically assume that anyone over 40 would not like this film. I'm over 60; I had a great time. So I saw it a second time, and loved it even more.","user":"Ric-7","rank":[429,739]}]
