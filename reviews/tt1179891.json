[{"title":"Expect the expected...","rating":8,"date":"15 January 2009","review":"My Bloody Valentine 3D is one of those really rare kinds of horror flicks. It delivers buckets of gore, brisk pacing, and a lot of in your face 3D goodness. Sit close to the front of your theater for the maximum effect (if you dare!). There is brutality in king size portions, sure to satisfy the most hardcore of horror fans. They really pull out all the stops with that pickaxe's of his. <br><br>Perhaps most importantly though, the production and marketing teams were aware of what it what it was. At its core, its a cheesy mindless slasher film, and rather than try to overcome this, My Bloody Valentine acknowledges this trait and works with it. It owns it. Internet ads bore slogans such as 'Its actually 4D if you're wasted.' Never does it get bogged down trying to patch together an airtight story. It just keeps its unrelenting pace up from start to finish, and delivers what the audience came out to see, gratuitous violence.<br><br>A film like this is quite refreshing for the genre, not because it is artful by any means, but because it embraces its inherent trashiness. By deliberately failing to take itself seriously, My Bloody Valentine becomes something more than the majority of its peers can ever be. It becomes fun in the same way that a Poison concert or monster truck rally is fun. Take my advice and see this thing as it was meant to be seen, through beer goggles and a pair of cheap 3D glasses. Enjoy it for what it is and don't worry about the second thoughts you might have tomorrow morning.","user":"ps42","rank":[135,195]},{"title":"Full-fledged throwback to the golden age of slasher films","rating":6,"date":"21 March 2009","review":"A movie titled My Bloody Valentine is clearly non trying to pander to art house crowds, nor does it even seem to be reaching for a higher ilk in the horror genre, but while appearing as a fully tacky horror movie entry (a 3-D remake) My Bloody Valentine succeeds in avoiding and ultimately reviving the never ending pitfalls of such films; a strong, unique opening and a surprising and completely plausible, non-ridiculous finale. <br><br>Unfortunately the movie is not as strong as its bookend acts, but it is certainly gory, fun, terrifying, tense and nothing but entertaining. (And yes, there is also nudity). The use of the trademark, in your face, 3-D tactics is mostly restrained, although it seems that director Patrick Lussier (who has mostly been in horror movie limbo since he directed Dracula 2000) could not avoid the intermittent pickaxe to the screen. The performances are actually quite strong, and while this is becoming more the norm in horror films, MBV even forgoes the smart-alecky, prankster character which removes the propensity for us to be taken out of the film.<br><br>The unique opening is actually a three-tier start. Flashing newsreels reveal that the collapse of the Hanniger Mine in a small town which claimed the lives of 6 miners (Or was it something else that killed the men?). Awakening from a comma years later, the sole survivor of the cave-in, Harry Warden, picks up where he left off, slaying dozens before being killed himself concluding what the town dubbed the Valentines Day Massacre. But all is not what it seems, as 10 years later Tom Hanniger (Jensen Ackles), a near-victim of Warden, returns to the small town to sell the mine but the killings suspiciously begin once again and it is up to Tom to clear his name.<br><br>My Bloody Valentine is a full-fledged throwback to the golden age of slasher films, like Friday the 13th (and is ironically better then the Friday remake this year) and never for a single second tries to be anything it's not and in doing so, it ultimately becomes something it shouldn't be; fun.<br><br>6.5 / 10.0<br><br>Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com","user":"Simon_Says_Movies","rank":[58,81]},{"title":"A gory, fast-paced slasher film that delivers plenty of suspenseful action","rating":8,"date":"6 February 2019","review":"This is a solid, decent bloody, fast-paced decent slasher from 2000's that delivers plenty of suspenseful action. It is not a better than original slasher 80's but it is a decent solid remake that I enjoy. I like this film. I love the setting which takes place in the mine shaft and in the forest on a Valentine's Day. This movie has gore, nudity (in which original didn't had nudity) and it is a fun thrill ride.<br><br>This is a American remake of Canadian slasher film. From the cast too murder scenes these are impressive 3-D effects, the director Patrick Lussier knew what he was doing and everyone on the set did a fine job.<br><br>A young man, who survived a vicious massacre, returns to his hometown only to become the prime suspect when someone wearing miner's gear begins pick-axing the locals left and right!<br><br>This is a good impressive slasher film that I love. I love the 3D murder effects. I love in the opening scene in which a guy get's a pickax in the eye I love thate ffect. I love in which a retired sheriff get's a pickax in his jaw and you see that effect in which that mask murder takes out pickax from his jaw and you see a blood flying in the camera that is a satisfying gore. You see a nude topless girl walking around the parking lot and her ex boyfriend gets pickaxed and so does she later in the motel. I love the gore in this movie. I love Prodigal Son Soundtrack from Michael Wandmacher for My Bloody Valentine song. I love the masked killer in a miner outfit with mask and pickax not a bad custom I love it.<br><br>The performances from the three leads Jensen Ackles, Jamie King, and Kerr Smith are solid, decent I love them they are likable characters. You have Tom Atkins from Halloween III and The Fog. You have Kevin Tighe from Another 48 Hrs. who did another solid job in this movie. Jensen Ackles brought me in to this film because I was huge fan of his TV show Supernatural back than.<br><br>I love this film to death. Jansen Ackles I love the guy so much, I love his performance in this movie. Kerr Smith from Dawson's Creek and Final Destination was not bad as Sheriff Axel Palmer I enjoyed his performance I love him. Jaime King from Slackers as Sarah Mercer Palmer was a sexy babe, but smart she out smarted the killer I love her as the final girl. I love Betsy Rue as Irene she is not bad at all I love her been all nude in this movie. I don't prefer the remake over the original but it is an pair with the original for me.<br><br>I love the good twist in the climax on the end, definitely my favorite slasher in remakes of all time.","user":"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","rank":[7,8]}]
