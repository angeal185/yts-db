[{"title":"Absolutely awful.","rating":2,"date":"1 August 2016","review":"I would have given this movie a 3/10, but the lower rating is from sheer disappointment. This movie had such a great idea, but was executed so poorly.<br><br>We see a hard-working mom of two with the stereotypical doof-ball husband, dealing with PTA moms who seemingly have nothing better to do than make her life harder.<br><br>Aside from the TERRIBLE acting, horrible cringe inducing dialogue, it just wasn't funny. The countless crappy attempts at \"humor\" fell flat on their face over and over and, had I not been with a friend, I would have left after 15 minutes.<br><br>But I had to endure a SAGA of ridiculous story lines, and so many loose end tie ups. By the end I was actually willing the movie to stop so I could leave.<br><br>Just, so awful. Terrible performances, a terrible script, a disgrace to the film industry and moms everywhere. Save your money and your time.","user":"kimberly-chanin","rank":[203,351]},{"title":"A Bad Movie for Moms","rating":3,"date":"4 August 2016","review":"Five minutes into Bad Moms, I already knew that I had made the wrong choice. I was hoping for a silly comedy staring some actresses I find to be hilarious (Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn.) This was not the case, as most of the jokes are raunchy, cringe-worthy mom jokes.<br><br>The worst thing about this movie, which is obvious from the opening monologue, is that it is corny. The story is corny. The characters are corny. The jokes are corny. The only audience that might let them get away with this cheese-fest, is mothers, because they will be able to relate.<br><br>This movie has its moments, but the majority of its laughs fall flat. Particularly bad were a couple of different montages, specifically, one of the girls drunk grocery shopping. Most disappointing is how unfunny Kathryn Hahn is, it seems that every word that comes out her mouth has to do with sex.<br><br>This movie also fails to follow some of the basic rules of a screenplay. The characters speak for the writer, not for themselves. The main conflict doesn't even come up until half way through the movie.<br><br>The brightest spot of this movie is Kristen Bell's character Kiki, who is a weird stay at home mom. She provides almost all of the enjoyment you will get out of this film. JJ Watt and Martha Stewart also have funny cameos.<br><br>I would not recommend this movie unless you are a mother. If you are anything but, avoid this train wreck at all costs.<br><br>Game of Thrones SPOILERS BELOW<br><br>They also spoiled Jon Snow's death for the sake of a mediocre joke. Not Cool.","user":"Kevin_C1","rank":[114,196]},{"title":"Bad Movie.","rating":2,"date":"8 August 2016","review":"Bad Moms (2016): Dir: Jon Lucas, Scott Moore / Cast: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith: Bad movie plainly with a gripe about the tiresome schedule of motherhood. Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell is the one passable character in this garbage. She caught her husband engaging in Internet sex so she kicks him out and discovers her schedule getting tighter. She makes friends with Kiki, played by Kristen Bell who is meant to be quirky and funny but just comes off as plain annoying. Kathryn Hahn as Carla advocate the need for sex within nearly every word that emerges from her mouth and it grows old quick. Christina Applegate and Jada Pinkett Smith are a total waste as antagonist school board bullies intent on pushing their agenda to the point of even stashing marijuana in the locker of Amy's daughter. The premise is rushed and the structure is predictable and boring. This is bad in more ways than one with two directors committing to a choppy and uninspiring job with production values straight out of the worst of direct-to- video bargain bid deals. Sure, it has a worthwhile message of the stress of motherhood, especially those balancing a job as well but the results here are embarrassing. The film concludes with the actresses sitting with their mothers discussing their upbringings. That is better than anything that appears in the film. This is clearly a film aimed at mothers and for them I say, good luck. This film is lackluster with no sign of an existing screenwriter. Perhaps the mothers could have gathered and wrote something that wasn't this bad. Score: 2 Â½ / 10","user":"anaconda-40658","rank":[85,144]}]
