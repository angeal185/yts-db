[{"title":"Surprisingly very entertaining, much better than it had a right to be","rating":7,"date":"5 June 2016","review":"Having never played the app/game, it was going to be interesting to see whether 'The Angry Birds Movie' was going to make something interesting out of it and how it was going to be succeed.<br><br>'The Angry Birds Movie' is not perfect, but this reviewer was really surprised at how much she enjoyed it. There are better animated films out there and there were better released this year (i.e. 'Zootropolis' aka 'Zootopia' in some places), but also far worse on both counts. From the two animated films seen recently at the cinema, 'The Angry Birds Movie' is the superior film of the two. The other was 'Ratchet &amp; Clank', which is not as bad as critics made out (personal opinion of course) and could have been much worse considering video game adaptations' dubious track record, but also had too many flaws to be considered a good film.<br><br>Getting the flaws out of the way, the story in 'The Angry Birds Movie' is somewhat flimsy and has a tendency to be thin on the ground with a couple of unnecessary parts and parts that don't really go anywhere. It does occasionally feel rushed too, and while the film entertains hugely a vast majority of the time there are a couple of gags that misfire. This is especially true with the quite tasteless, awkwardly placed and too overlong urination gag, that was also really quite out of place.<br><br>However, the animation in 'The Angry Birds Movie' is great. The colours are sumptuous and brightly vibrant, the characters are well-modelled and never look stiff or ugly and there are some very colourful and meticulously detailed backgrounds. There are also some very imaginative visuals in the action sequences. The music never makes the mistake of being stylistically jarring or over-bearing, and has a lot of infectious personality and energetic verve.<br><br>While not hilarious as such and unashamedly but endearingly silly, the script has some very funny moments, is tonally balanced with very little that's inappropriate or distasteful, is solidly balanced without being disjointed or muddled and there are some clever and witty lines. The action sequences are beautifully animated and thrilling, the message is a great one, gives the film a surprisingly emotional core without being over-sentimental or preachy and the climax is quite the knockout and the highlight of the film.<br><br>'The Angry Birds Movie's colourful characters carry the film beautifully, with a protagonist that is easy to relate to and Mighty Eagle despite being a marmite character is great fun. The villains do pose a reasonable threat though are not particularly interesting. The voice acting, including actors who you wouldn't expect to work as well as they did in voice acting, is excellent, with the best contribution coming from Peter Dinklage.<br><br>All in all, surprisingly very entertaining and much better than it had a right to see considering what it was based on. 7/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[21,26]},{"title":"Nice. Picturesque and eclectic. Merry. A very pleasant movie!","rating":8,"date":"6 October 2016","review":"Hilarious. Silly. Action-packed (everything goes ta-dam, cities and castles crash in the fire, birdies and piggies are screaming, running away, and nobody knows what's happening). Everyone in the movie is an idiot (birds, because they cannot understand Mr. Leo's making fools of them. And the piggies, because they just want to have some eggs for dinner. They don't really get, if that's such a big fault to be pursued and beaten).<br><br>The piggies are bad, of course. But that's what makes them adorkable (I could even say, it adds to their nicety). So, if I choose between Leo's folks and Red's comrades... let me choose neither. They're all alike, charming and brainless.<br><br>Now the character which is little use here for me is the Eagle. He just sits on his mountain and makes everybody (including us, the viewers) waste our time on his banjo playing. Sure, he relents at the end, and even gets a monument from the grateful bird people. (That was a hilarious joke, when he looked at his own portrait, and suddenly felt ashamed before himself. But I daresay that was the only funny moment about him).<br><br>The cartoon as a whole is not worse from other Sony children's works. For example, it reminded me of The Pirates - just as much merriment, just as much madness, just as much unobtrusive moral. (Yes, The Pirates are one of a kind, I know. But this is as close to them as possibly may be. If you want to experience the pure childish joy of going wild and letting your instincts free, this 'toon will give you two hours of positiveness). I highly recommend to watch it, even if you're not familiar with the game. <br><br>(Who isn't, though?)","user":"anaahnu","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"I can guarantee you this great movie will make you happy.","rating":10,"date":"20 May 2016","review":"The movie takes place on Bird Island, an untouched paradise inhabited by birds who are naive and innocent. These good birds know nothing of the outside world. They treasure eggs above all else, and are all carefree and easygoing, except for few. One of these birds is Red, a societal outcast who has had anger issues from the very beginning. Eventually, his outbursts become too much and he is sentenced to anger management courses, where he meets other misfit birds with similar problems.<br><br>The birds are suddenly visited by green pigs, who are dumb but funny. The birds and pigs quickly befriend each other, but Red does not trust the pigs at all. Ultimately, the pigs reveal their true colors, and leads to Red leading the entire flock in a \"maddening\" frenzy of rightful revenge as well as finding the right means of dealing with rage.<br><br>Everything about this movie is impressive . I can guarantee you this great movie will make you happy.","user":"RealityHurts","rank":[155,248]}]
