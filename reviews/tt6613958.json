[{"title":"Unique story and passable acting but it falls with the script","rating":6,"date":"25 March 2020","review":"Where to start? \"The Bygone\" is quite an interesting film that seems to have passed by critics and audiences without leaving any notice. Young ranger Kip Summers (Phillips) crosses paths with Native American trafficking victim (Toboni) and gets dragged into a world of crime, control, and danger. \"The Bygone\" can probably be described as the essence of neo-Western, and that in the best way possible. The cinematography should really get some credit; the vast landscapes and environment shots adds to the film's gloomy, isolated atmosphere. The acting is also passable, if not more than that, the main issue with the characters is their somewhat stereotypical character arcs, rather than the way they are portrayed by their respective actors. To summarize, \"The Bygone\" had a lot of potential, from its interesting themes to its great visuals, but somewhere along the line, writing/directing team Graham and Parker Phillips (Graham plays Kip) lost themselves. The pace is a bit uneven, thrills are delivered but only for short period of times, and many scenes are, if not unnecessary, boring and without any greater purpose. The climax towards the end stirs the film in a strange direction, with Kip's uncle Beckett (Coster) being a gruesome, racist serial killer with a torture fetish and suddenly, \"The Bygone\" ends in a archetypical slasher/horror way. That is the mark leaves when you're done watching it, and all the scenes leading up to the final twist are nothing but a faded memory. It is a shame because this is a movie that could have been a great, artsy movie.","user":"snowfre","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"slow paced , but has its highlights","rating":6,"date":"12 November 2019","review":"I knew this was a film from the present, but my goodness how this looked like a good ol' wild west cowboy love story, so if it hadnt been for the motorized wheels, the wind turbines and the galloping gerties, i wouldve accepted it. in a way it reflects the modern day wild west up the in the northern states , that attracts oil workers to come in steems, and with the steem the hardware store and the prostitutes for lust and entertainment are following close.<br><br>because its a story about one of theso prostitutes, and a native ranchers son whos has been a cowboy from the day he could straddle a horse. clashing togeter under serious circumstances he falls in love and promise her protection at the ranch. but the pimp wont allow that to happen and then the race is on.<br><br>there are some really ravishing bar fights and a lot of unfairness against the indian dame and the cowboy himself. the acting are merely great not superb. the spirit of the movie are gloomy , grey, dark and harsh visually and emotionally, so you are not entering a comedy, thats for sure.<br><br>but the grumpy old man have seen lots of films worse , also better ones, but it stings, thats for sure wether you like it or not. its a recommend","user":"ops-52535","rank":[27,39]},{"title":"Political correctness garbage masquerading as a western.","rating":1,"date":"13 November 2019","review":"Absolute zero. From the opening credits, declaring that there was no sexual violence in America before Europeans brought it with them - I mean how stupid can someone be? - to the bitter - and ridiculous - end.<br><br>The protagonist is typically a sickly, pale, skinny white male with less testosterone than a rock, a sniveling little man-child, always getting beaten or helped out by others, with zero strengths or smarts, just a big ol' moral compass, telling others what to do with no idea how to actually do it.<br><br>The plot is just as dumb; the aforementioned genius steals a prostitute from her whorehouse and lo and behold, her pimp wants her back - and he does get her with no effort or feeling, the white knight is just that useless.\nWhat happens next is just as strenuous to the viewer's grip on reality and hardly entertaining.\nWhen they finally introduce the oil tycoon = racist serial killer arc it's so over the top it's hilarious and surreal.<br><br>This movie checks all boxes of cultural decline and alienation from truth. There's something stupid or harmful being spat in literally every other sentence. The fact that they seem so noticeable may detract from the very real danger of being so permeated by lies you'll stop registering them. Your mind is a neural network; don't train it with garbage.","user":"Tyndareon","rank":[48,95]}]
