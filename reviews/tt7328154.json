[{"title":"Pointless","rating":1,"date":"28 February 2019","review":"Very pointless movie with random rape scenes, it's really an awful storytelling taste.\nActually there is no real story neither characters, it's just random rich guys going in a holiday and abusing young girls. Waow.<br><br>At least the photography is OK. That's where my only star belongs.","user":"achmoye","rank":[44,74]},{"title":"It's no Holiday for the audience.","rating":1,"date":"14 July 2018","review":"I had the misfortune to watch this movie at Revelation Film Festival this afternoon. Rev's blurb describes Holiday as 'deep, disturbing, and truly powerful'. Maybe they had to edit for space? 'Oh yeah, there's a rape scene as well. Very graphic. VERY graphic. We just thought we'd warn you in advance.' Yeah - I guess that line was considered superfluous.\nAnd this was the work of a woman director. Yay women directors! If a man had his name on this, I don't think deep disturbing and truly powerful would be the adjectives employed. In fact the whole movie is such a void that this vile scene seems to be there only to differentiate it (in the worst way possible) from all the other movies about brainless young women and their moody crim boyfriends.\nSkip this Holiday. Stay home!","user":"gregoryno6","rank":[43,74]},{"title":"Tedious waste of my time and the Producer/Directors efforts","rating":2,"date":"3 March 2019","review":"I kept waiting for something ANYTHING interesting to happen in this slow walking piece of cinematic dreck. Alas Nothing. Oh wait the heroine gets slapped three times! Not nearly enough for participating in this god awful mess of a film. Someone needs to shred everyones SAG card involved in this. Please don't waste your time here - I only wish I could have mine back. Life is far too short","user":"mcgilacudyyahootie","rank":[31,55]}]
