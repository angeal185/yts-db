[{"title":"Standard peril-in-the-woods thriller","rating":3,"date":"8 March 2017","review":"PREY, IN COLD BLOOD is another film that utilises that tired old premise of having a bunch of characters going away for a quiet weekend in a cabin in the woods only to fall foul of unexpected menace. This one's not supernatural but rather mixes in criminal elements with the presence of a murderous gang desperate to get their hands on some loot in the area.<br><br>It's pretty poor for what it is, although given the budgetary constraints I suppose you can't hope for much more. The one twist is that the characters are all middle-aged rather than the usual teenage victims, so the acting is a little better than usual. The kill scenes are very poor indeed although there's one great topless scene. The film becomes an action adventure towards the climax. It's not the worst I've seen, although still far from the best.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Poor writing only overshadowed by poor acting","rating":1,"date":"8 August 2018","review":"The writing of this movie does not observe any type of continuity whatsoever, and the far fetched nature of every scene somehow makes it predictable. Calling the acting in this movie sub par would be a complement. The storyline made no sense Nor did the portrayal of the characters by the actors. In different parts of the movie the script contradicts its self. How this made it to any type of broadcast is beyond me. The only shred of talent exhibited during the entire film was from Darri Kristin. Save yourself the 2 hours for any other movie or shows.","user":"Michael-Carroll2","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"The Characters Are So Obnoxious You Will Be Rooting for Their Deaths","rating":1,"date":"25 August 2018","review":"So many negatives, so little time. One, the main characters are so obnoxious, you will be rooting for them to be killed; the two male leads constantly pick on the nerdy guy, and the two female leads (including the nerdy guy's sister) do not stick up for him. Two, the CGI violence is terrible. Three, the script is bad. The plot is poor and nonsensical at times; as in slasher movies, several times the heroine thinks the villain is dead, but he comes back. Lines which seem intended to be humorous aren't. Four, the acting is poor, though the female leads are not too bad. This is a very poorly written, acted, and plotted film. <br><br>There are a few positives The main characters are all middle-aged which is refreshing for this type of film. The female leads are attractive, and one has a nice topless scene. Finally, the obnoxious characters get what's coming to them; the only survivor is probably the nicest.<br><br>This is one of those movies which are so bad they can be entertaining. Unless you enjoy those or watch movies for a bit of nudity, skip this.","user":"tclark55","rank":[1,1]}]
