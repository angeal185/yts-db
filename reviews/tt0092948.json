[{"title":"Alltime greats","rating":22,"date":"22 October 2004","review":"This movie came out late 1987, and people were dying for a sequel to \"Delirious\" which was 1983. If you go back and watch Richard Pryor's \"live in Concert\" or \"Here and Now\" you see that Eddie used some of Pryor's stuff, but gave it its own shot of himself (In delirious, Murphy does the \"bARBQ scene/story\" and he describes his aunt falling down the steps. It is the exact same description Pryor does in \"Live in Concert\" when he describes black women at funerals.) RAW used all the things that made Eddie Murphy famous; his deadon imitations, and his gift for telling stories. I can't even watch Martin Lawrence, DL Hughely, Cedric the Entertainer and a few others without noticing Eddie Murphy's influences right away. People forget how big he was, and how good- wayyy before he started doing bad talking animal movies. There are some debates over which was better Raw or Delirious....they are both hilarious, but you can tell the mindset was much different only 4 years later. In RAW, Murphy compares himself to Johnny Carson, while in Delirious he was just the most popular guy on Saturday Night Live. RAW is one of the best and funniest concert comedies ever, and I dare someone not to laugh out loud when watching it......NOTE: This movie was reviewed in 1987 when it came out by Siskel and Ebert \"AT The Movies\", which was when they were getting really popular in syndication, and it spurred one of the best on-air disagreements between the two EVER. Siskel likened RAW, and Eddie Murphy overall, as being as funny (or funnier)and outrageous as Pryor, Carlin or Lenny Bruce. He loved the movie. Ebert despised it, and chastised Siskel for being \"immature\" and he also felt that Murphy's attitudes toward women were patronizing, damaging and even went so far as to call RAW a \"pale imitation of a good comedienne\". I thought Ebert was nuts at the time, and now that Siskel is dead, I can't find any review of RAW on Ebert's website. I've emailed him numerous times about it, trying to figure out why a movie that was so popular, and not even that long ago, would not be in his database. Does anyone else thinks that sounds fishy?","user":"torr59","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Raw to the bone","rating":9,"date":"10 June 2011","review":"Many comics, like Jim Carrey, and Robin Williams, reach a certain age where they stop doing what they are good at and go into family movies. Jim Carrey was funny on In Living Color and Robin Williams has a certain magic with drama films, but now they continue to submerse themselves in the lowest common form of comedy. Cheap bathroom humor and little kid comedies that are in no way funny, nor clever. Eddie Murphy is no exception now doing such things as Daddy Day Care, Imagine That (remember that?), and those countless Shrek films.<br><br>But, with Eddie Murphy Raw, this was shot in 1987, when Murphy was a very vulgar and hilarious comedian. Eddie Murphy doesn't do anything like Delirious and Raw anymore, or does any sort of stand up comedy at all. These are two little pieces of his history that are now overshadowed by his lame kiddy comedies.<br><br>Eddie Murphy Raw is a ninety minute comedy special of him performing at Madison Square Garden in NY's Felt Forum. The comic discusses sex, women, actors, why whites can't dance (coming from a white man, so true), why Italians are motivated by Rocky, divorce, and just the topic of life itself. He gives his realism approach to everything, and even shows sympathy for Johnny Carson losing half of his money to his wife after their divorce.<br><br>The language in the film is absolutely filthy and the women dialog is incredibly misogynistic and degrading. But it's hilarious and has its own truth behind it. I'm sure Eddie cares about women, but some of the things he says about divorce is relatively, right on the money.<br><br>By the end of the special, it goes a tiny bit downhill which is exceptional because most of the beginning was hilarious and very funny. Raw is the sequel to Delirious, which is one I will be sure to see in the future. Going into this with only average expectations I came out very surprised at what I just saw. I almost had to sit down and have a long talk with myself about right and wrong. It's that good.<br><br>Starring: Eddie Murphy. Directed by: Robert Townsend.","user":"StevePulaski","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"What a show","rating":10,"date":"16 September 2003","review":"Imagine:  You produce the taping of the show for, let's be generous, for about 1 Million US$.  We're talking six to eight cameras.  Then you take the show to the theaters and gross a cool 50.000.000 !  This can only work, when you tape Eddie Murphy on stage in on of the best comedy shows ever!  Saw it live in L.A.  What a great timing the guy has.  Get a chance and see the VHS (where is the DVD?) and you'll have the best of times, while you're at it, grab a \"momma burger\" and a beer.","user":"GMTMaster","rank":[4,4]}]
