[{"title":"This movie is worth watching.","rating":8,"date":"6 July 2016","review":"I just wanna join the people who think this movie is awesome. If you like romantic comedies with ridiculous antics, this film will have you smiling and laughing in no time. It's better than any Sandler or Farrell movie recently released. Anyone who gives this less than a 7 star rating was probably not in the mood for this type of movie. Last night I watched The Hateful Eight and although I'm a massive Tarantino geek I actually enjoyed this more. I might be a little bias as I also love Silicon Valley, but we can't always be in the mood to watch a cinematic master peace. Sometimes we just want to be transported away to a place that doesn't take itself to seriously.","user":"filmeddows","rank":[18,27]},{"title":"Funny at times, outrageously bad and of poor taste at other times.","rating":5,"date":"10 September 2018","review":"Movie would have been lot better, if the writers thought about it with some common sense. Some scenes were hilarious, but some dumb and dumber. Not a total waste of time, but almost there.","user":"wkcranberry","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Under rated Worthy Comedy with an undeserved rating","rating":8,"date":"23 May 2015","review":"I was looking for a good comedy over the weekend. Happened to come across this, I sort of liked the idea but then I looked at the rating it was given. That kind of put me off. However I still decided to watch it. I must say I was amazed.<br><br>Its a hilarious comedy, unpredictable in the are you high kind of way. I thoroughly enjoyed it and specifically wrote this review, my first one to let others know, the rating is deceptive, it has been for some reason underrated which this title does not deserve.<br><br>I have given it an 8. I think it deserves that.<br><br>If you are looking for a fun over the weekend unpredictable comedy for good laughs, this is it.","user":"Zaturn","rank":[30,58]}]
