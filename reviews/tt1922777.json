[{"title":"Scary.","rating":8,"date":"31 July 2016","review":"This is about as scary as I want to movie to be. I genuinely jumped a few times watching this and once or twice muted the sound. Which makes me laugh writing it, but trust me, there are scenes in this film that challenge the old ticker. A cardboard box in the hallway comes to mind. Those who've seen the film will know what I mean. I particularly liked the use of the found footage in this movie. It was very well integrated into the overall film and extremely disturbing. There is definite potential to make a sequel to this, as the story is set up to have a new chapter. I'd watch it during the day next time. Highly recommended for jump-scare horror fans.","user":"johnwiltshireauthor","rank":[58,70]},{"title":"Horreur technologique","rating":7,"date":"12 October 2012","review":"In this day and age, horror is getting more and more creative by demand since the psycho killer in the woods-scenario has pretty much run its course. A consequence of that is the incorporation of contemporary technology and concepts appearing in the genre; \"found footage\" films have replaced Jason and Michael, and while these films do have potential (this year's indie \"V/H/S\" had some neat ideas), even they are beginning to lose steam. Enter \"Sinister\", which is an amalgam of timeless supernatural horror themes and \"found footage\" technique that has proved to be a consistent box office draw.<br><br>\"Sinister\" follows a true crime author, Ellison (Ethan Hawke) who moves his family (unbeknownst to them) into a house where an entire family was hung to death in a tree in their backyard, save the youngest daughter who vanished without a trace. Upon moving in, Ellison finds a box of 8mm footage and a projector in the attic; contained in these reels of film are various murders dating from the 1960s up to present day— one of them is the filming of the hanging murder that occurred in his backyard. As he furthers investigation into the footage, he finds more than he bargained for when connections are made to an ancient deity who takes the souls of children.<br><br>On a surface level, \"Sinister\" appears like every other horror piece on the market, but I was surprised by the substance the film had. Conceptually and thematically speaking, it's not painfully original, but director Scott Derrickson makes up for that with striking visuals and a daunting soundtrack. The opening of the film is particularly disturbing— the movie begins with the family hanging murder, which sets a damned unsettling tone for the rest of the film.<br><br>In terms of the supernatural elements at play in the script, they almost seem fairytale-ish (a Pagan deity who feeds on children— c'mon), but it does add a unique element to the film. I have to say though that the most frightening thing in this movie are the actual murder tapes themselves. It could be just me, but the notion of filmed murders unsettles me to the core, even if I know that the footage is faked; as if the act of murder itself isn't awful enough, documenting it is downright... well, sinister. The footage utilized in the film is unsettling, shocking, and above all, it's realistic, so the audience gets the same unpleasant feelings shared by Ethan Hawke's character. Truly macabre stuff.<br><br>Another major positive for this film is that the acting is far above par for what most genre fans are dealt. Ethan Hawke is a quality actor and newcomer Juliet Rylance proves her chops here; their scenes together are particularly strong, and much more than any horror fan could dream of asking for. The film's ending can be seen from a certain distance, although it doesn't necessarily make it less shocking in this case. If anything, it adds to the sense of dread pervading the film.<br><br>Overall, \"Sinister\" was a pleasant surprise for me. It doesn't offer heaps in terms of originality, but it's a stylistically stunning film and takes steps in the right in direction very gracefully. When it comes down to it, I can't say that I was even really \"scared\" by the film so much as I was unsettled by it. It has its share of orthodox jump scares, but I was more bothered and rattled by the grim nature of the film as a whole, which is a nice feeling to walk away from the theater with as a thick-skinned genre fan who has become increasingly harder to unnerve. 7/10.","user":"drownnnsoda","rank":[168,235]},{"title":"The movie for jaded horror fans who think nothing can scare them","rating":9,"date":"10 October 2012","review":"Directed and scripted by Scott Derrickson (\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose,\" 2008's \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\") from a C. Robert Cargill story, \"Sinister\" is an exquisite realization of an original paranormal theme. The movie debuted in this same town's SXSW Film Festival in March.<br><br>Ethan Hawke is Ellison Oswalt, a true crime author and devoted family man with a what-have-you-done-for-us-lately fan base and editor anxiously awaiting his next blockbuster. Wife Tracy (Juliet Rylance) and youngsters Ashley (Clare Foley) and Trevor (Michael Hall D'Addario) are tired of constantly moving from town to town as Oswalt is wont to plant temporary roots close to the subjects of his ripped-from-the-headlines novels. As the film opens, the Oswalts are moving into yet another new house, but Ellison swears this is the last time, and selectively informs his family of his intentions.<br><br>In the process of unpacking, Ellison discovers a box of the previous owner's old home movies in the attic. Thus begins the odyssey into the unknown. Let it be said at the outset that this is not \"just another found footage film.\" In reversing the role of viewer and protagonist, to some extent, it's Hawke's character who discovers the reels while we see his story played out on screen. We don't spend two hours watching shaky 8MM footage. They are integral to the narrative but aren't the sum of its parts.<br><br>In his horror debut, Hawke turns in a striking tour-de-force performance that rivals anything I've seen recently (\"Insidious'\" Patrick Wilson comes close). Rylance is delightful as the patient but exasperated wife who's barely willing to stand by her man for one more moment. Foley (Abby in \"Win Win\") and D'Addario (Josh in \"People Like Us\") are frighteningly authentic as the glue that holds this tight-knit family together. Fred Dalton Thompson (\"Law &amp; Order's\" D.A. Arthur Branch and former U.S. Senator) does a star turn as the stubborn sheriff who will have nothing to do with outsiders tarnishing his town's already-shaky reputation. Welcome comic relief comes from underrated character actor James Ransone (\"Ken Park,\" \"Inside Man,\" HBO's \"The Wire\").<br><br>This is Ethan Hawke's first foray into this genre, a simple consequence of his passion for the material. \"He said he'd never do horror,\" paraphrasing the filmmakers in the Q&amp;A following the screening here, but he fell in love with Derrickson's script. The casting of Juliet Rylance as his wife was also done at his suggestion. Their on screen chemistry is undeniable.<br><br>The technical team doesn't miss a beat. Top-notch visual effects are always key in a film like this, but the common flaw in this genre lies in overdoing it. CGI and post-production trickery can certainly advance the narrative where appropriate but \"Sinister's\" old school in-camera effects, done while shooting, enhance the believability of the action.<br><br>Cinematographer Chris Norr eschews hand-held for stationary tripod shots and Hitchcockian slow pans, with POV tracking shots that allow the audience to sense the protagonist's growing paranoia. The occasional subjective POV angle, where the character looks at the camera, effectively places the viewer into the scene.<br><br>Lighting in the Oswalt home, where most of the action takes place, is appropriately subdued and rife with interplays of light and shadow. Hawke is often seen in silhouette, masking dark corners hiding secrets, literally. Terrifying night scenes beg the question, \"Why are you going up into the attic?\" Christopher Young's original score blends perfectly with needle-drop songs from some of the filmmakers' favorite indie bands. In a typical production, where third party songs will be inserted, the actors work to a temp track -- music that plays in the background until the company can obtain licensing for the tunes they want for the finished product, usually unknown (although often hoped for) during filming, that are then added to the soundtrack in post-production. With \"Sinister,\" Derrickson and his team were able to purchase the rights prior to shooting so the cast members performed to a playback of the songs that would actually be used in the final cut. It does make a difference, especially when seasoned professionals like Hawke are \"acting\" in sync with the same music the audience hears in those scenes. It creates a symbiotic ambiance that links viewer to actor.<br><br>As a reviewer, I try to keep expectations out of my thoughts and writing. After all, it's only fair to the filmmakers (and me, and my readers) to judge a movie on its merits. Fortunately, it's not too much of a challenge to be as objective as possible when entering the theater, especially if it's a premiere and no other reviews are out there (and you haven't watched a trailer). But Fantastic Fest is a genre festival, after all, and one would not attend, theoretically, without being a fan of same. So expectations are placed on the film simply by virtue of the fact it's even being shown.<br><br>That's why I'm happy to report that \"Sinister\" was all I hoped it would be. Yes, this is why I attend Fantastic Fest and movies like this make it worth the trip. This is the flick for jaded horror fans who think nothing can scare them. This one does it. \"Sinister\" will give you nightmares.","user":"larry-411","rank":[284,412]}]
