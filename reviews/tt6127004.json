[{"title":"Looks nice","rating":3,"date":"11 September 2019","review":"Oddly I just watched Level 16 last week and there are massive similarities between the two. Main juxtaposition being that this is set in a visually stunning fantasy world, while Level 16 is very bland and sterile. Problem with this film is that between the setup and getting anywhere there's a weak romance plot coupled with weak character development. I really couldn't care what happened in this film.","user":"aeongale","rank":[76,97]},{"title":"Not as good as it thinks it is","rating":3,"date":"3 September 2019","review":"IN A NUTSHELL:\nThis Sci-fi horror/thriller is Allice Waddington's directorial debut. The film debuted at this year's Sundance Film Festival and quickly afterward, Samuel Goldwyn Films acquired the distribution rights. Unfortunately, it's not as good as it thinks it is.<br><br>TIPS FOR PARENTS:\nSome crude language and 1 F-bomb.\nSome violence<br><br>THINGS I LIKED:\nI'm a sucker for Milla Jovovich.\nI've been seeing Emma Roberts all over the place lately. Good for her. She sings in the movie too. A-lister Julia Roberts must be one proud auntie.\nThe young cast includes Danielle MacDonald, Awkwafina, Jeremy Irvine, and Eliza Gonzalez.\nFun and creative costume design.\nThe fantastical set designs were intriguing.<br><br>THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:\nThe sound kind of drove me nuts.\nSome of the acting wasn't very good. I've seen many of the actors do much better in other movies, so I was disappointed. It had everything to do with the poor script.\nI feel terrible saying this, but I was bored.\nSome of the scenes take place in dim moonlight, so it'll be hard to see what's going on if you watch this on a small device once the film goes to streaming or DVD.\nIt takes itself way too seriously.\nMany things are totally random and just don't make any sense at all. If they're symbolic, then I totally missed it. Everything just seemed really dumb and self-indulgent to me.\nYou can read the rest of my review at Movie Review Mom.","user":"trinaboice","rank":[84,118]},{"title":"Lame","rating":3,"date":"30 September 2019","review":"This is a kind of thing a teenager might enjoy watching because it definitely feels like the story was written by one. Or may be like some obscure comic book adaptation that looks ok on paper but is just too shallow for screen.","user":"doublespoon-39249","rank":[58,80]}]
