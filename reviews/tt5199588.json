[{"title":"Need More Than Pretty Pictures To Make A Film","rating":2,"date":"10 August 2016","review":"Like All Brain Farm releases- its Just Pretty Pictures..Nothing Else. We know Florence surfs..and...what else?? That's it..nothing more? Why even make a film. There is no story and you learn Nothing about the person being filmed. Any ambition in life beyond the self absorbed selfish surfing lifestyle. what about his family- father/mother,siblings, his friends his girlfriend, boyfriend, kids, his competitors? great filmmaking is much more than just pretty pictures. Someday a young extreme athlete will be brave and honest enough to open up their entire life to a filmmaker. Florence is obviously not that athlete and it will take more talented filmmakers than the gear obsessed dudes at Brain Farm to pull it off. This is just an expensive surfing highlights promo reel. We've all seem this a zillion times before,,,just the face has changed on the north shore.","user":"spinandmarty","rank":[24,37]},{"title":"One of the most beautiful, immersive films of this decade.","rating":4,"date":"4 December 2015","review":"Completely left in awe as to all the difficulty in attaining the footage that they got. And even more in awe as to how they could've made such a great film out of it. The film isn't just a \"surf film\" though, it functions at a much higher level than that. There's such a poetry to its images, and it really captures footage from such different locations and assembles it into a cohesive story without much of a narrative or, well, \"story\" by the usual definition. Heart, passion, and genuine creativity burst from this film from the get-go. Its editing, in both its film scenes and sound, is brilliaaaaant. And the music it uses just fits so perfectly. Every single second of this film was carefully structured. Quite frankly, it's just fantastic and easily one of my favorites of the year. It's such a wholly immersive experience, of the kind that no visual effects in Hollywood could achieve. <br><br>And did I mention that it may very well have the best opening title sequence of all time? Definitely the most beautiful.","user":"Red_Identity","rank":[14,27]},{"title":"not even a good surf movie","rating":2,"date":"13 February 2016","review":"I like movies and I like surf movies, but this was neither. If someone wants to waste 59 minutes on decent landscape footage then this is for you. Otherwise, I'd save my money and time. No point to the movie. No character development. Not even any drama or even some dumb surfers talking. Anything would've added to this movie. How about adding someone pulling into a wave eating spam musubi. A dolphin downing a porkchop when surfing a wave. Even some turtle licking his toe would've been better than this movie. Seriously, even if the whole movie was about a turtle popsicling his little toe would've been more entertaining than watching this toehead do the same trick over and over and over and over and over again. Anyhow, no spoilage alert here since there's nothing to spoil.","user":"jefe_kefe","rank":[17,37]}]
