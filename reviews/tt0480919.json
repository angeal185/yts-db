[{"title":"Not the best movie to tie up on Brass cinema.","rating":5,"date":"12 December 2005","review":"Typical movie of Brass's last licentious period. For those who don't know Tinto Brass I'm talking of his third period, from 'Così fan tutte' to this repetitive 'Monamour'. Nothing comparable to his previous period (from 1983 'La Chiave' to 1991 'Paprika'). Repetitive is the right attribute to this nasty movie, that lost the originality of 'Capriccio' or 'Senso 45'. It is another movie full of Brass obsessions like hungry voluptuous women, impatient to be sodomized, to be unfaithful, to go with everyone but not their husbands. Incredibly the sets are more or less the same of 'Senso '45', 'Fermo posta Tinto Brass' and 'Fallo!'. So the photography. Nothing new at all, also some shots are the same. On the background anyway you can still find out the usual Brass' hymn to sensuality and lust.<br><br>More interesting is, on the DVD edition (region 2), the making off, that show us all the tricks used to film all the 'deep impact' explicit sex scenes (i.e. fake penis, fake prospectives etc. etc.). Anna Jimskaia is Ukraine (just for your info) and was chosen by director for her bottom As usual!<br><br>SPOILERS follow.<br><br>The plot is very easy. During 2005 Mantova Festival Letteratura edition , Marta the deluded wife of Dario, a writer, meet Leon and start the habitual Brass lust-driven adventure. If you already saw the last seven Tinto's movie you won't find anything new, a part from the wonderful location (I would say better than the Venice of 'La Chiave' or 'Senso '45').<br><br>My vote is 5 out of 10.","user":"1felco","rank":[43,53]},{"title":"bottoms up, bottoms open and even bottoms on the toilet","rating":8,"date":"2 October 2008","review":"I suppose I understand the young couple who apparently picked up DVD of this film because it was described as an 'erotic thriller'. Something lost in translation there , I think. And for those who take exception to the non PC and violent elements, I guess if this is your first Tinto Brass movie you could be forgiven for being taken aback that this is not all silky hand upon silky thigh to the drone of some appalling musak. But, come on everybody else, this is Mr Brass, this is Italian, so we get gutsy action, bottoms up, bottoms open and even bottoms on the toilet. True, we are given to understand that the leading lady is fantasizing/desiring all of this whereas it is of course, Mr Brass who is in charge of the fantasies portrayed, but then this is only a movie. Anna Jimskaia comes from Tashkent, Uzbekistan and has been a circus performer and gymnast, so no wonder she can bend that bottom high and so beautifully. Max Parodi is a little over the top as her failing husband but Riccardo Marino is suitably moody as her 'French' lover. This may be a bit vigorous for some, lifelike prosthetic penises make you wonder, why not the real thing but whilst perhaps not the ideal first date movie, I reckon you get what's on the can","user":"christopher-underwood","rank":[33,49]},{"title":"Pointless Sexfest.","rating":4,"date":"4 May 2010","review":"This film occupies a kind of no man's land between erotic comedies and straight pornography, only instead of shell craters, barbed wire, and corpses this particular no man's land is a demented milieu of luxurious beds, Rabalasian frescoes, and prosthetic penises. At least I think they're prosthetic. I certainly hope so. One of them resembles something that should be found on a horse, or maybe an elephant.<br><br>The plot, what there is of it, is unremarkable. A young woman has been married for only six months to her publisher husband and already she's bored with his love making, so she seeks stimulation elsewhere -- in literature, in fantasies, in memories, and finally in the person of Leon, a tattooed French guy who turns out to be rough but satisfying trade.<br><br>The young blond is Anna Jimskaia. (Nobody else's name matters.) She's the kind of caricature of desirable pulchritude that Anita Ekberg parodied in \"La Dolce Vita.\" She's attractive, but in an entirely conventional way, no quirks, no individuality. And she's hefty all over. She doesn't merely walk. She minces and jiggles and bounces and sways her hips from side to side in a way that no man could possibly imitate.<br><br>It would only be a slight exaggeration to say that she has her clothes off as often as she has them on, so that we get to know pretty much every pore on her flamboyant body on a first-name basis.<br><br>The movie isn't worth going on about but, let me see, there are scenes of not only nudity, but urination, douching over a bidet, frottage, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, regular intercourse, threesomes, lesbianism, and -- I'm trying to remember. No, there were no animals.<br><br>I guess this satisfies Tinto Brass's fantasies or, more likely, he believes he's found a winning formula for making movies and money at the same time. I can't really recommend it with any enthusiasm because it's not my fantasies, which run more along the lines of giant tubs of Allegro marinade and upright alligators doing grotesque gavottes.<br><br>Not that there's anything wrong with the fundamental template that the plot fills in. There can't be TOO much wrong with it since it's formed the basis of about ten million pornographic novels and movies. Bored wife lets stranger boff her in a toilet during a literary ball. Right. It happens to me all the time. But it can be done sloppily, as here, or done with a bit of pith and a touch of poetry, as in \"Belle de Jour.\"","user":"rmax304823","rank":[9,14]}]
