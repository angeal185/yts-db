[{"title":"Double surprise gotcha - good acting and camera work","rating":14,"date":"14 January 2019","review":"So the out-of-luck tough guy falls in with the bad guys, and has to sustain his sweet lil' daughter, eh? Usually, such a story would be a recipe for disaster, especially when the movie stars a former action hero who's too old do any real action.<br><br>To my everlasting surprise, this one is neither cheesy nor predictable or boring. It's simply a very good movie. The slower approach results in a realistic appeal, even though it suffers from the \"blockbuster\" orange-and-teal color grading. The gunshots sound like the real thing - and cars don't explode on impact.<br><br>At the end I was saddened that it only runs 90 minutes. Highly recommended for the JCVD's performance alone, let's hope they keep this coming.","user":"big_brother_1984","rank":[27,28]},{"title":"Thought Provoking French Styled Thriller","rating":8,"date":"10 February 2019","review":"It's amazing how an action movie star that has always been looked upon with a smirk and a snigger can appear in a film this captivating, dark and tense. Van Damme carries his role to the bloody end. Partly spoken French, partly spoken English but the film is totally French in style. And this is no criticism.\nBeautifully paced yet offbeat, this film captivates with subtle screenplay and suggestive scores that always convinces you that danger could be around the next corner. Such a contrast to Van Damme's former films that dissolve any interest when this film keeps you magnetised to the bitter end.","user":"metalgear-25259","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"Encouraging not to see a JCVD movie!!!","rating":8,"date":"23 December 2018","review":"Under directions of Julien Leclerc, Jean Claude Vandamme can focus being an actor and working with this simple and efficient scenario. Nothing new but a good suprise, with intersting charachter: not talkative, with a huge pass and constrainted to do some dirty work. it's been a very long time and i thought i could never say that i'd like a movie of Jean Claude vandamme Again. Whish the best for future project :-)!!!","user":"allparizzo","rank":[27,33]}]
