[{"title":"Waste of Time and money","rating":1,"date":"14 September 2015","review":"Just an absolute waste of a movie night....save this one for the old school horror movie buffs with no idea what decent actors or special effects are....felt like it could turn into an adult film at any moment with the age of the actors and general feel of the movie....ridiculous... not even scary in the least.. I suggest saving your money to use when the actual poltergeist movie comes out. Recommended only for those who need the background noise while they fall asleep at night. At least the views on the movie were pretty but still the storyline made no sense and is kind of irritating due to the trailer being so misleading about the movie","user":"nikkischultz","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"This movie is not captivating in the least","rating":2,"date":"5 September 2015","review":"I picked this one up at Walmart along with the Haunted Rectory. Both movies have the same actor in it. This one however, has no special effects whatsoever. They used people in cloaks with hoods like monks with white ceramic masks. Not scary at all. They even used music during attacks that sounded almost identical to the music used in \"The Entity\", a timeless horror classic. I was unimpressed and saddened I spent $10 on it. Better to download it for a buck or two to watch or rent it if you can. This is just my opinion though. You can watch it and come up with your own opinion but honestly this one and Haunted Rectory are both very dry and plain. Not sure how it really gives way to the actual true stories but I was unimpressed.","user":"jen-99169","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"DO judge a book by it's cover","rating":2,"date":"12 July 2016","review":"As a story, there were some good ideas.. but what made the movie fall flat was the dreadful sound, the lack of suspense and the casting.<br><br>So you have the Father: who looks good for his age but can still pull off the young father look, and to also note - I thought he acted the part quite well.<br><br>Then you have the daughter: who is supposedly still in school, yet looked the same age as the father! Which I found disturbing.. <br><br>Some actors must think if they keep going for younger roles all the time, it may \"extend\" their career or something, but what made it worse, she couldn't even act her character's age either. If you don't look the part - at least try to act it!<br><br>In short, the DVD cover is pretty misleading in relation to the film inside.","user":"VeronicaW345","rank":[4,5]}]
