[{"title":"Finally, Another Classic Noir Unearthed.","rating":7,"date":"24 August 2010","review":"Paramount's UNION STATION (1950) is another memorable noir from Hollywood's golden past making its belated DVD debut. A gritty and compelling thriller it was adapted for the screen from the violent novel \"Nightmare In Manhattan\" by Thomas Walsh. Daniel L. Fapp's stark Black &amp; White cinematography brought a great style to it with its shifting use of light and shadow and the genuine locations, especially in the bustling Union Station itself in Los Angeles, added a realistic look and feel to the whole thing.<br><br>A girl (the resistible Nancy Olson) sees a man (Lyle Bettger) on a train wearing a gun under his jacket and immediately suspects him of being up to no good (how it never occurs to her that he could perhaps be a cop is conveniently glossed over). She however reports the matter to the conductor who in turn alerts railway cop William Calhoun (William Holden). It soon comes to light that the man with the gun and another have kidnapped a blind girl and are holding her hostage for a ransom of $100,000 from her well to do businessman father (Herbert Heyes). Things really hot up when Calhoun, with help from the city police headed by Inspector Donnelly (Barry Fitzgerald), stakeout Union Station - the nominated drop zone for the ransom. The picture ends with a climactic chase sequence as Holden pursues Bettger through a maze of dark tunnels underneath the station for the inevitable and exciting shootout.<br><br>Performances are generally fine throughout. Holden is terrific in it but it is unusual to see him as a cop. He plays the part well but watching him you can't help thinking he is an actor of a much higher calibre than is called for here and deserving of classier and more artistically challenging parts such as his Acadamy Award winning role as Sefton in \"Stalag 17\" (1953) or his perfect Joe Gillis in \"Sunset Boulevard\" which he and his co-star here Olson would embark on right after UNION STATION. Also kicking around his thick Irish brogue again Barry Fitzgerald repeats his role, almost verbatim, from \"The Naked City\" (1948) the only difference being his name here is Donnelly instead of Muldoon. But there's little doubt the movie belongs to Lyle Bettger as the heartless and sadistic kidnapper. Beside Jack Elam has there ever been a meaner or nastier baddie in movies? Born in 1915 Bettger made a full career out of playing menacing characters. He had a sinister smirk and a scary glare that was positively unnerving. His first film was Barbara Stanwyck's \"No Man Of Here Own\" just before UNION STATION and with the exception of only one time playing the hero in \"Carnival Story\" (1954) he continued throughout a busy career to be every moviegoer's favourite baddie \"you loved to hate\". Lyle Bettger retired in 1979 and died in 2003 at the age of 88.<br><br>Unusually there is no one composer credited with scoring the picture. But there are minor contributions from Heinz Reomheld and stock music from Victor Young and Hugo Friedhofor. There is a spirited main title over the credits which sounds very much to me like something the great Victor Young could have written. The score was compiled and supervised by Irvin Talbot.<br><br>The DVD release is an impeccable transfer with sharp as a button images and smooth sound. Clearly they had access to a new print of the movie and it shows. But there are no extras - not even a trailer. But now for a word of caution! Watch out for the most ridiculous and irritating logo you are ever likely to see which comes at the start of the DVD from a crowd called Olive Films. This has to be some kind of gag! But after all is said and done you can be confident, this silly intro. does nothing to diminish the excellence of the movie which remains a timeless classic.","user":"jpdoherty","rank":[37,40]},{"title":"A lost classic which should be rediscovered and hailed as the masterpiece that it is.","rating":10,"date":"10 August 2005","review":"I suppose that every movie lover and every film critic has one film that they love which makes everyone else shrug in bewilderment. I remember Barry Norman once publishing a book about his 100 favourite movies, and no-one could fathom why a well-made but totally disposable entry like \"Gregory's Girl\" was on his list. Similarly, many years ago BBC2 ran a short film series in which famous actors and directors revealed and spoke about their favourite film. Everyone was taken aback when Martin Scorcese came up with \"Duel In The Sun\" as his choice! Well, for me, the oddity among my list of all-time favourites would have to be Union Station. Since the first time I caught this fantastic crime thriller on Channel 4 one rainy afternoon, I've considered it one of the finest films of its type that I've ever come across. Not only did the story engross me, but the film inspired me to become a lifelong fan of William Holden, and also made me develop a serious crush on the lovely Nancy Olson.<br><br>Railway police man William Calhoun (William Holden) is having a fairly routine day at work when he is approached by an apprehensive passenger named Joyce Willecombe (Nancy Olson), who believes that two travellers aboard her train may have been up to no good. It transpires that Joyce is the secretary to a rich man called Henry Murchison (Herbert Hayes), whose blind daughter, Lorna, has been kidnapped and held for ransom. The railway station where Calhoun works has been chosen as the location for the pay-off of the ransom. Calhoun and fellow cop Inspector Donnelly (the atypically-cast Barry Fitzgerald) race against time to find the kidnappers and bring them to heel.<br><br>Pacy, exciting, surprisingly violent and very well-acted, Union Station is 80 minutes of terrific entertainment. Sydney Boehm's script is filled with incident, and Rudolph Mate directs the proceedings with a sense of urgency and a real talent for building the suspense. Holden - fresh from his masterpiece Sunset Boulevard - is in fine form and Olson (also from Sunset Boulevard) is an ideal leading lady, who not only gets the hero involved in the action but also pressurises him into not just nailing the bad guys but rescuing the abducted blind girl too. Impressive performances are also to be found from Barry Fitzgerald as Holden's colleague, and (especially) Lyle Bettger as the kidnap mastermind, a snarling and exceptionally nasty villain for a film of this era. The climax, involving a frenzied shootout and a chase through underground tunnels, is truly heart-stopping. Union Station is a first-rate thriller.... if ever a film needed rediscovering, then this surely is it!","user":"barnabyrudge","rank":[46,58]},{"title":"Really First Rate Film Noir - And Bettger Almost Walks Off With It!","rating":10,"date":"6 January 2008","review":"Looking at the casting and production of this film, and even the title, an informed viewer must wonder about who was the guiding genius behind it. The romantic leads, William Holden and Nancy Olsen, just played the similar leads in a tragically doomed love affair in Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD. The director, Rudolph Mate, was better known for his cinematography up to a few years earlier. But by 1950 he had THE DARK PAST (also with Holden and Lee J. Cobb) and D.O.A. (with Edmond O'Brien) under his belt...and there were more to come. The villain (in only his third film) was the terrific bad guy Lyle Bettger - about to fully blossom in what was the best role in this film (but bad guys usually got the best roles in \"film noir\"). Barry Fitzgerald is here playing a version of his Police Detective from THE NAKED CITY. In supporting parts are Jan Sterling, Allene Roberts, Herbert Heyes, Parley Baer, Ralph Sanford, and even Byron Foulger. This film has everything going for it - even the location is suggestive of potential tragedy.<br><br>In 1933 the FBI suffered the worst loss of personal in it's early history when four of it's agents, while escorting some prisoners, were ambushed in a botched attempt to spring the prisoners. The four men were machine-gunned to death as were the two prisoners (I said it was botched). As a result J.Edgar Hoover got Congress to pass legislation allowing F.B.I. men to carry arms into the field (something the states had rejected at first). The killings were later ascribed (probably truthfully) to \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd's gang, but nobody was ever punished for the killings. The incident happened in the parking area of UNION STATION in Kansas City. In fact, it is historically called \"The Union Station Massacre\". <br><br>Oddly enough no regular film was ever done of the true story - although a fictionalized television film was made in the 1970s. But this is such a good thriller it will do for it's acting (especially Bettger) and production values.<br><br>Olson is a secretary to Heyes, a very wealthy man who has a single child - Roberts. Originally Roberts had all her senses, but she has become blind. When she vanishes, Olson becomes suspicious of two men on a commuter train (Bettger and an associate) who she follows to Union Station. She approaches Holden and he uses his staff of railway police to follow them and see where they put away a piece of luggage. After they leave Holden prepares to open the locker to verify that Olson thinks they have a gun in there. But he insists on doing everything by the book - much to Olsen's disgust. He does not want law suits against himself, his men, the staff of the station or the station itself. He insists on her name and address, and Olsen - very angrily - gives it to him. Then the locker is checked, and Olsen's information verified.<br><br>This is how the film progresses, and adds to the tensions of the story. Bettger is a border-line psychotic (he enjoys some taunting of his victims, but he keeps his eyes on the goal of the kidnap ransom). He has spent five years in prison for a hold-up (he angrily dismisses the event, calling the filling-station robbery a \"coffee and cake\" affair). While there he thought out this meticulous crime - all centered on the station. As he is willing to use and kill people to get his results he constantly keeps one step ahead of his pursuers.<br><br>But Holden and his regular police force Detective Fitgerald have to move more slowly. They have to play by limitations and rules they are assigned to uphold (though at one point they give one of Bettger's associates a \"third degree\" good cop - bad cop grilling that gets results with near violence). They also are hamstrung because of Heyes, who is frightened at the threat to his helpless daughter and agrees to anything Bettger demands.<br><br>So Bettger, despite the losses of two associates, is always in the lead - and calling the shots to the conclusion of the film. His key to success is his hold on Roberts, a helpless victim who cannot fight on equal terms. If the forces of law and order want to find her alive (a point that Bettger really could not care about) they have to follow his tune.<br><br>The actors are all good, with Holden and Olsen gradually finding reasons to appreciate each other more and more. Fitzgerald has no moment (as in THE NAKED CITY) outlining his model for solving crimes. But he and Holden do discuss (after the death of a policeman) the limits of following the book and rules in moments of danger. Holden feels that such behavior only ends with the party on a slab in a morgue, but Fitzgerald says that kind of bravery wins battles. It's a lesson Holden takes to heart.<br><br>The supporting actors too are good - in particular Jan Sterling as Bettger's lover and most sympathetic gang member. <br><br>On the whole UNION STATION is a wonderful film noir, and a must see film.","user":"theowinthrop","rank":[18,21]}]
