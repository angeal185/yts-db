[{"title":"A Scandalous Marriage, A Derby Horse","rating":6,"date":"10 January 2007","review":"Wings of the Morning is both the title of the film and the name of a gypsy horse who rides in the English Derby at Epsom Downs. It was the first modern technicolor film to be shot in the British Isles. To insure quality cinematographer Ray Rennahan who was THE color guy in Hollywood was brought over and he did a first rate job. I guess for good luck Henry Fonda who appeared in the first outdoor technicolor film in the USA came over to appear in this one. In the tradition of Americans appearing in British productions, Fonda plays a Canadian horse trainer with the Irish name of Kerry Gilfallen replete with his Nebraska twang.<br><br>In fact most of this British production is shot in Ireland and I hope that Wings of the Morning is available to folks in Ireland in any format. Their country is really nicely captured in some really lush greens. And there is some nice color footage of London and the Epsom Derby in the middle Thirties.<br><br>There are two stories, a brief prologue involving gypsy princess Annabella and the Irish Lord Clontarf played by Leslie Banks. They wed against all convention and soon after, Banks is killed in a riding accident. Of course most of the family snubs the widow and she returns to the gypsies.<br><br>Fast forward some forty years and Annabella is now playing her own great granddaughter and she's back in Ireland having fled Spain from the revolution going on there. She flees like Katharine Hepburn did in Sylvia Scarlett, in the guise of a boy and fools everybody including horse trainer Henry Fonda. <br><br>Of course the romance develops and a pair of horses get trained and primed for the Epsom Derby. Horse stories are no different in the UK then they are the USA and if you've seen enough of them on the silver screen you have an idea how the rest of the film goes.<br><br>Champion jockey Steve Donoghue makes an appearance in Wings of the Morning and lucky indeed we are to have a technicolor filmed appearance of the great John McCormack who favors us with four songs sung at a party scene at Clontarf castle. McCormack was an icon in many an Irish and Irish American household. A great concert singer, he and an Italian tenor named Caruso share equal credit in developing the record industry as they both signed with Edison's fledgling RCA Victor label back in the day. You couldn't find too many Italian households without a Caruso record back in the day nor many Irish households without a gramophone and McCormack records to play on them.<br><br>During his sequence McCormack sings and reads material, lyrics I'm sure he must have sang a gazillion times. My guess is that he was 53 when Wings of the Morning was made and may have been sustaining memory problems. McCormack died in 1945 and had not sung for several years at that point.<br><br>Wings of the Morning were it not for McCormack and technicolor would be a rather ordinary race track story. Still it's good entertainment and for folks in Ireland, a must.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Strange film of Lords and Ladies and gypsies and horse-racing","rating":31,"date":"31 August 2001","review":"The first British Technicolor film, it has a script that is somehow from another world; a sentimental world where gypsies travel in wooden horse-drawn caravans and dance round camp fires; and where gentlemen train horses and live only for victory at the racecourse.<br><br>Maria, played by Annabelle, is dressed as a boy to escape the hostilities of the Spanish civil war, and becomes involved with Kerry (played by a young Henry Fonda). Kerry doesn't realise it's a girl, of course, until later when she reveals herself, when it's love at first sight.<br><br>The climax of the film is at the Derby, the year's main race for the whole of Britain, and we get a glimpse there of the real world through the mist of the obscure direction (Harold D Schuster's first film).<br><br>The Irish tenor John McCormack sings at a ball, and champion jockey Steve Donaghue appears as himself.","user":"hazelfreeman","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"A second try at watching this film was unsuccessful...","rating":5,"date":"8 April 2011","review":"It's surprising to read everyone talking about the wonderful early British use of Technicolor for this film, when in fact the color photography (as seen in the print shown on TCM tonight) can best be described as murky, even in the close-ups.<br><br>Aside from the color, the script is a garbled hodge-podge of strangely related events, clumsily crafted and given stiff acting even by the lovely ANNABELLA. For a better view of this French actress, I suggest you watch one of her later U.S. films called 13 RUE MADELEINE, to fully appreciate her acting abilities.<br><br>The disjointed story, combined with the lackluster direction and the lame dialog, only undercuts whatever merits are in the film's script. ANNABELLA does nothing here to indicate that she's on the brink of better things in her future and her line readings are less than professional as delivered in her French accent.<br><br>Why Technicolor was wasted on this below average story is a mystery to me. Fans of Annabella and Henry Fonda are sure to be disappointed. Fox would have been more successful if they'd filmed this horse story here in the U.S. in sunny California for both the interior and exterior shots.<br><br>Surprised that this unrestored print was the best TCM could do.","user":"Doylenf","rank":[9,11]}]
