[{"title":"My Favorite Dudley Moore Performance","rating":8,"date":"2 December 2005","review":"Though he will probably always be remembered for 1981's ARTHUR, my favorite Dudley Moore performance is still from the 1979 Blake Edwards classic \"10\". Moore plays George Webber, a man who seemingly has it all: a flourishing career as a songwriter, money, a gorgeous home, an equally gorgeous girlfriend (Julie Andrews), but still feels like something is missing in his life. Then one day, while stopped at a traffic signal, he glances at a girl (Bo Derek)in a limo, on her way to her wedding. George becomes obsessed with this vision, this perfect \"10\" and forsakes everything in his life, including Andrews, to find and be with this woman. After getting six fillings drilled by the girl's dentist/father (James Noble), in an attempt to learn where the girl went on her honeymoon, George flies to Mexico to find his \"10\" and eventually learns the lessons you would expect from such a venture. In addition to some great physical comedy offered by Moore, there are moments of great warmth here too. The scenes at the outdoor bar in Mexico where Dudley encounters a lonely woman (Dee Wallace) and plays the piano are lovely. Brian Dennehy is effectiveLY cast against type as the bartender. Also cast against type is Robert Webber as George's gay songwriting partner who tries in vain to make George see what an idiot he is and appreciate the things he has. This IS not just a smarmy sex comedy, but a warm character study of a man chasing something he really doesn't want or need and features one of Dudley Moore's most charming performances.","user":"Isaac5855","rank":[23,27]},{"title":"A Very Melancholy Comedy","rating":8,"date":"23 January 2005","review":"\"10\" (4 outta 5 stars) Kind of weird seeing this movie again after 20 years. When I first saw it I was just a kid in my early 20s and now I am older than the character Dudley Moore plays in this movie... a cranky, disillusioned composer going through a mid-life crisis. Dang, I never had one of those at 40... does this mean I'm overdue? Anyway, flawed as this movie is, it is still a classic. It's generally considered a \"comedy\" but the most effective scenes are the quieter, more melancholy scenes. (The scene where Moore plays the piano in the bar for Dee Wallace gets me every time.) This is probably the best role of Moore's career... he's able to come across as sympathetic even while acting like a jerk for most of the movie. It's the supporting performances by Julie Andrews, Dee Wallace, Robert Webber and Brian Dennehy that really give the movie its depth. Thankfully, Bo Derek doesn't really have to do any acting, so she doesn't throw the movie too much out of whack. The movie seems a lot sadder to me these days... though I thought it was hysterically funny 25 years ago.","user":"hokeybutt","rank":[32,42]},{"title":"Dudley Moore is a natural comedic genius!","rating":9,"date":"11 July 2006","review":"In this film, Dudley plays an award-winning composer. <br><br>Another brilliant film that'll make you laugh your head off while watching him run around like a maniac in hot sand!<br><br>My mother recommended this film to me because I was born after it was released. <br><br>Even in today's society, this movie is hilarious!
