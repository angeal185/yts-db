[{"title":"Popcorn Movie..!","rating":7,"date":"16 March 2019","review":"I didn't expect much from this movie going in, in that sense this movie didn't disappoint at all. If u would like to speak about flaws and weaknesses, I promise you there is a ton of them. But if you are planning to watch this movie after seeing trailer and expecting to be perfect, then you should blame yourself. Having mentioned much about the notions, lets analyse the movie strengths. Sophia lillis as Nancy drew is vibrant and funny. She is very good at keeping the mood light even in the tense scenes. There is an innocence in her acting. Laura wiggins plays the pretty friend as usual. Andrea anders, sam trammel doesn't have much screen space but they have supporting roles to sophia. Even though you pretty much know how its gonna pan out, this movie keeps you invested. Grab a popcorn and drink and if you plan to light hearted teen movie this movie won't make you regret it.","user":"vijaychandrank","rank":[29,39]},{"title":"This is watchable, and kind of fun","rating":7,"date":"26 March 2019","review":"As a 43yo man I definitely do not belong in the demographic this movie is made for, but I actually liked reading Nancy Drew when I was young which is why when I saw this movie flicker by, I stopped, and watched it.<br><br>This is not great, not fantastic, nor amazing in any form or way. Directing not so great, light and effects need to be worked on, story is bland and very simple, there is very little to celebrate with this movie since it is basic and do not offer much comes to cinematography, great scenes or action.<br><br>Still, this is fun. This is very much watchable, and well worth a look. I enjoyed this movie. Not everything need to be perfect or MCU spectacular. You do not need Oscar level of acting to enjoy a simple, fun, basic movie about teens, a couple of mysteries set in a small city and all that comes with. And Sophia Lillis is a magnet, she will be a star, with those wonderful eyes; how can she not become one?<br><br>I give this movie a strong 6 or a weak 7, I will give it a 7 just because I am in a good mood.<br><br>If you have nothing else to do, I can definitely recommend this. Much better movie than Us, much better movie than Alita, much better movie than What Men Want, in fact this is probably my second favorite movie of 2019 so far - after Captain Marvel.","user":"namob-43673","rank":[24,32]},{"title":"******* Teen Movie","rating":18,"date":"18 March 2019","review":"Young teens, that is. I wonder if young people read anymore, and if the ones that do ever read Nancy Drew books. Hard to tell if this movie will appeal to a large teen audience after \"Captain Marvel\" and numerous Batman films, but the story is good enough to hold the attention of kids who are not waiting for something to blow up.<br><br>Nutshell; Nancy is drawn into a mystery of a haunted house, owned by Linda Lavin. Aided by her 2 friends and a 'mean girl' they solve the problem, with a few\nobject lessons about mean friends along the way. If you are over 21 the script is hard to endure but sufficient to hold the interest of a young audience. Nancy Drew as played by Sophia Lillis is adorable and appealing. I would recommend it to teens who are tired of superheroes, but with a caveat - it's not Fortnite.<br><br>7/10 - The website no longer prints my star rating.","user":"GManfred","rank":[31,43]}]
