[{"title":"Lie with Me is HOT","rating":8,"date":"21 February 2005","review":"I saw Lie with Me at another recent screening and I loved it. As a 30 something woman I felt that this movie really spoke to me. I got from it all the things I loved about Lost in Translation and the Sunset/Sunrise movies with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Visually I think it is stunning, and the sex is really hot, but never gratuitous or porn-like. The supporting characters are strong as well and nicely developed in very economical scenes. The film never drags and there is not a single wasted frame. Eric Balfour smolders and I totally bought Lauren Lee Smith's journey of self-discovery. I highly recommend this film Â– Hope it gets released soon!","user":"dustie129","rank":[146,185]},{"title":"Honest, psychologically complex.","rating":10,"date":"20 September 2005","review":"Lie With Me is 100% honest. The sex is over-hyped as being X-rated. The sex scenes are long, filmic and beautifully shot. The film is not really about sex, but about the psychological. The female lead enjoys sex and pleasure and shuts out love and intimacy until she meets the male lead who is very intimate and emotional. Not a scene is wasted. Supporting characters comment on relationships, loneliness, the body as something that is unsexy. The leads are physically beautiful, lovely to watch from a filmic sense, and give naked performances. There are people in everyday life like this and it's honest to see it up there on the big screen. A brilliant film.","user":"joejoe-6","rank":[110,142]},{"title":"Truly Magnetic, Realistic and Raw!","rating":9,"date":"22 February 2006","review":"This is one of the most realistic portrayals of what it is like to be a woman who is sitting on the fine line between sex and love. Can you truly have both? Can you love someone and have great sex? I loved how this film captures the magnetism between two people.The heat, passion and possibility of love derived from attraction. The fact that sometimes you don't see love until it's too late. When you have it do you truly appreciate it? It also makes you see the addiction of those feelings, of being complete yet helpless in the arms of another and never wanting that feeling to stop. The main characters did a great job and had awesome on screen chemistry. One of the best love stories I've seen that wasn't like a \"chick flick\". If you have seen this movie already you might want to see the following titles: Wicker Park Or Love Me If You Dare (french film). Both of these movies deal with the Closeness and Connection between lovers that were probably kismet.Minus the rawness of sexual activity.","user":"lrlucier","rank":[53,71]}]
