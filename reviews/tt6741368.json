[{"title":"Great family movie - Cesar worthy!","rating":10,"date":"31 December 2018","review":"This rewrite of the famous French novel is very touching, very well directed and filmed. It will definitely appeal to all who grew up with the eponymous series. Great acting by Daniel Auteuil and Maleaume Paquin in particular. The addition of an \"after story\" with an older RÃ©mi is also an interesting one. We highly recommend it, including with kids.","user":"nfradin","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"Perfect Movie","rating":10,"date":"10 December 2018","review":"The plot is dynamic!
