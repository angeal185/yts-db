[{"title":"I was a weepy mess","rating":10,"date":"1 July 2019","review":"If you saw the first movie The Other Side of Heaven, you will remember the sweet spirit of the storytelling and the heart of the beautiful Tongan people. This sequel is a heartwarming reunion with more inspiration and miracles. Bring tissues. I was a weepy mess.<br><br>The film is filled with lessons for us to learn, and not just for \"Mormons.\" While the movie will have special meaning for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, everyone can enjoy it and be touched by it. As we're told in this movie, if you wait long enough, all stories have happy endings.<br><br>You can read my full movie review at MovieReviewMom (dot com) or on my YouTube channel. Here are a few of the highlights:\nChristopher Gorham is absolutely fantastic. He reminds me of Chris Evans as Captain America: his goodness. Director Mitch Davis chose Christopher because \"he has a very gentle soul.\" He learned to speak Tongan very well in the first movie and his speech coach said his accent was perfect. Did you know that he is a trained auctioneer like his grandfather?<br><br>The funeral scene was touching and heartbreaking.\nAbigail, the goat, in a dress. Adorable.\nThe moment that really got me to tear up was after the storm when Nancy yelled, \"Hoorah for Israel!\" From then on, I went through quite a few tissues.\nI loved hearing the Tongan people sing often in the movie.<br><br>When they were interviewing actors to play Thomas S. Monson, the moment they first saw Russell Dixon, they knew he was the right man for the job. After the real Thomas S. Monson watched the first The Other Side of Heaven movie in 2001, he immediately asked, \"When are you going to make the second movie?\" John Groberg said to director Mitch Davis, \"I'm not getting any younger and neither are you, so it's time!\"<br><br>I always love it when you get to see pictures and video of the real people of a true story in movies. You get to see a lot of that during the rolling credits, as well as a photo update of the principle \"characters\" in the movie.\nThe film was made in Fiji because the tax rebate to film there was 47 percent.\nThere is some humor, which is always appreciated.\nYou don't need to have seen the first movie, but it certainly helps in order to appreciate the history and significance of some of the relationships.\nThe music is noticeably good and sweeps with emotion.\nSome Christian movies are heavy-handed and even cheesy at times, but this one will fill your soul and make you feel.","user":"trinaboice","rank":[19,34]},{"title":"OUTSTANDING MOVIE","rating":10,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect, especially since it's been years since I saw the first movie and can't really remember much of it's story.\nBut we really loved this movie. It was full of adventure, funny, and very heart touching. My family members that aren't LDS welled up and really loved it too.\nIt's a great story for everyone, beautifully shot and very professionally done. I highly recommend it.","user":"laurievukich","rank":[12,26]},{"title":"So Glad I Saw this Film","rating":9,"date":"13 July 2019","review":"I think that this well done film kept to the original story as lived by Mr. Groberg.
