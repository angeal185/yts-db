It is so brilliant!! It captures the most amazing moments.. of innocence and first love ..in such a wonderful and adorable way. It echos traces of pure imaginative delight and each line of every song has hidden depth beyond just for eccentricity's sake.<br><br>Thank you, Luke Shirock! Thank you so much for being so cool and bringing tears to my face.","user":"jacobedelson","rank":[0,2]}]
