[{"title":"It's charm doesn't shine as well as it could have but it's enough to get pass","rating":5,"date":"10 March 2017","review":"I bought this DVD because I was looking for something a little different than my typical Cartoon Network Collection of Golden Era Cartoons. Always been a fan of Powerhouse Cartoon Network and always been true to that era. But enough about me, this is a review. <br><br>It's kind of reminds me of some of those old barbie cgi cartoons as a kid but unlike those cartoons something was just missing. This movie sometimes seems like they are trying too hard to be emotional at times. Even the characters sometimes seem to be putting off an \"forced\" joke but besides this, the movie did well at making the characters likable without having to go down the road that Teen Titans Go did. The artwork was pretty good too!! Kids will probably get a kick out of it!","user":"rasheedthomas-68306","rank":[2,4]},{"title":"Villain of the year is more appropriate title","rating":1,"date":"7 October 2018","review":"This movie has the nerve to call it self hero of the year after the fact that they have a Harley Quinn, Posion Ivy and Killer Frost in the same school that the heroes go to.<br><br>The whole film it self was an utter bore fest. Even my younger cousin hated this movie. But the only good this about it is the fact they had Sean Schleammel the voice of Goku from the Funimation dub of dragon ball in this and also Josh Keaton and greg cipes.<br><br>Other then that this movie is trash and insulting to DC.","user":"WeAreLive","rank":[1,3]}]
