[{"title":"Don't even bother watching","rating":2,"date":"31 May 2017","review":"Giving the film a 2 out of 10 because me and my family were laughing at how bad the acting was! The first half was really good. However, when people started dying you could see the cgi of blood when people got shot with exaggerated amounts of blood, and the funniest part was when the cheating husband gets shot in the stomach, and then starts walking like he's been shot in the leg, and when he's finally in the car with his wife he kisses her like he hasn't even been shot!!! Worst film that I have ever seen in my entire life. Also, when the woman who the husband has cheated with dies, the husband is literally sad for no longer than two seconds! Disgrace.","user":"brandonwilliams_2000","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Watch it!!","rating":1,"date":"9 June 2017","review":"It's been a long time since i laughed so much watching a movie. The plot is as basic as it's gets, the Cinematography it's a complete disaster, as well as acting, SFX and FX... I especially loved the audio of the movie... or better the lack of it. There are entire scenes without music or audio, just the voice of the actors... and they still managed to make some line totally incomprehensible, with huge volume gaps between lines and a constant noise like someone is gently rubbing the sponge foam of the mics... FX are hilarious, even worst than Birdemic, they even managed to mess up every green screen used in the movie, with awful transparency, layering and placement issues. A must have for every z movie lover!","user":"acarbone-64295","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Not worth the many stars","rating":1,"date":"18 October 2017","review":"The movie is obviously cheaply made. The special effects are horrible, the acting is bad, and the story line doesn't make a lot of sense. The characters aren't consistent and it's hard to understand what's going on in more than one scene. Why this movie has been rated as high as 8,6* at the time of my review is beyond me. I would not recommend anyone to waste their time with this movie.","user":"mikkelsen-42268","rank":[14,16]}]
