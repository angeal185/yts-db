[{"title":"Worst Adaptation Ever","rating":1,"date":"11 June 2016","review":"First... I did not know anything about this awesome, and I can't say that enough, awesome book becoming a movie. I have had to read this book at least 10 times over the last few years and some of my most favorite life quotes came from this book. So when I saw this as a movie and John as the main role I knew it was going to be amazing. I mean if I could cast the main character myself it would be John.<br><br>BUT... Well, if the director had made a movie out of the book, it would have been amazing. If the movie had any of the most notable and required pieces of the plot it would have been amazing. If the director had even read anything to do with the book, even the dust jacket, it would have been amazing. But he didn't, he didn't, he didn't.<br><br>SO... The movie sucked. I don't like to use that type of \"language\" when reviewing anything, but there is no other choices here. Everything about the movie was wrong and I gave it a lot of room, a lot of space to make errors and not flow the same. Because ultimately you want to be surprised by the movie. You ultimately want the director to make it his own just a little bit, put his spin on something and have it shine even more. And I did, I watched the movie to the very end. Checked behind the credits and everything. And now I wish I would have gone on for the rest of my life without knowing this movie existed. <br><br>IF... Now one might think by my review that had you not read the book, you might have liked it but sadly that is not true. This is not only the worst adaptation of a book ever, but it is also just poorly put together, scripted, acted, and there is no redeemable quality anywhere.<br><br>Such as... The sound effects were horrible, the video tried to be dark and creepy, but it was just bland. There was very little action or scare factor other than some BOO moments from the \"zombies type people.\" If you didn't see something coming from a mile away it is because it made no sense. The ending was a little baffling on how horrible it was. I mean I am actually trying to think of one thing. Just one that I can say and would take this movie from a 1 star to at least a 1.5 star. But I can't. I can't think of a single thing that I can look back on and say that was cool/nice/awesome/not terrible.<br><br>Lastly... So I will leave you with this. I am actually praying that I reach you before you watched this movie. I am hoping one of your not nice friends didn't play a prank on you and made you pay for this movie. It is my desire that this review has reached you before you have wasted one single heartbeat within the vicinity of this horrible, horrible film mistake. And I thank you for reading my review and I am sorry to those that I did not reach in time.<br><br>Joshua Kyte","user":"joshuakyte-60400","rank":[241,316]},{"title":"What Book Did They Read ???????","rating":1,"date":"11 June 2016","review":"I remember reading this book and thinking what an amazing Movie it would make. With the right cast and script I knew this could be a winner. I waited for someone to make it and finally they did.<br><br>We were getting John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson. How could they not make an amazing movie.<br><br>I waited eagerly to view this long anticipated adventure and thought the day would never arrive when I could get the chance to see it.<br><br>Then I did.<br><br>Firstly it has very little in common with the book I read. the book is very clever and draws you into the story. The movie is not clever and the story is thrown at us.<br><br>In The book we care about all the characters. In the movie we don't.<br><br>I have to admit I walked out before the end. I just couldn't take anymore.<br><br>Why oh why did they not just stick to the books narrative.<br><br>I know you have to cut corners but they didn't cut corners, they invented new corners that had nothing to do with the story.<br><br>I love Stephen King and have read all of his books but I'm tired of seeing them butchered by Movie makers who just don't understand the story.<br><br>Save your money. Don't even bother renting this movie.<br><br>Watch TV instead.","user":"carlcasso","rank":[186,252]},{"title":"Intense start but lazy end","rating":5,"date":"10 June 2016","review":"This variation of the zombie apocalypse borrows from films like 28 Weeks Later or Kaufman's Invasion of the Body Snatchers. That is to say, it relies more on psychological tension than on graphic violence (but still contains some graphic violence.) The first act is pretty good, intense, sharp, adopting a fast pace that dispenses us of the genre's clich√©s. That won't last as it will turn into standard fare. Finally, in the 3rd act, the writer completely drops the ball and doesn't even bother ending his story properly. He just takes the easiest way out and deserves some boos for it.<br><br>Bad storytelling is enough to make a movie bad and a rating low. Here however, I balance it with the impressive beginning and the excellent visuals. Also worth mentioning is Samuel L. Jackson who, for the first time in 20 years, portrays a human being instead of his perpetual annoying caricature.","user":"voyou-703-655350","rank":[92,132]}]
