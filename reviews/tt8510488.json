[{"title":"Nice movie, not very Zambian","rating":6,"date":"10 November 2019","review":"This is a nice little movie. My only issues are with the lack of actual Zambian culture. My reference: I'm married to a Zambian. There are a couple locations I know for sure are in Zambia, the original hotel and the elephant orphanage are real locations in Zambia. The \"local\" characters are mostly not played by Zambian actors, there is no Zambian music, and almost none of the Zambian languages. There is more Swahili and Zulu in the film than any of the 140+ languages that exist in Zambia. Also, Christmas isn't really celebrated in Zambia, at least not how it's portrayed in the film. It's a shame really, it's a beautiful country with a rich culture and they didn't access really any of it.","user":"meghanhumphrey","rank":[36,41]},{"title":"Heart, substance & elephant conservation with a side of Rob Lowe","rating":10,"date":"2 November 2019","review":"I'm an avid Christmas movie watcher!! But I'm also someone who needs at least a little substance and a cohesive story that actually makes sense in order to enjoy it. This amazingly cute story has the wonderful Kristen Davis who has been passionately worked with and advocated for elephants for many years. So having her character work with and care for the elephants felt so genuine because it was. Rob Lowe is so charming and they had great chemistry in this film. Thank you for not only highlighting the importance of elephant conservation but for also having our female lead character be educated and something other than just the stereotypical baker or wedding planner. We need more of these types of holiday movies with heath and substance!","user":"MovieQween-33622","rank":[86,108]},{"title":"Yes, to this heartwarming movie","rating":10,"date":"2 November 2019","review":"This sweet movie really had me tearing up with happy emotions throughout the entire movie. Please Do not listen to any of the negative reviews. This beautiful movie was tugging at my heartstrings from the very beginning to the very end. Thank you for bringing up the importance of the elephant conservation and rescue to the forefront. We all could learn more about this cause. Add in Rob Lowe and Kristen Davis and it's a truly adorable and fun holiday movie to watch and enjoy. Would love to see a sequel!!","user":"BurberryGal","rank":[68,89]}]
