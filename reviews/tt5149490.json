[{"title":"Not What I Expected","rating":6,"date":"2 September 2019","review":"I went in with the impression it was a horror film akin to \"the Witch\"... it is not. That's not to say it's a bad film but it just wasn't what I expected.<br><br>There is no supernatural tormentor, no spooks, specters or ghosts. What haunts this poor family is far more sinister and real and it will not be for all tastes. This film is bleak and dour and while it's well shot, competently acted and has great atmosphere, by the end I felt beat up, frustrated and heartbroken.<br><br>The family (a mother and two daughters) start out victims of circumstance as the husband is killed during war and their crops fail. Then they are victim to the local robber-baron's ruthlessness and greed as he first tried to buy their land out from under them, and then hires henchmen to murder them and burn the homestead to the ground. All this while the mother struggles against deteriorating mental health, leaving the adolescent daughter to try and care for her and her younger sister.<br><br>With the world seemingly set against them, the robber-baron has his way when he beats the mother and burns her along with their home, at least allowing her two daughters to escape into the night, fate unknown. There is no resolution, no happy ending and not much more to be said.<br><br>If you feel like you want to kill an evening and feel terrible afterwards, this film will do the trick.","user":"krenwregget","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"Ultimately just rather dreary","rating":5,"date":"18 August 2019","review":"(Minor spoilers) This beautifully shot film is much reminiscent in many ways of \"The Witch\" and the recent \"Hagazussa,\" two movies I loved. But while atmospheric and interesting to a point, it finally falls well short, not so much because the horror elements turn out to be irrelevant window-dressing--though that doesn't help--but because there's just so little to the storytelling. The characters gain no complexity or depth past our first meeting them, the situation grows more bleak yet doesn't really develop much suspense or urgency.<br><br>The revelation of the real villains here might have been effective if the film had worked in a thread of social commentary throughout, instead of misleading us with vaguely supernatural flimflam. Better to just make a straight-up Ken Loach-style miserabilist period piece than a halfhearted stab at a genre film that turns out not to really be anything of that nature at all.<br><br>Strong on mood and visuals but weak on the kind of screenplay substance that is needed to sustain feature length, \"Gwen\" should have been a 20-minute short. While I actually LIKE \"depressing\" films, they can't just throw downbeat plot turns at us and expect a poignant impact that has to actually be earned in emotional terms. Failing that, this film ends up feeling like a dirge rather than the moving \"folk ballad\" it seems intended as.","user":"ofumalow","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"Grossly underrated, for some reason","rating":9,"date":"9 October 2019","review":"How on earth does this only rate a 6? The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. The storyline is highly suspenseful, the underlying message is compelling and outrageous. Perhaps it's not wise these days to portray unbridled capitalism in a negative light. Granted, there were some dramatic liberties taken, but the brutal enclosure movement, the rape of the countryside, and the outlandish greed and cruel masochism of early unregulated industrialism is no fairy tale. I recommend this film.","user":"gpenney77","rank":[14,16]}]
