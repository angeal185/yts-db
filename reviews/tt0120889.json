[{"title":"The most under-rated movie ever ?","rating":10,"date":"26 December 2005","review":"Firstly this is an adult movie. I remember when it was marketed on its release. It seemed to be targeted to all ages - Robin Williams off the back of- at that time- children's movies. It promoted the technology of the making. Overall they marketed it completely wrong, which I daresay has led it to being placed in the mediocrity bin.<br><br>However, nothing could be further from the truth. What Dreams May Come would have to be one of the most intelligent, emotional, visually beautiful, and well acted projects ever to grace the screen.<br><br>Robin Williams is masterful and Sciorra perfectly mirrors her soul mate (Williams). Their performances encapsulate all the joy and abject sorrow human life entails. It's a movie that wants you to find real love, see beyond cynicism and grasp the idea of soul mate. And it's all presented in a stunningly gorgeous montage of exquisite colour and symmetry.<br><br>From the opening shot to the closing frame, its magnificent. The story is enveloping encompassing nearly every asset of human emotion. It's a roller-coaster ride but rewarding. Comedy, hope, sadness, joy, elation, despair... all displayed perfectly.<br><br>ALL actors shine, Cuba Gooding Jr is his usual excellent self and Max von Sydow is impeccable.<br><br>The greatest movie ever? close... most under-rated movie ever? - most probably. Watch it, very few movies will touch you as What Dreams May Come will.","user":"siit","rank":[372,431]},{"title":"What dreams are made of...","rating":9,"date":"14 April 2000","review":"To hell with the critics and the cynics.  I absolutely love this movie - it's in my top ten (or maybe even top five) list of favorite movies (I saw it at least 3 times in the theater and own it on DVD).  I have to admit, I'm one of those non- (almost anti-) elitist, \"I don't know art, but I know what I like\" type people.  I also truly love positive, upbeat movies with happy endings.  Not to say that \"realistic\" movies aren't also great, but there is room for everything in the moviemaking genre.  Isn't there enough depressing \"realism\" on the evening news to satisfy even the most jaded cynic?<br><br>I can't say exactly what it is that strikes me about this movie.  The incredible color-saturated visuals and special effects certainly help.  The acting talents of Robin Williams and Max Von Sydow help.   And I loved the story.  Emotionally manipulative it may be, but this is one of those films where I WANTED to be manipulated, where I willingly participated. Apparently some people resented it, but I was sobbing through much the movie, and glad to be doing so.  Laugh if you please, say whatever you want... this movie touches my heart.<br><br>\"Deep\" it isn't, not terribly.  On a metaphysical level, it goes only slightly beyond new-age kitsch.  Very few of the afterlife scenes and concepts agree with the spiritual outlook of any known religion.  But I don't care.  Again, if a movie touches my heart in just the right place, I can forgive it almost anything.  This one did.  9/10.","user":"The_Core","rank":[241,281]},{"title":"What Fantastic Movies are Made Of!!!","rating":10,"date":"20 March 1999","review":"Ok, This movie was overlooked. Period. Before I saw it, I was one of the many movie going clones who decided not to see it in the theater because it hadn't been getting the rave reviews that the trailer suggested it should.<br><br>So, my roommate works at a video store. One night, he brings home \"What Dreams May Come.\" For lack of NOTHING better to do, I pop it in one night when I'm home alone. 113 minutes later I was floored. This was a fantastic movie. At first, I was a bit skeptical. Very little character development creation, and death comes just as the introduction to life begins. Then......it all hits. The absolute best computer animation I've ever seen. A plot line that has no obvious holes. A story that has never been addressed on the big screen. A subject that is explored in a way that is both believable and desirable. An incredible movie that leaves you happy, sad, curious, and most of all, drained of energy and exhilarated at the same time. I can't explain the feeling that this movie gave me, and I bet you can't explain the after-life any better than \"What Dreams May Come,\" unless your 3 letter name begins with \"G\" and ends with \"D.\" If you have a mind that will allow you to be entertained by something other than a beefy guy blowing things up with an Uzi, see this movie. 10 out of 10 JimmyT-2","user":"JimmyT-2","rank":[272,335]}]
