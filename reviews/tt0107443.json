[{"title":"Most Underrated Film of All-Time","rating":10,"date":"11 May 2006","review":"After a triumphant run on Broadway, the film adaptation of \"Lost In Yonkers\" was completely snubbed at all of the major film awards ceremonies. Neil Simon's classic is brilliantly written and the direction is so simple, yet very subtle. But what really makes the film work is the performances. Dreyfuss is no Kevin Spacey, but does what he can with the role. The two boys are played expertly by their respective actors. Irene Worth reprises her Tony-award winning role and I thank god for that. She is spectacular as the stern grandmother.<br><br>But the stand-out here is Mercedes Ruehl. The woman delivers one of the most underrated performances in film history as Aunt Bella. She won a Tony, why no Oscar? Seriously, she is *that* good. Ruehl delivers such a magnificent performance as the slightly disturbed woman. She really should have two Oscars on her mantle.<br><br>GRADE: A ACTING: A WRITING: A+ DIRECTING: B MVP: RUEHL","user":"magicinthenight","rank":[23,23]},{"title":"Touching, Poignant, Funny, and Well Executed","rating":10,"date":"23 January 2000","review":"After watching this movie, I became interested in finding out about the young actor Brad Stoll who played the role of Jay. How sadenned I was to learn that he died of cancer. His talent was very promising, and it is tragic that his career was cut short at such a young age. Nonetheless, this film serves as a testimony to his fine ability, and I never tire of watching it. The performances are excellent across the board, and the story well written. I give it my highest recommendation.","user":"Texasguy","rank":[21,21]},{"title":"Wonderful Film","rating":1,"date":"1 January 2003","review":"The mistake most often made when approaching a Neil Simon piece is the thought-line \"if Simon wrote it - it must be a comedy\". LOST IN YONKERS like THE GINGERBREAD LADY (filmed as ONLY WHEN I LAUGH) is most certainly not a comedy - not that it's not funny. What it is is a heartbreaking story about two brothers who by circumstance end up in the care of their severe Grandmother. Thanks to the powers that be - both Mercedes Ruehl and Irene Worth reprise thier stage roles in the film. Both won the Tony for the stage. Both deserved and Oscar for the film. There are several funny bits amidst this disfunctional family fest - and some very tender moments as well. I highly recommend it - just don't sit down with a bucket of popcorn and expect THE ODD COUPLE. Simon's writing has matured far beyond those days and is rich and wonderful.","user":"kevita","rank":[24,25]}]
