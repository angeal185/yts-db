[{"title":"More dramatic than the usual Christmas movie","rating":8,"date":"8 December 2019","review":"It's a nice change from the usual fluff to have a slightly more serious Christmas movie about 2 rival ranches and a budding romance. I like the cast. Erin Cahill is pretty and believable. There is some diversity here with a biracial element. Hispanic actors A Martinez and Nicholas Gonzales Star. Good to see Lindsay Wagner - a lovely actress who hasn't ruined her face with plastic surgery. Looks so much better than some of her contemporaries.","user":"phd_travel","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"On the range","rating":10,"date":"30 December 2019","review":"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Great that it had some action in it. Great chemistry between Erin and Nicholas. I hope they make a sequel and soon. I wish they would make a series out of this. Love, loved it!!! Thanks Karen","user":"krichter-24724","rank":[1,2]}]
