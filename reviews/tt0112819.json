[{"title":"Great Movie","rating":10,"date":"9 May 2004","review":"This was a great movie, and I think it was overlooked. It is one my favorites due to the unique storytelling and action. This movie is way better than 90% of the crap that comes out today. The acting is also superb, and I think it Chris Tucker's greatest performance. Even though the story has a lot of action, it's very believable, which is hard to do in Hollywood. For those who haven't seen this movie I suggest you go and rent it now, it's a modern day classic. Sit back and be prepared to watch a great moment in filmaking. It's definitely underrated. I think if it was promoted better it might have done better, especially since most war movies do well.","user":"gator1110","rank":[36,43]},{"title":"An abridged, urbanized version of \"The Deer Hunter\"","rating":6,"date":"26 January 2003","review":"The Hughes Brothers tried to play up the same angle with \"Dead Presidents\" as Micheal Cimino and Louis Garfinkle did with \"The Deer Hunter\" by portraying the social effects that the Vietnam war had on its young veterans.  And for a while, it seemed as though they were quite successful. But in the end, it became apparent why \"The Dead Presidents\" fell short of the Academy recognition that \"The Deer Hunter\" won.<br><br>Set in the late 60s and early 70s, the plotline of \"Dead Presidents\" follows a promising and popular inner-city high school graduate, Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate), who decides to forego college and enter the Vietnam War as a member of the Marine Corps.  Anthony survives a graphic and arduous three-plus-year stint in the jungle, but upon his homecoming, he realizes that the \"real world\" can be just as trying as war.  His low-paying job provides little support for his new family and he becomes desperate to make ends meet.  He enlists the help of some old friends and plans a daring armored car heist which, if successful, could serve to amend his past and brighten his future...<br><br>The first seventy-five minutes of this movie were really well done. Character traits and relationships were well-established and the mood was properly set as suspense built for the anticipated war scenes--a perfect \"epic-caliber\" introduction.<br><br>But instead of continuing with a detailed flow, the directing crew tried to cram about ninety minutes worth of material into the final forty-five minutes, and consequently did not leave themselves enough time to totally develop any strong climactic progression or aptly characterize any of the cast members into their sudden postwar \"criminal complex.\"  Thus, the \"heist scene,\" which based on advertising was probably supposed to be one of the more memorable and authoritative parts of the film, seemed to be almost too \"spur-of-the-moment\" and lacked motivation and definition.<br><br>\nAll in all, the film's running time, which was approximately 119 minutes, was simply far too short for the storyline.  The postwar segment of the film (the last forty-five minutes) was indeed key in separating a decent movie like \"Dead Presidents\" from a epic masterpiece like \"The Deer Hunter.\"<br><br>\nBesides the first seventy-five minutes, a couple of notably good performances given by Chris Tucker as Skip (Anthony's best friend) and Rose Jackson as Juanita (Anthony's girlfriend) do make \"Dead Presidents\" a movie worth seeing at least once.  That said, I would warn not to create a preconception based on the title, tagline or any publicity images that you might have seen, because they apply only to a small portion of the action.","user":"isitwewin5","rank":[48,64]},{"title":"Brothers In Arms.","rating":7,"date":"30 May 2015","review":"Albert and Allen Hughes direct, produce and co-write (with Michael Henry Brown) this tale about Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate), a South Bronx boy who goes off to fight in Vietnam, to then return after his tours of duty to find things just aren't the same anymore. The follow up to their incendiary debut, Menace II Society, the Hughes brothers deliver another in your face picture that is quite frankly on a perpetual downer. This is no bad thing, though, as long as you are not looking to be cheered up.<br><br>That's Uncle Sam for you! Mean Green.<br><br>The pic very much harks back to the glory days of film noir in the 40s and 50s, where some talented film makers began to tell stories of returning war veterans finding what they left behind is now alien to them - with some characters, as is the case here - deeply scarred by their experiences. Add in some gangster elements and the coup de gr√¢ce that is the scintillating heist, and clearly the brothers have seen many an old classic film. That the narrative is tried and tested stops the piece hitting greater heights, this in spite of some super acting (especially Tate and the always value for money Keith David) and the hard hitting violence that pierces the senses. Predictable yet potent, and certainly memorable, it's well worth a look for the tough of mind and the classic era film of heart. 7/10","user":"hitchcockthelegend","rank":[9,10]}]
