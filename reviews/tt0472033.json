[{"title":"A visual banquet","rating":9,"date":"12 December 2009","review":"As a long-time fan of animation, I like to believe (misguided or not) that I have high standards and am not easily impressed. But this creation blew me away, so much so that I felt compelled to write my first ever review on this site. Please forgive me for the abundance of clich√©s that may follow.<br><br>9 reminded me strongly of my favourite short-work, Joacquin Baldwin's award-winning Sebastian's Voodoo. The detail, backgrounds, colours, forms, the dark 'grubbiness' of the overall look, the minimal but meaningful character expressions and sublime use of light and shadow were pure heaven for the eyes.<br><br>Imagine, if you will, a strange but beautiful lovechild of The Borrowers, Voodoo, Alien, Corpse Bride and War of the Worlds; and you have 9.<br><br>The atmospheric score and use of imagery from various real political movements and historic events added to the post-apocalyptic, almost Gothic feel. To prevent it from becoming too heavy, it is interwoven with a deliciously subtle humour and creativity - such as the use of ordinary household objects as weapons and items of clothing. You can tell that Tim Burton had more than a sprinkling of input.<br><br>Yes, the storyline is simple (which is why I am puzzled that so many viewers found the ending difficult to grasp) and the characters could have done with more development. That said, I immediately fell in love with 2, 4 and 5 with no knowledge of their past - a difficult task to achieve. And it would be hard to create nine full-blooded personalities with back-history involved in a complex plot in only 80 minutes. <br><br>Which brings me to timing and the only reason I knocked a star off - I felt it ended too quickly and I just did not want it to.<br><br>It is a rare sort of exquisite film-making that makes you want to serve it on a plate and eat it raw, enjoying every last mouthful. Then savour it all over again because you know you've missed so much in all the glorious detail.<br><br>It is a film that stays with you long after it ends. I would urge anyone with a love of the unusual to experience it.","user":"juliet-staveley","rank":[57,67]},{"title":"Brilliant","rating":10,"date":"1 July 2017","review":"I made an IMDb account just so I can rate this movie! No really, I did.<br><br>I thought it was brilliant, very dynamic! All the nuances and layers are there, also the animation is on point! Highly recommend this film. After seeing it on the list for months I final watched it, you should too!","user":"colindeane","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"A much darker \"Wall-e\", and that's a good thing.","rating":9,"date":"27 December 2009","review":"9 is a rag-doll who wakes up after a war between humans and machines that has devastated the world and wiped out humanity.He later meets a group of surviving rag-dolls and he tries to convince them to save 2.9 and 5 go to save 2, but they accidentally awaken a machine known as Brain.After they escape the dreaded machine, Brain hatches a scheme to build machines and hunt down the remaining rag-doll survivors.<br><br>\"9\" is like a combination of \"The Terminator\", \"War Of The Worlds\", and \"Wall-e\".With the war, machines, and apocalypse, there's no way you can disagree with that.The PG-13 rating is most certainly deserved.Afterall, the imagery is a bit frightening and will have young kids begging for their parents to take them to see \"Wall-e\" so they can get all of the disturbing images out of their minds once and for all.As for the movie, I can't say that I was disappointed.With it's spectacular visuals, great action sequences, and convincing characters, \"9\" is a must-see for those who want to take a visually thrilling roller-coaster.Clocking in at a brief 79 minutes( 72 minutes if you take out the end credits), \"9\" will take your imagination and put it into a world that will make you want for a sequel.We all know what the title would be, so I don't need to go any further.\"9\" deserves a 9.","user":"kirk-246","rank":[46,58]}]
