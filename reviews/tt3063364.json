For some unknown actors they did a good job on the screen, also at about 90 minutes runtime you have the feeling that the movie lasts for two hours mainly because of the same scenes with the same actors that are too long and boring. <br><br>You will feel from the start that you are about to watch a bad a movie and it might be good for you to quit after 5 minutes.","user":"adi_2002","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Mother Nature Bless Me","rating":3,"date":"17 May 2018","review":"Rick Rainsford (John Hennigan) is a celebrity and a famous hunter, just ask him. The bottle has caused him to fall from grace and be the token celebrity on a wildlife preservation cruise. He is being photographed by Anna (Michelle Taylor) when the ship explodes and every dies except these two (and a near dead guy) who end up on an island with two Russian hunters (Russians are the bad guys again in films. The Arabs were so boring.) If you look at the by-line you know they get hunted and bond ending their love-hate relationship. <br><br>Pretty standard Hollywood film. John Hennigan wasn't impressive in his role. I think Woody Harrelson would have been better. <br><br>Guide: No F-word. sex, or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[4,5]}]
