[{"title":"Overrated","rating":4,"date":"1 February 2019","review":"This is just a talky movie with two couples, then finally in last 20 minutes turns into a drama about who has cheated on who. Unimaginative.","user":"canyongirl60","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Slow going and boring","rating":1,"date":"29 September 2019","review":"This movie just would not start. It dragged and dragged. The story was disjointed. It was just all out boring. I know there is not much you can do with four people placed in an apartment but they could have tried a bit more.","user":"kq999","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Interminable. Might have worked as a short","rating":25,"date":"25 October 2019","review":"I don't mind talky films as long as there is something interesting in all that talking. But this film just drones on and on and on with nothing particularly interesting said. The attempt to wrap it up in the last 10 minutes is forced and obvious.\nUltimately a very long and shallow experience.","user":"random-70778","rank":[3,5]}]
