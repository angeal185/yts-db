[{"title":"Captivating","rating":10,"date":"20 March 2019","review":"I don't usually write reviews but this documentary was fantastic and needs to be shown to a bigger audience. I really didn't know what to expect; I watch a lot of similar shows about prisons and life inside but this is unlike any others out there. Of course they've had a long time to reflect on their crimes and life prior so the insight was compelling. I loved seeing their creativity and they way they collaborated together.\nThey make it known in the beginning their intent to make this film is not to get sympathy. I truly believe getting this out there to more people could help other young people identify their current situation and encourage them to get help before they make that decision that could change the rest of their lives. Even adults who already have their minds made up about inmates, what they see them to be like, to offer them a new perspective as well.<br><br>I loved every minute, definitely watch this film!","user":"mbenn0409","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"A \"REAL\" Masterpiece!","rating":10,"date":"27 February 2019","review":"Absolutely captivating!
