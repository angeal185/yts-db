[{"title":"WONDERFUL!!!","rating":10,"date":"18 May 2001","review":"\"Gulliver's Travels\" is one of the great animated features of its' time. It was made as a response to Disney's wildly successful \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". Today, \"Gulliver's Travels\" is not accorded the same respect as the Disney pictures and is pretty much forgotten.<br><br>Why? This is as good as \"Snow White\". After all, it was made by the Fleischer brothers, contemporaries of animation and in my opinion, geniuses. They made the 17 classic Superman shorts that still spellbind people today, including myself. They made those classic 20 minute plus Popeye shorts. Betty Boop, Grampy, Screen Songs, Little Lulu, Gabby (spawned from this feature) the list goes on. Famous Studios was one of the most prolific animation studios of its' time.<br><br>While purists may complain that it doesn't  stay faithful to the book, I think the changes are appropriate. What kid would understand Swift's social satire? What adult would really want to see a wholly faithful cartoon of the book. Besides, we have the 1996 epic film with Ted Danson to go to with accuracy.<br><br>The songs are surprisingly great considering how some can be overkill in a film like this. The characters are endearing and the story is solid and involving. What more could you ask for?<br><br>**** out of 4 stars","user":"Katmiss","rank":[29,29]},{"title":"Beloved Early Animation Classic","rating":10,"date":"28 September 2003","review":"Just throw any negative comments you read here from IMD comment contributors in the wastebasket. I don't know what they were smoking.<br><br>Gulliver's Travels is beautiful! It is just as beautiful now as it was 60-plus years ago when it premiered, perhaps even moreso with the wonderful restoration we have now on DVD. This film doesn't have to compete with anything by Disney, and I don't see how this story has anything to do with Snow White. It stands on its own two feet as a captivating and charming classic story that children can enjoy over and over again, made when animation was really animation, and all the cells were handpainted by artists, instead of slopped together on boring, cookie-cutter computer models.<br><br>The storyline is perfect and has an anti-war undertone that was a bit daring for its time, made on the eve of World War Two. Even Disney's Snow White didn't have the guts to do that! So kudos to the Fleischer Brothers!<br><br>\nThe songs are all wonderful and the soundtrack sounds marvellously enhanced on the new DVD version. \"We're All Together Now\", \"All's Well\", \"It's A Hap Hap Happy Day\", \"Bluebirds In The Moonlight\", and especially the haunting \"Come Home Again, Sailor Man\" are all perfect and flow into the action of the film, instead of being placed there with no relevance just to try and get a hit song. These sheet music pieces always sell well on Ebay, highlighting the fact quite clearly that this is one of the most beloved animation movies of all time.","user":"overseer-3","rank":[52,54]},{"title":"Solid gold, from animation's Golden Age.","rating":10,"date":"29 August 2001","review":"Talk about unforgettable music! I saw \"Gulliver's Travels\" forty years ago on Saturday-afternoon television, and I can STILL hum much of the Ralph Rainger/Leo Robin score, especially \"Faithful\", \"Forever\", \"Faithful Forever\", \"We're All Together Now\", and \"Orchids in the Moonlight\". What a songwriting team they were.<br><br>It's impossible to not compare \"Gulliver's Travels\", and its songs, to today's animated product, and it's sad when I try. The knack seems to be lost in all regards. <br><br>Lanny Ross and Jessica Dragonette, top radio stars of the period, actually enunciate the lyrics, and in tune, and with varying dynamics. What a relief to remember a time when that was mandatory in film music.<br><br>And we can also luxuriate in the well-drawn visuals, which allows the audience time to wallow in the rich colors and narrative (without the slam-bang short-attention-span cutting that sea-sickened me during \"Atlantis\" and similar Y2K material).<br><br>Give the youngsters a taste of the Golden Age of animation, songwriting and storytelling with \"Gulliver's Travels\", and take the time to enjoy it with them.<br><br>Highest recommendation. ****","user":"Hup234!","rank":[37,39]}]
