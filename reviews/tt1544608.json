[{"title":"Beautiful and Cold Atmosphere","rating":7,"date":"1 May 2017","review":"In the 50's, in Tuscany, the nurse Verena (Emilia Clarke) is hired by the sculptor Klaus (Marton Csokas) to help his son Jakob (Edward Dring) that does not speak since his mother Malvina (Caterina Murino) has passed away. Verena befriends the old housekeeper Lilia (Lisa Gastoni) and tries to connect to Jokob, but the boy usually hears his mother from the wall of the old family house. Along the days, Verena feels attached to Jakob and falls in love with Klaus, but she finds that Malvina is trapped in the house by Jakob.<br><br>\"Voice from the Stone\" is a dramatic film with supernatural touches in a beautiful and cold atmosphere. The performances are top-notch highlighting the gorgeous Emilia Clarke. The dubious story is open to interpretation since Verena might have been affected by either madness or the ghost of Malvina. The cinematography is magnificent in a dreamlike environment. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[98,124]},{"title":"I am very picky, but I liked this one good enough","rating":7,"date":"2 May 2017","review":"Personally, this movie had my interest through out. I think this film attracted people not accustomed to period drama's and hence the poor rating on IMDb. I love period dramas and this one was as decent as any other. Was it a perfect film? No, but it still entertained me. Bonus is I could not guess the ending, it had a good twist. Still not sure if she was entirely taken over or had to share her body with the soul of the boy's mother. Did leave me with a bit of a sinister feel, if that mother took entirely over the woman.","user":"c_a_simone","rank":[88,116]},{"title":"Could have been something, at least it has beautiful scenery.","rating":4,"date":"14 May 2017","review":"This could've been something creepy mysterious good but I don't know what just happened.<br><br>Movie is overall slow, i like slow movies if they have content but this is just basically nothing going on for a good hour or so.<br><br>Emilia Clarke is a good actor, at least she gave the movie some life and reputation and i am impressed with her Italian. Other than that, do not waste your time.<br><br>This movie has absolute no content what so ever.
