[{"title":"Heartbreaking , but real","rating":7,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"The movie in my opinion was good. The cast was very good. I'm wondering if this is the movie that made Ryan Murphy decide to cast actor Cody Fern in American Crime Story: Versace. It probably is. I liked the bond between siblings in this movie. I also liked how it depicted a family living in what is supposed to be the Valhalla of Suburban life and how truly fractured that family was. The mother who was played by Jennifer Garner was a mess and depended on her son to ease her pain. The father selfishly decided to start a new family and leave his children behind with their broken mother. Medina was more equipped to handle this , but Jim fell apart. His downward spiral was so sad. That ending was heartbreaking, but that's how things are nowadays. I appreciated the movie for that.","user":"erinlorijackson","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"Sad Slice of Life","rating":7,"date":"10 December 2017","review":"Another reviewer referred to this film as \"cruel.\" I think a better word is \"sad.\" It was quite well done. Despite anticipating the brother's demise, I was moved to tears at the end. The film did a great job of showing the complexities of being in a nuclear family in the 21st century, though, to be honest, I wasn't sure of the time frame until Facebook was mentioned. In most films that take place today the cell phone plays a major role and in this film it didn't, though they did Skype. <br><br>Anyway, Jennifer Garner is usually not a favorite of mine, but her acting in this film was excellent as was Maika Monroe's. The complex emotions exchanged by the members of this broken upper middle class family were realistic, palpable, and multi-dimensional. For example, it would have been easy to simply hate the father (Justin Kirk) for falling out of love with his wife and leaving his family for another one, yet one scene in which he explains himself to his daughter, bore some truths which made me feel empathy for him as well as the others. <br><br>The story was presented with depth which is what made it successful, in my opinion. It's not a happy film, or even particularly hopeful, but it is a realistic slice of life and engrossing.","user":"Moviegoer19","rank":[23,28]},{"title":"Cruel and Real","rating":4,"date":"4 December 2017","review":"This is a very good movie, people and characters in it are all look real. The broken marriages to so many families nowadays in almost every country of the world not only affected so many husbands and wives but also seriously messed up their children. America's social infrastructure is like a broken and shattered glass, so many broken families, so many toilet relationships, so many twisted hardship that kids have to deal with their parents' bad marriage. America has become a weird family tree, its branches and leaves so complicated, either the wives carried their kids to new marriage, or the husbands brought their kids from his first, second or even 3rd marriage to newest wives, while their newer wives or husbands also got their own kids from their former marriages. More divorces simply complicated the family tree's growth and burdened it to unknown, unpredictable and unfathomable abyss. Kids growing up from such broken families many have twisted views almost to everything that ensured them to repeat the same or similar situations of their own marriages, their relationship to their opposite gender. They would become a bad copy of their parents and usually, the 2nd or the 3rd copy will be always worse than its 1st edition.<br><br>This is a very cruel but up close and personal film that I could hardly be able to watch to the end. I pity the three young children from two different broken families. The hardships they have to deal with 24/7 are so cruel and unbearable. I felt so sad while watching it and couldn't resist thinking of my elder son's broken marriage, and the grandson jammed in between his mother and father. The hardship my son has to deal with everyday is beyond every word could be described. <br><br>This film is just too cruel to watch.....","user":"LogicIsEverything","rank":[27,37]}]
