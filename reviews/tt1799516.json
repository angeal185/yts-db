[{"title":"Other reviewers lighten up","rating":8,"date":"31 March 2018","review":"I have two very very sensitive children and they loved the movie. The only \"dark\" scenes were the turning Benji out in the rain and when the children's mom tells Benji to leave after he takes her to the kidnappers' house. People complaining the dog didn't have enough personality, really?!! I though Benji and the other mutt he picked up to help out had plenty of personality. My kids ended the film by hugging and kissing both our pooches and in good moods.","user":"stephaniecampion","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Family instant classic","rating":10,"date":"24 July 2018","review":"Captured both the original movie with a new storyline the fit in perfectly!
