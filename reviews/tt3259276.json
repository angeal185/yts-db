[{"title":"Comically bad movie","rating":2,"date":"6 April 2018","review":"The basic concept of this film could be an interesting one if treated in the correct manner. Unfortunately, the title and blurb give the entire plot away - young dweeb turns to steroids to make up for his insecurities &amp; inadequacies but falls victim to addiction and the fabled 'roid rage'. There really is nothing more to the plot than that...<br><br>The dialogue is laughable (especially that of the lead character's father in the final scenes), and the only cast members who come out of this with any dignity are Thai Edwards and Cameron Barsanti.<br><br>The guy playing the lead role looks like Brian Peppers and is portrayed as a total loser at the start of the film - there is zero credibility to his relationship with his girlfriend.<br><br>It seems odd that 'Kali Muscle' appears so high on the cast billing - his contribution lasts no longer than 10 seconds and includes no dialogue.<br><br>Ignore the fake reviews - this is a total dud.","user":"warrenhindle","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"Horrible","rating":1,"date":"15 September 2018","review":"Could of been a good movie if the entire idea wouldn't of been falsified because of the lack of knowledge. Good plot, bad characters, and unrealistic.","user":"dipietrochris","rank":[6,11]},{"title":"Great movie !","rating":9,"date":"7 May 2018","review":"I was expecting garbage, since I was mostly studio movies and only do independent if they've gained a name. However, this one I was pleasantly surprised. Although the main actor's face is a bit hard to look at for 2 hours, he did a good job, and the movie came together with a good supporting cast. It told the story well, and I felt the emotion and trauma that people were going through. It was a little predictable, only downfall. Despite someone else's comments the dialogue is all necessary to the plot development and I thought lines were delivered well.","user":"misterphilipj","rank":[4,7]}]
