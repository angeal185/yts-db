[{"title":"Wow this is dumb","rating":1,"date":"13 January 2019","review":"A waste of 2 minutes! Looks like a high school movie project. Wait I've seen high school projects better than this.","user":"robertjberry-55128","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Absolute crap on so many levels!","rating":1,"date":"24 December 2018","review":"Ha - Even with this film being so, so, so, so, so crap, I watched it all. I can confirm that it is absolute crap, with crappy, crappy acting, a crappy, crappy plot and a crappy, crappy everything else. What the hell possessed me to watch it all, I really don't know.<br><br>By the way, clearly the 10 ratings are fakes. No way is it a 1 even - but IMDB doesn't provide 0s or negative ratings.<br><br>So guys and gals, watch something else, but definitely not this!","user":"contactmaz","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Nothing","rating":2,"date":"31 December 2018","review":"There is nothing good that can be said about this movie,from go to whoa it is an absolute stinker in every way,shape and form.The script is awful,the camera work is awful and the acting is just woeful,it was just my stubborness to watch any movie I start from beginning to end so that I can leave an honest review that kept me at it,an absolute relief when it ended as badly as it began.Whatever you do,steer well away from this pile of dung.","user":"aw1963","rank":[11,12]}]
