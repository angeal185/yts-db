[{"title":"Incredible movie, compelling facts behind it","rating":10,"date":"10 November 2010","review":"I don't know exactly what to praise first.<br><br>First, there are the facts. They are very important. The doctors featured in this documentary have conducted numerous thorough nutritional studies (among them the likely most extensive nutritional study ever performed, the 'China study') that present compelling proof for a simple fact: Eating animal-based foods will make you sick. Eating a diet of whole food, low fat, plant based foods, will keep you healthy. However, they did not just find out this big secret, they used it very successfully over decades to treat - and cure - severely ill patients that had already been 'given up' by conventional medicine. When I first heard this story and saw the proof (I read the book before viewing the film), I asked myself 'Why did nobody ever tell me that?' The documentary answers this question, and you will not like the answer (it has a lot to do with what is more important for the US government, the financial well-being of its big food companies or the health of its citizens) <br><br>Second, there is the movie. Apart from bringing very important information, it is well made and entertaining. Nobody likes to hear talking heads reciting scientific data, regardless how important it is, for the length of a movie. The way it is made, weaving stories with background information, makes it worth viewing also from the entertainment point of view.<br><br>And third, there's the fact that the entire film crew (producers, directors, cameramen, cutters, even the interns on the set) and the composer of the music score all adopted a lifestyle based on plant based nutrition. If this does not tell you that the information presented is credible and convincing, then what does? Go see the movie. If possible, go for one of the pre-screenings or see it later in a cinema near you. And most likely also at the Academy Awards presentation...<br><br>Best regards, Andy","user":"andythaler","rank":[92,127]},{"title":"A Case Could Be Made - Most Important Documentary Ever","rating":10,"date":"27 July 2010","review":"I saw this film at a screening in Philadelphia on July 26th. <br><br>Most of us understand by now that the typical Western diet is not ideal. But this film explains that, in early clinical studies and scientific research, the overwhelming evidence points to some specific things we eat that are slowly killing us. It also explains that there is a way to eat that you will very likely live long and well. This movie is as simple as that, and as complex as that. <br><br>Traveling along with some of the pioneers in this field, you get to really see how obvious the approach they support is to them, and probably should be to us. You also get a \"taste\" of what this movement is up against. I get the sense that this film's point is to show the Dr.'s who were screaming: \"Why isn't anyone listening to us?\" and giving them a chance to say, \"Hey everyone, here is what we have been saying for 20 years, and here is our clinical and scientific proof, now go ahead and tell us how we are wrong.\" <br><br>Most of all, it is very well done. I really enjoyed how well the stories intertwined, as well as some terrific graphics. Some of the personal stories, for me, were the most convincing. <br><br>Every once in a while, a documentary comes out that is just in the right place at the right time to become must see and force social change. I believe in 10 years, people will be talking about this film as the moment when America and Europe finally \"Got It\". I cannot imagine that this will not be an early favorite for an Oscar for Best Documentary.","user":"dhunsber","rank":[91,127]},{"title":"open wide","rating":8,"date":"12 June 2011","review":"By now, there have been a number of documentaries about the health disaster that is the all-American diet. Lee Fulkerson's \"Forks Over Knives\" makes the case that simply switching from an animal-based diet to a plant-based one is the best thing that one can do not only for himself but also for the planet. Much of the documentary focuses on the work of Drs. Caldwell Esselstyn and Colin Campbell, who have researched the health effects of different foods over the years. It should come as no surprise that the increased processing of foods after WWII led to more heart disease and cancer.<br><br>The documentary doesn't simply preach. It even has a disclaimer at the beginning noting that it should not be interpreted as a substitute for a doctor's recommendation. It's just a warning about the deleterious effects of the western diet, especially with all the chemicals and antibiotics pumped into the food nowadays. As Bill Maher says in some footage, \"The answer is not another pill. The answer is spinach.\" I recommend the documentary.<br><br>PS: Rush Limbaugh recently said that Michelle Obama's proposed diet doesn't sound like something healthy. Well, who knows more about unhealthy diets than El Rushbo?","user":"lee_eisenberg","rank":[46,63]}]
