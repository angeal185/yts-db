[{"title":"Haunting and disturbing, but ultimately redemptive","rating":10,"date":"23 October 2003","review":"I avoided this when it came out in 1989 having seen Coming Home (1978)  and not wanting to revisit the theme of paraplegic sexual dysfunction  and frustration. I also didn't want to reprise the bloody horror of our  involvement in the war in Vietnam that I knew Oliver Stone was going to  serve up. And Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic? I just didn't think it would  work.  Well, my preconceptions were wrong.  First of all, for those who think that Tom Cruise is just another  pretty boy (which was basically my opinion), this movie sets that  mistaken notion to rest. He is nothing short of brilliant in a role  that is enormously demanding--physically, mentally, artistically, and  emotionally. I don't see how anybody could play that role and still be  the same person. Someday in his memoirs, Tom Cruise is going to talk  about being Ron Kovic as directed by Oliver Stone.  And second, Stone's treatment of the sex life of Viet Vets in  wheelchairs is absolutely without sentimentality or silver lining.  There are no rose petals and no soft pedaling. There was no Jane Fonda,  as in Coming Home, to play an angel of love. Instead the high school  girl friend understandably went her own way, and love became something  you bought if you could afford it.  And third, Stone's depiction of America--and this movie really is about  America, from the 1950s to the 1970s--from the pseudo-innocence of  childhood war games and 4th of July parades down Main street USA to  having your guts spilled in a foreign land and your brothers-in-arms  being sent home in body bags--was as indelible as black ink on white  parchment. He takes us from proud moms and patriotic homilies to the  shameful neglect in our Veteran's hospitals to the bloody clashes  between anti-war demonstrators and the police outside convention halls  where reveling conventioneers wave flags and mouth phony slogans.  I have seen most of Stone's work and as far as fidelity to authentic  detail and sustained concentration, this is his best. There are a  thousand details that Stone got exactly right, from Dalton Trumbo's  paperback novel of a paraplegic from WW I, Johnny Got His Gun, that sat  on a tray near Kovic's hospital bed, to the black medic telling him  that there was a more important war going on at the same time as the  Vietnam war, namely the civil rights movement, to a mother throwing her  son out of the house when he no longer fulfilled her trophy case vision  of what her son ought to be, to Willem DaFoe's remark about what you  have to do sexually when nothing in the middle moves.  Also striking were some of the scenes. In particular, the confession  scene at the home of the boy Kovic accidentally shot; the Mexican  brothel scene of sex/love desperation, the drunken scene at the pool  hall bar and the pretty girl's face he touches, and then the drunken,  hate-filled rage against his mother, and of course the savage hospital  scenes--these and some others were deeply moving and likely to haunt me  for many years to come.  Of course, as usual, Oliver Stone's political message weighed heavily  upon his artistic purpose. Straight-laced conservatives will find his  portrait of America one-sided and offensive and something they'd rather  forget. But I imagine that the guys who fought in Vietnam and managed  to get back somehow and see this movie, will find it redemptive.  Certainly to watch Ron Kovic, just an ordinary Joe who believed in his  country and the sentiments of John Wayne movies and comic book heroics,  go from a depressed, enraged, drug-addled waste of a human being to an  enlightened, focused, articulate, and ultimately triumphant spokesman  for the anti-war movement, for veterans, and the disabled was wonderful  to see. As Stone reminds us, Kovic really did become the hero that his  misguided mother dreamed he would be.  No other Vietnam war movie haunts me like this one. There is something  about coming back less than whole that is worse than not coming back at  all that eats away at our consciousness. And yet in the end there is  here displayed the triumph of the human will and a story about how a  man might find redemption in the most deplorable of circumstances.  --Dennis Littrell, author of \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't  Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\"","user":"DeeNine-2","rank":[158,193]},{"title":"Reality hurts","rating":8,"date":"4 February 2007","review":"When you see a war veteran campaigning against the very war in which he was willing to die once, you begin to have second thoughts about the intent behind the war. Many Americans went deep into this deliberation when veterans like Ron Kovic went on record questioning the wisdom behind US's offensive against Vietnam. Regardless of historical outcome of the war, the question will haunt USA forever -was the Vietnam War a noble and just cause. Your answer could be anything depending upon your political and ideological preferences, but the reality of thousands who lost their lives and limbs continues to hurt.<br><br>Oliver Stone's Born on Fourth of July - based on the true story of Ron Kovic - takes the audience through the triumph and trauma of a crusader who went from one side of the war debate to the other. Ron wanted to fight for his country and stop the evil force of communism dead in its tracks. He went to Vietnam to defend his nation but came back soon, injured and doomed to suffer further. In the inadequately equipped hospital, his dreamer instincts crashed against the harsh realities of political ambivalence, not for the first time though.<br><br>Over next eight years that are depicted in this masterpiece, the character of Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise with unprecedented brilliance) goes through the trauma of knowing that no one will \"love him now\", that even his own sibling is not on the same side of ideology, that the government had more pressing issues than taking good care of war veterans, that his countrymen did not necessarily endorse of his view point. The reality that he killed a soldier from his own army, the reality that he was the unfortunate one to butcher children and women in Vietnam, the reality that he would not be able to father a child, the reality of his realization that his government had made a wrong case for the war - it all kept gnawing at his conscience. It kept gnawing him until he opened up to speak about what was wrong about this war. Thus 'ended' the patriotic fervor of a driven person, but he continued his passion as an antiwar activist.<br><br>Born on Fourth of July may have been the story of one Ron Kovic, but there are many others whose sentiments would echo with this veteran's. At the end, there is no easy way out of this debate. War always comes with its baggage of pain, trauma and hurt. Whether Vietnam was a mistake or not - the arguments would go on forever. So would the history of people who aspired to be motivated by JFK's historical urge - Ask not what your country can do for you, See what you can do for your country - only to realize that in every war there is only one casualty - the human spirit. And this reality hurts.","user":"anupam-satyasheel","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Don't overlook the story","rating":9,"date":"14 February 2002","review":"You've heard the express \"can't see the forest for the trees\", right?  It refers to someone who gets so caught up in details, they miss the big picture.  Reading other comments on IMDb regarding \"Born on the Fourth of July\", I think people have the opposite problem with this film.  So many people seem to get caught up in talking about Vietnam, war, Nixon, America, Communism, and hippies, that they totally overlook Ron Kovic. <br><br>\nRon Kovic is the center of this film.  In \"Platoon\", war was the center, and the central character (Charlie Sheen's Chris Taylor) was merely a POV character through whose eyes we could see war.  Not so in \"Born on the Fourth of July\".  Vietnam is the setting, the context, and the backdrop. But Ron Kovic is the story.  <br><br>Oliver Stone really understands a character arc.  Look at Kovic's life, where it starts, where it ends.  The film is the journey, how he got from A to B.  It is a dramatization of a life, as opposed to an actual life, but it still rings true.  It feels true.  It reaches an artistic level of truth, even if some literal truths are overlooked, distorted, or rearranged. That's what Stone is trying to do.  People who quibble about the facts miss the point.  (This is a theme I will take up again when I review some of Stone's other films, as Stone is constantly being bashed for historical inaccuracies.)  The connections from one point to the next work admirably, and the progression is completely believable, which is quite a feat for such a dramatic change of attitude (compare to \"American History X\", where the main character goes through a similar about face with scant motivation). <br><br>\nAnyway, what impresses me about this film is the honesty and respect with which Stone presents the opposing views of the film.  Say what you want about Stone's political beliefs, but the argument in this film is presented in a very neutral light.  It's a story about Kovic's choices, Kovic's politics, Kovic's judgments.  And the anti-Vietnam beliefs he finally supports in the final act are a very natural and believable outcome of the story.  This film isn't anywhere near as didactic as some people like to imagine.  <br><br>The tragedy of Oliver Stone is that, because he has been so edgy, so controversial, so deliberately provocative, no one can really just sit down and, with a neutral eye, watch his films.  They have become so burdened by this giant, irrelevant, political squabble.  The films have been subsumed by the very issues they sought to raise.  And it's a shame, with this film especially, because it is excellent.  <br><br>Tom Cruise gives possibly the greatest performance of his career (I can't think of anything that tops it, though his performance in \"Eyes Wide Shut\", for very different reasons, is just as remarkable).  The script is fantastic, taking time where it needs to take time, but not overly deliberate in its approach.  It's very economical with time.  It knows what each scene needs to say, and says it without any excess baggage, wasted space, or dead time.  The direction is excellent, as is the editing and cinematography.  The supporting cast is excellent.  <br><br>But this movie would be nothing without the remarkable, heart-rending, true story of Ron Kovic.  So, while we admire the technical achievement of the film, while we debate the points raised, while we enshrine or excoriate the director (as the case may be), let's not forget the story.  Let's not get so fired up about Vietnam that we forget Ron Kovic.  He is the heart and soul of this film.  <br><br>One final note:  I bristle when people call this an anti-war film.  That really diminishes it, I think.  It's so much more than that.  It's not just saying that war is brutal, nasty, and horrific.  It's saying something far more specific about a specific war, and about the effect of that war on a specific man.","user":"andrew7","rank":[71,86]}]
