[{"title":"A classic for Laughton fans","rating":24,"date":"24 May 2001","review":"While this picture is not one of Hitchcock's more memorable pieces, it is nevertheless well worth a look simply to view the acting genius of Charles Laughton. The man is larger than life as the revolting yet oddly fascinating Sir Humphrey and provides the audience with far more insight into the character than a lesser actor might have done. This is not simply a one-dimensional villain that we are so used to seeing in British movies of this period. In addition to a superb reading of the script, Laughton is clearly ad-libbing in various scenes, further breaking down hitherto scrupulously maintained boundaries between audience and actor. I urge anyone who is weary of today's usual line-up of blockbuster big names to observe a true master at work and wonder where it all went wrong!","user":"Bruno Morphet","rank":[50,53]},{"title":"For once Robert Newton as a HERO!","rating":29,"date":"29 August 2001","review":"Most people tend to remember Robert Newton as Long John Silver, a role he perfected long after he gave up as an actor.<br><br>Jamaica Inn is an early film and here you see a fine looking Newton with the longest, darkest eyelashes I have ever seen on a man.<br><br>A side note:  Not too long before Jamaica Inn was made, a scout for Sam Goldwyn spotted Newton in London and thought he would be perfect for the role of Heathcliff in the up-coming Wuthering Heights.  Newton tested for the role and everyone but Goldwyn was thrilled.  Goldwyn though Newton was \"too ugly\" to play Heathcliff, although everyone else thought he combined the emotional intensity and the black gypsy look that was perfect for that role.  Eventually, Laurence Olivier was cast.  He admitted that he always believed, his great friend, Newton would have been better, darker and more naturally dangerous as Heathcliff. I often wonder how Newton's career would have changed had he been given the role of Heathcliff.<br><br>Hitchcock takes advantage of the dual danger/kindness elements of Newton's personality to create a memorable hero.  A young and lovely Maureen O'Hara is cast as the woman who comes to live with her Aunt after the death of her mother, only to discover she is in a den of cut-throats.  She witnesses Newton being hung and just manages to save his life.  Charles Laughton lends his special talent for seeming to one sort of person while actually being something quite different and Hitchcock rolls all these characters and a marvelous Leslie Banks, into a fine tumble of thievery and honor, love and loyalty, crime and punishment.<br><br>There are many of the familiar Hitchcock touches to move things along.<br><br>The climax is a bit over-the-top, but it affords Laughton a marvelous few moments.<br><br>Jamaica Inn has been re-made several times, but no one can replace Hitchcock, Newton, O'Hara and Banks.","user":"countryway_48864","rank":[52,57]},{"title":"Um... I disagree with most of the comments here...","rating":8,"date":"30 January 2005","review":"My wife and I had not heard of Jamaica Inn at all prior to buying a DVD collection of Hitchcock's works. We decided to watch the film as the Jamaica Inn is near where my Cornish ancestors lived.<br><br>We actually found the film gripping. Yes, the acting is stagy at times, but we always enjoy the \"old style\" acting. Apart from the dodgy special effects, we found the film quite gripping. Others have said that the Squire was clearly the villain from the start. That is true. The tension comes from us being aware that this is so - and watching as the hero and heroine become ensnared by him. Similarly, the almost constant night time scenes and the howling gales are oppressive and eerie...<br><br>Critics may say that the film is not as good as Psycho or The Birds. However, this film was made 20 years prior to those films. I think that it was a good effort, considering that it was made on the eve of WWII.","user":"seanahalpin","rank":[40,45]}]
