[{"title":"Captures The Fun of 80's Holiday Slashers","rating":8,"date":"14 September 2018","review":"I was fortunate enough to catch a screening of this at a film festival (under the title Stirring) and I was really surprised by how much fun it was. Obviously shot with a low-budget, Mrs. Claus doesn't let that get in its way. If you take a chunk of To All A Goodnight (complete with the prologue prank gone wrong) and throw in a few dollops of Black Christmas and Silent Night, Deadly Night, you might get some idea for what this film is trying to achieve. <br><br>The cast is a mostly appealing bunch, it's fairly well shot, and the special effects are pretty terrific. I must thank the filmmakers for casting Brinke Stevens and Helene Udy and giving them more than just thankless cameos (which seems to be a plague among many indie horror films - if you're casting these pros, give them something to do). They're given a good deal to do here and they're a blast to watch. <br><br>If you're looking for a deep, thought-provoking horror film, this won't be your thing, but those of you looking for a fun throwback to mindless 80's slashers will find a lot to enjoy.","user":"marcusgrant-86630","rank":[20,36]},{"title":"Better than I Expected","rating":6,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"Usually I will skip the low budget movies but this one was actually pretty good. No doubt there's the usual low budget things going on throughout. It was entertaining though (intentionally &amp; unintentionally) and cast was good enough to keep me interested. I liked the main character girl. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for Christmas Horror.","user":"dontworrybaby","rank":[10,17]},{"title":"Mrs Claus Sucks!","rating":2,"date":"24 November 2018","review":"The only reason this movie is getting a 2 is because of the cover art. That's it. What a load of crap.","user":"emilie8605","rank":[14,29]}]
