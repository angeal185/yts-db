[{"title":"Runs out of ideas, but not as bad as its rep","rating":6,"date":"5 June 2011","review":"This is not the worst movie of 2006 as I have heard it often cited, Little Man and Date Movie are much worse. But it is no Pan's Labyrinth or Children of Men either, nor did it need to be. Instead it is a flawed but reasonably entertaining film. It is predictable in the story yes, it runs out of ideas at the end(didn't like the freeze frame for example) and the script and characters in a sense are clich√©d. However, the film does look good with striking locations and fashions and the photography is above adequate. The soundtrack is bright and breezy, the pace is snappy and there are some amusing situations. Plus the entire cast are likable and do give it their all, while she has been better(ie. Mean Girls and Freaky Friday) Lindsay Lohan is very charming. All in all, not that bad in my opinion. 6/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Silly, But Entertaining","rating":6,"date":"8 July 2007","review":"In Manhattan, Ashley Albright (Lindsay Lohan) is a lucky woman and very successful in the agency where she works. The clumsy Jake Hardin (Chris Pine) is an unlucky aspirant manager of the rock band McFly, who is unsuccessfully trying to contact the entrepreneur Damon Phillips (Faizon Love) to promote his band. When Ashley meets Jake in a masquerade party, they kiss each other, swapping her fortune with his bad luck.<br><br>\"Just My Luck\" is a very silly and predictable comedy, but also entertaining. Lindsay Lohan is charming and adorable as usual and shows a good chemistry with Chris Pine making this movie work. Further, the story has no villain and all the characters are nice. Forget the private life of Linday in the tabloids and enjoy 103 minutes of fun in this forgettable fell-good movie. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Sorte no Amor\" (\"Luck in Love\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Love the Distraction, too bad the movies is so hated.","rating":8,"date":"12 August 2006","review":"To be honest, I didn't expect this movie to have been as hated as it seems to be. It seems to have a high number of both 10/10s and 1/10s... as if you either love it or hate it? Well, I loved the fact that the movie distracted me enough to relax and unwind for an hour and a half. I didn't think it was groundbreaking, so originally I was going to give it 9/10, but also, I though it was very straightforward and plot twists are usually important parts of dramas and romantic comedies.<br><br>The thing is, though; I've never expected romantic comedies to have very much story or be very heavy on plot. So, all I was looking for was something to occupy me... and I got it.<br><br>There's not much else to say, except that I really don't think the movie was so bad that it deserves a 1/10. When you consider the genre, it was fairly average. Plus, \"blonde humor\" is funny, and I think that's why the girl-who-was-lucky was so silly: she was really not accustomed to thinking critically, relying on her good luck (i.e. a very positive, problem-free environment) to provide a platform for her success.","user":"bajan13k","rank":[52,73]}]
