[{"title":"I was born in SC in 1972. I'm flooded with memories!","rating":8,"date":"18 January 2020","review":"First of all, Viola Davis could make a documentary about paper bags, and I would watch it. She's an amazing actress. Anyway, the movie is reminiscent of those movies in the 80s, where the story has a little of everything and slowly paced. The movie is cast well, and they all did a good job with the Southern accent. It annoys me greatly when movie makers make the accents an after thought.<br><br>The plot is basically a little girl trying to overcome the death of her mom while navigating the cruel waters of middle school. But, she's quirky and doesn't mind putting herself out there to accomplish her goals; becoming a form of Girl Scout in order to live her biggest dream. It's funny, heart warming and outright fun. However, those who didn't grow up in the late 70s, early 80s may not appreciate the movie as much as I did. They paid close attention to the time period and to the South. The setting and wardrobe is spot on. Although, they definitely tone down the racial tension of the time.<br><br>It's a cute movie. I would suggest craving out time in your afternoon to watch it.","user":"tbyrd-50088","rank":[36,44]},{"title":"Sweet, heartwarming and impressively dramatic","rating":7,"date":"20 January 2020","review":"A quirky tale of kids aiming high in their scouts' troop, Troop Zero isn't the world's most original film, but that doesn't mean it can't be a delightful watch. Sweet and heartwarming with a dash of inspiring drama throughout, this is a really lovely movie that blends engaging characters with upbeat and pleasant emotion.<br><br>While it's never quite on the offbeat or surprisingly touching level of the likes of Moonrise Kingdom, Troop Zero is an impressively likable watch that's appropriate for younger viewers, and just as captivating for adults.<br><br>It's not an ode to the nostalgia of childhood as you may expect, but it's a film that really engrosses you in the lives of its characters, from its ambitious young misfits to a handful of surprisingly complex adult characters, particularly in the form of Viola Davis.<br><br>In that, Troop Zero isn't just a throwaway, Disney-esque kids' movie, but a genuinely engaging comedy-drama, brought to life with both sobering drama and wonderfully heartwarming emotion, not to mention a collection of great performances.<br><br>Viola Davis stars in the lead adult role as the woman who seeks to help a group of children achieve their dreams, but is troubled by failures in her own past. Throughout, Davis does a great job of blending a warm, almost motherly quality with genuine gravitas, and while the film's main focus is squarely on the fates of the children, she proves an enthralling supporting lead throughout.<br><br>But the real standout here is young Mckenna Grace, who is an absolute joy as Christmas Flint, the young misfit with dreams of speaking to aliens and travelling to outer space. Not only is she utterly adorable throughout, but also holds her own against legendary actors like Viola Davis in the film's more dramatic moments, impressing with engrossing emotional resonance alongside her boundless lovability.<br><br>Add all that together, and Troop Zero is an effortlessly likable film, with pleasant humour and engaging drama across the board. It's not a purely easy-going watch, and impresses with engaging and complex emotion at times throughout.<br><br>However, it's a wonderfully sweet, kind-hearted and uplifting tale of big dreams and doing what you love. It may not be the touchingly nostalgic tale to childhood it perhaps could have been, but with charisma, laughs and a big heart all the way through, it's a film that will easily put a big smile on your face.","user":"themadmovieman","rank":[32,40]},{"title":"Troop zero","rating":10,"date":"17 January 2020","review":"Fantastic movie.. it has a wonderful message of encouragement, friendship and love.
