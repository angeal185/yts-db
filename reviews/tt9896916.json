[{"title":"Wonderful message!","rating":9,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"It's true that sometimes the animation is found a little lacking in this movie, but the heart and soul of the message of the film more than makes up for that! I never read the book, but was always intrigued by it, and this was a wonderful and accessible way to see what it was about!","user":"nicksurguine","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"Amazing movie IF you are wearing spiritual goggles","rating":10,"date":"4 August 2019","review":"The CG could have been a lot better and the only way to really review it is to be honest. If you are a Christian and have a deep understanding of the spiritual world then you will love this movie - if your not it will be painful and pointless to watch.<br><br>The story is a timeless classic and my 6 and 7 year old watched all 100 'minutes with only one visit to the bathroom (usually about 10 visits per movie when they are bored).<br><br>I would definitely recommend and will watch again.<br><br>Maria","user":"maria-50336","rank":[21,25]},{"title":"A MESSAGE for the SPIRITUALS","rating":10,"date":"7 August 2019","review":"When you have stopped viewing life way beyond the physical, only then can you truly understand the messages relayed in this movie. Thank you for this as it will continue to be an inspiration to many.<br><br>He who has ears let him hear what the Spirit is saying.<br><br>I thank God for you, John Bunyan.<br><br>i will gladly recommend this.","user":"neroogodo","rank":[15,19]}]
