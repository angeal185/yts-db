[{"title":"A horrible script overshadows some good performances","rating":2,"date":"8 December 2017","review":"Back in 1990 Jef Geeraerts wrote a book called Double-Face. I love that book. Jef died in 2015. I'm almost glad he never got to see how his excellent book about a serial-killer got butchered as badly as the victims in it.<br><br>This is the third outing of Koen De Bouw and Werner De Smedt as Vincke and Verstuyft and both are quite comfortable in their roles with especially De Smedt giving an excellent performance.<br><br>And that's where the good news ends: the female lead Sofie Hoflack gives one of the flattest performances of the year, there's no emotion, no depth, nothing. She seems to only have been cast for her willingness to do most of her scenes nude or partly nude. The sharp contrast with De Smedt, with whom she shares the majority of her scenes, is disconcerting.<br><br>The director, Jan Verheyen, knows his trade, he directed the previous one \"Dossier K\" as well, yet overdoes the aerial shots and fast cuts in such a way that it quickly becomes irritating. It is unfortunately also clear he wanted to emulate the American Way of making thrillers which simply doesn't fit a Belgian story. (There's a shoot-out near the end of the movie to illustrate that point perfectly).<br><br>The main problem however is the script. In the original book the killer is caught by accident quite early in the story and the remainder of the book narrates the chilling interviews Vincke and Verstuyft have with the killer who suffers from paranoia and schizophrenia. It was meticulously researched by Geeraerts who even spend time at Quantico.<br><br>This script however threw all of that overboard for a messy whodunit which will have you screaming in frustration at the reveal as nothing makes sense: all the clues, all the twists, false leads and suspects are rendered useless by a ridiculous plot twist which disregards all the information we knew about the killer up to that point, there's no motive and no clear idea behind any of it. It is, by far, one of the worst plot-twists I've seen in the last couple of years with the sole purpose of having a \"shocking\" twist and not bothering to make a small bit of sense. Even the actions of De Smedts character after he finds out who the killer is are only there to go into an action scene with, again, a bunch of aerial shots and fast cuts. It is a complete mess of a story that puts the whole movie beyond saving.<br><br>Don't bother with this one. Rewatch De Zaak Alzheimer/Memory of a killer which is in every way a superior movie.","user":"krissa75","rank":[15,21]},{"title":"A decent and exciting crime-detective movie","rating":8,"date":"6 November 2017","review":"This movie is one of the better Belgian crime movies I've seen so far. In the beginning the movie has its flaws with some unclear scenes or stereotypes, but the more you get involved in the murder case, the more clear it becomes how excellent the cinematography fits with some exciting action scenes. Towards the climax of the movie there are some very well directed action scenes and the movies becomes more tensive and the story as well proves to be more ingenious.","user":"timvandenbranden96","rank":[13,18]},{"title":"The Movie Rises Above the Script","rating":6,"date":"24 April 2018","review":"The acting and the pacing help this movie rise above the underlying script, a hackneyed, contrived story of the search for a serial killer. It has all the usual elements? Do we have a methodical, team oriented policeman in conflict with an intuitive cop with no impulse control? Yes. Do we have a list of stereotyped suspects that fit the bill perfectly? Yes, including (!!!) a psychiatric patient with a pet claw hammer.","user":"reidandgenene","rank":[3,3]}]
