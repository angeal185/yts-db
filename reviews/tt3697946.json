[{"title":"Not bad, but not as good as the original","rating":6,"date":"25 January 2017","review":"Once again, Janne gets himself in for more than he can seemingly handle on a night's outing with his buddy Tapio and, later, their friend Kapu. However, the hi-jinks this time involve, rather than a quest to get a digital box, the well-being of Janne and Inari's infant daughter, Lumi. In addition, Inari and Tapio's girlfriend, Marjukka - for whom he's moved from the locale of the title to southern Finland - decide to have a girls' night out. Enter Mikko, the former flame of Inari and Janne's would-be-challenger from the original movie. He now owns and operates an upscale resort, complete suites outfitted with electronically controlled fireplaces, wall screens and birds in cages. The threesome our friends tangled with in the first movie are back, while notable new characters include a a speed junkie/thief, an somewhat officious hotel clerk and his gambling addicted colleague, a couple of bemused local cops, Janne's parents and a stud-for-the-night that the rather hot-to-trot Marjukka encounters in the bar. Kapu has outfitted his wheels with a massive sound system. When asked how many decibels it gives out, he replies that its volume is measured with the Richter scale. As in the first movie, seemingly unbelievable problems are encountered by the well-being but not-all-that-bright trio of buddies, leaving one in semi-suspense as to whether all will work out in the end. Animal-loving types might be a bit put off by the fate of the bird in the bedroom Mikko and Inari visit, and will definitely not enjoy what happens to the reindeer who found mushrooms in Kapu's car just as the boys remotely turned up its volume to help find their way out of the woods. Nonetheless, not a bad way to kill an hour-and-a-half, but the humour is a bit tamer and not so off-the-wall as it was in the original outing - maybe a sign of the increasing maturity of the young-boys-in-adult-bodies persona of Janne and his mates.","user":"stevergy2000","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"V채lisell채 v채채nnetty","rating":4,"date":"1 January 2019","review":"Ja vain paikoittain hauska.
