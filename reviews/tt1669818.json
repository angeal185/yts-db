[{"title":"Cute but somewhat intense adventure movie","rating":7,"date":"2 January 2018","review":"Just watched this movie with my kids, ages 3-10. We laughed and cried, we screamed at certain points. The story follow a 6-year-old boy and his baby sister, who after a car wreck have to travel on their own to their grandmother's house. Their journey contains many moments of intense peril, as the children are pursued by wolves and an angry hobo. They also come across a couple of huge wolf traps in a rather scary scene. Some parts are rather intense because of the perilous situations involving the baby. My kids did get upset at points but the baby is never harmed and everything turns out for the best. The ending is very heart warming and sweet. Overall a very dramatic and fun movie for the family.","user":"andreak2345","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Cute","rating":7,"date":"28 January 2019","review":"This is a very cute movie. Fun and well done. It is NOT Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. That is a different movie.","user":"mark-98452","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Not bizarre at all","rating":1,"date":"15 April 2018","review":"I don't get it this show isn't bizarre at all.
