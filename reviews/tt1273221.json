[{"title":"Quite Terrible.","rating":2,"date":"14 February 2019","review":"This is not in any way a cult classic. It's just a terrible movie. Amber Heard is hot in this. Billy Bob Thornton is ok in it. (He kind of phones it in.) Johnny Depp has more screentime than Theo James, but is uncredited somehow. Too much of the movie is taken up by a darts throwing yellow-toothed Jim Sturgess who plays it far too unsavory to be believable. And the film is made up of these horrible Thornton voiceovers and... you know what? You are probably going to watch because of the hot girl. But trust me, just put on Showgirls, it's a better movie.","user":"catblack-692-314355","rank":[71,80]},{"title":"Annoying.","rating":2,"date":"20 February 2019","review":"I'm going to be brief: Jim Sturgess overacts so much it's embarrassing, my neighbours three dogs bark from the minute they leave to when they get back, Jim is way more irritating than them. It's like amateur dramatics night.<br><br>Give this one a wide berth.","user":"mikehavekin","rank":[44,50]},{"title":"Someone's perverted sexual fantasy","rating":7,"date":"7 October 2019","review":"This film tells the story of a writer who gets inspired by her neighbour of his flat swap.<br><br>Seriously, this film is so sexually charged that it gets me uncomfortable. It basically is the vehicle to objectify Amber Heard, thereby fulfilling someone's perverted sexual fantasy. It tries a bit of noir, but it does not succeed. Instead, it is less than engaging and does not offer suspense or mystery as intended.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[9,9]}]
