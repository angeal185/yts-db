[{"title":"Good B-movie concept, but poor execution","rating":5,"date":"9 July 2018","review":"The first thirty minutes of this movie really promised something nice. The acting was decent, the sound track great, and the visuals were on point. However, the story starts to slow down to a crawl and the \"action\" scenes are just BAD. The main character was engaging and active in the beginning but it also falls apart, becoming a whiny little thing.<br><br>The cast is diverse and mostly convincing. But the actors couldnt fight against bad writing.<br><br>I wish this had a better execution. Even for a b movie it fell flat.","user":"bruxabrvxa","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Find something else to do Cleopatra!","rating":2,"date":"4 July 2018","review":"The story is, well, so-so. It could have been written a lot better as an idea with drones, and the acting could have been a lot better!\nI felt like yelling \"Cut!\" in so many scenes. But I think there were enough cuts to make it not work! Where did Tanya disappear to at the motel? She was in the car with Claudia, then Claudia leaves the motel without Tanya! Continuity is not there, like some parts were cut out or something.\nClaudia has the \"Remote control\" and when faced with a drone runs away whimpering like some puppy instead of using what she had in her hand, after she had dropped it!\nI was starting to fall asleep when we had the second \"Transition\"... \nNah, I won't say judge for yourself, I'll say don't waste your time!","user":"Australian1","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"A pointless, very amateurish film that stretches its very manageable plot to over eighty minutes","rating":3,"date":"3 July 2018","review":"The main problem is the script, because apparently Ms Coleman lacks the experience to write three-dimensional characters and embed them into a working story. <br><br>Spoilers: A duo (he is old, she is young) help old and sick farmers to die - because of overpopulation or something. Both talk a lot of expository text, then a drone catches the old man at his house and kills him. Shocked, the young woman (played by Ms Coleman) questions her work. <br><br>The movie never really makes it clear what it wants to be about. Are drones evil? Or the AI? Or the people behind it? And how can any tension arise when the audience sees in the first minute of the film that a drone toasts the head of a poor innocent farmer? That would only be possible if our heroine were to come to the conclusion relatively quickly that something was wrong here. <br><br>But here we are back to the horrible script: after twenty minutes of filming her partner dies, then our heroine needs an endless series of completely obvious clues. By the time she finally understands (finally!), we are already two thirds done with the film. So far we have learned, among other things, that she is expecting a child from her boss with whom she has no chemistry at all and who cries like a child over the death of her old colleague. This emotional outburst is particularly surprising, because the general performance follows the pattern of \"looking concerned and whispering sadly\". That was genuinely funny. \nThe atmosphere of the movie should probably be reminiscent of Blade Runner, with its calmness, synth music (plus a probably stolen song from a well-known cracktro from the 1990s. What the...) and its countless, irony-free drone shots. There is just a difference between a protagonist standing in front of spectacular future architecture and thinking about the definition of existence and life itself or a protagonist standing in front of a crop field and thinking about the possibility of the use of drones for murder. <br><br>In the end, of course, it's a clear culprit: the evil, evil management. Because \"the bad guys up there\" is always a wise solution when you have to come up with antagonists, right? So the ending is a classic ending of a conventional B-movie. And Sci-Fi? There is no discussion of the actual science fiction topics. Here they are little more than buzzwords for the following non-action.<br><br>So: A film without tension or focus but with a lot of padding, a messed up script with a very limited imagination, flat characters, monotonous acting (except the cry surprise), unremarkable direction, laughable special effects. If at least everything would be proper terrible, it could get cult status, but that's just not the case. And what's not terrible is just okay. That's why I had to write down my thoughts about the movie quickly, because in 48 hours I'll have already forgotten it completely.","user":"Markus_Beer","rank":[15,21]}]
