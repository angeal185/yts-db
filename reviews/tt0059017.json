[{"title":"Lee Marvin deserved the Oscar!","rating":4,"date":"4 April 2004","review":"I watched Cat Ballou again the other day after a gap of over 35 years. A spoof western, definitely. That Lee Marvin should not have won the Oscar? No way. It is far more difficult to carry off a role in what is obviously a pastiche than to excel in a serious dramatic part. Lee Marvin plays it to perfection. Watch his face in the bar scene in the hole in the wall, desperately trying to catch the moment to propose a toast - \"I'll drink to that!\". It's brilliant. This film has to be watched in the context of its time. It is no good trying to compare it to today's special effects dominated blockbusters or Pixar animations. The semi-musical format was innovative, and remains so today. Cat Ballou is a perfect example of 60's \"cool\".","user":"jeremyfd","rank":[71,79]},{"title":"Great western spoof, and Lee Marvin steals the film!","rating":8,"date":"15 January 2005","review":"Cat Ballou is a movie spoof unlike any other, and a great parody of the Western film genre. Jane Fonda appears in one of her most playful film roles (\"Barbarella\" is another light and funny Fonda classic), and Lee Marvin gives one of his finest film performances (he won his Oscar for his dual roles). Add to this mix a wondrous soundtrack, with Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye as minstrels of sorts who stroll and sing throughout, making the film almost seem like a musical; an outstanding supporting cast including Michael Callan (who later appeared on TV's \"One Life to Live\"), and Dwayne Hickman (TV's Dobie Gillis), and the result is this hilarious, thoroughly entertaining film that was nominated for five Academy Awards (Marvin was the sole winner). <br><br>Catherine Ballou (Fonda)is a recently graduated-from-school schoolteacher returning home to live with her father on his ranch, but he is gunned down upon her arrival. She enlists the help of a loyal ranch-hand, a couple of outlaws, and most notably, a has-been gunman by the name of Kid Sheleen (Marvin) to help her get revenge. The result is a thoroughly enjoyable film that still stands up today, and Lee Marvin stealing the entire film in his amazing dual role performance as both Tim Strong and Kid Sheleen. Lee Marvin alone makes the film well worth seeing.<br><br>The dialogue is great. Take this exchange as an example:<br><br>Jackson Two-Bears: \"Kid, Kid, what a time to fall off the wagon. Look at your eyes.\" Kid Sheleen: \"What's wrong with my eyes?\" Jackson Two-Bears: \"Well they're red; bloodshot.\" Kid Sheleen: \"You ought to see 'em from my side.\"<br><br>I was thrilled when the widescreen special edition of this long-time favorite of mine came out in 2003, and on DVD. I have the soundtrack on vinyl, but I have always wished that it would come out on CD; Nat King Cole is one of my all-time favorite singers, and his rendition of \"They'll Never Make Me Cry\" always makes me...anyway. This film still hasn't lost any of its humor or fun with the passing of time, and stays on of my personal \"top ten list\" of comedy.","user":"ClassicAndCampFilmReviews","rank":[66,74]},{"title":"Entertaining and funny western with agreeable comedy","rating":6,"date":"26 June 2005","review":"The movie concerns about a school teacher (Jane Fonda) become bandit who to avenge her father's (John Marley) death forms an outlaws' group constituted by a motley and butcher team ( Michael Callan , Tom Nardini and others). Later on , she engages a boozy gunfighter interpreted by Lee Marvin and they 'll take on the villains and nasties ( led by Reginald Denny) that have a hired gun , a murderer with an artificial nose ( also played by Marvin).<br><br>It's a bemusing western with adjusted runtime where there are humor ,tongue-in-cheek , spoof , irony, shootouts , it is fast moving and for that reason isn't boring but funny . Lee Marvin won a deserved Oscar Academy Award for his double playing as a drunken and sympathetic cowboy and his twin , an odious and ominous killer , he is the best . The support cast is awesome , thus appears the habitual secondary from Western : J.C.Flippen , Arthur Hunnicut and Bruce Cabot . Frank de Vol (usual musician of Robert Aldrich) soundtrack is jolly and lively . Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye play splendidly two singing minstrels . The film is well directed by Elliot Silverstein , he posteriorly will attain great success with ¨A man called horse¨. Rating: Good and nice. Well worth seeing.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[23,24]}]
