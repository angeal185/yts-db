[{"title":"Still Lethal","rating":7,"date":"25 February 2002","review":"I caught this movie on TV a few days ago, so I may as well voice my opinion. I've enjoyed all the \"Lethal Weapon\" flicks and I hope one day to buy a boxed set of DVDs containing all four in the series.  Don't ask which one I think is best.  They're all lots of fun to watch.  <br><br>Of course, the original didn't have as much humor as its sequels.  Mel Gibson's character was a downtrodden loner, who was established as a \"loose cannon.\"  But as the series continued, he suddenly turned into Buddy Hackett, cracking jokes left and right.  <br><br>Needless to say, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover make one of the best on-screen duos in the history of film.  Their characters of Riggs and Murtaugh are like polar opposites, but that's the beauty of it.  That's the essence of the buddy cop genre.  The two partners are always at each other's throats, yet they share a great bond and deliver much humor.  <br><br>Richard Donner is a spectacular action film director, and there are some breathtaking stunts.  The opening truck chase is extremely memorable. <br><br>\nAnd each and every scene is buoyed by great comic relief.  Gibson says a great line when he arrests the fraudulent truck driver:  \"You have the right to remain unconscious.  Whatever you say...ain't gonna be much.\"  That's a priceless line!  <br><br>OK, so the plot is meandering.  There are scenes that are very entertaining, yet don't really move the story along.  But the whole movie is so funny and exciting that I just think...who gives a damn?  I'm having too much fun! <br><br>\nJoe Pesci's character, Leo Getz, adds additional comic relief.  His bleached blond do is hilarious enough, and his nebbish schtick makes it all the more humorous.  Rene Russo is also added to the cast, to provide some good eye candy.  Just like the Bond girls, there's always a sexy love interest in the \"Lethal Weapon\" movies.  In the second movie, there was Patsy Kensit. <br><br>\nAnd there are some human elements to the story.  Danny Glover's Murtaugh still thinks \"he's getting too old for this s**t\" and is about to retire. He's suffering a severe middle-age crisis and to add to his problems, he ends up killing one of his son's friends--which he did out of self-defense. Sometimes I think Glover's acting talent is underrated.  And though this is a fluffy action/comedy, he delivers the kind of powerful performance he would in any Oscar-winning masterpiece.  <br><br>\"Lethal Weapon 3\" again showcases the immense talent of its two irreplacable leads.  This sequel packs a lethal punch and delivers first-class entertainment from start to finish.  And I love that Eric Clapton/Sting song \"It's Gonna Be Me.\"  <br><br>My score:  8 (out of 10)","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[26,32]},{"title":"Good, really, really good!","rating":7,"date":"8 June 2005","review":"This is a great series! Actually I could stop right here because I have already said what needs to be said but just for people's enjoyment I'll elaborate a little.<br><br>The acting is, much like in the two previous films, excellent. Somehow Mel Gibson and Danny Glover never seem to get tired of each other and it shows because their playful banter never seems to get tiring to the audience. Mel Gibson is a class actor and this time around he develops the character of Martin Riggs even further than he did in the second film. He is so good at portraying emotions that the audience genuinely feels with him. When he is angry you feel his anger and when he is sad you feel sad, you get the picture. The fact that he is so versatile shows in the contrasts of the character. He is both great in action-sequences and in romantic sequences. As for Danny Glover he also does a great job in bringing his character further and he really does in this installment because you get to see the more negative sides of the character this time around. In the first two films he was the character who didn't evolve much but took pride in it. This time, because retirement is rearing its ugly head, we get to see, what I must suppose was, the facade stripped away and see Murtaugh in his raw, pure form. Joe Pesci also returns this time for the comic relief and he is still funny. There is just something about the character of Leo Getz that is incredibly entertaining. However, the best performance is perhaps done by Stuart Wilson, an incredibly underrated actor who has sadly never really achieved a commercial breakthrough. He is the villain of this film and is perhaps the best villain of the series simply because he has more depth than any other villain in the series. He is also given considerably more screen time than many of the other villains so he really has a chance to shine. Rene Russo appears in this film as Riggs new romantic interest and she may not be the most gifted actress ever to be on film but her chemistry with Mel Gibson is undeniable and her on-screen presence is pretty amazing considering that she is a new entry to the character gallery.<br><br>The story of the film is the weakest out of all the series (yes even the fourth one) and sometimes it kinda drags. Mainly, however, the story is still highly entertaining and funny. The best element of the script is the fact that villain is an ex-cop this time around and that does that the heroes can hate the villain even more because he is, aside from being a mean bastard, a traitor, almost a symbol of the back-side of the medallion.<br><br>The action of the film is just like in the two previous movies absolutely brilliant. The action is highly entertaining and well made and Mel Gibson is excellent as an action star as well as many other things.<br><br>All in all a great entry to a great series. <br><br>7/10","user":"MinorityReporter","rank":[29,37]},{"title":"Third entry with the enjoyable couple battling a corrupt and killer ex-cop","rating":6,"date":"6 October 2008","review":"Our friends Los Angeles policemen Martin Riggs(Mel Gibson) and and his methodical pal Roger Murtaugh(Danny Glover now are patrolling through the streets after a botcher explosion caused into a building. Roger is about to retire when they encounter themselves into a dangerous case. A previous police named Leo(Stuart Wilson) turned into criminal kingpin and heinous weapons smuggling.

They go after and run afoul a nasty villain well played by Stuart Wilson, including to Joe Pesci as likable swindler. Furthermore appear as secondaries Mark Pellegrino, Nick Chunlund,Alan Scarfe and unbilled , the director's wife and also producer: Lauren Shuler Donner as a nurse and the director Stephen T. Kay as a filmmaker. Colorful cinematography by equally director Jan De Bont and atmospheric musical score by Michael Kamen , accompanied by catching song by Eric Clapton. Richard Donner directs with fair-play and the result is quite entertaining. Acceptable and passable movie for enthusiastic of the series won't be disappointed. It's followed by the last chapter 'Lethal weapon 4' with same players adding to Jet Li and Chris Rock.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[13,15]}]
