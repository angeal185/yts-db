Obviously a low-budget , amateur attempt at horror , 45 minutes in and there wasn't even 1 scare. There were scenes of drama in this movie that were well played, Aurora Perrineau is a very good actress and pretty, but what are scenes like this doing in a horror movie ? Did they start to make a melodrama and then change their minds ? I kept falling asleep, this is so unbearably slow and I just gave up wondering when it was going to become a horror film. Except for Aurora and the actor playing her boyfriend, who seem to be in an entirely different movie, the other actors are unconvincing and just plain bad. The 4 actors chosen to play the family come across as just that, actors, never once do you believe they are a family. At times I felt like I was watching an incredibly poor imitation of Halloween, if you removed all the elements of horror and suspense. A must to avoid unless you need a sedative.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[44,51]},{"title":"Good grief what a stinker...","rating":1,"date":"19 March 2019","review":"No one and I do mean no one can even act in this stupid excuse of a movie.The plot was garbage because there basically wasn't one.The script seems to be written in about an hour by someone who has never left their basement.It's just one steaming pile of crap that should have never made it past the cutting room floor.I just can't say enough bad about this \"movie.\" Save yourself the trouble of watching this garbage and just go to bed.","user":"ncminus","rank":[36,42]}]
