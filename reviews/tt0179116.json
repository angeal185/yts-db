[{"title":"NOT your usual angst-ridden coming out film...","rating":8,"date":"28 July 2000","review":"This is a completely different take on any 'coming out' movie I have ever seen - but with RuPaul as a former homosexual turned 'conversion therapist,' it would pretty much have to be!<br><br>Mink Stole is delightfully smarmy as Amanda's (Natasha Lyonne) mother who sends Amanda the cheerleader to `True Directions' a homosexual deprogramming camp - camp being the key word - mostly based on the fact that she doesn't like her quarterback boyfriend's extremely wet and sloppy kisses and (heaven forbid!) she has a poster of Melissa Etheridge in her bedroom.<br><br>The camp is a wonderful, non-stop visual joke.<br><br>The girl's bathroom has literally thousands of daisies attached to the walls. Their bedroom is a riot of pink satin, ribbons and lace worthy of Mae West.<br><br>The girls have to wear pink uniforms and do housework; the boys are in blue and have to learn to chop wood, work on cars and learn football. Watching RuPaul work on a car is worth the price of admission alone.<br><br>Each of the kids has a 'root,' - the reason they became gay: ranging from `a traumatic bris' to `my mother got married in pants.'<br><br>Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann, respectively) are priceless as two of the first clients of True Direction and are now self described ex-ex-gays. They rescue kids via the 'underground homo railroad' with the message `that no matter who you are, be yourself.'<br><br>They are an absolute delight.<br><br>The final 'graduation scene' which wraps up the film very nicely is a real gem - I didn't know they made lavender fatigues!<br><br>There were some real standout performances - Dante Basco as Dolph and Clea DuVall as Graham deserve special recognition.<br><br>Don't run out as soon as the credits start rolling: There is one last scene that seals this film with just the perfect touch.","user":"TuckMN","rank":[53,58]},{"title":"\"5,6,7,8, god is good, god is straight!\"","rating":20,"date":"20 December 2003","review":"SPOILER: This movie definitely doesn't have as much recognition as it deserves.<br><br>I absolutely love this movie.  I appreciate its comedy, and its love story, and the valuable lesson it tries to get across its audience: Just Be Yourself!<br><br>This movie is about a typical teenage girl named Megan Bloomfield living in a suburban neighborhood.  She's got is all, looks, popularity, the jock boyfriend, and also, she's head cheerleader!  But there is something odd about this girl that no one can put their finger on.  Why does she seem so disinterested in making out with her boyfriend?  Why does she have pictures of girls in her locker?  Why does she eat TOFU?  There must be only one answer:  She's totally, 100%...GAY!  It's the only reason for the way she's behaving, so off her parents force her to go, to a rehab camp called True Directions for Gay People.  Six weeks in this place and you come out straight as a pin, they claim.<br><br>Going in, Megan doesn't think she's gay, but it only takes her a few days to think otherwise.  Soon she is doing all the exercises to make herself normal again.<br><br>Then she meets bad girl lesbian Graham Eaton, a girl that shares a room with her.  Well at first, the two hate each other, but then soon afterwords, become friends.  Graham tells her that no one can change who you are, but Megan is determined to graduate.  Suddenly, the relationship between the two of them becomes more than friends, and Megan realizes she wants to be with Graham, and it doesn't matter what anyone else says, she will always be Megan, head cheerleader, and lesbian.","user":"ashisthegal","rank":[42,48]},{"title":"Campy on Purpose","rating":8,"date":"9 January 2005","review":"Incredible social commentary. Yes, It's a little campy, but it's all supposed to be that way. It's an amusing look at attempting to 'rehab\" homosexuals with therapy and \"finding their roots\". Great acting all around, excellent writing. <br><br>Personally, it was the subtle things that did it for me. Mary's son was funny, and the cut-outs (just pay attention to the boys' lessons) were Hilarious. I thought it was a great tongue-in-cheek way of saying \"okay, this is stupid, we need to let them be\" for the gay community.<br><br>If you're in the mood for a lot of laughing, and RuPaul out-of-drag to boot, rent this one.","user":"AyngelKaimus","rank":[55,65]}]
