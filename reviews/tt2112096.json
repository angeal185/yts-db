[{"title":"Disappointing; Only for die hard fans of the original series","rating":5,"date":"11 July 2016","review":"As a huge fan of Ab Fab I was looking forward to this a lot. What's more, I wasn't worried about the quality of the writing, as the special Olympic episodes merely a few years ago stood up to the original shows quality. I wouldn't say my expectations were particularly high nonetheless, I didn't expect anything groundbreaking, merely something in the range of The Last Stand or Gay. Alas, the film doesn't quite live up to any of that.<br><br>Overall, it ends up just being a homage to the original series. The majority of the screen time is stuffed with \"LOOK! CELEBRITY CAMEO! YEAH WE GOT THEM!\" or \"HEY REMEMBER THAT ONE JOKE FROM THAT ONE EPISODE? HERES A REFERENCE TO THAT!\" I came out of the theatre disappointed and just craving to go home and re-watch the original show.<br><br>Honestly, I think a huge part of it's weakness is it totally drops the strengths of the original series. Some of the original series funniest moments were it's overly dramatic monologues, laden with smart insults and often traded between Patsy/Saffy or Edina/Saffy. There isn't really any of that here.<br><br>If you are a huge fan like myself, I'd still recommend seeing it. I think, like me, you may end up disappointed, unless you are such a die hard fan you are blinded by the weaker writing quality, but it's still worth a watch to judge for yourself, and the film still has a couple moments worth seeing. It's not very long either, or at least doesn't feel too long, so at least you won't feel like you've wasted your time.<br><br>Either way, it's obvious this film is largely the result of a bet between Saunders and Dawn French. It lacks the soul of the original series, and while it isn't awful, it's just not good either.","user":"RubyMowzRulez","rank":[47,56]},{"title":"Bonkers, but great for fans of the TV show","rating":5,"date":"11 July 2016","review":"This film is lighthearted, funny and crazy from beginning to end. If you were a fan of the TV show, I think you're more likely to enjoy it because you would understand the silliness and not expect it to be amazing. This film shows the return of Patsy, Edina and Saffy, along with some new characters and many celebrity cameos. <br><br>One of the new characters we see in the film is Edina's granddaughter; Lola. Lola appears frequently throughout but fails to engage the audience. The character is weak and I think shouldn't appear as often as she does in the film. <br><br>From the very beginning of this film we notice there are many celebrity cameos in this film, 60 in total. Many of these celebrities only appear for a minute each, but some of them are not needed at all as they only say a word or two. Despite this, many of the other celebrity appearances are very amusing and bring a smile to our faces. For example, Rebel Wilson, Lulu etc.<br><br>Overall, this film is crazy, amusing and doesn't fail to make you smile. It is definitely aimed at people who were fans of the TV show, as it brings a sense of nostalgia and reuses some of the classic jokes used in the show. The story line is bonkers, but that's what we expect from Patsy and Edina. Some characters definitely shouldn't have been included as they don't add anything to the film and appear to be used to fill time. If you weren't a fan of the show, I'd give this one a miss.","user":"laurenb-03294","rank":[19,23]},{"title":"What happened?","rating":5,"date":"28 November 2016","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this after watching the brilliant TV series years ago. I thought it would be a golden opportunity to being the characters up to date and make something really special.<br><br>However, I spent the entirety of the film waiting for it to pick up and gain the pace we are used to which made the TV series so brilliant. It felt as though the script had been stretched out to fill the allocated time.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with the acting, and all the favourite characters are in the film - but also (and probably to the film's detriment) are hoards of minor celebrities and wannabes who serve little function in the story. It seemed as though anyone who was remotely connected to the clique of luvvy land was included for no reason at all.<br><br>Another thing which I think played a role in the lack lustre end product was that Jennifer Saunder's played down Edina's character - which lacked the punch and sparkle of her original portrayal.<br><br>Overall it was an OK kind of film, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again. You would be better off and get more entertainment value from watching replays of the original series.","user":"mjsreg","rank":[10,11]}]
