[{"title":"A nice surprise","rating":8,"date":"16 July 2004","review":"After reading different comments about this movie, I've decided to see it, and I'm really surprised because what I have found has little to do with what I thought it was. <br><br>Naqoyqatsi is about the loss of our natural perception of reality and its substitute: the image itself as a product of technology, the image as a weapon in a globalized war. And here comes the apparent incoherence, because the film is a parade of these images, a product of the same technological violence it is reflecting and criticizing. That's not hypocrisy; the contradiction is part of the film itself.<br><br>Although I do not completely support Reggio's point of view, I admire the way he expresses it through his films without impositions of any kind, so that the viewer can find his own perspective. While watching Naqoyqatsi, I was asking for the \"original\" pictures that were below those distortions and filters, but soon I realized the real world wasn't there. It was like \"OK, so that's all... Well, let's see it\".<br><br>A few words about the inevitable comparison with it's predecessors: if you are looking for something like Koyaanisqatsi, go see Koyaanisqatsi again. Naqoyqatsi is a different film. It does well as the third part of the Qatsi Trilogy, but like the other two, has its own \"personality\". And I think it's a great film. Maybe not a masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi, but a great film.","user":"sdbloom","rank":[22,27]},{"title":"Inferior rehash","rating":7,"date":"3 April 2005","review":"What a let down. Koyaanisqatsi was brilliant, Powaqatsi was quite good, Naqoyqatsi is the same thing all over again, without the beauty and profundity.<br><br>It's not that I don't sympathise with the meaning behind the film, but bombarding me with images of dollar signs and corporate logos is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The majority of those who view this movie do not need to be chaperoned around these issues.<br><br>The film feels structureless and jumps back and forth from one point to the next and then back again. I suppose you could argue that this reflects the chaotic nature of the films subject matter, but to me, that's just making excuses for a poorly conceived narrative.<br><br>The computer graphics don't work well at all. They often feel like an excuse to show of a few fancy special effects and already look dated (Max Headroom came to mind on several oc...oc...oc...occasions.). They just don't have the beauty of a 'real' image.<br><br>To add insult to injury, the film has been stretched out from a 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 so all of the people appear distorted. This is because the stock footage used was 4:3 and they couldn't be bothered editing it to fit into a widescreen presentation. They just stretched the lot, and when you watch the DVD it is very noticeable. It's claimed that this was a deliberate move and not a decision based on technical difficulties, but I'm not sure.<br><br>Overall - I'd say watch koyaanisqatsi again - it's the only film out of the three worth repeated viewings.","user":"epsilon3","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"a cinematic tone poem","rating":15,"date":"15 November 2003","review":"In the hustle and bustle of a chaotic world, we often don't take the time to stop and really look at all the beautiful things that tend to pass us by unnoticed.  It is Godfrey Reggio's aim in `Naqoyqatsi'  as it was in his previous `Koyaanisqatsi' and `Powaqqatsi' - to focus our attention on all the artistry inherent in the shapes, forms and patterns that make up our universe.  His film is a succession of images, some of them derived from nature (clouds, ocean waves), others from Man (buildings and bridges), and others from computer-generated fantasy.  These he filters through his observant camera eye, state-of-the-art processing and ingenious editing to create a cinematic tone poem.  The element that most separates `Naqoyqatsi' from Reggio's earlier works is the much heavier reliance on camera trickery and CGI effects here.  For the most part, Reggio has moved away from nature as his subject and towards the cyber realities of the current age.  Thus, the altered emphasis in form seems not merely appropriate but thematically valid as well, as Reggio examines a world in which nature has been largely eclipsed by computer technology.<br><br>At the end of the film we are told that `Naqoyqatsi' is a Hopi word meaning, essentially, `war' and `violence.'  I'm not sure, though, that Reggio has really earned that title with his film.  True, he does include a few shots of mushroom clouds, of street riots, of violent video games, but they hardly account for the majority of the images we see.   Perhaps it is the clash between nature and technology that he is referring to here, but the title  at least as defined at the end - still seems to fall a bit short of the mark.<br><br>Still, Reggio is often able to find poetry in even the most disturbing of images.  For instance, there's an amazing shot of a trio of crash test dummies performing a macabre, yet strangely beautiful slow motion `dance' in a simulated airplane crash.  It is but one of the many unforgettable images in the film.<br><br>Enhanced by the haunting music of Philip Glass, `Naqoyqatsi' offers a dazzling kaleidoscopic view of the world, a visual tour de force for the aesthetically inclined.","user":"Buddy-51","rank":[23,31]}]
