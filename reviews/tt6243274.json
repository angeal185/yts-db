[{"title":"Decent","rating":9,"date":"3 May 2018","review":"Don't know if I would call this a b or c movie - however for what it is, it's very nice.\n I really enjoyed this movie. \n It is probably safe for the whole family- it's a feel-gooder with some cool quotes and badass good guys/girls. \nIf the cable and Wi-Fi were out I wouldn't mind having this on DVD.\n I could watch it over and over.","user":"fountainkitty","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"A rarely good and hard to find good Southern charm","rating":7,"date":"7 May 2018","review":"This film is very good, actually everything with the Georgia State background story will be just fine. All the main characters in this film were well cast, male and female, old or young, performed so well and very likable. The screenplay is good, interesting dialog, good sound track. The possible heart attack anytime to the voted out sheriff, forced into retirement, then turned half-hearted pig farmer with only three pigs and three chickens, well, was such a wonderful created character, but also hanging up there over my head during the viewing, a hidden tension to keep the good movie going in the right direction. <br><br>Not easy to find good film under the weather of too much and too many Marvel's comic super heroes crappy, cliched schlock.","user":"LogicIsEverything","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"A Surprise","rating":8,"date":"12 May 2018","review":"I stumbled across this movie.
