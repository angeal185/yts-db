[{"title":"Despite a charming cast, the film suffers from a host of unlikable characters and a silly storyline","rating":5,"date":"23 June 2008","review":"Julia Roberts seems to be one of the most hated celebrities on this website. I can't really understand why. I find her to be talented and charming as well as engaging and usually likable, until I saw Runaway Bride. I thought I was going to like this one but it offered some of the most unlikable characters I have ever seen in a romantic comedy. Generally, the audience should want to cheer for the two people to get together but I couldn't care less. I don't think Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) actually deserved to be in a marriage because she was selfish, immature and seemed incapable of love. I just couldn't fathom why anyone would actually be attracted to her. She has weddings like there no big deal and she probably wasted a lot of money between the four failed ones she had. She has her fianc√© invest all of his time into the relationship, trying to show her that he does indeed love her only to be left at the altar. I guess the situation was supposed to be humorous and I shouldn't have taken it so seriously but it was tough to overlook all of the garbage the film was trying sell to me.<br><br>Acting wise the film was decent, which did save it a little. Julia Roberts gives an okay performance, although it's one of her worst. However, she is working with rather weak material and she's portraying a woman that is just so hard to like. Richard Gere was also decent although nothing special. The chemistry between these two was basically non-existent which made their relationship seem completely fake and unrealistic. It was hard to buy that a cynical man would fall for a woman that has no problem trampling all over a man's heart. They did have a few funny scenes together though which made the film more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the film runs for an inexplicable 116 minutes so there are a lot of dead spots.<br><br>Romantic comedies shouldn't really be loathsome movies. The characters should be likable and engaging so it's easy to get behind them and the story shouldn't be too far-fetched. Unfortunately, Runaway Bride commits the worst sin for a romantic comedy by offering unlikable characters, making it basically impossible to really get into the movie despite how talented the cast may be.","user":"christian123","rank":[25,29]},{"title":"You know what? Don't tell me anything about Pretty Woman, because I don't even want to hear it.","rating":8,"date":"28 August 2000","review":"Runaway Bride is just a good romantic comedy. Yes, the director and the two big name stars are the same as the film's 1990 counterpart, but even though the two films have striking and almost offensive similarities, Runaway Bride has a good enough story that I refuse to believe that it relied on the success of its predecessor. <br><br>Julia Roberts is Maggie Carpenter, a hardware store owner (a laughable profession surpassed only by Denise Richards as a nuclear weapons specialist in The World Is Not Enough. Yeah RIGHT!), and Richard Gere is a newspaper columnist (Ike Graham) who has been fired for printing a supposedly false column about a woman who consistently runs out on her marriages. When he travels to the tiny town where she lives to learn more about her life and possibly get his job back, he finds that there is more to her than just a newspaper column. <br><br>By the end of the film, there is such a huge media hype about Maggie's wedding that it's a wonder that Ike wasn't honored for his 'false' column about her. Joan Cusack has never looked and acted better than she did in this movie, delivering a wonderful nasally performance that was strangely heartwarming. <br><br>Runaway Bride had all kinds of wonderful scenes. I particularly liked the wedding rehearsal scene. The look on Christopher Meloni's face was priceless! There were so many good things about this film that I am able to overlook the superficial look of unoriginality. If you just look past the director and the two big names, the story itself is not at all like any other film. There will, of course, be the inevitable cynical comparisons to Pretty Woman, and these complaints are understandable, but people who condemn Runaway Bride as a rip-off of Pretty Woman or some sort of re-make are simply not looking at the film, but only at the names on the bill. This is a very good romantic comedy, and it should not be missed simply because of a superficial comparison to Pretty Woman.","user":"Anonymous_Maxine","rank":[46,61]},{"title":"Like fine wine, time is of the essence","rating":28,"date":"28 August 2004","review":"Until Runaway Bride came on the scene, I didn't realize how dated Pretty Woman had become!  Fans of Pretty Woman will delight in the thinly veiled references and homages that Runaway Bride serves up.  This is a fun film, very tongue in cheek in it's delivery.  The first viewing of the film may seem a little flat, but after watching it subsequent times, you get a definite feel for the dance that is perfected here.  That is what I look for in a movie; can I watch it over and over and still delight in it? <br><br>\nI took absolute delight in the setting of this film more so than anything. The movie refers to the town as Hale, Maryland.  The actual town is Berlin, Maryland, absolutely gorgeous and located more to the Northeastern part of the state.  Setting is everything here because you focus more on the characters and the small town atmosphere than the glitz and glitter of a major city.  The character Maggie Carpenter is not unlike women of her generation--perhaps we tend to marry later in life now more than ever because we don't want to make that mistake that ends in divorce.  Maggie doesn't know what she wants out of life, but she has enough sense to get down to the minute and realize a mistake.  Her timing is rough, but it manages to avoid divorce lawyer, right?<br><br>Drink in the backdrop of the movie, and enjoy the main characters and the strong ensemble cast in this enticingly amusing tale of love and romance redefined.","user":"Misspoe93","rank":[43,61]}]
