As in the thought of making a mixture of horror with comedy and then ending with a beautiful message which is actually the wow factor of the movie deserves an applause.Great work Team STREE.","user":"nikhilsharma-05528","rank":[28,34]},{"title":"Must watch","rating":9,"date":"31 August 2018","review":"A very well mixture of comedy and horror.
