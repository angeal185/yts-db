[{"title":"Very good! Christian haters won't like it.","rating":10,"date":"3 January 2019","review":"There's really not much about God in the movie but still, some people can't even stand the mentioning of God. It's probably more like a 7 but I hate when people do this. It's a great feel-good movie. I like my horror movies too but it's nice to watch something like this sometimes. I promise you won't be disappointed if you watch. It's basically a crime-suspense movie with a happy ending. I'm not a big Christian, but I don't hate people of any religion. I don't think you willl think they are trying to push God down your throat, I didn't.","user":"Dave_douell","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"The theme of the movie was emptiness.","rating":3,"date":"3 January 2019","review":"As I began watching this movie I didn't have any expectations whatsoever. I knew that it was a Christian movie (although it really wasn't to be honest) and that it was a low budget. In other words: I would have to have some forbearance.<br><br>Now, I genuinely tried to give this movie a chance, but it didn't play many minutes before I realized it would be a tough one to sit throug. It all just felt so empty. The conversation was dull and the acting was what you would expect in the likes of \"worst movie\" and \"epic movie\" etc. There were a few scenes that managed to generate some sort of feeling, but other than that; empty and depressing is how I would describe the experience I had watching this film.","user":"gabriellarsson","rank":[3,7]}]
