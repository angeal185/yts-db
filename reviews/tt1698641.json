[{"title":"Normal movie","rating":7,"date":"15 December 2018","review":"Good movie. The reason I'd give this a 7 out of ten is because at the beginning it was ok nothing happening that much much but in the end all the drama came into it. There's a valuable lesson in this about that bad days can turn into good days","user":"dylanrichman","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Good, clean family fun.","rating":8,"date":"15 July 2019","review":"There's not really a lot that needs to be said about this movie. It is just a lot of fun and both kids and adults will find plenty to make them chuckle. There's plenty of 'slapstick' humor for the kids but it's all done so cleverly that adults will enjoy this movie just as much. An excellent cast of savvy adults and precocious kids work well together to portray a family that anyone would love to be a part of. The things that happen to them to make this, at first glance, one of the worst days ever will bring a smile to your face. It only goes for 81 minutes too, so littlies won't get bored and it doesn't overstay its welcome. See it.","user":"CabbageCustard","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Simple movie for the family on a Sunday!","rating":5,"date":"26 January 2015","review":"The reason I give this a 5 out of 10 is that this movie is a good one for the kids. A movie with a simple lesson to accept the bad days and enjoy every good one. To be more positive. <br><br>About the movie out of my point of view? Well, not that awesome, but you can't expect a lot of this kind of movies. Steve Carell didn't perform at his best, that is obvious, but that wasn't even necessary. <br><br>After all, this whole movie was from the point of view of Alexander. Of course they did choose to make it a little childish. I believe the acting was also based on the viewer to be around 5 - 10 years old. Some simple jokes, not a lot of jokes where to use the brain, but more of the eyes.","user":"miguelcorreia93","rank":[23,32]}]
