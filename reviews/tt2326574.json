[{"title":"Just see it","rating":8,"date":"1 January 2015","review":"Sometimes it's refreshing to see a sweet movie that has some nice cinematography, good actors and no violence, for a change. Doesn't matter if it's faith based or not; it's relaxing and rewarding. We just have to lay our usual critical sense aside and enjoy the ride. This movie have not wasted money on excesses, it's all there on the screen, and for the budget it's really managed to capture the times nicely. This movie has a little bit of Elvis, the 50s, Jerry Lee Lewis, a bit of faith, nice cars, clothes and manners from times gone by. And, why not? It feels fun to see something that are sweet and in a way a little silly sometimes. That doesn't mean that it don't have real feelings and emotions, just that it's not pretending to be something it ain't. I saw this movie with an open mind, and I found the ride to be quite good.","user":"peter-carlsson-976-779113","rank":[22,26]},{"title":"A definite must see!","rating":9,"date":"1 January 2015","review":"Both my wife and I were amazed at the depth of the acting ability of Ray Liotta and Ashley Judd. This movie had both of us fully engaged from start to finish. As other reviewers have stated ignore the negative feedback as this movie delivered well beyond anything we anticipated. For those ladies out there keep some Kleenex close by as there are several scenes that will deliver some strong heart tugs. Guys watch and listen closely as history is told and even I was impressed with the directors delivery of years gone by.<br><br>This is a rock n roll history and life of a specific individual. It will reference another artist so sit back and enjoy the ride. This is one movie we will keep and share with our family. Kudos to the director and many actors who delivered a movie that fully engaged its audience. This is one of the few that delivers!","user":"don-bayerle","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"A Refreshing Change","rating":10,"date":"8 September 2014","review":"Loved it! A must see. I've seen this movie twice already and will probably see it again and again. It was so nice to go to the movies and be able to take my 7 year old daughter and not have to watch a cartoon or animated movie and not have to worry about sex, violence and language. The story was great. The actors were great. Even Blake Rayne did a fabulous job with his acting debut. The music was toe tapping and I will definitely look for the sound track. Who hires these so called 'critics' anyway? What movie were they watching? Why does their opinion hold so much value? Everyone that I know that has seen it has had nothing but great things to say about the movie. They all recommend the movie and would see it again. We need to put these critics in there place and show that they don't know what they are talking about. We want to see more movies like this!!!! Move family-friendly movies! Go see the movie and decide for yourself. DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!!!!!","user":"hilllw","rank":[45,66]}]
