[{"title":"More Teenage Angst","rating":7,"date":"16 March 2019","review":"If you're not a fan of Larry Clark's work, please move along as this film with probably upset you or you'll just plain hate it.<br><br>Me, I've loved Larry Clark since I saw Bully and Wassup Rockets. Now honestly, the first Maria Girl was a bit disappointing. A very vague storyline without any interesting narrative. It was essentially just a film of sex and violence with horrendous acting by some (as ususal) unknown actors.<br><br>So jumping into #2 I was intrigued by the fact that Jonathon from Wassup Rockers would also be appearing. Now, if you liked the fact that the first film was filled with sex, you'll be happy to know there is more sex and nudity in this film. The storyline follows a more stable pattern, the acting is much better and the ending brings quite an interesting climax when Marfa Girl kills the child of her rapist, Tony, which occurred in the first film.<br><br>Overall, this film follows a better storyline, better conversations and an overall more interesting plot line. Again, if you're a fan of Larry Clark, you won't hate this film, but don't be expecting another Kids or Wassup Rockers, because it's not.","user":"standunderintenseteasing","rank":[0,0]}]
