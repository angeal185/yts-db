[{"title":"Thoroughly enjoyable great family adventure film - outdoor adventure beckons","rating":10,"date":"21 July 2019","review":"At a time where phones, tablets, Xbox and social media are the first port of call for most children, this film harks back to the days of kids playing in the summer holidays, running around outside with the freedom to explorer and discover with friends.<br><br>Like The Goonies, or the Famous Five books, with an element of Home Alone thrown in, it is an old school adventure film about two young boys and their speedway racing father, and comes complete with an evil crime boss, a two incompetent henchmen and a tale of lost treasure to discover.\nThere is plenty of action with chases and speedway racing, and comedy with slapstick moments that will make you wince and laugh.<br><br>Beautifully shot in the countryside of South East England near the directors own home, this is a thoroughly enjoyable family film with an underlying message to the current generation to get outside and have some fun and adventure.<br><br>I watched this with my two boys at the weekend who loved every minute of it and and the next day I found myself being dragged out to the park with them on our bikes.<br><br>Thoroughly recommend you go and see this as soon as you can, and inspire another generation.","user":"simonc58472","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Great family film","rating":10,"date":"21 July 2019","review":"Loved watching this film, it made me smile, laugh out loud and not once did I get bored.
