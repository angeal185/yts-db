I feel that it's really struggling to find a genre, so it's harsh to compare it to the Exorcist as many have.  This is a film based somewhat on truth, and somewhat on legend with a little Hollywood finesse to bring it all together.  It doesn't stay completely true to either a Christian audience or to mainstream Hollywood, but I think that's to it's credit.  I don't know many people who knowingly make this kind of cross-over in their normal rental choices, so in that way, it helps to reach the largest possible audience.  The way that the film afflicts it's heroine with the stigmata through the rosary is just typical screenwriting, and the romance aspects are predictable.  The film, based upon the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, assumes that the discovery of that scroll had never been know to the public, and that personal vendettas within the Vatican had helped to suppress it.  In reality however, there have been numerous translations of that Gospel, although I rather doubt that the modern bible will be amended. (Due to it's debated authenticity.)  In short, the film is thought-provoking, yet not heavy-handed in it's message. It leaves you asking questions as to your own faith, and to the nature of the established \"church\" far after you've reached the final credits.  As an action-suspense-thriller I'd rank it about a 7 out of 10, but in terms of it's religious nature it succeeds greatly in the find-the-truth-for-yourself message that it conveys.","user":"cynic701","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"Better than you might think","rating":26,"date":"26 January 2003","review":"The \"stigmata\" is a Christian religious term that refers to the spontaneous appearance of wounds corresponding to the wounds on the Christ's body when he was crucified.  This religious experience is most typically associated with deeply religious people and, I believe, is not one that is widely taken seriously.  What makes this movie interesting is that it portrays the appearance of these wounds as a terrifying, extremely painful and ultimately humiliating experience.  There's nothing conventionally religious in the experience portrayed here -- in fact, the victim is an athiest.<br><br>But, having bypassed the conventional, the movie is only partially successful in bringing the experience of the stigmata to the screen.  The movie is a victim itself of a conventional portrayal of the evil bureaucratic Vatican desk jockeys suppressing \"true\" religion.  And I have to admit that, as I was watching it, I found myself thinking, \"Hmm, that sounds like the Gospel of Thomas,\" -- a famous Gnostic Gospel.  Surprise.<br><br>But, overall, I'd recommend it as a decent movie and a departure from the generic, bland portrayal of Christian religious experience a la the Hallmark channel or \"Touched by an Angel.\"  It is a movie that can make you think about the nature of religious experience and its impact on an ordinary life.","user":"looie","rank":[62,75]}]
