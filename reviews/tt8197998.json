[{"title":"Disappointing compared to series","rating":5,"date":"31 December 2018","review":"The TV series was phenomenal compared to movie. Unfortunately our expectation could not be met. We were expecting much more quality for the special effects, better dialogues, storyline.<br><br>Alper Caglar is one of the talented and great guy in the Turkish cinema but i believe he took the audience for granted, simply play fast and loose with it.<br><br>Note: The scene of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk \"The greatest leader and the founder of Republic Turkey\" was amazing, moved to tears.<br><br>Also thank you for the Kemalist Turkish Army Force and Turkish Polis Force personnel for their sacrifice to stop the terrorist movement called \"FETÃ–\". You will be remembered.<br><br>God bless their soul whose martyrize.","user":"raja-bell","rank":[21,32]},{"title":"A heart pounding action film based on true events","rating":9,"date":"4 January 2019","review":"I am an english teacher at a private school in Istanbul. You can say I'm a long term tourist in a beautiful country. I lived through the events of July 15th 2016. It was an extremely dangerous and polarizing night when against all odds the democratically elected government and the brave security forces won against the shadowy conspiracy of an Khomeini-like cleric and their faction within the military and the police.<br><br>This film is about that second group of people. It is a peek into that night when patriotic police and soldiers went through great ordeals to protect against a modern putsch that Turkey might not have survived at all.<br><br>The film itself is well acted, action packed and full of triple-A visuals which are an absolute delight considering cinema in Turkey is in its infancy when it comes to action. It is miles better than any in-house production Netflix ever came up with, while clearly being a fraction of the budget.<br><br>Even though almost everyone is familiar with the maverick Mr. Caglar who produced the film (I should know all my 12th grade English literature students are fanatics of his style), the two talented directors Emre and Ozduru who weave heart-pounding action and grim drama deserve props. The sublime musical composer Lincoln Jaeger is also world class here, as well as the cinematographer who lights a dark and foreboding urban Ankara where only the brave roam the streets of the putsch. Turks often have trouble relating their point of view to the western world. They have a tempestous love and hate relationship with the democracies of the Atlantic. But this film does and will appeal to the discerning international viewer who wants to enjoy a thrilling slice of the distressing night that Ataturk's republic almost fell.","user":"GuiltyJames","rank":[18,35]},{"title":"Once again a great movie due to Alper Caglar","rating":10,"date":"29 December 2018","review":"I won't write much about it, because it may spoil your the movie. Fact is, that Alper Caglar as Turkish director and producer is unique. He knows, what the modern viewers want to see and he just implements it in his movies. The special effects, acting, camera movement, dialogues and the implementation of the latest coup attempt in Turkey is just terrific. Here I want to add that my thoughts and prayers are with the martyrs of that coup attempt and their families. Over 250 people gave their lives to stop terrorist Gulenists from taking over Turkey completely.","user":"agirmete","rank":[21,42]}]
