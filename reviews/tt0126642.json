[{"title":"Intriguing Van Bebber Short Film","rating":8,"date":"8 May 2006","review":"Jim Van Bebber must be the unluckiest filmmaker on earth. The original video distributor of \"Deadbeat At Dawn\" ripped him off, \"The Manson Family\" was in movie limbo for a decade and this short was made with the intention of attracting investors for a full length feature film. In true Van Bebber style, no cash was forthcoming.<br><br>It is incomprehensible to me that a visionary like Jim Van Bebber has to beg, borrow and steal to make a film, while every second loser in Hollywood gets a $30 million budget thrown at them to rape a 1970s horror classic, \"re-making\" it into a steaming pile of commercial crap. Unfortunately, the joke is on us. Horror fans have missed out on what had the potential to be a phenomenal film.<br><br>Roadkill focuses on serial killing cannibal called John Martin, who picks up stranded motorists on a deserted highway and then takes them home to be butchered. The result lies somewhere between \"Wolf Creek\", \"Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer\" and \"Schramm\". In other words, it is awesome. As with all of Van Bebber's work, the violence is gritty and realistic. The butchering of John's male victim is intense and his female victim's cries for mercy and ultimate fate are utterly grim. The film's only real weakness is Mark Gillespie's performance as John, which lacks restraint and initially comes across as unintentionally funny. I'm also not sure why John spent so much time screaming at his television set. However, these faults do little to detract from the intensity and brutality of Van Bebber's short film.<br><br>Roadkill is another example of Jim Van Bebber's unique style and considered approach to on-screen violence. What a shame that we only have 15 paltry minutes to savour.","user":"Crap_Connoisseur","rank":[11,11]},{"title":"Not VanBebbers best","rating":5,"date":"26 November 1999","review":"As a fan of Jim Van Bebber I was surprised to see this movie in the UK Uncut after the BBFC rumpus over Deadbeat at Dawn.The short(about 15 mins im not sure) details the activities of a maniac called John Martin who lives in a Filthy home and eats roadkill,yelling at the TV,and eventually going out to capture some hitchikers.Its fairly grim viewing,but the acting is poor,and the attempt to capture a Texas Chainsaw atmosphere doesnt work.Made to finance a feature film.Its on video in the UK with the great My Sweet Satan,a much better film by Van Bebber.","user":"Zombie79","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Greatest horror short film ever made about a serial killer.","rating":10,"date":"24 June 2005","review":"Seriously - as a fellow filmmaker, horror fan who has seen it all - Jim has made the most incredibly gory, raw, repulsive short movie in the history of cinema. This is an uncompromising glance into the world of your next door neighbor: a serial killer/psychotic loner who lives in a infested house of filth, torture and human remains... who seems to be hanging off the razor's edge of complete madness - even his television, which appears to be his last link to the real world, appears to be decaying as it can no longer play \"babysitter\" to his deteriorating insanity. This is a MUST-SEE film (I was lucky enough to get an autographed copy on VHS years ago) available with Jim's incredibly disturbing and horrifying true crime short, My Sweet Satan. Jim VanBebber ranks among the very elite independent filmmakers of ALL time - not just in Dayton (where Guided by Voices - one of the greatest indie bands of all time hails from) or America, but world wide. Tonight, after waiting over 15 years for The Manson Family, I'm finally going to get to see it - thanks for your tenacity, Jim! God bless! - Glen Grefe (Director of Nutcracker: An American Nightmare)","user":"glengrefe","rank":[5,7]}]
