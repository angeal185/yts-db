[{"title":"Brutal and Brilliant","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2014","review":"For a film that seemed to come out of nowhere, with a limited advertisement campaign and small budget, Starred Up has proved to be one of the more ballsy pictures released in some time - and with a UK release date sandwiched between two major blockbuster sequels, it had to do something to stand out from the crowd.<br><br>The main attribute of the film is its acting, most notably central character Jack O'Connell; a career-best performance from our lead protagonist serves as the driving force of the film, immersing the audience so much in the drama of it all that we can't believe we're feeling sorry for the prick we thought we knew in the opening stages.<br><br>However we all know that good acting doesn't necessarily constitute a good film; but placing such talent in the hands of David Mackenzie and providing a gripping (albeit unoriginal) story line is a damn good combination.<br><br>Despite the many positives, where this film fails is in the variety of on-screen shenanigans. Although it does slowly progress, the day-to-day life on the inside seems repetitive and predictable, particularly when the overall message is all too familiar and practically clichéd. <br><br>All in all however, Starred Up is one of the best prison dramas in a long time, and probably the best British film this year. Not for the faint-hearted, this superbly acted drama will scare you into following the law to the strictest command.","user":"tyse1","rank":[64,78]},{"title":"Hard-hitting...and then some!","rating":8,"date":"23 April 2016","review":"STARRED UP is another modern-day prison flick, this time a British one. Before everybody starts groaning and thinking \"what, again?!\", let me reassure you that this one's not sugar-coated at all. There's no sentiment here, just brutality throughout, and yet it becomes an immersive and thought-provoking experience. Even with all the violence and bad language and animalistic behaviour, there is still light at the end of the tunnel.<br><br>The film features Jack O'Connell ('71) in a star-making performance as a disturbed young man who has just been transferred (aka starred up) to men's prison from juvenile. To complicate things further, his own father is an inmate, and the two have a volatile relationship. I've seen the Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn before in a few Hollywood flicks and didn't think much of him, but he's a perfect fit for the part here.<br><br>A lot of the usual prison clichés are played out here, but they happen in a matter-of-fact and dare I say it grimly realistic way. The violence is brutal but not overdone, and it does serve a purpose rather than being gratuitous. And the realism is top-notch, reminding me of the BRONSON film at times. Despite all this writer Jonathan Asser manages to tell a believable storyline with an identifiable beginning, middle, and end. It's a good little film, although not for all tastes given the subject matter.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"A Raw, Evocative & Hard-Hitting British Prison Drama!","rating":6,"date":"6 September 2015","review":"Brutal, unflinching &amp; downright intense, Starred Up tells the story of a young convict who's transferred to adult prison due to his extremely violent behaviour where he meets his father after a long time. The plot follows the harshness of imprisoned life and covers his journey as his father attempts to get him to settle down so that he can go through therapy.<br><br>Directed by David Mackenzie, Starred Up takes a no-holds-barred approach to brings its violent tale to life and retains its viciousness throughout its runtime. The script keeps the focus on its lead character who is unable to keep his rage in control and through him, the plot captures not only the menacing life behind bars but the devastating effects of violent upbringing as well.<br><br>Production design team manages to recreate the grim atmosphere of prison, Camera-work is carried out in a controlled manner although it misses out on encapsulating the picture with a claustrophobic ambiance, Editing is brilliant for it never cuts up too quick and effectively sustains the build-up tension, Music is virtually absent, yet the strongest aspect of Starred Up is its performances.<br><br>The cast comprises of Jack O'Connell, Ben Mendelsohn &amp; Rupert Friend, with all of them chipping in with strong work. O'Connell is an absolute revelation for the way he expresses his stuffed-up emotions &amp; sudden burst of anger is utterly convincing, Plus, he effortlessly makes us believe that his character is be a byproduct of a childhood filled with trauma &amp; abuse, and that he's not a bad person per se.<br><br>On an overall scale, Starred Up is a highly engaging, relentlessly aggressive &amp; unforgiving British prison drama that benefits from Mackenzie's terrific direction &amp; O'Connell's winning performance, offers an interesting take on father-son dynamics set in a brutal environment, and has much to say about people guarding the prison as it ends up saying about the prisoners behind bars. A raw, evocative &amp; hard-hitting flick, Starred Up comes thoroughly recommended.","user":"CinemaClown","rank":[7,7]}]
