[{"title":"I know this story/family, but from a different perspective.","rating":8,"date":"24 October 2016","review":"An American film about an Austrian family, which was based on a German book by Agathe von Trapp. This is a true story that takes place years before when Hitler's Nazi army marched towards the Vienna. So it is a pre world war two drama, and with its influence that focused more on the family to tell the story. This is one of the recent unexpected films, I also surprised to see how averagely it was received by the people. You don't have to accept it as the best film of the year, but it was rich in performances and screenplay with a good pace, particularly cinematography that makes it one of the best of its kind.<br><br>A young girl Agathe, who is anger over her father for not keeping his promise, decides not to sing in her life ever. But this von Trapp family is gifted with the good singing voices. In her late teenage, her father remarries and that's not accepted well by the family, but they did not show it outside. The story is not between a step-mother and her stepchildren. Its about Agathe's, her struggle after her mother's death who took all the responsibility until a new woman who entered her family as a new member. It also reveals her childhood crush, but she was never sure and how it ends was quite emotional.<br><br>How the political scenario changes in the nation affect this family takes the prime focus of the later half of the film. From lives threats to the financial struggle, how they manage to keep the family members in order was given preference. Towards the end, in the last half an hour, the film plot becomes tighter because of the new development. Though it did not turn as tense as I anticipated in those parts, and then it went back to the original timeline to bring a conclusion.<br><br>This is not a very popular film, not everybody knows its existence. For me, the trailer impressed, particularly the locations. You know I love the Alps and its lash green grass turfs. The film did not disappoint me on that, besides, the colourful costumes were another highlight. These two were the reason I loved it. I would definitely give an award for the costume designer. But once the story reached its mid part, I started to feel, deja vu. Because I did know what this film is about like was it a real or fictional. And then very soon found its clone, I mean it was another version of 'The Sound of Music'. The perspective of the storytelling was different in here.<br><br>\"The one thing we have in common is that we both love the old fool.\"<br><br>It was told from the eldest daughter of the Von Trapp family. I don't know how much true to the book this film is, but surely this is very close to the real events than the other title I mentioned above. So, according to the main character, I mean Agathe von Trapp, the Maria who is her family's new governess was portrayed completely in a different shade than what we had impression. That's really shocking, because it proves the people's opinion differs from place to person. But the entire story was pretty much the same, except what Agathe saw with her own eyes had the main preference.<br><br>The Agathe character was played by three different people. As a young child, which is a very short span, but I liked that foundation to film to achieve its success. However the film opened around present time with the aged Agathe narrating her tale to inspire her young niece who decided to run away from home on the Christmas eve. Then the Middle aged Agathe, I mean the very younger one like in her pre 20s, which was played beautifully by a British actress that covers the majority of the film.<br><br>The rest of the cast was not bad either, but none of them was dragged into the screen like Agathe was. On the other hand, it was not a music genre as it was stated, just a drama, a good drama. But there was very little music in few occasions and all are German verse. That's the very original of this tale, while the rest of the film was translated in the English language.<br><br>Apart from this and the 1965 film, there are other versions too, but I haven't seen them. This is the most recent version and I liked it. So I think comparing between these two are useless, but I always like normal drama than the music or musical. Still, I liked both the films and if you are interested in the facts, then you should watch this, but the other one was a great entertainer. Overall, as I mentioned earlier, the perspective of the tale differs. The original source title says: Memories before and after the sound of music. That means it's definitely worth a watch even you have seen the 1965 film and/or a big fan of it. So recommended.<br><br>8/10","user":"Reno-Rangan","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Where's the rest of the story?","rating":8,"date":"29 January 2018","review":"Disappointing only because it covers the basic story from Austria to the family's escape. Appears to be mostly true, but I question some of the events which may have been enhanced for dramatic effect. Also a bit preachy at times as it tries to explain the political divide between the Nazis and the \"Democratic Party\" as it is called. The horrible British accents and slang that \"creeps into\" the dialog. \"On the Dole\" is a very British phrase and I would not expect an Austrian to use it. The typical British \"Drawl\" invades the actor's performances, although many players appear to be Austrian (or German). I find it very hard-to-believe that the Nazis broke into the mansion at exactly the same moment that the Von Trapp Family fled. It is somewhat known that in reality the family left the country by train and did not really \"hike over the Alps\". I was also disappointed that very little is mentioned about their music career after leaving home. Their \"summer camps\" and touring in America and eventually settling in Vermont, and opening up a concert center and ski lodge there. I have read the other book \"My Story\" by Maria, and it covers all of this and more. Still an enjoyable biography with excellent sets and very authentic-looking locations. However, where is the American Ski Lodge shown in the film? Certainly not in Montana, as noted in the credits. More realistic to-be-sure than the \"sugar-coated fairy tale\" known as the Sound of Music. Worth at least a one-time view, but maybe not a \"keeper\"?","user":"mike48128","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Found it enlightening","rating":8,"date":"28 April 2018","review":"I know it is not 100% accurate or the best in some eyes. but I have watched it numerous times...good back story, It also lets you feel how they might have felt.
