[{"title":"Recommended - moving and technically brilliant","rating":9,"date":"15 June 2019","review":"Went to the first public screening at the Sydney Film Festival tonight with members of my family and sat in the front row in a packed cinema. Director Kriv Stenders has taken a big undertaking in telling this highly recognised Australian and New Zealand battle of the Vietnam War that has however been long overdue in getting a major screen treatment. He has succeeded brilliantly. The film's relentless action and attention to detail are mixed in with moving scenes of young conscripts and volunteer soldiers grappling to stay alive in order to return to their loved ones at home. Much like Peter Weir's Gallipoli the mateship ethos shines in this movie. However, unlike that film, most of Danger Close concentrates on the battle itself, and what a technically amazing film it is in presenting and creating a visceral and tense atmosphere for the audience.The performances are excellent all round but particular mention must go to Daniel Webber as Private Paul Large, his moving portrayal of a young conscript struggling and battling courageously to help his mates and himself survive, while looking forward to returning home to his fiance and family is brilliant. As noted earlier the action in this film is relentless, from start to finish, however it never ignores the humanity and futility of war through the loss of life of many young soldiers. The roll call of ANZAC soldiers who died in the battle, noted at the end of the film with their ages, makes that abundantly clear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.","user":"TrevorJD","rank":[75,106]},{"title":"Iconic Australian Movie","rating":10,"date":"16 June 2019","review":"I watched this movie at the Sydney Film Festival ahead of its official release. Thank you to everyone involved in making this movie. It is important that Australian stories such as this are told. The Australian values of mateship and the larrikin spirit are at the centre of this true story. If you identify as being an Australian, you need to go and see this movie when it comes to cinemas in August. I'll be going to see it again when it is officially released. It is one of those movies which leaves you thinking about it well after leaving the cinema. 10 out of 10.","user":"adamer-74973","rank":[88,129]},{"title":"Exceeded my expectations","rating":10,"date":"17 June 2019","review":"I had high hopes for this movie, retelling this famous battle of the Vietnam War. I had previously seen the excellent documentary by Red Dune Films, and was expecting that this film would draw largely from it. However, this is a film and not a documentary, built around the experiences of the main characters, underscored by a brilliant sound track. The action sequences were about the best I've seen for a war movie. The ending is very moving. I'm glad I took the opportunity to see the pre-release at the Sydney Film festival.","user":"RR1107","rank":[66,100]}]
