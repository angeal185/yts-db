[{"title":"The best WWE movie up to date","rating":8,"date":"23 November 2008","review":"We were really surprised when me &amp; my friends watched this movie; it was really the best WWE movie ever, taking into consideration that we all don't enjoy wrestling, but we gave it a try, as it was thought to be as \"Battle Royal\", not a wrestling movie, &amp; in fact, it surprised us all. All the acting was excellent, especially Steve Austin &amp; Vinnie Jones, &amp; surprisingly sometimes emotional acting was there even from the male characters!! The plot was so simple but extremely good (for a WWE movie!), also the shooting was very fine. I recommend you watch this movie, especially with a group of friends, you will be very surprised &amp; will have a lot of fun !","user":"johnnie02","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Surprisingly decent","rating":7,"date":"8 August 2007","review":"So this flick was by no means great, but it did what it wanted to do, be a good bad action flick. Swearing, blood, fighting, no CGI, I had a great time watching it. Which really surprised me cause I HATE stone cold, but even he was pretty good. If you just wanna turn off your brain and watch a well done bad action flick, check this out. And yes I have seen battle royale and the running man, and yes this rips them both off fairly liberally, but what the hell, an action flick is an action flick, enjoy it for what it is. And Vinnie Jones is great as the super evil bad guy. And it even has some social commentary about the media's influence on our culture. Granted, its heavy handed and obvious, but seeing as I was expecting a movie on par with a Segal straight to DVD flick, any level of intelligence is appreciated.","user":"fatmaninatrenchcoat","rank":[112,140]},{"title":"Not nearly as bad as a lot of you are making it out to be.","rating":8,"date":"6 October 2007","review":"Honestly, I really enjoyed this film. It reminded me of the good old days of action films such as Commando, Demolition Man, etc. Anyone who can endure/enjoy Stallone or Arnold in action movies certainly shouldn't have a problem with Steve Austin's acting.<br><br>I think this film just gets a bad rap from critics because WWE is associated with it and no one wants to be the guy that gives them a break. It certainly won't win an Oscar, but if you enjoy action films then I'd definitely give this a chance. Just try &amp; forget WWE is associated with it, let it stand on it's own two feet and judge it for yourself with an open mind.","user":"js_ravinstorm","rank":[89,112]}]
