[{"title":"Suspenseful Indie thriller","rating":9,"date":"28 September 2019","review":"The Redeeming is a psychological thriller that has a nice slow build of tension as it progresses. It centers around a woman in a home in a remote area who lets a young man in. Interesting twists in turns throughout. Great acting by Tracey Ann Wood and Ryan Wichert.","user":"jason-scepter","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"All you wish a psychological thriller to be, and more","rating":9,"date":"25 August 2019","review":"I love psychological thrillers and this one was so smart and kept me curious (and nervous!) the whole viewing. The acting is amazing, and the script and camera work are crafted in a really intelligent way. Recommended!","user":"ringthebellsproductions","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Excellent indie, one location thriller","rating":9,"date":"23 August 2019","review":"Film makes the most of its one location and small cast. Very well executed thriller with shades of the film Misery. I have a a soft spot for films done well with limited resources. This is a smart production from start to finish.","user":"Ink789","rank":[9,10]}]
