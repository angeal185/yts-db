[{"title":"Hilarious, clever, incredibly heartwarming","rating":10,"date":"16 May 2018","review":"This film manages to hit both deeply sentimental and absolutely hilarious chords, all while staying beautifully self-aware, fresh, true to itself, and playfully tongue and cheek. It's amazing and positively refreshing to see a film that satirizes online dating through a deeply genuine and comedic lens. We need more films that touch on the important themes of genuine intergenerational and intersectional dialogue, and I plan on showing Dating My Mother to my future children one day.","user":"rachelelizaoleary","rank":[7,13]},{"title":"I loved this film!","rating":10,"date":"2 June 2018","review":"Dating my mother is a beautiful movie, beautifully shot and acted very well!
