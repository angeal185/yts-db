[{"title":"My favourite film","rating":10,"date":"11 May 2003","review":"My favourite film of all time. Despite its academy awards at the time it remains largely unknown now which is sad. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you feel good. What more can you expect from a movie?","user":"datkins-3","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"I LOVE this movie","rating":10,"date":"7 July 2001","review":"One of the best romantic comedies ever.  Dreyfuss &amp; Mason generate as much chemistry as I have ever seen on the screen from a couple that was never a couple.  Quinn Cummings delivers one of the greatest child actress performance in cinema history -- always genuine and winning.  The dialogue is witty and brittle.  The direction never strikes a false note.  And all the dualities of New York are well exploited.  I simply LOVE this movie.","user":"monkeyface_si","rank":[39,46]},{"title":"Gives you a warm glow","rating":10,"date":"24 October 2000","review":"Simply my favourite movie of all time. First saw it with my fiancee (at the time) and it was her favourite also. We saw it 3 times. Whenever it is on TV I watch, and I have two video copies (in case one gets lost or spoiled!).<br><br>It stars Richard Dreyfuss at his best, and Marsha Mason and the \"kid\" are excellent too. Perhaps it is one of the best of films because it is able to make you laugh and cry, and sometimes at the same time. Neil Simon's writing is so comic and never allows the pathos to drown you. I believe it won a number of Oscars when first released yet almost no one I rave to about it has ever heard of it. Strange!<br><br>This film is very much under-appreciated. It is a wonderful tale of of family, of career, of relationships and of love. The rooftop scene is just fantastic and leaves a knot in my stomach every time I see it. A warm glow and a feeling of \"this is how life should turn out\". Great movie, great script. Fantastic.","user":"datkins-3","rank":[33,41]}]
