[{"title":"A Stunning achievement.","rating":7,"date":"7 January 2002","review":"'I Stand Alone' goes where few movies dare these days. It presents a portrait of hatred, disgust, despair and nihilism. Many would probably not like to face up to the fact that people like \"The Butcher\" exist in our society, but they do. By ignoring them we compound the problems they present and represent.<br><br>Philippe Nahon plays a middle aged unemployed French butcher who is trapped in a loveless relationship with his pregnant girlfriend (Frankye Pain). She has some money and uses it as a power trip, promising to set him up with a new shop. When that doesn't eventuate he attacks her in a fit of rage, and leaves with a gun and three bullets. He heads back to Paris with no money and no prospects. As he sinks lower and lower into hopelessness his anger intensifies, and his mind races with fantasies of violence and revenge.<br><br>This is a confronting and profoundly disturbing movie, mainly because of it's realism and believability. While it certainly features some scenes of extreme violence, and one scene of explicit pornography (blurred in the print I watched), most of what makes it so powerful and horrible is the almost non-stop venomous monologues of \"The Butcher\". Director Gaspar Noe self consciously apes Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver' in several scenes, but this movie is a truly original vision. Highly recommended for movie buffs with strong stomachs, and the ability to deal with dark and troubling material.","user":"Infofreak","rank":[87,94]},{"title":"The rage of a proud, bitter, luckless man","rating":9,"date":"21 July 2002","review":"This fearless film may or may not be a masterpiece, but there is little about this film that feels false or inauthentic.  Many have already compared this film to TAXI DRIVER; but TAXI DRIVER is more of a film about a man that is dragged to insanity by psychotic fantasies he can no longer resist. TAXI DRIVER does, however, share with SEUL CONTRE TEUS a sense of psycho-sexual determinism.  The protagonists in both films are at least partly driven by sexual compulsions they either can not control, feel they can not control or badly desire to explore.  Both films have memorable scenes that take place inside a porno theater, emphasizing the dominance sex and sexual compulsions have over each of the protagonists (though for different reasons in each of them).<br><br>SEUL CONTRE TEUS, however, is less of a film about an inexorable pull toward insanity and instead is more of a film about an inescapable rage -- the rage associated with a fiercely guarded sense of pride that has a strong tendency of violence toward anything that appears the least bit insulting; and a rage that comes from endless feelings of loneliness.  The protagonist (known only as \"The Butcher,\" which is his past profession) is consequently very vulnerable to feelings of humiliation and has little ability to make sound decisions in life.  SEUL CONTRE TEUS is about the rage of those in the working classes that suffer the pain of a hard childhood, are punished for their crimes that mainly arise out of anger, and endure the humiliation of unemployment and unwantedness -- yet refuse to let the harshness of life knock them down for good.  The Butcher refuses to lie down.  He wants to fight back at whatever blocks his path.  But, like an animal, he chooses his targets arbitrarily and impulsively.  Those that he is most threatened by in reality offer little danger; and perhaps could instead offer friendship or even assistance.<br><br>The film features an astounding interior monologue that runs like an intensely embittered sermon (told through a voice over) throughout the duration of the film.  Many of The Butcher's thoughts are intensely provocative and refreshingly, fearlessly insightful and profound.  My favorite is probably the line that says (something like) \"there is no revolution anymore; when we are all alone there is only revenge.\" Valuable lines like this are mixed in with incendiary rants against foreigners and homosexuals -- thoughts and emotions rooted in painfully stubborn pride and bitter humiliation, but which sometimes have the feel of some desperate, lost, apocryphal truth to them.<br><br>There are a couple of other qualities this film shares with TAXI DRIVER. For the most part, even though they are quite frightening, the protagonists in both films are sympathetic (though again for different reasons) and even charismatic.  Also, both films have extremely violent climaxes that, thematically and psychologically, resemble the male orgasm gone psychotic. The conflation of sex and violence in both films is unmistakably real and psychologically (and perhaps politically) profound.  Also, both films feature a twisted sense of redemption at the end (though I will say no more than that for fear of spoiling the endings of both films) -- twisted in the sense that there is a future and not all hope is lost; but it is a hope that is rooted in something unclean and false.  I think most people will find the scene of reconciliation and redemption toward the end of SEUL CONTRE TEUS to be remarkably moving (at least until it turns into something perverse).<br><br>\nThis film is not for everyone -- that's for sure.  If TAXI DRIVER was more than you bargained for, then stay away from this film because this film is even more intense and brutal.  But for those of you who desire, or even need, to see a film about the rage of a man who is disenfranchised and dispossessed and is driven toward fantasies and expressions of violence and perversity -- then here it is.  This is for you.","user":"enicholson","rank":[64,72]},{"title":"Warning: not for the weak, of body or mind.","rating":8,"date":"24 March 2000","review":"A brilliantly disturbing film, unlike anything I have ever seen.  This is an incredibly detailed account of how a disturbed human mind rationalizes everyday reality.  It's like looking right into the mind of a man pushed to the brink, a man capable of anything.  The film darkly builds as we watch the main character fall lower and lower, becoming more and more desperate. I love a movie that can capture an emotion so strongly, and this film defiantly grabs you and does not let go.  The tension literally drips off the screen making it difficult at times to take, but like a car crash, you can't take your eyes off of it.<br><br>Noe's direction is excellent.  The pace is slow and methodical and cut up with a surprising sound affect that makes you jump almost every time you hear it.  This just adds to the disturbing, uneasy atmosphere that the film creates. <br><br>Its a trip that not all people should take, but those of you how are not easily offended, and have a strong stomach and a good eye for art, you should go far out of you way to see this film.","user":"eraceheadd","rank":[73,84]}]
