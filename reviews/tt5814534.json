[{"title":"Surprised","rating":7,"date":"25 December 2019","review":"Ok so I'm very into animation and everything and history behind studios. I went into this movie with low expectations. Blue sky was always just kind of there. My family never went to see any of their movies in theaters. It's Christmas and we went with a cute kids movie because we were seeing it with grandparents. I was blown away. Yes it is kind of a predictable plot but it has a nice spin on it. I liked the emphasis on how violence isn't always the option, and how the movie delivered it in a non cheesy way. Tom Holland and Will Smith worked great together. I laughed a lot. Animation was colorful and fluid and I was surprised how much action was in this movie. I liked how it was an original idea and not just another sequel. Walked out happy, had a great time. Fun to see with family!","user":"iiiluminada","rank":[83,97]},{"title":"Just watched it with kids and we loved it","rating":8,"date":"27 December 2019","review":"Just out of cinema - my two kids and I laughed a lot.\nScenario is not very complex but it is a kid movie don't forget ðŸ˜‰\nI find it refreshing to have a action comedy as a cartoon","user":"niessen-Frederic","rank":[52,67]},{"title":"Pretty fun and entertaining","rating":28,"date":"28 February 2020","review":"This story is pretty fun and entertaining!
