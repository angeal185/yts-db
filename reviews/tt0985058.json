[{"title":"Memorable visuals right up to the end; failure to generate suspense or build to a strong climax","rating":7,"date":"18 November 2009","review":"Tarik Saleh, who made Metropia, is a Turkish graffiti artist living in Sweden and who made an effective 2005 documentary on Guantanamo interrogation techniques called Gitmo. Now he's turned to Orwellian sci-fi, with nods to Kafka and Hitchcock. The opening text of his gray, photo-realistic animated dystopia, which premiered at Venice and was shown at the London Film Festival, reads: The end of the millennium marked the end of many things. Natural resources dried up, the global financial markets crashed and the crisis that connected the fate of all people, still left the individual isolated in his ruin. It's 2024. We're in Sweden. Oil has run out, hence the construction of \"Metropia,\" a new pan-European subway system. This computer animated film is built up out of actual photos using real people's faces and things. Everything is somber and dark and murky and grayish blue, but hey, it's Sweden; and there's a kind of beauty in the drabness, at least at first; visuals are not the weak point of this film. Where it bogs down is in its meandering and ultimately uninteresting plot.<br><br>Protagonist Robert (sensitively voiced by Vincent Gallo) is a dull call-center worker whose expressionless face and big soulful Keane eyes exude a preternatural calm; or is there massive Valium in the water system? After Roger starts hearing Big Brother (actually Stellan Skarsgard) talking in his head and responds by following pert, tough-talking Nina (a cold, slinky-voiced Juliette Lewis), which leads him into a meeting of gangsterish world leaders and their overlord, Ivan Bahn (the naturally ghoulish Udo Kier), head of the Trexx Corporation, which owns everything and is pushing an ominous (?) shampoo, whose ads feature Nina. The in-your-head talkers turn out to be nice lookalikes who take coffee breaks and have their own job insecurities. But somebody is plotting with Nina. Yes, this is one of those worlds where paranoia seems justified; but the dangers don't seem very imminent. This computer-animated photo-based animated film starts out promisingly and has an appealing (if transcendently drab) look with memorable visuals right up to the end, but the nearly-comatose quality of the main characters and the failure to generate suspense or build to a strong climax leads to a ho-him final feel.<br><br>Seen as one of three features in the San Francisco Film Society's 4th Annual Animation Festival in November 2009, this film was part of the London Film Festival in October. Metropia has been nominated for several prizes. It won the Future Film Digital Award at the Venice Film Festival and is slated for theatrical release in Sweden December 27, 2009. It is a production of Atmo Films.","user":"Chris Knipp","rank":[49,56]},{"title":"A very good movie of an unusual style","rating":8,"date":"21 October 2012","review":"I have watched this move on a hint, haven't expected it to be much, but in the end it turned out swell. The atmosphere created and the style of the movie is excellent. I have really enjoyed it, as it is not heavy, but more tranquil-food-for-thought kind of movie.<br><br>The number of allegories in the movie is overwhelming, and there are many connections with how the society functions today.<br><br>The low ratings for this movie are almost certainly there because of the complexity of the work, not because it is bad. Getting to IMDb it immediately reminded me about Aronofsky's Fountain, which had (and still has) sub par user rating compared to the quality of the work.<br><br>I think that Metropia is worthwhile and enjoyable work, and can recommend it.","user":"mrmut","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Originality in animation, if not in story...","rating":7,"date":"8 November 2009","review":"I just screened this in advance of its showing at the San Francisco International Animation Festival. It's an interesting film, more for its technique than its narrative. Set in the not-to-distant future in a VERY bleak world, it tells the story of one man's fight against an evil corporation's machinations. Nothing really new narrative-wise, but the plot really isn't the point of this film. It's the animation. The process uses photomontage as its basis, and is quite creepy in its execution. The voice work is well done, and it's always good to see/hear cult film fave Udo Kier. If you enjoyed \"1984\" or \"Brazil,\" you might want to check this film out.","user":"soncoman","rank":[50,62]}]
