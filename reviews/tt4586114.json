[{"title":"An anthology in all things generic and pointless...","rating":3,"date":"17 June 2018","review":"So, one would think that an anthology in horror with ten film makers coming together for a mutual project, that there should be potential for at least something good.<br><br>One would think...<br><br>Boy, this was one amazingly boring anthology. Just about 90% of the stories were generic, boring or downright bad. And that fact is what made this such an ordeal to suffer through.<br><br>The story with the coroner and the dead girl was the only story worth watching really, in my honest opinion. The rest of the stories were just not really worth the time or effort.<br><br>If you enjoy horror anthologies, then there are far better choices readily available in the horror genre. And I can, in all honesty, not come up with a single reason to suggest that you should take the time, effort and much less pay the money to get to sit down and watch \"A Night of Horror Volume 1\". I suffered through this so you don't have to.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"(Another) Horror Anthology","rating":5,"date":"11 July 2017","review":"\"A Night of Horror - Vol. 1\" is a horror anthology containing some \"hits,\" but mostly misfires. There are ten stories, and I am not going to go into them all. I will talk about the ones I liked. <br><br>\"Hum\" is a story about a hum coming from inside the walls of an apartment building. The girl who lives there thinks she is going crazy, as she seems to be the only person who can hear this noise. However, after she calls the building's superintendent, she learns she isn't all that crazy. I will not give away the ending, but I will say it has one of the most disturbing monsters I have ever seen. \"Priest\" was also a step above the rest. A woman's ride home on a commuter train leads her to an encounter she will never forget.<br><br>Although I didn't care for the majority of these film shorts, I at least applaud the filmmakers for their restraint. There is blood and violence, but it is how these tales attack your mind that makes the film work. Hopefully, Vol. 2 will be even better.<br><br>Rated R for language, disturbing images, and violence.","user":"dcarsonhagy","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Only one good segment-the rest are really bad","rating":2,"date":"2 November 2019","review":"The segment with the coroner was really freaky-definitely the only good segment in this thing. Everything else was not scary or just junk, to be honest. If you're watching this for free on Amazon, just skip to the second segment and then stop.","user":"kwilhelmi","rank":[1,1]}]
