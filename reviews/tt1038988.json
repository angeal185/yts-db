[{"title":"I was a wreck after watching this (ho ho)","rating":9,"date":"24 February 2008","review":"There's a lot of these shaky-cam movies around at the moment, and among your \"Cloverfield\"s and \"Diary Of The Dead\"s this low budget Spanish movie may seem like the underdog, but it's punching way above its weight.<br><br>Filmed by a TV crew stumbling upon something very nasty happening in an apartment block, the movie is shot and acted brilliantly, the sense of unease gradually giving way to all out terror. While it's obviously derivative of movies like \"The Last Broadcast\" and \"The Blair Witch Project\" it manages to deliver in a way that those movies couldn't thanks to some brilliant set-pieces. It's not even out in the UK yet and Hollywood have already remade it (the inevitably inferior \"Quarantine\") but do yourself a favor and spend an evening in the dark with the original. You'll regret it, but in the best possible way. Terrific.","user":"teresaband","rank":[357,440]},{"title":"Do you want some nightmares?","rating":9,"date":"13 January 2008","review":"This is truly a superb horror movie. I loved this movie so much I had to leave a comment. It has been a long time since I jumped off my seat a few times (way too many). It has some of the scariest scenes I have ever seen (you'll know what I'm talking about). The way it's filmed helps us to live this \"nightmare\" as it was for real, as if it was a news article. The \"suspension of disbelief\" works unlike some other titles I have seen. I'm a big horror movie fan and I must tell you: you have to see this. I'm overwhelmed, I'm frightened, I'm suspicious, I can't even sleep... It really scared me big time. There's one particular scene (you'll know, believe me) that I do not recommend for those who are easily impressionable. Go see it. One of the best horror movies I have ever seen.","user":"danielmatrix","rank":[297,375]},{"title":"One of the best horror movies I've ever seen","rating":8,"date":"5 December 2007","review":"This is the kind of movie that you go to the cinema and watch, and then haunts you for weeks. Not that it will make you afraid of the dark or it will make you question your vision of life. This is the kind of movie that is all about the experience, the feeling, the atmosphere. This is the kind of movie you wish you hadn't seen because then you'd be able to experience it again for the first time.<br><br>It doesn't have amazing dialogues, it doesn't have a compelling story, but still is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had in my life. It's a short movie, short enough to have you interested all along, and everything is well packed, the pace being almost perfect. It goes from a quiet, even boring documentary from a cheap local TV to an atmosphere full of tension and expectation. Truly a unique experience. It has some flaws but the movie as a whole made me forgive them all.","user":"albert_bass86","rank":[363,474]}]
