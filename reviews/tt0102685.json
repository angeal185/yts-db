[{"title":"An under-rated classic","rating":6,"date":"6 January 1999","review":"Point Break is one of those films that everybody loves, but that nobody actually talks about all that often. It is a film that if you mention it in conversation, everyone else around is bound to say how much they enjoyed it.<br><br>The film's two main assets are unexpected ones, in the form of the direction and  the script. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two sky-diving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets (and houses) of the city. The script, by W. Peter Illif, is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multi-layered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent, by the standards of most Hollywood action films.<br><br>This film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties, not up there with Die Hard 2/3 or Speed, but better than 90% of the action junk made nowadays. At least this film has a plot.","user":"Keegen","rank":[214,253]},{"title":"The Sum is larger than the Parts.","rating":10,"date":"23 June 1999","review":"Movies are like Bands. People come together--maybe they're not even the greatest musicians individually--but together, something meshes and they make great music. It takes more than great musicians to make a great band. Just so, some movies, no matter how much money, talent, and horsepower is brought to bear, just don't coalesce. Others, like Point Break, come together with an ineffable \"rightness\" that defies any of the parts, logic, or analysis. This is one of my favorite movies. Period. Everything \"works.\" This movie ROCKS.","user":"mikew-8","rank":[190,256]},{"title":"How can you not like this film...","rating":10,"date":"27 September 2006","review":"OK, sure it is just a big action film with a flimsy script and crazy stunts but.... it is filmed so great. It feels so summer in Cali. It makes you want to forget your blah zaa blah job, move to the beach and surf your azz off and have summer bonfires all night and party the night away. I have been reading others comments on why they can't understand the guilty pleasure about this movie.... Duh that's the whole idea. Yes you can like movies that have you thinking about this and that at the end. You can have movies that astound you. And of course you can have movies that can make you feel like you had a great F'N experience. This is what this movie is. Eat your popcorn. Dive into it AND have a great time. Who cares about the social impact. Enjoy it and think about this. Sex Wax! If it's in the movie, it's a FUN movie! Holla","user":"gbenson20","rank":[114,152]}]
