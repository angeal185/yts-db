[{"title":"Monsters great, people and drama boring","rating":6,"date":"5 June 2019","review":"Great and Amazing battles/fights among giant monsters, epic and spectacular ones, what everybody was waiting for, if you want to enjoy good monsters and CGI this is you movie, go watch it on the best screen 8.5/10... But the plot is weak, people are stupid and make meaningless decisions. People's behavior is absurd, with a lot of boring drama that nobody cares, in addition the actors who are supposed to be the main ones have no time on screen. A Total disappointment.","user":"JoeYabuki","rank":[416,497]},{"title":"All hail the King... of bad writing","rating":6,"date":"9 September 2019","review":"Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the sequel to Godzilla (2014) directed by Michael Dougherty. It's satisfying enough to be considered a Godzilla movie but doesn't live up to its predecessor.<br><br>What made Godzilla (2014) an above-average Hollywood blockbuster is the interesting dialogue and interactions between the characters which King of the Monsters fails to accomplish. For example, the scientists and the military are given comedic traits often resulting in painfully unfunny and out of place humour. Protagonist characters (the Russel family) are given bare minimum characterization which is a blockbuster standard by now. As a matter of fact, not a single character or character interaction is interesting and not a single joke lands which are the films biggest sins.<br><br>To give credit where credit is due to the King of the Monster nails the VFX and the over the top battles make up for most of the poor writing.

Thus, my 5 star rating. Half of the movie involved the monster battles and that gets 10 stars. The half of the movie where there is no monster presence gets 0. That averages out to a 5. Perhaps some day Hollywood will re-discover the lost art of screen writing and combine it with CGI to create a truly fantastic movie. But don't look for it to change soon. A lot of people came out of the theater visually dazzled by the special effects knowing that the story was awful but still thought it was a great movie. So they will continue make a lot of money creating these kind of movies and save on time &amp; expense by not having to pay top dollar for a writer.","user":"kbayless-1","rank":[334,421]}]
