[{"title":"Another Wonderful Fifties Western.","rating":7,"date":"23 June 2010","review":"WARLOCK (1959) was the final entry in the roster of splendid Cinemascope/color westerns that 20th Century produced in the fifties. With a star studded cast headed by Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda, Anthony Quinn and Dorothy Malone this project was produced and directed by Edward Dymtryk. The excellent screenplay by Robert Alan Aurthur derived from a novel by Oakley Hall and the superb cinematography was by the great Joe MacDonald.<br><br>Warlock, a small mining town in the west, is plagued by the unruly and lawless cowhands from the San Pablo ranch who wreak havoc every weekend on the hapless citizens. The gang have just run the current Sheriff (Walter Coy) out of town and the impatient town council have now decided enough is enough. They make the decision to hire a gunfighter - an expensive gunfighter. So along comes a famous Marshall by the name of Clay Blaisedell (Henry Fonda) and his friend and bodyguard Tom Morgan (Anthony Quinn) to take on the job. He also brings along his portable gambling casino complete with the shopfront hoarding naming his gaming saloon \"The French Palace\". (He explains to the council \"What you pay me for keeping the law would hardly keep me in ammunition for my gun practice - gambling is my business - it's how I make my living\"). But through one difference or another and having to outdraw and kill his friend Tom Morgan and set his gambling saloon alight the town eventually sours against the Marshall. The now reformed gang member and newly appointed Deputy Sheriff Johnny Gannon (Richard Widmark) tells Blaisedell he'll have to leave town by morning. The picture ends with Gannon confronting Blaisedall the next day with the gunman easily outdrawing him. But surprisingly the Marshall capitulates and tosses his gold handled six-guns into the street to the visibly shocked Deputy's relief. Then with a wry smile to Gannon the colourful gunfighter mounts his horse and rides on out of town forever.<br><br>Performances are generally excellent throughout! Although Widmark has top billing it is clearly Fonda's picture. His Clay Blaisedell is the film's pivotal personality. As the well dressed gunfighter he is cool, smooth and lightning fast on the draw - as one challenger (DeForest Kelly) finds out to his utter astonishment in one gripping scene. Fonda hasn't been this good in a western since his superb portrayal in \"The Tin Star\" two years previously. Good too is Quinn in a really meaty characterization as Blaisedell's neurotic, over-protective and club- footed bodyguard. Also effective is Tom Drake as the Pabloite gang leader but Dorothy Malone is quite irritating and gives her usual breathless overwrought and over played portrayal of an old flame of Blaisedell. Better, and prettier to look at too, is Dolores Michaels as his newer love interest.<br><br>Underlining this engaging western is the music of Leigh Harline. The composer had worked before with director Dmytryk on the excellent \"Broken Lance\" (1954) which elicited from him his best score. Here his music is just as dramatic. The music under the titles is robust and determined featuring strident strings against repeating and striking brass figures pointing up the menace of the errant San Pablo gang. There is some tender music for the scenes with Fonda and Michaels and a reflective lyrical cue for Blaisedell himself which is wonderfully uplifting for the end scene as he rides out of town.<br><br>WARLOCK is a good western and warrants repeated viewings. A well structured character driven drama set in an engaging western environment and well played by an equally engaging cast in what is yet another memorable movie from the cinema of yesteryear.","user":"jpdoherty","rank":[43,49]},{"title":"Psychological western in disguise","rating":9,"date":"17 January 2006","review":"After banging on about the sea change in Westerns from the 1940s to the 1950s in my reviews of THE TALL T and MAN OF THE WEST on this site recently, I watched 1959s WARLOCK unfold with a certain set of expectations in my head.<br><br>At first glance, WARLOCK appears to be a western of the old school, not that far removed from earlier classics like MY DARLING CLEMENTINE or THE WESTERNER. In fact, it even shares some plot similarities with John Ford's 1946 Wyatt Earp biopic. But the key difference here is that in the older style of western, the immutable Code of the West is the salvation for men such as Earp, but in WARLOCK it is the millstone that will drag them into the abyss.<br><br>For Johnny Gannon (Richard Widmark), the Code causes him to leave behind the lawless San Pablo ranch cowhands lead by the increasingly psychotic Abe McQuown (pronounced McEwan), to accept the post of Deputy Sheriff, eventually bringing him into conflict with his old gang, which includes his own kid brother, and finally making him face up to hired gunslinger Clay Blaisedell (Henry Fonda).<br><br>For Blaisedell, though he initially believes he can leave his old life and marry local beauty Jessie Marlow (Dolores Michaels), the Code re-asserts its grip when Blaisdell is forced to confront his own partner Tom Morgan (Anthony Quinn) in a street shoot-out, and he realises that he will never escape his destiny as a gun-for-hire, no matter how he tries.<br><br>(Incidentally, I disagree with another reviewer here who claims Anthony Quinn's line \"I won!\" as he gasps his life out on the Warlock street means only that Quinn won the draw. I believe that line signifies that Quinn has proved that Fonda cannot escape his fate as a hired killer. The only way for Fonda to prove he'd changed would have been to NOT shoot Quinn. So in that sense Quinn won not just the draw but also the philosophical point that Fonda would never change.)<br><br>The Tom Morgan character has no loyalty to the Code. He simply enjoys his life as a \"friend\" of the great Clay Blaisedell. His motivation is that at Clay's side, men fear him and, though they may think him just a \"cripple\", they'd never dare say it aloud. Without Clay, Morgan would be just another casino owner. <br><br>But ultimately, you could say Morgan sacrificed his life to save Clay from himself. Because without Morgan's manoeuvrings, Clay may well have tried to settle in Warlock and would probably have ended up \"backshot\" by some old crony of Abe McQuown.<br><br>So, not the simple tale of the west it might at first appear, WARLOCK is a clever, subtle and insightful look at the psychological motivations at work in this deceptively complex three-way conflict.<br><br>A movie definitely worth more than one viewing ...","user":"Matti-Man","rank":[33,38]},{"title":"Rock of ages comes to Warlock in Dmytryk's excellent adult Western.","rating":9,"date":"14 January 2009","review":"Warlock is a small town suffering from visits by a gang of thugs led by Abe McQuown. The honest townsfolk meet and decide to hire infamous gunslinger Clay Blaisedell to act as a Marshal. Blaisdell, aided by his trusty companion Tom Morgan, proceeds to clean up the town and promptly takes control of the gambling and dance parlour. But things are rarely straight forward in a town of this type, one of the thugs (Johnny Gannon) decides to reform himself and takes on the role of legal sheriff. Things are further complicated when a woman arrives in town proclaiming that Blaisedell and Morgan killed the love of her life! This coupled with the fact that McQuown and his thugs are plotting destructive revenge, means that Warlock and it's array of complex characters are heading for judgement day - one way or another.<br><br>The basic plot sounds like nothing out of the ordinary, the tough gunslinger with a reputation hired to clean up a town has been done a fair few times, with varying degrees of success. What lifts this Edward Dmytryk directed (and produced) Western above other films of its ilk is that it goes deeper than most of those other genre pieces. Blaisedell may be a fearsome gunslinger but we are at a time when a new breed of faster and more thuggish cowboys exist, and so his very being is crucial to the number of events that transpire in Warlock. Here all central characters are multi-layered, there is a plenty going on that begs the utmost attention, where tragedy hangs heavy with its looming presence, and Dmytryk threads all the story strands together with thoughtfully potent results.<br><br>Adapted by Robert Alan Aurthur from Oakley Hall's novel, Warlock boasts three excellent male lead performances and a firing on all cylinders supporting cast. Henry Fonda (Blaisedell), Richard Widmark (Gannon) and Anthony Quinn (Tom Morgan) are superb, while Dorothy Malone, Dolores Michaels, Tom Drake, DeForest Kelly, Frank Gorshin (sadly uncredited) and Wallace Ford come up trumps with excellent shows for totally important characters. The only gripe I can come up with is that I would have liked a bit more use of the Utah location courtesy of Joseph MacDonald's Cinemascope Technicolor, but since this story is primarily set within the confines of Warlock the town, one can be and is a touch forgiving.<br><br>During the last few years I have spent a lot of time revisiting the Western genre, and I have been rewarded with a ream of excellent adult pieces by the likes of Anthony Mann, Henry King and Budd Boetticher. Few of them are as undervalued, and maybe as forgotten, as this first class effort from all involved, it's a must see for any serious Western fan. 9/10","user":"hitchcockthelegend","rank":[20,22]}]
