[{"title":"Intriguing story","rating":17,"date":"17 June 2003","review":"Secretary is the first of its kind - a very dark love story. First of its kind in that it deals with themes never seen before seen in mainstream Hollywood cinema - S&amp;M, sexual dominance and submission.<br><br>Maggie Gyllenhaal is outstanding in a potential minefield of a role - she handles it with dignity and even provides some effective dark humour.<br><br>\nThe story here is that her character, Lee, applies for a job as a secretary for the firm owned by James Spader's brilliant Mr Grey. However, Lee has a history of self-harm and masochism and Grey has a dominance complex along with a very sadistic streak. Combine these 2 in theory and you have 2 very happy people. But this is no ordinary love story...<br><br>Spader, as stated, is brilliant. He brings an icy steel to the troubled Grey, but also provides a touch of black humour which comes at some great moments to 'release the tension'.<br><br>For the themes supplied here you'd probably expect a lot of raunchiness - well there are sexual moments, of course, but there is nothing gratuitous, which is in itself an achievement and well handled.<br><br>Overall it's quirky, off-beat, and a little bit different.<br><br>Worth a view.","user":"Danny_G13","rank":[228,249]},{"title":"Two great performances, one great film","rating":9,"date":"1 October 2002","review":"The word \"originality\" has been overused, especially by me, so much that it has almost been beaten to a pulp.  After all, how can one really tell if something in a film hasn't been done before?  Well, I can confidently say that Steven Shainberg's \"Secretary\" may be the most inventive, and yes, even original, film this year.  I can confidently say that in all of my time of watching and reviewing films, I have never seen anything like it.<br><br>\nLee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just been released from a mental institution due to the fact that she constantly would cut herself when tension started to build up around the household.  After she is released, it is clear that the habit has not been broken, but cuts or no cuts, she needs a job.  She goes to typing school and gets some of the highest grades in her class, making her perfect for the position of secretary at a nearby lawyer's office.  She goes for the interview, and after seeing the previous secretary run out in tears and hearing the questions in the interview, it is apparent that the lawyer, E. Edward Grey (James Spader), is a bit of a creep.<br><br>\nSoon enough, Lee begins to cut herself at work, and needless to say, Grey catches her in the act.  He doesn't take any sort of disciplinary action towards her.  Instead, it seems that he can relate.  He tells Lee, very inspiringly, that she will never cut herself again.  Lee is uplifted, but has no real inclination as to just why he said what he did.  However, she still continues to make mistakes in her writing, and after a while, it simply drives Grey nuts.  He invites her into her office and tells her to \"Lean over, put your elbows on the table and read the letter outloud\". She does as he asks, but in a strange turn, he spanks her every other word. She runs into the bathroom hurt and embarrassed, but interestingly enough, she loved it.<br><br>I'm a bit surprised that even by this time, there has been little controversy over \"Secretary\".  I had images in my head of feminist groups rallying for the film never to reach the screens, or possibly screams of NC-17 from everyone's favorite censors, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).  Thankfully though, it's gotten this far unscathed.  Maybe that is because audiences at preview screenings and film festivals are realizing that although loaded with thick layers of kooky (but not that kinky) S/M, the situation is a deeply and fundamentally human one.<br><br>Basically, if S/M was ever shown in a film before, it would usually be in the context of a villain torturing a hero against their will, and usually such scenes weren't in anything that wasn't some cheap exploitation film. \"Secretary\" is a brave endeavor, but it knows where it's going.  This isn't a gimmick, S/M sequences in the film are not the least bit perverted (the same can't be said about some segments in several Larry Clark films). These scenes are essential to understanding the characters.<br><br>What is so great about \"Secretary\" goes beyond its offering insight as to why anyone would find being tied to a pole and spanked while holding a carrot between their teeth even remotely attractive.  Despite pretty morbid subject matter, \"Secretary\" flies off the screen with energy and wit, offering some of the funniest, most surprising dark comedy I have seen since \"Fargo\".  Several scenes in the film have already become classics in my repertoire of movie moments that will stay with me forever, including one hilarious incident involving a worm.<br><br>Even with all of this, there is no way that \"Secretary\" would have pulled it off without Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.  Spader is creepy and oddly pathetic; his performance is such that at one moment we are sympathetic, the next we are booing him, then we're intrigued again.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is equally brilliant; she gives us complete access into the mind of Lee Holloway, and it's close to impossible not to feel for her.  Also, take into account how courageous she is; you try and find me another actress her age who would be willing to do half of the things she does in the film.<br><br>Spader and Gyllenhaal have such chemistry that everything clicks. Director Steven Shainberg lets us truly understand the complexities of their relationship without letting the energy lag or any of the subtle comedy fly past the audience.  \"Secretary\" is invigorating, touching, hilarious, and often all at the same time.  With too many romantic comedies trying too hard to try something new when they are in fact only going backwards, \"Secretary\" is a truly unique specimen.","user":"bigspeegs","rank":[112,125]},{"title":"a dark comedy layered with nuanced social and personal commentary","rating":13,"date":"13 April 2003","review":"What is the path to love?  For every person, it's different.  The superficial circumstances are similar... you meet someone at work, at school, in a singles bar.  And, usually, the emotional pathways are similar. Eyes meet.  We talk.  We dance.  We communicate about ourselves to each other.  Then begins the sexual part, so we parry and thrust, take signals from each other, and, over time, we feel each other up together.  But what about the path to love through the back door (so to speak)?  What about a love story where she's a young, neurotic woman, just out of a mental hospital back to a family where Dad's a serious drunk and Mom's a serious nervous fruitcake.  And what about a man, an attorney, who's emotionally closed off and can only get in touch with orchids, inserting long stainless-steel tools into their waiting organs.  Yes, these two find each other in one of the most bizarre cinematic love stories ever. <br><br>\nI loved this movie.  I pilgrim around, searching through books and movies for secret pathways to and circumstances of the human heart.  This movie transcends its gentle S&amp;M to reveal yet another way to love. <br><br>\nOur heroine, the fresh-faced (and magnificently moon-like) Maggie Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the new secretary to a lawyer who goes through so many secretaries, he has a \"secretary\" vacancy sign he lights up outside his office.  As our heroine tries to re-enter the world by getting her first job with this man, it becomes apparent that the boss is anything but normal.  He is demanding yet insistent that his new charge break away from her stifling past and be herself.  But what or who is she?  And who in the hell is he?<br><br>The movie is sexy.  There's no denying it.  Gyllenhaal is radiant and sinuous, and we feel that she's truly experiencing the wonder of it all for the first time.  Spader is type-cast a bit, but his world-weary sexiness fits well with Gyllenhaal's naivet√©.  And, let's face it, Gyllenhaal is grippingly sexy, and we see her in hose, panties, tight skirts and in the nude.  And as far as I'm concerned, she's fabulous, darling.  And in one of the movie's sexiest, most endearing scenes, we see Spader carry her off in her urine-soaked wedding dress as he finally assumes his responsibilities as her loving \"dom\".  She is totally tired, subservient and radiant in total surrender, rescued from a voyeurizing world.  What a hunk of sexy cinema that was with her arm languidly draped around Spader's neck as he carried the bride over the threshold to love and dominance.  Wow.<br><br>This movie explores and explodes sexual myths.  The director has successfully created a dark comedy layered with nuance in a stew of social commentary.  This movie is not for everyone.  Stay away if you're conventionally wrapped, conservative, or lacking in a certain joy of exploration.  But if you're ready for a most untraditional-traditional love story, Spader and Gyllenhaal give Oscar worthy performances... but of course the subject matter nixed that.","user":"stephenksmith","rank":[83,92]}]
