[{"title":"an underrated gem","rating":8,"date":"25 January 2008","review":"I didn't know what I was going to see when I first watched this film. It's not big and splashy but it's a quiet film that I almost overlooked. I'm so glad I didn't. This movie made me a fan of Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten even more. It's an amazing movie and the ending was a great twist. The quiet and subtle performances are what made it more personal. It's one movie that is overlooked that shouldn't be. It's a small and quiet film, but it's a great one at that.<br><br>I'm used to seeing Ginger Rogers either dancing around with Fred Astaire or playing a chorus girl in a show that is struggling, but this movie has shown me how much talent she really had. And I only saw Joseph Cotten in Citizen Kane and Since You Went Away. This movie made me take notice and see how good he was as a leading man and actor. <br><br>The story is simple and is perfectly played that way. Although it might seem a little too melodramatic and hokey, it's really not. For anyone interested in old movies, I would recommend it to them. This needs to be on television and seen a lot more.","user":"FrancescaRella","rank":[34,37]},{"title":"Boy with Past Meets Girl with Past","rating":8,"date":"30 April 2009","review":"Joseph Cotten's character Zack suffers from anxiety attacks. A vivid scene showing him have one would be good for people who do suffer from such attacks. His voice-over, talking to himself, telling himself that is isn't real, is exactly right because in the middle of one, nothing else in the world feels so real. He also gives Ginger Roger's character Mary a good description of what it feels like in a big battle - the only thing you experience is what's right in front of you, not how they show it in the movies with panoramic knowledge.<br><br>One thing that is missing from the movie is any idea of what prison is like for Mary. I have heard of work release from prison but never vacations from prison.<br><br>There is some nice gentle humor sprinkled throughout, particularly between Mary's uncle and his daughter, played by Shirley Temple. He chastises her for playing her music too loud and it's amusing to think that \"war\" has been going on for 70 years! I believe that \"small\", character driven stories like this stay with viewers much longer than the explosive, quick cut turkeys Hollywood seems to want to make today.","user":"PretoriaDZ","rank":[14,14]},{"title":"A Lovely Surprise !","rating":9,"date":"29 January 2005","review":"I usually gobble up 1940's romantic movies like freshly made creamed rice pudding, so I was most surprised to see this on DVD whilst looking for something else ! For the occasion, I gave in to an impulse and came home with the DVD in my bags ! This is not normal as I only usually buy DVD's of films I know and like.<br><br>The \"risk\" paid off ........ I thoroughly enjoyed the film, of course, I dearly love both of the main actors and am also fairly fond of Shirley Temple ( it's a change to see her as an adolescent instead of as a small kid ). Although the beginning of the film is a tad slow, the whole outfit soon warms up and of course viewer suspense is maintained by asking oneself when each one of the couple will discover the \"terrible\" secret of the other. It's an old and tried formula, but the hard fact is that it WORKS ! The only unpleasant moment is a frighteningly savage dog attack on Mr Cotten - which I wasn't expecting - and left me momentarily breathless (let's face it, those big white teeth were impressive !!!). I am happy to have this film as part of my DVD collection and would highly recommend it to all of you who are smitten with 1940's style romanticism !","user":"nicholas.rhodes","rank":[34,38]}]
