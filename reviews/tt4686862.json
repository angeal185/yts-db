[{"title":"I thought it was fantastic","rating":10,"date":"13 March 2017","review":"I honestly don't know why there are so many negative reviews; I thought it was super sweet, relateable, funny, and a breath of fresh air both in terms of representation and in the fact that it didn't fall prey to most LGBTQ fiction tropes or film clich√©s in general. It was very real and also just kept me giggling, and the actors are all fantastic. New favorite!","user":"teddiejean","rank":[21,29]},{"title":"Coming of age and coming out, all in one, but funny","rating":8,"date":"18 February 2017","review":"I'm sure this movie won't be for everyone, but I'm well outside the target audience (I'm in my 50's) and although some of the jokes slide by I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've lived some of those moments and they sang true on screen for me. It's not going to change the world but it was lightweight, funny and hit a spot that needs to be hit.","user":"eloisepasteur","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"Disappointing movie","rating":2,"date":"8 February 2017","review":"Originally, I was really exited for this movie - I love the actors and the people behind it. I even contributed to the kickstarter campaign. But the movie was so disappointing. The most of it was cringe worthy and almost painful to watch. I'm pretty sure that this was suppose to be a comedy, but the humor fell completely flat with me. And I didn't like the fact that they used the R word the way they did. The whole movie is almost based on the fact that Cassie is overreacting (who would almost throw away a friendship over that?)and that's a shame. <br><br>Also as a backer, I'm disappointed in how long we had to wait to see the movie (I know they had to find a contributor first), but if I remember correctly, we were promised to watch the movie before anyone else. And that clearly didn't happen.","user":"NielsenF1","rank":[25,38]}]
