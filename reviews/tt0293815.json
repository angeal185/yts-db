[{"title":"I almost dropped dead laughing!","rating":11,"date":"11 October 2003","review":"Man, to anyone that thinks this is highbrow art, please, please, get a life. This was supposed to be a ghetto comedy, and as such it is awesome.  The scene with Damon and the pimp in the Bathroom almost put me in the hospital. And the Church ladies at the storefront.  This is funny stuff.  I mean real funny stuff.  If you can't find the comedy in this, you need to take the stick.....  I'm sorry, as I was saying this is really funny stuff.","user":"giatime","rank":[32,40]},{"title":"Ho! Ho Ho! Foo !!","rating":9,"date":"6 January 2007","review":"In udder hilarity, the gang of two is back! And with a comedic vengeance. I saw this in California when I lived there at Christmas time, 2002, and it was one of the funniest down in the hood yule-tide, Christmas stories I have seen in years. <br><br>From one of the worst roommates, Dey Dey,(Epps Jr.) to Pinky their ex-boss, to Pops and uncle, doing restaurant bar-BBQ together(and arguing and fighting, all the way)right on down to the landlord and one of the biggest 'problems' these two have had (Damon) since, well...since 'FRIDAY' 1995 when Chris Tucker was riding with Cube, and Deebo was troubling' em'!!<br><br>The two police officers I won't soon forget, A.Hole and B. Dix when it came time to bring the PO' PO' into it, these two were all in all. Christmas time is here and unfortunately so is the ghetto thugs, out rippin' and stealin' everything in sight, including Dey Dey and Craig's stuff even out the refrigerator. They're broker den broke, and you can't 'beat' that with Michael Jackson!<br><br>I went back and saw this a few more times before it left the theater because frankly, it was worth it. Ms. K.D. Aubert, was a lovely and wondrous addition to this Miss-L-toe mantra in the ghetto. This was accompanied by a ghetto-fabulous soundtrack! Mary J Blige was my favorite of all, 'Family Affair' was R&amp;B soul-delicious!! And in all, as Mary would say, Jesus is the reason for the season all the way!<br><br>I really love it when Ice Cube puts his writer's cap on and brings out yet another gem of a good-times movie. <br><br>I recommend this to Ice Cube and Mike Epps fans, because they take it and bake the cake and steal the show.<br><br>Good team playing' y'all! Here's to another fun-filled two hours down the hood comedy road. I'll be waiting. Until then, (****) four out of four.","user":"buzznzipp1995","rank":[19,24]},{"title":"It was good, but it wasn't Friday","rating":5,"date":"20 November 2002","review":"I had the opportunity to sneak this film at the CWRU Film Society this evening.  I admit I wasn't expecting much.  Friday was a great film.  Fun, laid back and a good trip.  Next Friday was, well, OK, but it wasn't great. Friday After Next was maybe a little lower on the scale.<br><br>This suburban white boy is a huge fan of Cube, so I had fun just the same. Things just seemed... I don't know... disconnected.  Granted the first two films didn't have a strong plot, but this one was a little thinner.  The situations were funny, but they weren't as funny often times as I thought they could be.<br><br>In short, I'm glad I saw it and yucked it up.  I certainly needed the laughs, but there could have been more of them and not so spaced apart. Finally, I thought the opening sequence was cute, but perhaps too cute, and it certainly seemed to drag on just a little too much.<br><br>Enjoy it, it's worth the money, but maybe at the cheapie show, which is where I fear it will be in a few weeks...","user":"froggy-19","rank":[4,4]}]
