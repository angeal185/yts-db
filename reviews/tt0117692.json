[{"title":"A different take on the story","rating":26,"date":"26 September 2012","review":"Direct-to-video sequel is actually more of a re-adaptation of Stephen King's original story. Michael Gross plays a psychiatrist who goes back to his hometown following his mother's death. Accompanying him is his teenage daughter, Michelle (a young Hilary Swank). Gross soon realizes that they're being targeted by the men who sacrificed his sister in a satanic ritual 27 years earlier, only they're no longer human.<br><br>In some ways, this is better than the first film. For one, it features an overall darker tone. It doesn't get all sappy either, and the idea to have the gang return as demons instead of ghosts works well, also tying into a ritual from the original story that the first adaptation omitted. I preferred the father/daughter dynamic over the family one, and the addition of side characters, Maria and Jules, was certainly welcome.<br><br>On the other hand, even as demons, Alexis Arquette and company didn't come off quite as menacing as the gang from the previous flick. I think that had to do with some lame one-liners. There's also the fact that I recognized one of the gang, Glen Beaudin, from the silly 90's TV series, \"Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad\", so it's hard to take him too seriously as a threat. The priest character is way over the top as well, and the annoying lawnmower idiot couldn't get off my screen fast enough.<br><br>Still, this is a fun take on the King tale, and we get some interesting imagery such as death by flying tarot cards and Swank getting it on with a demonized Arquette. It's far from great, but it makes a nice companion to the first, as both have their qualities and misfires.","user":"Cujo108","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"What the...?","rating":2,"date":"17 December 2005","review":"This movie was like watching a presentation in a community college class on movie effects. I was watching it and got the notion that I could write a better movie, so I did. It took about 14 minutes. I kept feeling like they were deciding on exactly what to do as the scenes came up. No planning at all. The death scenes were laughable. The acting was too. This movie should have been called, If Nothing Else Is On, Watch This Muted Because Hillary Swank Is In It. That's basically what we did, minus the muted part. I would recommend, if you enjoy this movie, that you see a doctor immediately. There is a good chance that something serious is wrong with your head. Who knows, maybe there is a tarot card stuck in it.","user":"hurdleston","rank":[16,29]},{"title":"Better than the original","rating":8,"date":"9 October 2007","review":"This is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. It may have been direct to video, but it was theater worthy. It has everything a great horror movie needs: a great plot, the wonderful and chilling music, the great acting, the amazing death sequences, and the villain Tony Reno (Alexis Arquette) gives the movie life. It deserves higher than viewers give it. If it were up to me, i'd put it in the top 250.<br><br>The first film is good, but it was too happy for me. The third is good, but really should have been a stand alone film. This is a more accurate version of King's story, including a ritual from the story that never made it into the first film.<br><br>If you want a good horror film, watch this. You'll be happy you did.","user":"cmagu","rank":[11,24]}]
