[{"title":"Tongue-in-cheek horror and lots of Art Deco...","rating":9,"date":"31 August 1999","review":"This film would have probably been horrible had they taken themselves seriously.  Fortunately, they didn't and, consequently, created a fascinating and entertaining festival of murder, revenge, and Art Deco set design. Vincent Price is Phibes, a brilliant organist and acoustic expert who's wife dies during an operation.  He seeks to avenge her death by killing all 9 members of the operating team in creative and extravagant ways.  You know the murders will take place, but you're fascinated at how they are done. It's like watching a master at work and all of the murders are works of art. By the end of the movie you'll find yourself rooting for Phibes.<br><br>Price is at his best at Phibes.  Phibes requires a machine to speak, so Price is effectively miming to the dialog, but he does it so well.  The performance of Virginia North as the silent, yet deadly, Vulnavia is particularly interesting.  She plays the murderer's sidekick and is always beautiful and mysterious.<br><br>One of the most wonderful elements of this film is the Art Deco set and costume design.  Every scene just oozes with elegance.<br><br>This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  No, it's not Gone With the Wind, but it's fun and fascinating just the same, sort of a candy movie. I highly recommend it.","user":"Charles-31","rank":[46,51]},{"title":"A masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"10 January 2005","review":"Calling this 'Horror' does not make it justice. I wouldn't call it 'movie', either, but 'film'. It's pure art. The sets and art direction are incredible, the whole movie shows the 'aura' of 1920's Art Deco, giving it that 'classy' touch. The script is also very original, and there's even room in it for lots of laughs, without sacrificing style or rhythm. Vincent Price is PERFECT as Phibes, as the other reviewer just said. He IS Phibes, and succeeds where others would probably fail miserably, fitting in perfectly in the 'tone' of the movie. Great direction by Robert Fuest, also. He managed to mix the perfect amount of horror, drama, romance and comedy in a single movie.","user":"naltimari","rank":[56,63]},{"title":"An Old-Fashioned Love Story","rating":10,"date":"22 July 2001","review":"Vincent Price plays a \"dead\" man avenging the surgical team that lost his wife on the operating table.  Nine doctors in all(one of them a nurse) are treated to nine of the most innovative, creative, outlandish deaths imaginable. The deaths loosely follow the Ten Plagues of the Old Testament, but each with a new twist.  The film is an exercise in witty, stylish black comedy seldom seen today.  Much of the credit MUST go to director Robert Fuest for his vision of something truly unique:  a world in the 1920's with clockwork musicians, 20's music, and beautiful sets and costumes.  Price gives one of his best performances in a role that barely utilizes his greatest attribute, his voice.  Price relies heavily on movement and facial expressions, and does so wonderfully.  The cast is superb with British stalwarts adorning the film all over.  Terry-Thomas has a nice cameo as a Doctor Longstreet experiencing a blood donor's worst nightmare.   Peter Jeffrey, a woefully under-appreciated actor, gives a fine comic performance as a policeman always on the spot a moment too late.  Joseph Cotton does a credible job as the surgical leading physician.  Aubrey Woods(wonderful..simply wonderful), Hugh Griffith, and John Cater also lend their talents to the supporting cast.  Caroline Munro plays Price's dead wife as well.  This film rejuvenated Price's career in the 70's.  It is unique, poetic, haunting, and, for me the most important, very amusing.  If you lack a sense of humour with regards to the world of the macabre, you might want to stay away from Phibes.  It is a very dark, black comedy, yet one that is at its heart nothing more than a tragic love story of sorts.","user":"BaronBl00d","rank":[47,55]}]
