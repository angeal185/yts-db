[{"title":"Historical Drama from South Korea","rating":8,"date":"23 July 2014","review":"In 1770s Korea, King Jeong-jo of the Joseon dynasty has been on the throne for only a short time, but numerous assassination attempts have already been made on his life. His mother and grandmother are at odds; the court is divided and worse, the army is under the command of a general who may or may not be loyal to the king. While training himself in secret, Jeong-jo trusts only his clerk, whom he has known since before his father was executed years ago. Meanwhile, over the decades young children taken by a brutal slave-master are brought up to become assassins, and tonight is the fateful night....<br><br>It just isn't a Montreal Fantasia Festival for me if I don't see at least one seriously costumed historical drama from at least one Asian country, and this year \"The Fatal Encounter\" fit the bill perfectly. There's a massive amount of intrigue, lots and lots of intense combat scenes, a bit of torture here and there and, of course, a love interest as well. The film is apparently based on a real incident in Korean history, although of course how much license is taken by the filmmakers is another question. I must admit that I was confused for much of the film, simply because there are so many intrigues and plots going on at the same time, and it was very difficult to wrap my head around a \"grandmother\" who is younger than her \"grandson\" and considerably younger than that \"grandson's\" mother - but heck, this is the kind of film where you just go with the flow and trust that it will all come out right in the end! Definitely worth a look, but do try to keep all the plots straight in your head while viewing it....","user":"alisonc-1","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Didn't expect would be so good.","rating":9,"date":"11 April 2015","review":"Watched it last night. At first, I thought it would be another colossal Korean movie, but after a few minutes, I was intrinsically interested with the directing, editing, scoring, and how the story evolving. <br><br>The characters, all have their magnetic personalities that trapped me into liking almost each of them. Especially the little girl, her acting is impressive. And the king, don't let me start. Even the antagonistic Queen.. she's magnetically impressive as well.<br><br>Heck, even the quiet killer, and the clash with his old buddy, seemed interwoven sweetly.<br><br>I have been a kung-fu movie fan since decades ago, but I must say, this one Korean movie is a great masterpiece that I have never seen before during my fan-girling all Chinese, Hongkong, or Japanese movies.<br><br>OK, except for HERO. I think they almost have the same depth of quality.<br><br>Utterly recommended.","user":"jojifrey","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Fast-paced historical drama film","rating":7,"date":"27 September 2014","review":"This is another movie that takes place during the Joseon Dynasty. However unlike certain Korean dramas that takes on this premises. This actually way more fast-paced. The movie revolves around a King, spies, assassins, treason and love affairs. And for the most part it's actually blended in quite well. The twist and turns actually makes this one quite immersive, despite some of the twist being quite predictable and all. My one main disappointment is how certain characters and story structure builds up and at the end, it just seems to fall short with it's development. In another words, the good build up seemed a bit disappointing, because of the weak ending that just felt a bit abrupt. It's a movie that is worth the attention though. <br><br>7.6/10","user":"KineticSeoul","rank":[7,10]}]
