[{"title":"Born in China","rating":10,"date":"20 February 2020","review":"Born in China is the best Disneynature release since their first film Earth. It is a departure from the one species centered films they have been releasing the last couple of years. Instead, Born in China uses remarkably intimate cinematography and footage to capture the lives of several species living the in the beautifully natural outskirts of China. The four main storylines are all alternately adorable (pandas!) and sometimes tragic and heart-wrenching. Disney weaves its magic in the tales of the families and the film never devolves into overly sentimental and manipulative, which couldn't necessarily be said about Chimpanzee and Bears. Disney also does a good job showing the true Circle of Life consequences, especially during the snow leopard chunk of the story which is also the most emotional. Born in China could have done with a few more facts on the issues of endangerment the creatures face and the idea of global warming, but it isn't a huge deal when the film is this engaging, emotional and beautifully photographed. It is a nice, pleasant Earth Day release that is mercifully brief.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[31,32]},{"title":"\"Born in China\"- Gorgeous imagery with a lack of real substance or information.","rating":6,"date":"6 May 2017","review":"The real shame with Disney's nature documentary \"Born in China\" is that the potential was there for a remarkable film. The imagery captured of both the landscapes and of the beautiful and elusive animals on which it is centered is completely awe-inspiring and never less than completely engrossing and compelling. And it tells the oft-poignant story of what it is like for families and packs of animals in the vast reaches of China, including adorable pandas and stunning snow leopards. Unfortunately, the film's failing is a complete and utter lack of any real substance or information regarding these subjects, which is instead traded for often contrived schmaltz and \"jokey\" narration. For all it does right with the stunning visuals... all else seems forced and a tad bit trite.<br><br>The footage itself is incredible. Especially when viewed on the big screen. Director Lu Chuan and his team of cinematographers and cameramen truly do capture some compelling and beautiful looks into the lives of these animals, and it's a pleasure seeing what it's like for them as they struggle to thrive and survive over the course of just over a year. The most outstanding of course being the snow leopard referred to as \"Dawa\" and her cups, simply because they are such stunning creatures and they face the most adversity and tragedy throughout the film. Chuan and the rest of the crew feverishly document these wonderful creatures to the greatest of extents.<br><br>The problem is that through editing and over-written narration delivered by comedic actor John Krasinski, the entire message seems a bit undermined. I know that it wouldn't work for some, but in my mind, simply showing the footage over music or with only minimal information carefully doled out through brief bits of narration would have worked best. But you get the feeling that Disney's nature department felt they needed to add more of a \"message\" to the film, and it feels tacky and silly. The film starts out promising with some actual key information about China and a pleasant explanation of the symbology involving cranes taking flight... but it quickly becomes an \"Ohh, so cutesy!\" affair with Krasinski \"speaking\" for the animals and inserting odd random jokes while never doling out more than the most basic and bland of facts. This was an opportunity for education, but instead it places too much focus on talking about how much animal-mommies love their animal-babies, and throwing in some really odd references to appease the young children in the audience. (The film likes to constantly remind us that it refers to a clan of Snub-Nose monkeys as the \"Lost Boys\" about once every 30 seconds in certain scenes.) It's borderline condescending. I remember when I was a child watching nature documentaries in school or on television... I wanted to learn. This film instead feels the need to talk down.<br><br>Still, I can't say that this fact ruined the film as a whole. Because it didn't. There's still so much to take in through the 76- minute run-time that I'd definitely give it a mild recommendation, especially to families with young children or general nature enthusiasts. While critical facts are few and far in-between and the over-done narration does drag it down a bit, the footage enclosed is constantly and consistently enthralling and exquisitely captured. And it did save the film for me, and make it an enjoyable watch as an entire cumulative experience. Seeing pandas, snub-nosed monkeys and of course the snow leopards in their natural habitats, living and breathing is just too magical to dismiss over my squabbles with the production.<br><br>I give it a slightly above average 6 out of 10. It could have been better, but there's still just enough to make it worth a watch at least once.","user":"MaximumMadness","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"Oddly disturbing, depressing, disappointing film","rating":5,"date":"27 April 2017","review":"The trailer for \"Born in China\" promised stunning cinematography and a focus on the animals and birds native to China, and advertising for the film prominently featured it was being presented as one of the ongoing \"Disneynature\" series as well. Pre-opening ads also mentioned that if viewers saw the film during opening week some of the profits would go to endangered animals. We decided to support the film during its opening week without having read much about it, hoping for a beautifully-photographed, in-depth documentary on each of the animals and birds featured. However, disappointment settled in early in the film for both of us, when the narrator (who is not credited at the beginning of the film, so we were in the dark as to who it was) clearly was not the right choice for this type of narration. You know how some narrators are like great storytellers, drawing you in with their voice because they sound so fascinated with, and curious about, the subject matter? This narrator immediately struck both of us as an amateur, and you could practically see him in a recording booth just reading the material rote, almost as if he wasn't watching the actual footage of the film as he was doing so. He never got better, and I was genuinely surprised to learn he turned out to be John Krasinski of TV's \"The Office,\" who displayed a lot more life and vitality on that show than he does here. He wasn't the only problem, though, as the film is far too short, skipping between seasons of the year too quickly, and, while I appreciated the fact (to a degree) the film showed just how harsh real life can be for animals and birds in the wild, some of the more gruesome killings and deaths seemed too much a focus of the film. The genuine overall wonder of how the balance of life plays out in the wild seemed less an inspiration for the filmmakers than just how grim the wild can be. We both came away feeling like the filmmakers rather enjoyed their depictions of baby monkeys being plucked from their families by birds of prey and a snow leopard mom who freezes to death after being injured during a hunt, and that they were less impressed by the more upbeat and miraculous aspects of life in the wild. I'm all for showing a balance, but, as one example, this film left us wondering what happened to the two snow leopard cubs orphaned by their mom's death. The narration tries to imply hope that they survived (vaguely), but logic says otherwise, and you then find yourself wondering why the large crew depicted in the credits (local guides and filmmakers plus their crews) didn't then intervene to rescue the cubs so they could live out their lives instead of dying of starvation. The credits leave you with jokey moments with a camera operator who is waiting out a storm for a perfect shot of his surroundings rather than answering any of the many questions you're left with at the film's (too soon) ending. After viewing we discovered the film was only about 80 minutes long, and we felt cheated on multiple levels. We'll be cautious at paying to see Disneynature films in theaters in the future. On a final note, I had a difficult time coming up with an overall rating for the film, and settled on a \"5 out of 10\" only because most of the cinematography is genuinely, undeniably stunning, and it did feel at times very moving to witness up-close the lives these beautiful animals and birds we share the planet with live every day. Unfortunately, the filmmakers' apparent interests in featuring the harsher realities of life in the wild overshadowed the wonder and miracle of it all--and their lack of follow-up in the closing credits as to what happened to their subjects (particularly the orphaned snow leopard cubs) while focusing instead on jokey material about the filmmakers left us with a sour, depressed feeling on exit.","user":"2001ASOfan","rank":[10,14]}]
