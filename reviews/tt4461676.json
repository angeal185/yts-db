[{"title":"A movie you just see!","rating":9,"date":"25 September 2019","review":"So many movies out now are Super hero or CGI movies. It's nice to see a movie with a great story and relatable. When you move to a new city you are looking for a sense of community. Great characters and relationships.\nReally liked the leads relationship and the random drunk guy.","user":"mingift","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"So LA","rating":9,"date":"16 September 2019","review":"Loved this film!
