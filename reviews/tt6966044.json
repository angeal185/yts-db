[{"title":"Intimate and full of suspense","rating":7,"date":"29 December 2019","review":"There were two reviews here at the time we decided to try it - one really bad, one mediocre. We decided to give it a try and see how far we watched. In the event, we watched the whole movie and enjoyed it. It was well acted, the storyline kept us interested and the single camera approach made it feel intimate and full of suspense.","user":"ListenToChris","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Impressive, but...","rating":6,"date":"26 December 2019","review":"I like the idea of the main character doing this with no script or guidance, that's perfect for an amnesia victim.\nBut all the supporting characters should have been given more. Them bumbling about was completely aparant and took me out of the story.\nOverall this was really well done, aside from that.","user":"shortecrx","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Conspiracy BS","rating":2,"date":"25 December 2019","review":"This is what you get with a low budget, terrible actors and a plot that a 4 year old could write.\nFrom the opening scene with a amnesiac neurotic woman you know this going to be dross.\nIf Jason Bourne had been in this he would have ended it after 10 minutes and spared us torturing ourselves watching it.\nDon't do it, the worst conspiracy film I have ever seen and I love this genre.","user":"pkdyer6519","rank":[3,6]}]
