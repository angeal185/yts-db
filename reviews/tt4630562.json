[{"title":"Good","rating":6,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"There are some amazing scenes, and the talented cast has fantastic chemistry, and as always the action is loud enough, but the story, character development and plot are somewhat lacking.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[40,42]},{"title":"Cringefest - Stupidity level 11","rating":1,"date":"18 June 2017","review":"This was painful. Action? Yes, but we're talking Physics that Sharknado would be ashamed of. Failure to understand or accept how reality works, even at a basic level. If you know the basics of cars, computers or physics, this will inflict pain to your brain.<br><br>No part of this movie made sense, it makes all 7 prequels seem like a real life documentary about cars. By far - Worst of the series. By going so far off the deep end, it made it too improbable for me to enjoy.","user":"satanclaw","rank":[335,459]},{"title":"The worst movie of the series","rating":1,"date":"25 June 2017","review":"This is my first review on IMDb and I'm only writing this because so many reviews are praising this movie! I knew it would be average but within the first 10 minutes I realised how horrible this movie was. From winning a race in reverse gear of a wrecked car to driving ahead of an army without a single bullet hitting them. I know this series has always had over the top action but this plain nonsense. As somebody else said in their review the heists didn't need cars in the first place. I only liked the action sequences between Dwayne and Jason, rest were unwatchable! I feel bad for the people praising this movie.","user":"stevemartis","rank":[230,326]}]
