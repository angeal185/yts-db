[{"title":"A glimpse of stalking","rating":11,"date":"11 September 2004","review":"I've just come back from seeing what I think is one of the best movies of 2004. I found the story fascinating, the look stylish, and the music haunting.<br><br>\"Wicker Park\" is a tale of obsession on many levels. It is told partly in flashback, so that you have to piece the events together and figure out how far back the action of the film began -- what is now and what was then. The director uses split-screen techniques that enhance the look and feel of the film, lifting it from the realm of the ordinary to the plane of art. A haunting theme weaves its way through this labyrinth of lies, leading to a satisfying (because inevitable) conclusion.<br><br>I saw the film with two friends who were of a very different opinion. They found the film \"convoluted\" and \"clichéd\". I disagree. It was easy to tell what was flashback and what was here-and-now. But the story is complicated (not convoluted) and does require some sorting out. As for being cliched, I found the film quite the opposite. It could have gone in some trite, hackneyed directions but didn't. And while some people might think the ending is the cliché of all clichés, I thought that, emotionally, it was absolutely right and the only possible way to end the film.<br><br>I loved \"Wicker Park\" so much that I would willingly see it again, to get a better sense of how the story is put together, and just for the sheer pleasure of its look and sound. You might say I too am obsessed.","user":"livewire-6","rank":[189,228]},{"title":"Agree -- better than expected!","rating":8,"date":"26 December 2004","review":"I hadn't heard of this film before seeing it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was suspenseful, even \"gripping\", with a touching and romantic plot. Overall, a movie definitely worth renting.<br><br>The film begins a bit slowly but picks up very nicely about 30 minutes into it. There are a few twists and turns that will keep your attention. The acting was quite good, albeit with little-known actors except for Josh Hartnett of Blackhawk Down. <br><br>The best part of this film was the clever way the story all comes together towards the end, including the flashback style which was very well done.","user":"mei-7","rank":[131,157]},{"title":"An underrated masterpiece.","rating":9,"date":"2 March 2008","review":"Exceeded my large expectations. One of the best films of 2004 with my personal Oscar win for Best Actress. It's an extremely compelling and unique mystery thriller with intricate characters and a storyline that could easily become absurd and convoluted but feels natural and McGuigan allows the viewer to be fully aware of what's happening. It never gets too far ahead of the audience but it doesn't drag for a second. The editing is flawless and meshes the present with the not-so-distant past perfectly. Josh Hartnett delivers a surprisingly emotional performance and adds another strong performance to his recent resume that has really transcended him from the horrific heartthrob clique he was placed in when he first came onto the scene into a serious, talented actor. But the real star of the film is the beautiful Rose Byrne who, as always, delivers a knockout performance that is easily one of the best of the decade. She takes this psychopathic character and somehow makes her immensely sympathetic. I actually found myself rooting for her to be with Matt. Simply with her eyes she portrays this wounded, internally saddened character effortlessly. As I always am when seeing her act, I was completely entranced and amazed. A stunning performance in a brilliant film.","user":"dead47548","rank":[42,50]}]
