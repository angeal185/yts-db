[{"title":"A Groovy Little Gem","rating":10,"date":"30 June 2019","review":"A wonderful film of trying to reach a dream. Everything about this film is magical, relatable and even nostalgic. Now, I'm a '90s baby, but it felt so genuine and from the heart that you could really imagine yourself in the '60s. One of my personal highlights would be the film's soundtrack, both original and classic rock tunes are sprinkled throughout, adding to the groovy atmosphere.<br><br>This movie is like a tall glass of lemonade on a hot, humid afternoon - it's a welcomed break from all the crap that's been pumping through Hollywood recently. In a sea of sequels and reboots, it's nice to see something sweet, simple and original.","user":"wgow01","rank":[15,30]},{"title":"There is no woodstock","rating":3,"date":"29 August 2019","review":"The movie may just as well have been titled; Isle of Wight or Bust","user":"ggt667","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"100/10 Beautiful Film","rating":10,"date":"26 August 2019","review":"Such an amazing film that does a wonderful job showing the ups and downs of a high school friendship. Along with showing what the pros and cons are to following your dreams. A great coming of age movie.","user":"leslie-68250","rank":[5,13]}]
