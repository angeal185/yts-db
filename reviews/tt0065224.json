[{"title":"A wonderful little film, if you can find it.","rating":9,"date":"29 October 2000","review":"Well, I just saw a restored print of this at the Screening room.  It is a marvelous piece, light and yet moving, filled with wonderful visuals, a great performance by Jack McGowran and a marvelous (and unfortunately out-of-print) score by everyone's favorite Beatle, George. The synopsis above just doesn't do justice to the film.  Yes, it's about a daffy old guy who peers in on a lovely young woman living next door, but there's nothing creepy or pathetic about it.  In fact, he's actually quite a bit a of a dashing and romantic figure in his own detached, weird way.  One of the most notable things about the film is the art direction, done by the band/art collective The Fool.  An obscure folk group (sort of a lesser Incredible String Band) they made the most of what was most likely a thin budget by pouring every ounce of energy into creating two amazing sets for the adjacent apartments of the old man and the young model.  They are, without a doubt, two of the coolest looking places to live I have ever seen in a movie (I would give my eye-teeth to live in either one of those flats) and they form as much of a part of the main characters as the portrayal by the actors themselves.  The old scientist lives in Celtic-Medieval warren, inspired by Pre-Raphaelite design, and the young model lives in a mod Sixties psychedelic/glam environment suffused with overtones of 20's/30's nostalgia. Both apartments then are filled with a yearning for the past and so, the old man becomes no more of a romanticist than the girl, despite his age. He is actually quite dashing in his cape and tuxedo when engaging in some of his later escapades, like some bandit out of a Fantomas picture.  No, this movie isn't about a pathetic old guy lusting after a lithe young thing. It's about a few other things more interesting and perhaps more touching, but you'll have to find out for yourself.  In any case it's a nice little treat worth finding, if you can.","user":"sfried","rank":[41,48]},{"title":"Psychedelic Oddyssey","rating":8,"date":"19 December 2008","review":"Wonderwall is certainly a period piece from 1968. The plot concerns a lonely old college professor,played by Jack McGowan, who periodically spies on his attractive,young fashion model,played by Jane Berkin (star of many a French film),thru a hole in the wall. The professor starts to drill more holes in his wall,so he can view her from various perspectives. The film earns it's kudos from it's production values,it's use of colour (the professor's flat is a dreary,colourless one,while the model's flat is a burst of psychedelic colours). This little seen film fared poorly in the U.K. &amp; even worse in the U.S.,before it was promptly forgotten in the dustbin of ignored films. Pity....it would have made for a most fitting addition to the rank of midnight movies in the early to mid 1970's. One didn't have to partake of various mind expanding drugs to enjoy this odd little film, but it sure didn't hurt. The film's director was Joe Massot,who would be more recognized nearly a decade later as the co-director of 'Led Zepplin:The Song Remains The Same' (he directed the \"fantasy\" sequences featuring the members of Led Zepplin,as well as their then manager,Peter Grant, that for some managed to pad the film out way beyond it's two hour,plus running time). The most notable aspect of this film is the musical score,which was composed by George Harrison,who wanted it to sound as much anti Beatle as possible (and succeeded). A brand new print of this forgotten film was re-discovered a few years back,restored with a punchy sounding soundtrack &amp; re-released. Worth seeking out. No MPAA rating here,but contains a bit of peek-a-boo nudity &amp; adult situations which could have earned it an 'R' rating back in 1968","user":"Seamus2829","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"THE psychedelic masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"1 June 2005","review":"for me, the psychedelic equivalent of Citizen Kane must either be Wonderwall or else Conrad Rooks' Chappaqua. this film must be THE psychedelic masterpiece. it comes with incredible credentials. just check the credits. i was recently watching it with james t. rao (from the band Orange Cake Mix) &amp; he said, \"wow, this must be the BEST psychedelic film!\" &amp; we've watched almost EVERY film of this genre. don't take LSD &amp; watch the film. or DO take LSD &amp; watch the film. you'll find very little difference. the plot is touching &amp; sentimental but with an edge. the \"message\" of this wonderful art film is complex &amp; multi-layered &amp; manifold. watch it a few times &amp; see new things each time. \"it's the lanolin that does it.\" the color is gorgeous. the DVD extras are incredible &amp; include the director's first film (a short).<br><br>-bobby cormier","user":"bobbycormier","rank":[26,39]}]
