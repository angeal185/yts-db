[{"title":"Average but okay","rating":6,"date":"23 April 2017","review":"It is a very average animated movie. It is not among the best, but it is not painful to watch either. It loosely copies an ocean eleven formula, but with various critters.<br><br>The animation is well below average though. It can look very cheap at times.","user":"imdb-14931","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Who thought this was a good idea?","rating":1,"date":"18 June 2018","review":"The squirrel and snake had boobs. I lowkey wanna die after watching this. A typical straight to DVD film found at the dollar store. Probably should find a different film to watch. -_- I would rate this 0 if possible.","user":"imabaldcupcake","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Fun!","rating":10,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"When I first saw this movie, about a year ago, I was not certain how much I liked it. It was nice, and the story moved along well, but I was distracted by the animation. I did not think I cared much for how it was animated. But after a year, I watched it again and much to my surprise, I really enjoyed it! I have been a fan of animation for a while (being an amateur cartoonist myself) and I am fascinated by the strides taken in this area over the past twenty years. Not every animated movie need look the same. In fact, it would be pretty boring if they did. I found myself loving the characters this time. I thought character was particularly well developed. Now I was not distracted by the thought of the animation itself, I began to notice a lot of little touches (very cute) that had escaped me in my first perusal. I enjoy this movie so much, I don't mind watching it over again. That's when I know I truly like a movie.","user":"Roadie2","rank":[1,2]}]
