[{"title":"AMAZING....not one minute wasted","rating":10,"date":"10 March 2020","review":"I have read some of the reviews, and I really think some of these low informed people leaving their opinions, just don't get this film. IT IS NOT HORROR. It's a pyscho- thriller, and its more of a thinking man's film. Something the previous two reviewers lack. They don't have an original thought. These are the same people that think Texas Chainsaw remake was good. If that's the case, this is the wrong film for you. This movie tests you early on, thanks to clever writing, eye for detail and lastly, excellent performances by all involved. This director is really onto something, and the last 10-15 minutes literally have you on the edge of your seat. Fantastic film. Masterfully directed. Don't sit this one out.","user":"locklip","rank":[56,84]},{"title":"incredible film....on so many layers","rating":9,"date":"4 December 2019","review":"I was lucky enough to see this film at a festival in Buffalo, and the audience was buzzing when it was over. A fantastic slow burn indie, keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. The two leads were fantastic, as was the entire cast. I have no clue what the first reviewer was watching, but he seemed pretty engaged to only give it two stars??? Odd. This movie was made with pure passion.....you can tell. Beautifully written and directed, with eerie undertones. One of the things I loved about it, is how it unfolds, and how it plays out like you're on this journey with this couple. You'll NEVER see the end coming.....NEVER. Brilliant work from a director to keep your eye on.","user":"danielsroberta","rank":[57,94]},{"title":"I hope that the movie will be completed with another film","rating":7,"date":"14 March 2020","review":"Very interesting, worthy of the follower. The story was great. I hope that the movie will be completed with another film to achieve more about the crime that happened.","user":"iamuzmakinaruto","rank":[22,33]}]
