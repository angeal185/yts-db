[{"title":"Great","rating":10,"date":"3 February 2020","review":"V.I.P.\" is an impressive action crime thriller, which includes all elements that made the genre a huge success internationally.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[37,39]},{"title":"Mediocre for Korean standards","rating":5,"date":"11 January 2018","review":"While the cast for the roles is superb this movie lacks considerably in plot.<br><br>The storyline is weak with no suspense and 1 or 2 tiny plot twists that aren't that interesting. To be honest the situations the stars get into are far from the reality anyone could have in mind. In short 3 different parties want to capture a serial killer that is the son of a high ranking official. There is no hunt whatsoever though since he literally does not try to evade them at all. <br><br>The action in the movie is almost non existent with the exception of literally only 2 scenes.<br><br>Felt greatly disappointed since Korean movies are usually fantastic in this genre. <br><br>5 / 10 stars only for the casting and the length of the movie","user":"leviathantv","rank":[15,31]},{"title":"Great acting.

By the second half of the movie, there were twist and turns happened made things a lot better.</li><li>You would get really mad at most of the scenes but the ending was very good. </li><li>There are so many morbid/brutal scenes. I almost stopped watching in the beginning because of it.</li><li>Action scenes were really good and intense.</li><li>I was shocked to see Peter Stormare (Lucifer from Constantine movie) here.</li><li>I was really amazed at Lee Jong Suk here because he was so scary at some of the scenes. This is the first time I saw him as a villain and he did a great job especially since his previous characters were good guys.</li><li>Jang Dong Gun and Kim Myung-min were amazing in their respective roles.</li></ul><br><br>SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Your choice.
