[{"title":"Fitting Final Showcase for Paul Walker, the Actor","rating":7,"date":"4 December 2013","review":"I will admit that I would probably not watched this movie if Paul Walker had not tragically passed away last Sunday. Prior to this, I only knew about Walker from the \"Fast and Furious\" films. This quiet little film certainly introduced me to a whole new and better Paul Walker.<br><br>\"Hours\" is about Nolan Hayes. His wife Abby was rushed into a hospital because of premature labor minutes before Hurricane Katrina hit their city. Difficulties pile up on Nolan as the hospital is evacuated, but he could not leave because his newborn daughter is hooked on a ventilator while in an incubator. Nolan had to deal the power outage, malfunctioning battery, food shortage, violent looters, and abject loneliness as he is trapped in desperate isolation.<br><br>The production values of this film are obviously low budget and the supporting cast may be mediocre. But there is no denying \"Hours\" is an incredible one-man show for Paul Walker, the actor. Very few actors have attempted this sort of project where basically there is only one character. Tom Hanks did it in \"Cast Away\" and Sandra Bullock did it in \"Gravity\", and now this project for Paul Walker. <br><br>I have to say that Walker surpassed my expectations and actually pulled it off very well with a very memorable performance. You can feel his frustration and his desperation as the hours pass hopelessly and endlessly. The tears that rolled down his face all look like they came from very deep emotions welling within him. The final scene was a thing of absolute beauty which alone elevates the entire film to a higher level. <br><br>With this film, we will see the breadth and depth of Walker's true acting talent, now lost in that horrific car crash. Fortunately, he was still able to release this one special film to forever remind us of his abilities which we will now be missing.","user":"3xHCCH","rank":[70,77]},{"title":"Should not have a such a low rating; this film is great.","rating":8,"date":"15 November 2013","review":"This film in a sentence: What a father will do to keep his premature daughter alive, when the world is falling down around him.<br><br>Why this film isn't receiving a better rating I won't know. This is the best acting from Paul Walker I think anyone will have seen. Just watch it (especially if you thought 'The Impossible' was a great piece of film)<br><br>One of the core roles a man feels he needs to provide for his family is protection and to provide; this film shows this by putting Nolan (Walker) in scenarios where you feel his struggle to keep the only thing he has safe.","user":"casiosx","rank":[103,128]},{"title":"Paul Walker was excellent in his role","rating":10,"date":"2 December 2013","review":"I watched this movie weeks before Paul Walker had passed and thoroughly enjoyed it. I must admit I've always been a fan of his. Yet I can indisputably say without being biased, that he played this role with excellence.<br><br>OK, so the move was not a fast paced action or romantic, date flick, but it was a well written realistic Drama / Thriller.<br><br>While the ending may have been somewhat predictable. The rest of the film with it's characters and plots certainly was not. You will find quite a few surprises.<br><br>I am sure it will do well if/when it's released in theaters around the world. What a great way to pay tribute to him by releasing it to as many screens as they can. At least I really hope they do. If you can't go to see it. I'd say it's worth renting anyway.","user":"badttboy","rank":[51,64]}]
