[{"title":"We need more movies like this!","rating":10,"date":"3 November 2018","review":"We just happened upon this movies. Zero publicity/marketing. We didn't even know it was showing in the theater because it wasn't even listed at the theatre. One showing for one day in Harrisburg, PA. Yet I see 10000 commercials for garbage movies full of evil, murder, blood, guts, torture and on and on... Our world is upside down. We need more movies with real messages.","user":"psudiva-19936","rank":[16,30]},{"title":"God is Great","rating":10,"date":"2 November 2018","review":"Moving film about love, loss and life !
