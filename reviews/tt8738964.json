[{"title":"Sins of the Catholic Church","rating":8,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"A film famous ahead of its release and obviously judged as well.<br><br>In Poland, there are 2 main extreme ways we are forced to think of this film:\neither as a direct, unjustified and blunt attack of satan worshippers on the Catholic Church in Poland or as a just and the only true image of what is hidden from secular eyes, and oh boy it is a satan worshippers organization.\nWhere, to my mind, after just watching this in a theatre, neither of above is true.<br><br>Knowing Smarzowski's (the director) old films I was expecting more pessimistic and negatively shaped image of the Polish clergy. Of course, the film shows lots of sins of the priests but it also tries to understand the background of the situation. All of our priests-protagonists are built like humans who make errors but also are often tangled in the strings of the system that is a way stronger than them (apart from sexual abuse, this I cannot blame on anyone else than the offenders themselves). Often they show the will to do good deeds, but not always the intentions turn as they would wish. Some of the events seem a bit made up (the way the archibishop speaks his \"true mind\" is a bit cartoonish) and also implies that the higher we get in hierarchy, the worse the priests are. Which to me seems a little bit oversimplified.<br><br>To the things I could complain about I would add the fact that this film also lacks a really developed female characters (the part of Joanna Kulig is rather small, and yet being important character for the plot, she is barely present on the screen). Please, stop thinking I am some crazy SJW. I just think a woman perspective (for example a protagonist nun character) would also help to show the state of the Polish Clergy which I believe was the aim of the filmmakers.<br><br>An important note to add is that the film doesn't touch the topic of God/faith/religious matters. It is not about that. It shows the sins of the Catholic Church by showing its people, their stories and their method of coping with the fact that the system is far from being good. Also, sexual abuse in and out the clergy is thrown here as the subtopic but of course it takes the prominence due to its weight.<br><br>The films is well made (except for some live-footage bits which are a bit out of place) and actors work is superb. I highly recommend this film. It has its problems (oversimplification as in every other Smarzowski's film) but it is a very important voice in the discussion that, I believe, is aimed to heal the Polish Church, not to destroy it.","user":"neofita","rank":[34,45]},{"title":"WARNING, this is not comedy. Great film however.","rating":8,"date":"23 October 2018","review":"This is listed as a comedic film but quite frankly I have never seen anything less comic. Don't get me wrong it is a fantastic film and very powerful. But please label this correctly to people or I'm afraid this could be an issue.","user":"davidcarden2","rank":[27,35]},{"title":"This movie shows the truth...","rating":8,"date":"12 March 2019","review":"As a Pole I can say that what you will see is quite possible to happen every day in Poland. However, if you will watch this movie carefully you will see that not all priests are bad, just like not every human being is bad. Most of Polish reviews criticize this movie for \"witch hunting\" of priests in Poland. I think those people saw a wrong movie because it clearly shows two sides of a coin. Watch open minded, I am sure you will see a value in it.","user":"Crematory","rank":[11,13]}]
