[{"title":"Vulnerable","rating":9,"date":"29 July 2018","review":"This film had broad international production support including several European countries. Filmed and storied out of Tunisia it's message has broad application to all countries where power and authority bullies &amp; threatens individual rights even so far as terrorizing their citizens. We have institutionalized political &amp; religious brutality in this film as a female college student attending a school party encounters the police. Her quest for justice is hampered by being a liberal female in a conservative country. Kafkaesque, but is there still hope? Despite the verbal/physical battering by police her resoluteness grows, but again perhaps too late. \nIntelligently written &amp; directed, but it's the acting (often non-verbal) by Mariam Al Ferjan that engages &amp; captures your attention, and worthy of an award.","user":"westsideschl","rank":[24,32]},{"title":"good ''horror'' film, realistic, about woman being abused","rating":7,"date":"13 June 2019","review":"I saw most of it on TV. It's about the struggles of a woman who was abused one night and tries to get justice, but shows how corrupt the system is. And how frightening it is, especially in a poor 3rd world country. It lacks the feminist propaganda nonsense, and it's quite realistic in my opinion. Definitely a must watch for young girls who don't value their own safety and go alone during the night, thinking that nothing can happen to them. And there's TONS of such girls.<br><br>I hope I didn't give out too much spoiler/information about the movie<br><br>American horror movies are 1/10 crap compared to this. They're worthless.","user":"llVIU","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Rape","rating":21,"date":"21 October 2017","review":"The unbearable story of a young Tunisian woman who is raped by some policemen before she goes to complain to the nearest police station. Useless to say that this fight is lost in advance. How could it be else in a country where women are considered after the camel? This a real painful but so realistic tale. I heard some people in the audience be very uncomfortable, groaning. I myself felt dizzy. A true masterpiece worth seeing at all cost.","user":"searchanddestroy-1","rank":[16,26]}]
