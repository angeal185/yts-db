[{"title":"If you were forced to watch home movies...","rating":1,"date":"2 February 2019","review":"This entire thing was like being forced to watch your most annoying friends travel videos from their boring road trip that you had originally declined to go on for that very reason. The only catch is that you don't know these people so you can't even make fun of them behind their backs. I wish I was exaggerating. But it's almost two hours of looking out a car window. That's not a spoiler, unless you think talking about your carpool home is a spoiler.","user":"jacqueline-clarke","rank":[48,50]},{"title":"You'd rather watch paint dry, believe me.","rating":1,"date":"25 January 2019","review":"Don't even know where to begin.. this was one of those \"movies\" (if you want to call it that?) where if you were to give a 10 year old a camera, he'd do a better job with a more compelling story-line.<br><br>The main characters cannot act what so ever, it is just pure dog s**t<br><br>This is just so bad, I can't even think to write this review.\nPlease stop making movies.","user":"cenkz","rank":[58,62]},{"title":"Really bad","rating":2,"date":"25 January 2019","review":"This movie could have been made into a ten minute video and not missed a thing. The last ten minutes was the only part even worth filming. The rest is the same as me taking a video grocery shopping or to Walmart. Maybe picking out new carpet would even be better or doing laundry! The characters were pretty funny but not worth wasting my time watching. I should have listened to the other reviewers but the title said shadow people so I had to watch. Don't make the same mistake! If I had paid to see this I would really be pissed!","user":"Dave_douell","rank":[46,49]}]
