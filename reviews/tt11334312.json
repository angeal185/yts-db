[{"title":"Seriously not bad at all for an Asylum film","rating":4,"date":"9 January 2020","review":"Honestly viewers are rating this too seriously. You have to keep in mind the film was probably shot on a budget of less than a million so with that in mind it wasn't too bad. Obviously you're not gonna get academy award winning acting and the special effects can't compare to Jumanji which has a production budget of a hundred million but if you watch it for the tongue in cheek comedy that it is then it's not too bad. The story is lame but that's to be expected. Jumanji doesn't exactly have a great story either. I saw Jumanji 1 and 2 and thought both the stories weren't exactly great so I'm not going to be overly critical of this low budget version. It's silly fun for what it is. What drew me to this movie was I wanted to see what they could do with such a limited budget as a Jumanji type of movie requires quite a bit of CGI. Plus it's great to see Bai Ling in the cast. As my expectations were low it was mostly met with a basic story, campy dialogue and silly fight sequences. All in all not too bad. Lower your expectations and give it a chance. This is also one of Asylum better films. Many of their films are unwatchable but this one is tolerable.","user":"Only_Honest_Review","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Just a cash grab","rating":1,"date":"13 December 2019","review":"The real jumanji is coming out this weekend so what better time to release this pile of ****. Bad acting, bad cgi, sub-par dialogue. The asylum has done it again, when you thought they couldn't do worse, they hit another home run with this train wreck of a movie. Well done. Please, don't waste your money, rent something from a studio that actually cares about movies.","user":"hlucas3","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"Not brilliant, but not that bad","rating":6,"date":"15 December 2019","review":"The obvious aim of this movie was to imitate the Jumanji movie, it tried. The acting was just ok. The character dress codes for each level were easy on the eye, so thanks for that. The reproduction of computer game mechanics were done to a satisfactory level, even with dorky bouncing stance when ready for action. Parts of the movie could have been left out or shortened, I found myself rolling my eyes and grabbing for the remote to fast forward. However, I did resist and watched it all. Don't expect lots, it is a B grade movie, a drink or two may assist with the watching process, enjoy the eye candy.","user":"staunton-gary","rank":[4,9]}]
