[{"title":"One guy and his video camera","rating":4,"date":"11 March 2017","review":"TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOUR is a simple found footage-style horror film in the style of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT in that the terrors are all unseen and of the psychological variety. The film is in essence the video diary of a sole hunter as he ventures into the Montana woods and soon finds himself assailed by both vengeful hunters and a supernatural force.<br><br>First things first: it turns out that this is an Irish production, and I had no idea until checking online. It's completely convincing as an American film, the Irish woods stand in well for Montana, and Ronan Murphy nails his accent perfectly. In terms of authenticity this gets a ten out of ten.<br><br>Otherwise, it's rather sluggish and really suffers from a lack of incident; there's only so much of one guy talking into a camera that a viewer can take. It's lucky that the landscapes are picturesque. There is some atmosphere built up along the way but the ending is too abrupt and there's no real sense of menace, either; things never get nasty enough for this viewer.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":2,"date":"25 February 2020","review":"I made an account just to write this review... how it had a 6.0 when I viewed it, I will never know.<br><br>It's basically a low quality, self shot youtube survival \"show\" by a guy who is terrible at it... and them scary things start happening while he runs around lost in the forest.<br><br>I guess for a 500$ budget it was OK, but I wish I read an honest review like mine and saved myself almost 2 hours of wasted time.","user":"dhadikin","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"Nice talking..","rating":2,"date":"15 March 2020","review":"A guy talking through the whole film to create the tense atmosphere but he becomes a bit unbearable. All mystery is solved at the very end with two pictures.","user":"fernandojose-25371","rank":[2,3]}]
