Instead it's a literally wound to your life and time.<br><br>The storyline is so jumbled and a mess, not even Armie can save it. We honestly have no clue about the plot except there was some kind of ritual.<br><br>There was no explanation of why Rick was the portal for whatever came out of him at the end; we could barely see it because of the stupid CGI cockroaches covering the screen at the end.<br><br>No explanation why Armie's character was chose and no reason why Carrie was the only one affected by the internet tunnel of hell..I suppose?<br><br>And finally, what was the purpose of the college kids? To drop the phone and send messages with ZERO context?<br><br>When you do realize that the ritual was performed based on some books, you are never told what happened and why it happened.<br><br>This movie is garbage.","user":"chazzatl73","rank":[313,368]},{"title":"Bad.","rating":1,"date":"19 October 2019","review":"Had no clue what was going on throughout the whole film and the characters were so boring. The only reason I watched until the end was in hopes of finding out what it was all about- but nope didnt happen.","user":"zdog-36810","rank":[230,275]}]
