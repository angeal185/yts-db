[{"title":"Horrible movie","rating":1,"date":"26 March 2015","review":"I'm not real picky about movies having to be 100% accurate. I don't care if space ships go woooosh in a vacuum. But I would like the movie to have at least a shred of believability. This has none. The visual effects are horrid and don't even remotely resemble what happens in a major quake. Buildings do NOT split up the middle. And the reaction of the people was hilarious. Was this supposed to be a comedy. People on the top floors of office buildings are running down the stairs, while the quake is in progress. If you've ever experienced a 6+ quake, and we have to assume \"the big one\" would be much worse, you are doing good to stand up, much less walk. Running down stairs would be impossible. Plus, you'd think people in LA would know what to do in a quake. The biggest danger is falling objects. Rule #1 - stay put and get under something heavy if possible. Don't run down the hall yelling \"What's happening?\" over and over. It's LA. It's called an earth quake. And the guy jumps in his car and tries to drive across the city to get to his girl friend. While the quake is in progress. Really? This movie would have to improve to be bad.","user":"pmstone3","rank":[61,71]},{"title":"A disaster of a movie, one to be watched at your own risk","rating":1,"date":"11 August 2015","review":"LA Apocalypse is not quite down there with SyFy's all-time worst, but that doesn't stop it from being a disaster in every way.<br><br>Apart from some nice scenery, the movie is not particularly well-made visually, it has a very drab look, the action and disaster scenes are shot chaotically and the best the special effects get is substandard, which is indication of how cheap, out-of-proportion (very anaemic and non-threatening) and sometimes unfinished-looking they are. The music is like a loud monotonous drone with little sense of atmosphere.<br><br>There's nothing remotely believable in the dialogue either, it's basically 80 minutes or so of mind-numbing cheese, improbable sci-fi (that constantly sounded as if made up on the spot) and tedious dramatic padding that leads nowhere and adds little. The story is basically a dull rehash of previous sci-fi disaster movies, except with even more cheese and even less suspense or fun. The lack of originality, believability or even anything just made LA Apocalypse a tiring watch and is topped by a muddled and predictable kidnap-and-rescue plot. The disaster scenes on top of looking cheap are so silly and indifferent (falling objects being the worst it gets) that it comes at the expense of any fun or tension.<br><br>Every single character is little more than personality-less stereotypes, the movie is flatly directed and the acting is very bad at best across the board. David Cade is stiff, Gina Holden's acting lacks emotion and the villains are over-the-top to the point of being insipid. Even Christopher Judge is lacklustre.<br><br>Overall, a disaster movie that manages to be a disaster of a movie as well. Watch at own risk. 1/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Not bad at all","rating":5,"date":"12 January 2017","review":"This film exceeded expectations based on the average ratings. At least there is very little padding scenes and the main story and action starts pretty much right away which makes a nice change for these budget films.<br><br>And whilst the CGI effects are pretty standard for these budget films these days they still put quite some efforts into showing as much CGI destruction scenes as you would expect in any major disaster film. Which for a budget film was great to see instead of the CGI action light scenes and a more claustrophobic feel you can find in cheap disaster film. You at least get a scale of size with this films.<br><br>CGI, whilst quite regular and fairly big scale, they could have tried using more finer particle effects in falling buildings and debris than they did. As it would have given a far great element to detail and realism to many destruction scenes. As I often felt it was almost like watching partially SD effects on HD footage such was the lack of fine detail in some of the CGI effects.<br><br>Acting was fairly good, if standard, and the overall story passable. Overall an acceptable TV disaster film that's worth a good 5/10 for me.","user":"dave-70421","rank":[4,4]}]
