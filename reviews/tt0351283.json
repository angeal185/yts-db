[{"title":"Madagascar","rating":8,"date":"17 February 2020","review":"A great story of friendship and survival where an animal escapes from the zoo and his friends go to pick it up but everything goes wrong. The plot and their misadventures are quite original and the whole thing is rendered very well and generates great fun","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[37,38]},{"title":"I've Seen Better And Worse. Overall, It Is A Decent Kids Movie That Can Hold Adults Attention As Well.","rating":7,"date":"7 June 2005","review":"Let's face it, it's hard to put out a good animation movie that is equal to Shrek, The Incredibles or Finding Nemo. Those are hard movies to follow but Madagascar is by no means a bad movie. In fact, I will still rate this pretty high, as I enjoyed it without watching the clock.<br><br>The plot was very easy for children to follow while not so simplistic that adults become bored in the middle. The simple plot was that 4 animals raised in a zoo venture out into the wild and quickly realize how easy they had it back home in the New York Zoo.<br><br>There was quite a few humorous scenes in Madagascar, but my favorite has to be the \"distinguished\" chimps who get offended that the thought of looking or smelling like a monkey is bad. An honorable mention is the penguins who also got more than they bargained for in Antarctica.<br><br>While some of the graphics are sub-par to other movies I've mentioned, like Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) for instance. At times they look sort of like clay-mation or something, and other they look positively life-like. The scenery and the lemurs stand out as the most beautifully rendered parts of the movie.<br><br>This movie is great for getting the kids out of the house and not too bad if the normal adult wants to get away and enjoy something more suitable for the family as well.","user":"BraveHawk","rank":[106,146]},{"title":"Madagascar - a great ride!","rating":8,"date":"29 May 2005","review":"Lots of fun - I saw it with the grandkids and a theater full of families. a great time was had by all. technically speaking, one might say that the story was 'uneven' in places (can you say *that* about animated films? (-:) -- I mention this because there has been some needlessly negative feedback here at IMDb. On the whole, though, the presentation is quick-paced, bright, happy, and delightful to the eyes and ears. There are also some unique, quirky scenes (i.e. animals nonchalantly getting on a subway?) - I love to see stuff I haven't seen before. that's not easy to do, you know - by all accounts, \"everything has been done on film already..\" - (if you catch my drift). so, give credit when due! enjoy!(-:","user":"canuckteach","rank":[125,185]}]
