[{"title":"Voter fraud","rating":3,"date":"1 May 2018","review":"How the hell does this have a 9 rating. I gave it a 3 which is only because of the ending. This moving is boring, confusing and poorly acted. Thank God it only cost be $0.99 on Amazon. Still a waste of money though.","user":"Randall-Flagg01","rank":[26,33]},{"title":"Complete Garbage","rating":1,"date":"11 May 2018","review":"IMDB Really needs to crack down on these fake scores; obviously rated by the cast and crew of this completely garbage movie. <br><br>The effects arent the worst thing in the world; but the acting is absolutely atrocious. Its so bad it makes lifetime or scyfy asylum movies look oscar worthy. <br><br>The storyline is a complete joke; absolutely nothing original. <br><br>But its the acting that you just cant get passed.\nNo person in their right mind would ever rate this above a 2. It is truly that bad. <br><br>Dont waste your time or your money watching this trash.","user":"IKnowGoodFilms","rank":[25,32]},{"title":"Absolutely horrible.","rating":1,"date":"18 August 2018","review":"I cant point out one single thing in this movie that wasn't terrible. Locations, acting, props, music, story. All of it just terrible.<br><br>I've seen better movies made for school projects than this. Not only is the movie bad in general, but it's also plain confusing to watch.<br><br>Dont waste your time and money people.","user":"The_Techpriest","rank":[15,18]}]
