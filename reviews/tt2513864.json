[{"title":"Amateur Hour","rating":4,"date":"19 August 2014","review":"I was expecting a low-budget horror flick, sometimes smaller films can be interesting discoveries, if only \"so bad they are good,\" but this movie is just mediocre. Poorly shot with pitiful effects and an atrocious score, the movie lacks inspiration, either of the scary or humorous kind. Possibly the tone is intentionally subdued to match a \"true crime\" report, but a reenactment should be more fun! The framing story of the survivor is tedious, and victims pass in and out of the story too quickly to engage the viewer's interest. The most interesting parts are the clips of the real Leonard Lake explaining himself, but they last only a couple of minutes. That said, it could be worse, and some scenes are almost good; other than the soundtrack it's not too obnoxious if you are compelled to complete your snuff collection.","user":"timlin-4","rank":[10,17]},{"title":"clickbait trash","rating":1,"date":"4 January 2019","review":"Don't bother watching this movie . there way better movies\nYou would think this movie is about a haunted house right ?\nWrong its about a serial killer and not about a house like the title of the movie would suggest","user":"heirman_steven","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"One of the worst things I have ever tried to watch","rating":1,"date":"8 January 2019","review":"What was their budget for this, $25? Had they just made a documentary, it may have been more successful. The acting is positively horrendous and the music is annoying.","user":"gbunny-59019","rank":[3,4]}]
