[{"title":"An honest movie about relationships, age, and state of mind","rating":9,"date":"17 May 2015","review":"Carol Peterson, played by Blythe Danner, is a widow in her 60s or early 70s living in Southern California with no one but her dog for close company. Her daughter has moved away; her husband has been gone for 20 years; and she spends most of her time watching TV, playing golf and bridge, and drinking wine. Over a short period, her life livens up considerably and she meets new people, does new things, and moves towards unwrapping the cocoon of age that's been winding about her. That's the plot.<br><br>This movie isn't as much about plot as it is examining life in our time. When did you stop looking ahead? When did you start spending too much time reviewing your life? When do you stop forming relationships? How do you continue with your life while enduring the blows life hands you? These are questions we must all deal with at some time or another. I think this movie handles these questions more honestly that most Hollywood films.<br><br>The movie is very well acted by terrific talent in the form of Danner, June Squibb, Rhea Perlman, Mary Kay Place, Sam Elliott, and Martin Starr. You should recognize most or all of these names if you watch movies and TV. It's a very, very accomplished cast. Although this movie isn't strictly a comedy, Danner, Squibb, Perlman, and Place all get in their comedy licks like they've been doing it all their lives, which they have.<br><br>Worth seeing. Opening soon.<br><br>We saw this movie through the San Jose Camera Cinema Club.","user":"steven-leibson","rank":[65,77]},{"title":"Blythe Danner great","rating":8,"date":"25 October 2015","review":"Carol Petersen (Blythe Danner) is a widow of 20 years and a retired singer in a band. She has a simple life and her circle of friends (June Squibb, Rhea Perlman, Mary Kay Place). They want her to move into the retirement community. Her dog dies of old age. She starts a friendship with the new pool guy Lloyd (Martin Starr). He's a poet graduate and living with his mother. Bill (Sam Elliott) is the new love in Carol's life. Her daughter Katherine (Malin Akerman) comes for a visit.<br><br>A high June Squibb is hilarious. This is a rather light easy story. Blythe Danner is incredible. She encompasses every part of this movie. Her internal struggles even before she has them are all very effective. It's a quietly powerful performance.","user":"SnoopyStyle","rank":[27,30]},{"title":"A movie about old age which rings true to me","rating":8,"date":"13 September 2015","review":"Most of the other reviews of this film which I read were negative. There is no way to tell the age of those reviewers, but my age is 68. I like this movie, which was touching but not maudlin. It's true to life to me. My wife is still living, and I don't have a big enough retirement savings account to buy a boat and a Cadillac. But we are fortunate enough to have our only child in the same city, and our only grandson (and very likely the only one there will ever be) there also, so we are already ahead of Bill and Carol. But you have to be in old age to appreciate this story. If one of us dies, what will the other do? Would we consider remarriage? How would you find somebody, if you wanted to? If one of our beloved pets dies, what will we do? Do we want to start with another one, even an older one which might die before we do? Do we go to a retirement facility or keep the too-large house? Old age is generally not exciting, even if you have enough money to eat and buy medicine, and it's little things where you find happiness (even if it is TV or golf). This was intentionally a low-key story, which didn't answer any of the questions it raised. We only know tiny tidbits about Carol, but nobody else. Where did Bill come from, other than Dallas? What does Carol's daughter do, and where does she live, and why haven't they seen each other more often? You can draw you own conclusions or just accept this little snippet of Carol's life and move on, as she will, but to what we don't know. It's life, where we come into contact with people but know nothing about them. And nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. If you are lucky enough to have a tomorrow.","user":"lancasterray","rank":[30,37]}]
