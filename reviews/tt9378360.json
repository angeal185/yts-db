[{"title":"Subtle Intrigue","rating":9,"date":"21 April 2019","review":"The combination of leads Jeffrey Charles Richards and Emily Price makes for a sustainable intrigue threading throughout the film. With minimal cast, the story slowly unfolds revealing great pain endured by Harry, portrayed beautifully by Richards. Silent in dialogue, an array of musical choices enhances a build up of emotion as Richards reveals true anguish, line for line, in a seasoned face of despair. Watts-Joyce is a refreshing face lighting up scenes with her beauty and delivery. Complete opposites in scenes together, Price unknowingly pulls at heart-strings as Richards' character labors between past and reality. Richards delivers one scene after another with fluidity in natural dialogue creating an effortless match with Price, both actors believable and true on film.","user":"ccandruby","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"I had it all","rating":1,"date":"17 June 2019","review":"Harry Newman (Jeffrey Charles Richards) write crime murder mysteries. He is rather scruffy wearing wife-beater shirts. When his daughter dies suddenly, Harry goes to his country home to write his memoirs. He meets Eloise (Emily Price) who reminds him of his daughter Ethel. Harry has some reality issues.<br><br>I liked the Stephen King isolated writer story more. If watching Emily Price do head turns a few dozen times is your idea of entertainment, by all means, this film is for you.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"What a wonderful movie","rating":10,"date":"29 March 2019","review":"This is one the best movie I have watched lately!
