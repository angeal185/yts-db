[{"title":"Retread story and less than compelling characters make this forgettable","rating":2,"date":"16 May 2018","review":"A classic thriller with a weak script and multiple lackluster perfomances. Another case of a passable story reduced to a unimaginative work that wastes the talents of decent actors. Jason Chatwin does a good job with little support and the work of Peter Stormare is first rate as the baddie. If you like John Wick or Proud Mary you may find this interesting but most will lose interest quickly.","user":"garygwilliams","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"A few shining moments in a lackluster film","rating":5,"date":"15 May 2018","review":"The Assassin's Code (2018) is not a bad film, for direct-to-video fare. The major beats are predictable well in advance. The heroes, villains and villains in the guise of heroes might as well be wearing black and white Stetsons and the characters who are about to die might as well be wearing red shirts. Production values are modest, although they do utilize an elegant mansion, casket and several luxury automobiles. Cinematography is unimaginatve, other than a few aerial shots that seem to be stock images. As is typical of low-budget productions, the film relies heavily on jiggly-cam shots which are distracting and shatter willful suspension of disbelief. The action/stunt choreography, car scenes and gunfights seem about thirty years out of date. The love story is not well developed and the reconciliation near the end seems to come out of nowhere. The acting is generally pretty good. Justin Chatwin is credible in the lead and Peter Stormare delivers a nuanced performance. Sprinkled throughout the film are little gems of dialogue and characterization that shine against the unimpressive background. While the film employs a lot of tropes and often seems familiar, it offers a few fresh moments. The damsel in distress scene has a unusual twist.","user":"ginocox-206-336968","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"Was that up to code?","rating":5,"date":"22 April 2018","review":"Michael Connolly (Justin Chatwin) is a rookie detective assigned to checking in on mail box crimes. When a robbery and a murder takes place he is given the high profile job.<br><br>This is not a who-dun-it in Cleveland. We knows who did it and Michael has a pretty good idea because Yancy Butler tells him and she was no Huggy Bear.. There wasn't much in surprises. The plot was one we could have picked up from any crime film and it would have played better as a Columbo story. The characters kept the film afloat and they could have build the background info by something other than the boring bar scene. <br><br>Not a bad film, but one I had trouble remembering five minutes later to write a review. <br><br>Guide: F-word. Sex. no nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[7,10]}]
