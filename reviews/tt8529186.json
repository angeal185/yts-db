[{"title":"Totally worth it","rating":10,"date":"4 August 2018","review":"I write this review after I read the other two. One used \"farce\" in the topic, the other used \"cinecism\"instead of \"review\". And I can hardly understand both of them. I don't mean they were wrong about the words. No offense. Just feel a little bit confused.\nAnyway, speaking of the movie itself, as a comedy, it is hilarious and creative. Thanks to the directors and all the casts. What makes it special for me is that comparing with its trailer, it can be even more splendid. That's not easy.","user":"v-84791","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Brewster's Millions remake","rating":5,"date":"29 September 2018","review":"This movie is almost a complete remake of \nBrewster's Millions. It was made in 1985 and was based on a novel. Hard to beat the original. I guess if u can understand English then watch \nBrewster's Millions.","user":"adambeerbower","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"I think this is a very funny movie","rating":10,"date":"14 August 2018","review":"What's the feeling of being a rich man? Most of us don't know, and don't have the chance. In this movie, being a millionaire isn't a very happy things, too. But it's on the condition that you should use it up in 30 days. So I do think having money is really a good things.\nPs: the actress is very cute!","user":"p-83552","rank":[6,9]}]
