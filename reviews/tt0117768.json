[{"title":"vastly underrated","rating":13,"date":"13 August 1999","review":"Don't listen to the critics. \"The Stupids\" is one of my favorite movies, and I've seen close to 800 in the last few years. It's full of scenes that deserve to be classic, like the \"I'm My Own Grandpa\" musical number, the Stupids' encounter with The Lloyd, and \"to be a bush, you've got to think like a bush...\" It's worth watching more than once, for sure. It's tragically underappreciated. The plot has Stanley Stupid investigating the conspiracy to steal his garbage and accidentally blunders into an illegal arms deal, while also tracking down the evil Mr. Sender.","user":"Beach","rank":[31,36]},{"title":"Stupid it may be....stupid its SUPPOSED to be!","rating":20,"date":"20 September 2002","review":"Well guys, sorry to disappoint so many of you, but I thought this was one funny movie. I agree totally with a couple of reviewers who commented that you need to have on the right \"mind-set\" at the time. You need to have also a sense of the absurd here, if not the insane! <br><br>Landis is having a go at everyone and everyTHING in this ode to cinematic oafishness.  He gets away with murder here, whereas Brian Levant who persists in trying to offer disastrously unfunny \"family comedy\" like THE FLINTSTONES simply falls over his own Director's chair.<br><br>I just about wet myself the first time I heard Arnold break out into his musical monologue  \"I AM MY OWN GRANDPA\" That has to be one of the funniest things I have ever seen on the big screen. If you can't laugh at that - you're dead...or terminal!<br><br>Sure, its not for everyone - neither was SIGNS though!","user":"uds3","rank":[40,48]},{"title":"Really not THAT bad!","rating":15,"date":"15 January 2004","review":"I happened to catch THE STUPIDS on cable once and found myself laughing....and I really tryed NOT to! Yes its silly and stupid, but really its quite an enjoyable mess of silliness. If you are looking for a movie parents can watch with thier kids THE STUPIDS really isnt a bad choice. It may not win Tom Arnold any Oscars, but as far as his movies go this and NINE MONTHS are the best ones.","user":"mamamiasweetpeaches","rank":[31,37]}]
