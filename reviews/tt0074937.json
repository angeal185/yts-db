[{"title":"A Comedy-Suspense Masterpiece!","rating":10,"date":"18 January 2005","review":"Eccentric millionaire Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites five of the world's greatest detectives, each allowed one guest, to dinner and a murder. Can the detectives, who turn out to be even more eccentric, stop the murder before it happens, and solve it if it does?<br><br>I first saw this film as a kid in 1976 with my parents at the theater. Although I could remember I liked it at the time, I hadn't seen it since, and it was at best a vague memory. I certainly didn't remember it being so hilarious and entertaining. Written by Neil Simon and directed by Robert Moore, Murder By Death is a very funny spoof of some of literature/filmdom's most famous detectives, set in a beautifully designed, creepy mansion, and at times, becoming a fine mystery film in its own right.<br><br>The jokes fly by very quickly and range from subtle to over-the-top, so attentiveness is required, and multiple viewings are rewarded. The cast is incredible, as you should expect by combining such luminaries as Peter Sellers, Peter Falk, Alec Guinness, James Coco and David Niven.<br><br>A comic masterpiece--10 out of 10 from me.","user":"BrandtSponseller","rank":[90,107]},{"title":"One of my all time top 10 films","rating":10,"date":"13 March 2004","review":"An amazing ensemble cast who must have all had their tongues most firmly planted in their cheeks to produce their performances in this highly amusing murder mystery spoof.<br><br>By incorporating plots and characters from your favourite classic crime genres and gently poking fun at them all it is both funny and comfortingly familiar.<br><br>So if you want great visual gags (blind butler, deaf maid), superb one liners (especially from Maggie Smith &amp; David Niven) and to escape for 90 minutes back into the gentler, less realistic Golden Age of Crime then you need look no further.<br><br>If only there were outtakes.","user":"LauraAS","rank":[69,89]},{"title":"What A Hoot","rating":9,"date":"19 August 2006","review":"An all-star cast, superb dialogue, effective lighting and editing, great production design, and interesting costumes rev up the technical quality of this cinematic spoof of literary whodunits. An eccentric genius named Lionel Twain (Truman Capote) invites the world's five greatest fictional detectives to a dinner party, at which time someone will be murdered. The detective who solves the crime first gets $1 million.<br><br>Everything in this film, from the acting to the sound effects to the plot ... is deliciously exaggerated ... hence the humor. For example, mystery readers accept that Hercule Poirot and Charlie Chan are so observant as to spot the most obscure clue, which conveniently points to the solution of the puzzle. In \"Murder By Death\" writer Neil Simon exaggerates that gambit. A guest detective draws the most outlandish conclusion from the most irrelevant fact, which in turn is shot down by another guest detective who points out the flaws, and then proceeds to do exactly the same thing.<br><br>The dialogue is marvelous. In one scene the blind butler serves non-existent soup from an empty bowl, to which Miss Marbles (Elsa Lanchester) protests: \"Murder by starvation, maybe that's his game\". In another scene, Inspector Perrier (James Coco) reads from a list, and then concludes: \"Everything here has been rented for tonight\". Miss Marbles responds in a melodramatic voice: \"You mean?\" \"Yes\", answers Perrier momentously: \"this entire murder has been -- catered\".<br><br>And then there's the scene wherein Sam Diamond (Peter Falk) ruminates: \"I don't get it; first they steal the body and leave the clothes; then they steal the clothes and bring the body back. Who would do a thing like that?\" To which Dick Charleston (David Niven) responds in a serious tone: \"Possibly some deranged dry cleaner\".<br><br>The film's casting is wonderful. Truman Capote may not be much of an actor, but he brings to the film a personality that is appropriately eccentric. My only problem is that the amount of screen time for the cast is uneven ... too much for Peter Falk and Peter Sellers, and not enough for Elsa Lanchester, who arrives late.<br><br>\"Murder By Death\" is a wonderful film classic that still holds up thirty years after it was made. The film conveys no heavy-duty political or social \"message\", no great insight into the human condition. But when you're in the mood for lighthearted, escapist entertainment that provides some laughs, this film is a great choice.","user":"Lechuguilla","rank":[48,61]}]
