[{"title":"nice acting","rating":7,"date":"20 January 2019","review":"This is not a funny film, its not even romantic, but the acting by jessica barden are memorable and aspiring. she will be 27 this year, but has the ubelievable look of an innocent 14 yrs old girl, but at the same time could have been man hating 30 year old too. her acting really wins the contest of driving this film to a 7.<br><br>its all about romance, the lack of it, the wish for it, the quest for it, and to live with it. its a hard days night all the way through, as she tries to be seen, but at the same time trying to be a rough tough individualistic female, that means trouble and headbanging against the wall., though it ends surprisingly well ,the travel has been hard. i think a lot of girls from 13-30 will find recognition and a-ha moments , and even a good share of boys will be able to identify oneself with the main character.<br><br>im impressed by the technical product carly stone has put together, and what amazes me most is the multipel locations and settings that has been used making this flick. if i say at least 50 then im not overestimating. also the make up department shall have gratitude for making ms barden so rich and at the same time so plain and simple....<br><br>the story though might feel a bit superficial and shallow for an old grumpy man like me. will i recommend it, of course.....","user":"ops-52535","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"never ask the director what the movie's about","rating":6,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"First off, you should know that this IS a movie critical of sugar baby/daddy culture.\nIt does not, however, pass judgement on its lead Blake played by Jessica Barden.<br><br>Other than Barden's great acting it doesn't really have any solid cinematography or outstanding memorable score.<br><br>Plotwise, any scene beside Blake sugar babying feels replaceable and at times plain cliche (halloween party on April) and name-dropping Nora Efron directly to outline her writing roots feels lazy.<br><br>This is a movie that has its soul and originality inside the criticism on the topic of sugar babies - the decision to respond to a topical subject is wonderful.<br><br>But cinema demands to be more than TELLING a good story, it's the art of showing it.","user":"bardavidi","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"The New Romantic Review of the film","rating":6,"date":"22 February 2019","review":"It's worth to watch this movie for one important reason: so you know what not to do with your life, not to push beyond thin lines. And also, to process some personality traits that we may all have but we may as well hide. This film shows how possible it is to be on \"the other side\" by just being yourself, not resisting, not having any moral restrictions, nothing to hold you back. It challenges matters of personality, ethics as well as social interpersonal relationships.","user":"e-angelou","rank":[4,7]}]
