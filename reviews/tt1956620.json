[{"title":"One of the worst movies...","rating":1,"date":"19 July 2014","review":"I don't like to be negative, but I feel obligated to help save the rest of the world from wasting their hard earned money on this movie. This is just about the worst movie I can recall ever seeing in my entire life in the movie theater, and I have seen more movies than anyone I know. There were about 10 minutes of this movie that I can honestly say were funny, but the remaining 84 minutes were just complete and utter agony. The movie takes the concepts of silly and campy to new lows. The movie is laden with deliberate and unintelligent attempts at campy humor, but every attempt falls flat. The concept behind the movie was great, but the execution simply does not measure up. Disappointed! Can I get my money back?","user":"dc_max","rank":[227,312]},{"title":"A really poor comedy","rating":2,"date":"17 July 2014","review":"Sex Tape tells the tale of a couple who, as the title suggest, make a sex tape and it gets leaked. Now this is a perfect example of a great concept that morphs into a really bland and unfunny movie. Cameron Diaz and Jason Segal play a bored married couple trying to spice things up. For the sake of the film, these characters are needed but the actors in the roles are surprisingly typecast at this point. Jason Segal plays an R-rated version of his How I Met Your Mother character and it doesn't exactly benefit him at this point because these are the roles he is now stuck in. He's very good at what he does but this is the one film where his performance grows weary about mid way through. Cameron Diaz isn't much better either, while she does generate a couple chuckles it still isn't nearly enough to help it. The supporting cast featuring Rob Lowe and Rob Corddry do generate most of the laughs, it again doesn't make for anything of a redeeming quality. Jake Kasdan directs from a poorly executed screenplay that features a great idea and glimpses of its genius in some of its twists but they are not enough to set this comedy apart from the million other R rated comedies that have come and gone. Much like Bad Teacher, this film has maybe two good scenes while the rest become bogged down with useless crude jokes for the sake of having a R rating. Overall, Sex Tape marks another disappointing comedy with its overtly crude for the sake of being crude scenes and flat performances.","user":"trublu215","rank":[141,194]},{"title":"Neither sexy nor funny enough.","rating":5,"date":"24 December 2014","review":"Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel play married couple Annie and Jay, who are dismayed to realise that leading a hectic family life has had a seriously negative impact on their physical relationship. When they find themselves with an evening free from the kids, the couple decide to try and revitalise their love-life by filming themselves performing EVERY position from 70s manual The Joy of Sex. The proverbial hits the fan, however, when the couple realise in horror that their current iPad has synced their home-made porn with all of the other tablets they have previously owned—tablets that they have given away as gifts to various friends and associates.<br><br>For most of its running time, Sex Tape smacks of desperation, chucking in as much unsophisticated sexual humour as the R rating will allow, but rarely getting the expected laughs; when Jack Black and Rob Lowe provide a film's funniest moments, then Houston, we have a problem. Of course, for many men, the biggest lure will undoubtedly be the sight of Diaz in the altogether, and at 42, she still has a very commendable body; unfortunately, facially speaking, she has started to resemble Jack Nicholson in Batman, which is just a bit off-putting—although not nearly as off-putting as Segel's hairy ass, which gets far too much screen time for my liking. Let's just say that the sight of Diaz and Segel rutting really ain't all that sexy.<br><br>The film also suffers from a typically maudlin Hollywood finale in which our adventurous couple's ordeal helps them to remember just why they fell in love in the first place. Gack!<br><br>Overall, I rate the film a rather disappointing 5/10: it sometimes rises to the occasion, but is frustratingly flaccid for much of the running time.","user":"BA_Harrison","rank":[6,6]}]
