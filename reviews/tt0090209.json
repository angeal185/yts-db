[{"title":"Needs a U.S. version of the DVD!","rating":1,"date":"1 May 2002","review":"A terrific, quirky film by Alan Rudolph. As an earlier reviewer wrote, he has weird things going on that are never explained. They are just features of his \"alternative future\". Remember that so much of the world we live in goes by, unexplained. It helps break this film away from the Hollywood-spoonfed blandness.<br><br> A real treat not commented on is Keith Carradine. A veteran of Alan Rudolph films, he has a wonderful transformation. Without any commentary, he goes from a rural-type (flannel shirt &amp; jeans) to a denizen of the city (wild clothing, make-up, boufant hairdo). And his behavior gets more bizarre with his change in locale.<br><br> Also, watch for one of cinemas most unique murders. Let's just say it involves water, a major feature of the movie, but it takes place in a location you would never fathom.<br><br> This is one film I would love to see get the deluxe DVD treatment. Widescreen, director commentary, deleted scenes. It is an overlooked wonder.","user":"wadwilchap","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"once upon a time...in the future","rating":9,"date":"26 June 2006","review":"This is a great piece of atmospheric mid-budget film-making. Alan Rudolph and his production team successfully utilize the architecture of Seattle and its rain-slicked streets to bring to life the funky Neo-noir metropolis known as Rain City, inhabited by a set of off-beat characters, my favorite of which is a gangster played by the one and only DIVINE, in his only male-gendered role. He even gets to say the films best line: \"Everyone wants to go to Heaven but no one wants to die!\"<br><br>This is a film that is just begging for a DVD release. As others have mentioned, the audience for this film is definitely out there.","user":"raegan_butcher","rank":[15,18]},{"title":"Bladerunner?","rating":10,"date":"27 August 2003","review":"The person who compared this film to Bladerunner is not only doing this film a disservice, but is so far from the mark as to be untrue. The chief protagonist is a cop true, and though initially spurned, he does get the girl in the end, but that's about where it ends...<br><br>From the opening strains of the muted trumpet, and Marianne Faithfull's beautifuly broken voice, this film is a masterpiece, it's moody, quirky, low key and not without a little menace, especially when Hilly Blue \"puts the anchor\" on Solo, \"they should all blow each other's balls off, make my life easier...\" to quote Lt. Gunther.<br><br>It's everything that Bladerunner isn't, if anything it's set in some alternate vision of a disfunctional 50's &amp; 80's combined, down at heel low life's, trashy outfits, too much drab neon &amp; hairspray, allied with a little mob glamour and modern art.<br><br>I guess I just feel for the characters, Hawk's hunger for a life he never had, the Zen stillness of Wanda, the wild eyed innocence of Georgia and the weirdness that is Coop, Solo freaking out as a Bhudhist, and last but not least, Divine in a suit... \"let everybody get what they deserve...\"<br><br>It's not a fast movie, or an ensemble piece, but at some deep level it resonates.<br><br>\"what are you looking at?\" \"you a cop?\" \"you know damn well I'm not a cop\" \"that's what I'm looking at then, a woman who isn't a cop...\"<br><br>It's the film I watch when I get down, I've lost track of the number of times I've watched it, I caught it first at the ICA West Bank in London, on it's last showing before they started a series of Mexican masked wrestling bario movies :) I bought it recently on DVD in a shop in Schipol airport after being delayed in Amsterdam for two hours, I'd been looking for it for years at that point... Even Amazon had it on back order.<br><br>It's really a wonderful movie, from icy lake to mountain road, I always come away from it happy, I guess you can ask no more from a movie than that.","user":"praxis22","rank":[25,33]}]
