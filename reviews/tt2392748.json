[{"title":"Award for the Most Hilarious Premise in Winter 2017/2018","rating":4,"date":"3 February 2018","review":"Almost the whole humanity was killed by climate change and catastrophes related to those changes and after billions are dead a few guys and gals still driving cars are threatening the climate and therefore hunted down by bounty-hunters - wanted dead or alive. Well, that's a well-dumb-crafted premise I must admit :D <br><br>What more to say!? Movie is so so but only if you are a BIG-time fan of the (pos)apocalyptic genre. No new The Road, The Book of Eli or Mad Max etc. here. Tastes like a C-Western, good enough to kill some spare time with nothing else to do.<br><br>Only for die-hard fans of the genre who must watch 'em all.","user":"Tweetienator","rank":[45,57]},{"title":"Neutrally ok.","rating":5,"date":"7 February 2018","review":"Watchable, giving the plots partly similar to both Clint Eastwood's \"Unforgiven\" and \"Pale Rider\" with a bit of Mad Maxish's enemy wasteland cars. Though none of the editing scene to scene were irritating throughout. The actors are average but not imposing enough with the exception of Gina's acting, she is certainly suited for more kick-ass heroine roles in movieland.","user":"collinsburns57","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"Gina what's happened?","rating":5,"date":"6 March 2018","review":"This is a poor movie, that should be on in the background whilst you do something else, you shouldn't put any time aside to actually watch this, I like Gina and she had great potential to become an action star so why get involved in his drivel.\nAlso, just a small point about the costume designers, one of the premises in the movie is the toxic atmosphere and the reliability on masks and silver?? None of the masks had filters on them which really bugged me, do some research people, masks need filters...","user":"phillip-henry","rank":[11,15]}]
