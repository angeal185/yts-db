[{"title":"Possibly the ultimate grindhouse exploitation movie","rating":13,"date":"13 October 2003","review":"BASKET CASE is, for what it is, superb.<br><br>That's not to say it is technically proficient or boasts particularly good performances from its actors.  But it's intelligent, creepy and viciously horrific.<br><br>A young man, Duane, enters a seedy Times Square motel carrying a large wicker basket.  Inside the basket, as we soon discover, is his monstrously deformed Siamese twin brother, Belial.  Belial looks like a twisted lump of fat and gristle, with two clawed arms and an eerily human-like face.  He was, not so long ago, attached to his brother's side, until his father and some crooked surgeons decided to seperate the brothers against their will. Now the pair is in Manhattan, to do away with the doctors who performed the operation.<br><br>The very premise is as bizarre and sordid as one can imagine.  And the movie doesn't disappoint.  Everything is washed out with red and blue neon, every location is dirty and grungy, every character is twisted or crazed.  The movie jerks the viewer's emotions around brutally, going from silly to grim to nightmarish to funny to horrifying to tragic.  It may take the movie a little while to sink in.  If you allow it to, it will leave you speechless.<br><br>BASKET CASE is a classic of exploitation cinema.  It's as gruesome as any splatter movie and sleazy as any grindhouse porno, but it's far better written and crafted than most of its type.  It's a nightmare not unlike David Lynch's ERASERHEAD, but with a more EC-comics feel.  If a mixture of sleaze, extreme gore, expressionism and poetic justice are your cup of tea, don't pass up BASKET CASE!","user":"squeezebox","rank":[41,46]},{"title":"Superior 80's rubbish","rating":8,"date":"22 March 2005","review":"Frank Hennenlotter's \"Basket Case\" highlights the problem with horror films of today. Back in the eighties, films would be made with an idea and no budget, and the result would nearly always see the release of an inventive and interesting horror film. Basket Case is no exception to this, as despite hokey effects, a rather silly story and some very suspect acting; Basket Case is a trash classic all the way, and it's a film that's guaranteed to delight fans of horror. The story capitalises on the fact that many people (including yours truly) find the subject of deformity uncomfortable, and the subject of living with it even more so. The plot follows a strange young man that carries a basket around with him. Inside the basket lies his hideously deformed Siamese twin, and the deformity wants it's revenge! <br><br>This leads the two brothers to seek out the doctors that separated them and brutally butcher them, and delivering us with a great camp horror movie! The central creature - namely, the deformed brother, is a masterpiece of creature design. The thing itself looks ridiculous, but in spite of this it actually manages to be quite frightening, and once you've gotten over the initial giggles: it takes on a life of it's own, and even manages to become quite believable. The film is sufficiently gory, which will no doubt be good news for everyone that wants to see it. Frank Hennenlotter is one of those directors that obviously has talent and flair for making films, but also hasn't been given a real chance to realise it. It's a massive shame that the endless amounts of remakes continue to get released on huge budgets, while someone that could make a great movie is blessed only with chicken feed to make them with. Just wait until the part where the brothers' story is told Â– that's inventiveness for you! One thing I do love about the director is the way he casts his lead; the one here is certainly odd enough, in a naive loser sort of a way. On the whole; fans of intricate, deep cinema should stay well clear - while everyone else is preparing themselves for a damn good time!","user":"The_Void","rank":[44,54]},{"title":"What's in the basket?","rating":8,"date":"27 November 2003","review":"Basket Case (1982) happens to be one of the greatest shoe string budget horror films ever made. A true cult classic and a tragic tale of brotherly love and jealousy. The sleazy surroundings and characters that the movie was shot in and around adds to it's charm. Duane and Belial are a pair of brothers you don't want to cross paths with. This film was such a success that it spawned two sequels and a funny cameo in another. Highly recommended.<br><br>A","user":"Captain_Couth","rank":[31,38]}]
