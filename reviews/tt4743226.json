[{"title":"Worst writing I've ever seen!","rating":2,"date":"3 November 2018","review":"If there was a story here, it got shredded and pieced together randomly.<br><br>The camera shots are decent, but not sure if it was the crappy screenplay, terrible editing, or the director got bored mid-scene, as some scenes were out of nowhere and/or just ended abruptly or dragged on. A Chinese 5th grader could have written a better screenplay.<br><br>And that lame and loud continuous 1980's background music was so annoying and out of place. Credit does go to some great photography, sfx and visuals for the fighting scenes but that's about it.<br><br>I'm sure B-Willz and A-Brodz where shaking their heads when they saw the final cut, but I'm sure they got paid well just to be headlined in this film.<br><br>Maybe the 25 producers (including Mel Gobson??) should have spent more money in the production instead of paying for the ridiculous amount of fake reviews.<br><br>At best, this film is a 4/10 - only for the visuals, but I knocked off 2 points for the fake reviews... I can't stand it when producers do that. So 2/10 from me","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[84,93]},{"title":"AIR STRIKE 3","rating":1,"date":"1 January 2019","review":"Screen play. Steerike ooone! Acting. Steerike twooo! CGI. Steerike threeee. OUT! Bruce Willis has gone from Unbreakable to Unwatchable. Adrien Brody should have his Academy Award confiscated. I tried fast-forwarding to the good parts. There weren't any. This film is so bad, it made me nostalgic for Pearl Harbor! The worst part: My girlfriend can't get her dollar back from Redbox.","user":"mcgillarch","rank":[28,30]},{"title":"Why so bad ?","rating":2,"date":"6 November 2018","review":"This is an impressively bad film! However, as the CGI airplane fights are fun, I gave it a 2 instead of a well deserving 1. I never expected to see Bruce Willis in such a low standards film, but I guess the international economic crisis is forcing stars of old, to become more \"flexible\".\nThis movie is about the fight of the Chinese against the evil Japanese. The true crime though is the terrible acting, direction and script. In my humble opinion one can make a great movie with only one cheap camera as long as there are a few good actors and a good solid script.\nBruce Willis can not make up for the luck of script guys.\nNext time pay for better writers instead.","user":"demetrius11","rank":[37,42]}]
