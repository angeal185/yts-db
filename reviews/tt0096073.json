[{"title":"Supernatural mystery with an excellent performance by Demi Moore.","rating":6,"date":"25 January 2007","review":"The picture concerns a pregnant woman (an actually pregnant Demi Moore) living with his husband (Michael Biehn). She realizes the strange boarder (Jurgen Prochnow) at home and the fantastic goings-on happening are united to the ¨Book of Revelation¨ and some prophecies connected to her unborn son . She gets drawn into a cobweb of mysterious events . Nowadays , she only can stop the destruction of the world like is said in ¨The commentaries of the Apocalypse of Saint John¨. All around the world various signs emerge from Biblic omens . A Vatican emissary priest (Peter Friedman) is dedicated to investigate the bizarre deeds . As the seals have been broken. The prophecies have begun. Now only one woman can halt the end of our world. An ancient evil has been awakened and there is nothing you can do to stop it... except pray.<br><br>It's a spiritual triller skillfully narrated with bit action but quite entertaining . Strikingly designed and well paced with little exterior scenarios , being exception for the frozen village and African outdoors . This polished film provides chills , supernatural events and thrills in lively mystery . It's rich and dark , though confusing , at times . The film belongs to supernatural prophecy sub-genre (along with : ¨The omen¨and its sequels , ¨The Body¨ , among others) . Good main and support cast , even Ellen DeGeneres played a bit role, but it was cut from the film before releasing . Esoteric musical score and excessive use of synthesizer by composer Jack Nitzsche (Starman , Jewel of Nile , Razor's edge) . Colorful cinematography full of shades and lights by excellent Spanish cameraman Juan Ruiz Anchia (Close range , House of game , River runs black) . The motion picture was well directed by Carl Schulz (a regular television picture director) . It's one of the most unusual supernatural movies from the 80s and certainly one of the most unsettling .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[30,38]},{"title":"Very underrated movie; Jurgen Prochnow, wow!","rating":10,"date":"1 July 2007","review":"Most critics wrote this movie off simply because it was a supernatural or horror film. I didn't have high hopes for it myself, but I watched it because I like the actor Jurgen Prochnow. And I was pleasantly surprised. The movie itself looks good; a lot of films of this type look cheap and flimsy, but not this one. The story was cohesive, suspenseful, eerie and had some truly skillful acting. There is the always good Michael Biehn as the husband and the two young actors Manny Jacobs and John Taylor are standouts. Even Demi Moore, an actress I normally find irritating, comes off well here. She played a pregnant woman and was pregnant herself, which certainly added a dimension to the nervous Abby. But it is Jurgen Prochnow who truly makes an impression; his eyes, his face, his voice are so expressive of the character. I won't reveal more, but let's just say a lot of actors have played this role, and this is one of the most believable interpretations of it that I've ever seen. Rent this movie!","user":"cynthiacher-1","rank":[41,54]},{"title":"Beautifully done supernatural chiller","rating":8,"date":"22 July 2015","review":"Let me say this right off the bat: I'm not usually a fan of religious films. Although The Seventh Sign has heavy undertones, I can't help but love it for being a really well crafted, atmospheric thriller that let's it's fantastic cast go to some truly tough emotional places, that would still be captivating in a film without religious roots. Demi Moore, who I've always loved a lot, plays Abbey Quinn, a tortured girl whose pregnancy only brings forth dark memories from her past and troubles her more. As ominous biblical signs intrude on her benign everyday life, a charismatic, intense stranger (Jurgen Prochnow) rents a room from her, and right away we know he ties into the phenomena somehow. Prochnow rarely gets a chance to play outside of the Soviet terrorist psychopath prototype, but here he brings sincerity, depth and a warm heart to a role that isn't easy to play without lookin like a preachy moron. Michael Biehn give a fiercely touching turn as Abbey's husband, a realist who finds himself out of his element with the supernatural elements that begin to creep into his life. Biehn has a scene at the end that he just nails, and is a highlight of his career. All religious paraphernalia aside though, the themes presented, about sacrifice, love, and finding the one tiny ray of hope in a world cluttered with scum and degenerates are concepts that can be universally applied to any story, be it Christian or not. It's a moody, exciting, heartfelt film that's well worth checking out.","user":"NateWatchesCoolMovies","rank":[13,15]}]
