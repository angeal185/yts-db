[{"title":"Painfully stereotypical","rating":1,"date":"30 April 2016","review":"Being a Saudi woman studying in the US, I was prepared for a movie full of stereotypes that I usually encounter in my daily life. However, it was even worse than my imaginations! <br><br>Aside from the exaggerations and lies, there was no plot. I couldn't tell what the purpose of the movie was<br><br>Also, the Arabic language spoken wasn't even close to the Saudi accent! And mentioning things like it's rare to have Saudi female doctors, seriously?!!!!<br><br>It was a waste of time watching a poorly researched and written movie.<br><br>Tom Hanks' acting didn't live up to the expectations either.","user":"galghaith","rank":[100,153]},{"title":"Disappointing Treatment of Much-Praised Book","rating":5,"date":"25 April 2016","review":"Not every comedy is for everyone (at least I think this was supposed to be a comedy). Last week I saw The Big Lebowski (1998) at the local movie theater. Packed. People in Lebowski t-shirts, people who raised hands to show they'd seen the movie five, ten, twenty times, people anticipating the laugh lines. Eighteen years from now, nothing like that will happen with this film from German director Tom Twyker. Tom Hanks is American businessman Alan Clay, whose marriage is over and whose career as a salesman is on the skids. In what appears to be a last chance at success, he's sent to Saudi Arabia to sell the king on a costly holographic teleconferencing system for a new city being built in the desert. He encounters bureaucratic delays, clandestine alcohol consumption, confounding cultural gaps, and unexpected romance. Where I messed up was in thinking, \"Oh, Tom Hanks. He's always great.\" Someone so talented just wouldn't be in a mediocre film. Why would he? And, I thought, \"Oh, Dave Eggers wrote the book it's based on. Got lots of praise for it too.\" For example, New York Times reviewer Pico Iyer called the book \"an anguished investigation into how and where American self-confidence got lost and — in the central word another lonely expat uses for Alan— 'defeated.'\" And the Boston Globe: \"True genius.\" Someplace along the way, the promise of the book and Hanks got lost, and a more disjointed and implausible narrative is hard to imagine. When we're told that the crowds Hanks saw at a mosque were there because \"that's where the executions are,\" it's hard to believe that a Saudi woman would take the very great risk of being alone with him, an American infidel. Hanks does get to drive a very sexy 2015 Audi R8, briefly. But even that isn't worth the ticket price.","user":"vsks","rank":[82,133]},{"title":"A Hologram for the King: A good film. Besides: is there such thing as a bad Tom Hanks' film?","rating":9,"date":"31 July 2016","review":"A good film about being 60, being alone, being abroad and being open-minded.<br><br>Tom Hanks is a troubled man sent to KSA to sell something on behalf of a big American Corporate. And there he clashes with Arabic Culture in his usual thoughtful and suspended-judgment way.<br><br>I won't tell you what happens, of course, but after a quick look to the other reviews (someone even claims to have fallen asleep) I understood that not everyone have liked it. And I'm surprised but I won't comment. <br><br>I would just say, for those who could possibly share my feelings, that this was a good film: interesting, clever and not slow at all. Just, maybe, a little different. Images are great and the story depicts nicely our difficult times. Besides: is there a such thing as a bad Tom Hanks' film?","user":"niutta-enrico","rank":[89,146]}]
