[{"title":"Decent, but not really a horror movie","rating":11,"date":"11 March 2018","review":"There are a few brief moments that resemble horror, but Muse is really more of a supernatural thriller or a dark adventure. It's not going to be anyone's favorite movie of the year, but it's still a pretty solid production, with good cinematography, cast, and characters.<br><br>The big issue here is the core premise, which is actually really interesting and filled with potential, but ends up feeling a little underdeveloped. I wish there would have been more backstory on the individual muses and that we'd have gotten to see more of their interesting powers. I have to give the movie credit for at least making me that interested that I wanted more of what it had though. <br><br>Overall it was still a good, enjoyable film that kept my attention the whole time and I didn't regret my time spent on it.","user":"horrorgasm","rank":[29,36]},{"title":"Good...","rating":7,"date":"1 October 2018","review":"My first niggle is, as other reviewers have pointed out, that this is a supernatural thriller, not horror. Not a bad thing at all, IMO, but a smidge irritating that the genre is miscategorized. It was good, but really could've used another half hour to flesh out, so to speak, and be what it should've been and deserved to be. I'll be looking for longer cuts on DVD. The almost non-existent and very rushed bonding of the two leads needed more development to really be effective. Really, I would love a sequel, but only if given more character and story development. There's that word again: development. Too hasty - didn't really sink its hooks into me like it could have and should have. Visually - wonderful. Very well done. Actors &amp; acting were, to me, perfect.","user":"darlalatour-58455","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"The Seventh Muse","rating":7,"date":"11 April 2018","review":"The popular literature professor Samuel Solomon (Elliot Cowan) is a great friend of Professor Susan Gilard (Franka Potente) in the university and is secretly in love with Beatriz (Manuela Vellés), who is one of his students. After making love at Samuel´s home, Beatriz asks Samuel to promise that he will love her forever. Then she goes to the bathroom and commits suicide. One year later, Samuel is no longer teaching and has recurring nightmares with a woman that is brutally murdered. Out of the blue, he learns that a woman called Lidia Garetti (Leonor Watling) was found brutally murdered at home and he realizes that she is the woman of his nightmares. He decides to sneak into the crime scene to investigate and he stumbles upon a young woman, Rachel (Ana Ularu), who claims to have the same nightmare. They snoop around and Samuel finds an oval object hidden in a water tank and a photograph hidden in a photo-frame. However the police arrive at the place and Samuel and Rachel need to flee. Rachel takes the object with her and disappears. Samuel identifies the men in the photo and soon he learns that he has entered in the uncanny world of The Seven Muses, cruel supernatural women that have inspired and destroyed writers along the centuries. Further, there is no way out unless he destroys the Seventh Muse. But who and where she is?<br><br>\"Muse\" is a little gem with a melancholic and complex storyline about the muses that inspire writers throughout time described as insidious and cruel supernatural women. The viewer needs to pay attention to the screenplay that has many details and references. Viewers that had the chance to see the spooky 1988 \"Spellbinder\" will delight with the underrated \"Muse\" that has the same style. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[16,22]}]
