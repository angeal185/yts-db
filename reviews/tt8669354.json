This is a clean, fun, holiday movie you can watch with the whole family. The story line is fun, and the acting is great. It's refreshing to see this type of storyline with black actors! It's like a like a black Hallmark movie but not corny. Great film and I highly recommend it.","user":"karrahamiller","rank":[1,1]}]
