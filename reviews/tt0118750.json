[{"title":"Raunchy but often extremely funny!","rating":7,"date":"23 April 2001","review":"Come on, when you're planning on seeing a movie entitled \"Booty Call\" you're obviously not anticipating a Disney comedy.  This film delivers just as much raunch as its title suggests.  The comedy is sometimes overdone and sometimes plagued by lame sitcom material, but I still got tons of laughs. Jamie Foxx is a terrific comic actor, and he delivers many funny--and memorable--one-liners.  Even when the story runs flat, he livens it up with his quirky sense of humor.  There's also a good cameo by multi-talented comedian Bernie Mac, who has some of the funniest cameo roles in movie history.  I enjoyed the two Middle Eastern guys who worked at the convenience store.  Sure, they were stereotyped caricatures of what a foreigner at a corner store or 7 Eleven would act like, but they were still extremely funny.  This film has a chock full of outrageous, yet original moments.  The argument in the Chinese restaurant is a classic!  If you're looking for good, clean fun--\"Booty Call\" is NOT the movie to see!  But if you're looking for big laughs, no matter how raunchy and profane, you will have a blast!  Don't leave this call on hold!<br><br>My score:  7 (out of 10)","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[18,20]},{"title":"Non - Stop laughs.","rating":10,"date":"26 December 2003","review":"Forget race. Forget age. Forget social status. We all know the perils of getting, and giving, some; because of that, the humor of this movie is universal. This is one of those unbelievably rare comedies that is funny all the way through. Not only that, there are so many jokes and gags, that you will probably miss some of them because you're too busy laughing at the last one. Excellent movie to rent for a \"stay-at-home\" date.","user":"shakennotstirred","rank":[18,24]},{"title":"You'll laugh 'til your booty falls off","rating":20,"date":"20 June 2000","review":"Booty Call is one of the funniest movies to come along in many years. Jamie Foxx absolutely steals the show. He has some really funny, memorable lines, and is adept at physical humor. Even though the material is of an overtly sexual nature, the message of the film is definitely that monogamy is cool. A real over-achiever of a film. Was probably made on a shoestring budget, but delivers more laughs than any high-priced Eddie Murphy comedy. A must-see!","user":"briansteven","rank":[7,8]}]
