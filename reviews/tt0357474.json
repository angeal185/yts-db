[{"title":"Not great but much better than Seagal's films have been of late","rating":10,"date":"10 April 2004","review":"Jake Hopper is ex-CIA who retired from the job after a bad shooting incident, although he still does work on the side for an old Agency buddy. When his daughter is kidnapped along with her friend (a Senator's daughter) while on a backpacking holiday in the far east, Jake's contact tells him. With official channels working to get the girls' back, Jake joins up with his old partner and begins trawling the underworld looking for the gang that has his girl.<br><br>Despite getting consistently burnt, I keep on coming back to Steven Seagal films - I can't help it.  I always go to the video store (for that is where Seagal now resides) looking for something to veg out in front of that will entertain me without challenging or stimulating me; it is a sad condemnation of Seagal films that they rarely manage to do even that most basic of requests.  However, in some regards, Belly of the Beast is actually a reasonable film.  The plot is pretty standard and relies on nonsense to move it forwards - stuck with no clues, a girl approaches Jake with a mystery tattoo on her naked chest that only appears when she gets wet!  Talk about an excuse for nudity!  This sort of plot device is over used; too often the film has things just happen for a way of moving the plot forward.<br><br>The plot is poorly developed and it also has elements that just seem to have been thrown in in order to fulfil the formula.  The love interest is one good example of an element that is silly and simply doesn't work.  What does work is the action.  For once in recent Seagal films, the fight scenes are actually pretty enjoyable even if they do overdo the slowmo effects. Seagal himself is quite effective; despite his weight gain he manages to move quite well here - even if most of it involves upper body work rather than full motion.<br><br>As an actor though, Seagal is about as bad as ever: his emotional range is rubbish, as seen in his reaction when told his daughter has been kidnapped (`you don't say' he blankly emotes!).  He even is blank when kissing the gorgeous Lo - so what hope is there for him?  Having said that, the worst moment in the film is one that is another actor's fault.  In one scene Seagal is dubbed by an actor who sounds nothing like him - it is a laughable moment and a sad comment on the effort Seagal is putting into his films now (unable or unwilling to show up for ADR).  Luckily for him, his support cast is OK.  Mann's sidekick is good and Wu makes for a decent bad guy despite having very low screen time.  Monica Lo is very beautiful and sexy - just a shame that her scenes where she gradually falls for Seagal make more for laughter than passion!  Even these few good performances are still pretty basic though and the standard is no better than Seagal's usual stuff.<br><br>Overall, if you watch Seagal films a lot, then this will probably be better than you are used to, despite not actually being that good a film.  The acting, script and plotting are as poor as you would expect but it is in the action stakes where this film improves upon his recent efforts. Understand that this is still not saying a great deal in my opinion but it still makes the film a lot better to have well choreographed and quite exciting fight scenes.  If you have to watch a recent Seagal film, then this is probably the one to pick.","user":"bob the moo","rank":[38,45]},{"title":"Belly of the Seagal","rating":8,"date":"16 August 2005","review":"Contains Spoilers. (Like it matters) Steven Seagal is a miracle. Somehow he has made a career making the same film over and over and this is no exception.<br><br>In my opinion he is a comic genius and a shrewd businessman, he's so good he has everyone thinking he's an action star. He is master of hypnotism. When you see a DVD of his on the shelf you are always drawn to it. You read the blurb. Ex CIA agent (John/Jack/Jake, or my favourite Forrest Taft) seeks revenge on everyone for kidnapping/murder of family/environment/hostages/nuclear weapons.<br><br>You inevitably rent it and proceed to cry with laughter. In this film Seagal, jumps through a train, fights a Ladyboy(!), beats 5 ninjas just by turning around a lot and best of all slicing an arrow clean in half with a sword.<br><br>Although this film deserves special praise for giving Seagal some nookie and the chance to find a secret message hidden on a woman's breasts.<br><br>After years of trying he may have finally made his masterpiece something to rival Under Siege 2 and all those films that had three word titles, for example; Out For Justice, Hard To Kill, Above the Law, On Deadly Ground and Fire Down Below.<br><br>This is comedy to rival Chaplin, Keaton and Jean Claude Van-Damme.","user":"philipsavory","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"Wait, this is supposed to be good?","rating":4,"date":"5 December 2006","review":"First things first, I love the classic Seagal movies. I own every one on DVD from Above the Law to Exit Wounds. Since then, Seagal hasn't made one good film. I couldn't believe that his output had gotten so bad, so I was researching his stv output on IMDb and trying to see which one was the best of the trash pile. Lots of hardcore Seagal fans seemed to like this one, so I rented it. What a forgettable mess. There are little glimmers of hope here and there, but overall this is garbage. If this is good compared to his other films of the past four years, he's really in trouble. The only other STV Seagal films I've seen are \"The Patriot\": not bad but boring, and \"The Foreigner\": terrible. Steven, what's up man? Instead of making 10 bad movies a year, make one good one. And, I'm sorry man, but lose some weight, too.","user":"reverendtom","rank":[6,6]}]
