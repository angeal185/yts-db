[{"title":"Important and Powerful","rating":10,"date":"8 December 2018","review":"This movie is not for everyone. It is about those of us who are outsiders that often feel so dead on the inside we give up on life or seek self destructive behavior to feel alive or human, whether that be through drugs, sex, abusive relationships, risking one's life, intentional infliction of pain, or whatever else makes us feel alive for a moment, or a combination of all of the above, and the devastation it can leave behind. As someone that deals with depression and addiction to self-destructive behavioral patterns, I can tell you this movie was dead on in capturing what it truly feels like, and the impact it has on us and those around us.<br><br>\nFor those that don't have such feelings, or know people plagued with them, I am not sure if they will get it. For those of us that do, it is hard not to view this movie as a masterpiece. It was not judgmental, overacted, or built on false assumptions. Rather, it was a brilliant showing of understanding and awareness for those of us that do not often feel understood or valued.<br><br>You will not feel good or happy leaving this movie. In fact, it was so realistic and on point it brought me straight to my dark place. However, for a change, I did not feel alone in my blackness, but felt like I was with friends that understood and wanted me to make better choices in life. For that I am grateful this important movie was made.<br><br>Absolutely exceptional. And again, I thank all of those involved for taking this so seriously.<br><br>I have no idea why IMDB has this movie listed as a comedy. It is a dark movie about depression, emptiness and suicide.","user":"dogmaticdogs","rank":[38,56]},{"title":"An assured debut from Karen Gillan","rating":10,"date":"27 February 2018","review":"I'm not going to spoil anything here, but I will say that Karen Gillan's \"The Party's Just Beginning\" isn't a perfect film. There's a lot of stuff going on and not all of it gets a resolution. But it's still very well acted (Gillan's best performance yet), well written, and beautifully directed. It's a very confident debut and Gillan's voice really shines through. <br><br>I've seen reviews angry at the film, saying that it \"exploits\" people who identify as transgender or that she \"exploits\" suicide, which I think is just ridiculous. I really believe that all of that is just down to the fact that Gillan tried to include a lot of different topics and themes in this film. Some are included unsuccessfully, and the film can feel a bit overstuffed, but in my opinion, most of the themes have a good pay off.<br><br>Without spoiling anything, I can say that The Party's Just Beginning is an incredibly assured debut. It's got a strong cast, a socially relevant, poignant, and funny script, and even when it doesn't land every punch, The Party's Just Beginning is still an admirable, emotional, and immensely enjoyable directorial debut that marks Karen Gillan as an actor and a director to watch. 9 out of 10.","user":"ilovegod-45956","rank":[41,64]},{"title":"Film Stays With You...Impressive","rating":10,"date":"9 July 2018","review":"This movie really resonated with me because several of the topics are very personal to my life. I have always liked Karen in her films, but this project took my admiration to a much higher respected level. She is now a filmmaker, not just an actress. I later found out (went into the festival screening not knowing she was both director and scriptwriter) this was her directorial debut. Scottish film, but all the topics discussed cross over to other countries, so don't think this is just a UK film being shown in the US. Being someone that has been close to several of the topics in this movie had a real impact on me personally...... the movie really stayed on my mind for weeks. This film needs to be seen by people, it is impacts to the viewer. Also, a film I can't wait to buy AFTER I see it again on the big screen, it's one you need to see several times.\nKaren, for a first time director, did an amazing job. I enjoyed the flow of the film in how it looks back in time about several of the facts. The scenes on the train bridge are amazing and so well done. I was blown away. Cool soundtrack! Karen what is next for you in the directing chair? Can't wait to find out.","user":"Jackie_lovmovies","rank":[20,37]}]
