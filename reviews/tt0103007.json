[{"title":"Enjoyable Fun","rating":8,"date":"23 January 2002","review":"Although not Joe Pesci's best film, it had enough funny moments in it for me to watch it again. Joe Pesci was at his crazy comic best. Vincent Gardenia's expressions and comedic timing helped make this an enjoyable film. Mr. Gardenia's last film. Too bad, he &amp; Pesci would have been a good team in other future projects.","user":"goumba","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Have a little sense of humor..","rating":8,"date":"2 April 2009","review":"For real. Have a little sense of humor about this one. Obviously it does not contain realistic elements and the acting of some of the characters didn't give their brightest performances but it's more a show than a movie. I classify movies as films that are to be taken seriously precluding to aspects like acting, filming, dialogue, original comedy, killer special effects..etc whatever it may be because the people affiliated with the making are striving to find a way to discover the next best flick. I classify shows as films that are made strictly just to entertain us. The Super is a comedy and it made me laugh hysterically just watching Pesci's physical acting. The dad was hilarious. A lot of people say he did terrible. Why? He was an arrogant slumlord and a big old asshole that had mercy for not a soul. Reminds me of my Uncle Jimmy from Boston. His angry bantering and selfish statements were so funny and in my mind authentic. The main actress? Eh whatever were watchin Pesci just to belly laugh.<br><br>So don't pay attention the shitty elements that most critics cap on but just sit down, hit the bong, and see if you don't pee in your pants laughing at the awesome talents of Joe Pesci. GIMME THE RENT!","user":"nick_beatrice","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"\"Gimme The Rent!\"","rating":6,"date":"19 March 2012","review":"Joe Pesci, Vincent Gardenia, Madolyn Smith Osbourne and Ruben Blades star in this 1991 comedy. Pesci (Goodfellas) plays Louis Kritski Jr., a slumlord like his father, Big Lou (Gardenia) who gets sentenced to live in one of his apartments he must fix in 120 days or goes to jail. He meets a council woman from court (Osbourne) who checks in on him to see if he's doing what he supposed to do and tries hitting on her. He befriends Marlon (Blades) who tries getting him to play basketball and such. Soon, Louis realizes he can't be like his selfish father and must be his own man. I think this is one of Pesci's best and he &amp; the late, Gardenia were great together. I recommend this.","user":"gwnightscream","rank":[4,4]}]
