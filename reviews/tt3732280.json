She has a friend who is so stupid she thinks artificial resuscitation by the hero is an attempt at murder. At this point she runs off into the countryside, fearful for her life. Our hero, with a possibly dying passenger in his car, forgets all about getting her to hospital and instead runs all around back roads trying to find the stupid friend. WTF. Why for gods sake??? . Just stupid.","user":"christopher-n-robinson","rank":[73,104]},{"title":"Ridiculous!","rating":1,"date":"29 December 2018","review":"I've officially just watched two of the stupidest, annoying, over reacting, bad decision making, unlikable, just plain mentally challenged people I've ever seen.
