[{"title":"'Nobody beats me in the kitchen!\"","rating":8,"date":"26 November 2003","review":"Steven Seagal reprises his role as a one time SEAL team captain, a counter-terrorist expert who had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive, and protect the hostages... He happens to be on the Grand Continental passenger train traveling from Denver to L.A... Seagal joins the only family he has, a 'cute kid' named Sarah (Katherine Heigl) after her parents died in a plane crash...<br><br>Seagal has an electrifying screen presence... Seeing him in action is similar to appreciating modern art... <br><br>The train is hijacked by a team of 'ugly men' with guns... Their chief, Travis Dane (Eric Bogosian), is a high-tech mastermind, who fakes his own death in order to gain control of a top-secret nuclear satellite... For this crazy technical genius, technology can be used for beauty or debasement, and 'until you plug it in, you just can't tell.'<br><br>Dane's henchman Penn (Everett McGill) is a soldier of fortune freak, whose relationship with his boss resurfaced during Desert Storm...<br><br>Morris Chestnut's focus is on humor and breath-taking sequences...<br><br>Geoff Murphy's film is incredibly entertaining, combining action, martial arts, and dark sense of humor...","user":"Nazi_Fighter_David","rank":[48,66]},{"title":"Seagal accidentally ends up on a train full of terrorists and has to save the world","rating":6,"date":"9 August 2006","review":"Yes, the earthquake beam from space (heck, the whole story line and all of the villains too) are totally unbelievable. Frankly, if you can find a \"believable\" action movie, I have a beach house in Arizona you might want to buy. Yes, the production values were not the finest.<br><br>But -- if you like watching the hero exterminate the bad guys, few do it with the style of Seagal. Like Jet Li (yeah, I am old enough to remember Bruce Lee the original, and Chuck Norris), he is one of the few action heroes who is a real martial arts guy, and he moves so fast and fluidly it is hard for the eye to follow, but fascinating to watch. This is brainless entertainment, full of hilariously cheesy B-movie one-liners you can laugh at (\"Assumption is the mother of all f-ups!\"), often bad acting, a story line you could describe in one sentence, and zero character development.<br><br>There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes. Believability is for films that take themselves seriously. Seagal is more like stand-up comic straight man meets Aikido ace. At least he handles a handgun like someone who has actually fired one.","user":"randallcameron","rank":[28,37]},{"title":"100 minutes of pure bone breaking action","rating":9,"date":"24 October 2010","review":"I love action movies, if they features some decent bone breaking action, it's even better.<br><br>Steven Seagal is the lord of bone breaking, how you could go wrong ?<br><br>Plot: A bunch of terrorists hijack a train, they took a satellite (which is also a weapon of mass destruction) under they control, they demand 1 billion dollars, or they are going to blow up everything ! Unfortunately for them, Casey (Seagal) is on the same train, while he was traveling with his niece.....now bones are going to break and arms are going to get snapped.<br><br>Under Siege 2, delivers good one-liners and violence. The violence is almost in a comic-book or video game style, that is one the reasons why i like Under Siege 2.<br><br>You can watch it even if you haven't watched the first Under Siege, because there are no real \"connections\" from the first movie, just the character played by Seagal.","user":"Viva_Chiba","rank":[11,13]}]
