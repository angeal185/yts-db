[{"title":"Think \"The Handmaid's Tale\" meets \"Romeo and Juliet\"","rating":9,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"Clearly the current only reviewer 'gerard_schmidt' is a wannabe critic that probably only saw the trailer, and even with that, this film is certainly not a 1/10 smh. And if anyone thinks my rating and review is fake, click on my username to see my 1000+ ratings and 800+ reviews, and read my profile on how a film should be properly rated and reviewed.<br><br>Now this little gem of a film; This is novice writer and director Takashi Doscher's third full length feature film, and I have to say, he nailed it, especially considering this is a low-budget B-grade indie film.<br><br>This was a true romantic psychological moral drama apocalyptic sci-fi thriller that actually combined those genres better than I would've ever expected. I'm not a fan of back and forth timelines, but Doscher's timelines worked exceptionally well, especially with the perfect cinematography and distinct color choices for each timeline by cinematographer Sean Stiegemeier. Doscher's directing was spectacular, in that every scene transitioned perfectly, even with the back and forth timelines. The score and sound were on point and very fitting in maintaining that constant level of suspense. Leslie Odom Jr. and Freida Pinto's character chemistry and intimacy was convincing, and their performances outstanding - especially Pinto's break-down scene that was award-worthy. My only critique would be the slow pacing. I know it had a lot to do with maintaining the tension and suspense, but maybe cutting down/out some scenes, and/or pick up the pace in many of them, the 98 min runtime would've flew by.<br><br>I get this film wont be for everybody, but if you're a fan of apocalyptic films with romance that actually works well, then you will enjoy this. If your gal wants to see a chick-flick and you a sci-fi, this film is perfect for both. But if you're expecting a big budget Hollywood blockbuster from seasoned actors and filmmakers like Mad Max or Oblivion, you may be disappointed. But nevertheless, this is a well put together and entertaining film - especially considering it's a low-budget B-grade indie film, put together by a novice filmmaker. Mad props to Takashi Doscher for this little gem, and it's a well deserved 9/10 from me.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[27,46]},{"title":"Marriage story ?","rating":4,"date":"13 April 2020","review":"The storyline is okay but given the storytelling is kinda let down. It's low budget but this kind of topic cannot be too low thus no quality can be produced. What I saw is a \"marriage story\" with sci fic background.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Was ok but too slow","rating":5,"date":"19 March 2020","review":"Good story and decent acting, but was pretty boring most of the time. Definitely needed more action and less drama. Wouldn't recommend it. 5 stars","user":"Draysan-Jennings","rank":[5,10]}]
