[{"title":"Very funny","rating":9,"date":"2 November 2017","review":"Like an update on a Laurel and Hardy movie. These guys are hilarious. I thoroughly enjoyed watching their infantile endeavors. It's rare that a small indie like this is so well made, and so sharply written, and delivers with such punch. Is it a movie about being a grown up in a childish world? Or being childish in a grown up world? I don't know. I know I laughed, and I needed to laugh, and it felt great to laugh. Plop yourself down on the couch and prepare to laugh. Highly recommend!","user":"Benjamin_Meyer","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Quirky/Dark Comedy","rating":9,"date":"19 October 2017","review":"Reunions usually end up much different than you expect. I think the main characters in \"A Legacy of Whining\" can agree with that. The movie is a fun/quirky flick with a dark yet funny side. It doesn't take itself too serious, which makes it that much more enjoyable.<br><br>The direction and acting from Ross Munro is on point, as is Robert David Duncan and the supporting cast. The film is shot well and the pacing is even.","user":"mrtheflip","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"A great movie to relax with!","rating":8,"date":"5 August 2019","review":"A great movie to relax with, this largely comedic story has far more behind the laughs and quirky characters, there is real heart and charm here. Enjoy the solid performances, the witty script and the light hearted atmosphere. Well worth a watch.","user":"Anmer93","rank":[5,7]}]
