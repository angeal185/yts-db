[{"title":"Bad in a good way","rating":5,"date":"1 November 2017","review":"I liked this movie.<br><br>It's definitely a B movie, much of the acting as well as the effects is so-so, but there are also clear nods to old school sci-fi, kind of a mix of some old Flash Gordon movie and some of the cheaper 80's sci-fi stuff, but also randomly mixed up with modern style tech/effects just to spice things up.<br><br>If you also consider that it's literally a low budget movie (at least partially financed through fundraising), it's not bad at all.<br><br>I think it works. I've seen worse stuff rating higher on IMDb...<br><br>+ + + Just to give you perspective: I like sci-fi a lot. I rarely shut off or fast forward even the shittiest of movies. It has happened perhaps 2-3 times that I can remember, and I've watched hundreds of sci-fi movies and TV shows.","user":"peter-2002","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"Hallelujah...","rating":11,"date":"11 March 2017","review":"I guess everyone who took a quick look at the cast was wondering: \"Wow, really, THAT Casper Van Dien? The guy from Starship Troopers and Sleepy Hollow?\" And yes, this is the only reason why I sat down at a friend of mine who collects trash movies. And it didn't take long and I got this weird \"Command &amp; Conquer 1 Cinematic\" feeling. It's been 20 years ago that Titanic actually looked kind of realistic and Starship Troopers set the benchmark for action packed CGI. And here we are in the year 2017 and are being served with visuals that could have been done by a group of self taught high-schoolers. But that's only the first thing you notice - after this is goes on and on. This story. Sorry, I am usually a guy who tries to value even smallest mercies but no, no mercy here. This story is recycled, rehashed and wrecked - you are pulling your hair out because you just know everything ahead.<br><br>The camera, the sound effects, the dialogues, the music, the costumes, the locations (this was probably shot in a forest nearby), the whole way people encounter and talk to each other, it's all so unbelievably lame - i wonder what some of the actors thought when they read the script. In fact a few actors try so hard to make this work you can immediately tell the quality of someones talent. Even with bad camera, clumsy dialogue and cheesy costumes some prove that even in worst conditions they can at least deliver a believable performance - and that goes to some actors, and the actors only.<br><br>When you see some student movies coming out of some film or media universities you'd be surprised what the next generation has to offer. Even they would laugh about this embarrassing excuse for a movie. I'm so sorry, I just couldn't be nice this time. This is an insult to movie lovers - and yes, I'm also the kind of guy who also \"gets\" and laughs about Kung Pow - Enter The Fist.","user":"SebastienSpa","rank":[61,78]},{"title":"Ray gun for hire","rating":3,"date":"5 June 2019","review":"Somehow I doubt that Casper Van Dien will be doing a sequel of his Saber\nRaine character. Then again look at how many Sharknado movies were made.<br><br>Van Dien's character is an intergalactic gun for hire. At one time a decorated\nwar hero on earth he's an exile now, willing to sell his ray gun and fighting\nskills to the highest bidder.<br><br>His mission here is to rescue a brother and sister heirs to a planetary throne.\nBut things get complicated when it turns out that sister is in league with the\"\nbad guys.<br><br>Casper must really miss those glory days of Starship Troopers. This film\ndoesn't come close in any category you care to name.<br><br>If you like cheesy sci-fi than this is your movie.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[5,5]}]
