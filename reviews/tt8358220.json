[{"title":"Dreadfully Boring-I guess the other reviews so far are from the crew","rating":2,"date":"15 February 2020","review":"If you like horror films, or creature features, you should definitely PASS on this film. If you like indie dramas about an annoying couple painting a house together while getting into tickle fights, before seemingly unexplained problems in their relationship cause a rift that makes up 95% of the story then you need to grab your significant other and buckle up for 90 minutes of you giving each other quirky glances whenever something onscreen resonates with something in your own annoying relationship. The story is boring, the setting is dull, the dialogue at times reads like a small-time theater production and less like a movie, and most importantly the monster is on screen like one and a half times if you count a short glimpse of it halfway through, and when you finally get a good look at it, it's a freaking joke. I don't know if that was some deliberate attempt at being offbeat but the monster design just comes off as cheap more than anything else. I still don't fully understand why his girlfriend left him to begin with? Because she didn't like living in the country and wanted to go eat food from street vendors? I'm not joking...paraphrasing her character here but she left her boyfriend who she seemed so in love with in flashbacks because she suddenly decided she didn't like living in a small town and she wanted to drink funky wines and eat sushi and food from street vendors! I wish I was joking... That's some college girl stuff, man...can't really sympathize with her. Just goes to show you, being a good and loving partner is just boring for these women anymore. 2/10 because I'm feeling generous.","user":"umimelectric","rank":[38,70]},{"title":"insufferable","rating":1,"date":"15 February 2020","review":"I guess rotten tomatoes scores are now just bought and sold, as this thing is sitting right around 100%. this film is nearly unwatchable in every regard. the acting is awful, the dialogue is laughable, the characters basically insufferable. then there's the \"creature\". wow. one of the dumbest films i've ever seen and i'm not sure how it's gotten distribution or release. there's \"low budget\" or \"indie\" and there is amateur garbage like this. nonsensical plot, inexplicable character choices: (head over heels girl in love disappears one day to the exotic wilds of *miami* in search of wine and sushi?) anger inducing waste of time, avoid at all costs.","user":"dyingxmidwestern-1","rank":[32,60]},{"title":"Sometimes movies truly are a waste of time.","rating":1,"date":"18 February 2020","review":"So the plot here is pretty simple:<br><br>Guy lives out on farm with love of his life\nAt some point love of his life is no longer in his life\nA mysterious beast attacks his house nightly<br><br>So they questions you ask during the film are:<br><br>1. Where is his girlfriend? Dead, alive, just a break up? Did the monster get her?\n2. Is there really a monster or is it in his head like his friends think?<br><br>The majority of the movie is flashbacks of times with his perfect GF. They clearly love each other, which makes you assume she maybe died at some point but he hasn't accepted it? Did he kill her and is a complete nutjob? Is HE the monster?<br><br>The rest of the movie is scenes with the beast attacking the house. You never get a good look at it accept for one time it eats his GF's cat and you see it for a split second. Otherwise it just leaves behind damage done to the house, which friends suggest is a bear or mountain lion.<br><br>So what's the actual answer to what is going on? Well the GF was just bored of their relationship and headed on down to Miami for a reunion, and simply had her phone off so she could have space.<br><br>The monster? Yup it's real. Shows up in the last scene with the entire cast and our main character kills it.<br><br>The end. No explanations, just the end. 1 star for a nice soundtrack at times.","user":"jasonscottwilsonfl","rank":[15,27]}]
