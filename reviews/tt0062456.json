[{"title":"\"What do you feel in your soul, deep in your soul?\"","rating":9,"date":"15 July 2008","review":"I must admit I was surprised when, following Russia's so-called \"moral victory\" at the Battle of Borodino, Part Four of Sergei Bondarchuk's 'War and Peace (1967)' opened proceedings with Field Marshal Kutuzov's reluctant retreat and Napolean's march onwards into Moscow. One suspects that the narrator's patriotic speech at the end of '1812' was perhaps a little premature, as Russia never seemed more vulnerable and defeated than the moment when French troops sidle casually into the nation's deserted capital. While it suffers from the unfocused and disjointed narrative also present in Part One, the final instalment of Bondarchuk's epic accomplishment is a brilliant and satisfying conclusion to a great story; as a proud nation is brought to its knees, the emotional register frequently strikes its maximum. 'War and Peace IV: Pierre Bezukhov (1967)' is arguably the picture's most important segment, when the story's primary characters place everything on the line for the future of their beloved Russia.<br><br>First and foremost, Part Four is a visual masterpiece, and Bondarchuk once again places his mark on the film with an assortment of dramatic episodes that are staggering in their intensity and attention-to-detail. During the burning of Moscow, as Pierre Bezukhov (Bondarchuk) attempts to rescue a young girl from a fiery inferno, the characters are almost completely obscured by the blustery splinters of ash that gust across the screen. I have no doubt that the filmmakers destroyed an entire village (which they probably built themselves) in order to achieve this remarkable set-piece, and the sheer intensity of the raging red flames often gives one the impression that Pierre has, with the arrival of the French, unexpectedly descended into the sweltering pits of Hell. Later, following the withdrawal of the invading army, Bondarchuk counterpoints these visions with another sequence, an awesome, seemingly-endless overhead tracking shot of the lines of weary soldiers stumbling through a bitter snowstorm.<br><br>Part Four of 'War and Peace' provides the ultimate test for many of the story's characters. Prince Andrei (Vyacheslav Tikhonov), who was wounded at the Battle of Borodino, must finally accept his impending death, and his final departure is preluded by an eerie dream sequence, in which Andrei wakes to observe a procession of indistinct faces marching past, the exodus of a lifetime of people, places and memories. Natasha Rostova (Lyudmila Savelyeva), now an emotionally-mature young woman, must accept her past mistakes and make peace with the man whose love she had betrayed. Pierre, who had previously expressed his complete disinterest in the war at hand, must choose to defend his beloved Fatherland, even if it may cost him his life. The picture's eventual conclusion, though certainly sad, strikes just the right note of bittersweet, and we feel as though we've just completed something very special. The overriding emotion is one of hope: wars will come and go, but life goes on, and life is the most important thing of all.","user":"ackstasis","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Powerful war","rating":9,"date":"6 June 2019","review":"Of all the adaptations of Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece 'War and Peace' (all ranging from above watchable, though the 2007 adaptation was disappointing, to outstanding), the not always perfect but still towering achievement that is Sergei Bondarchuk's adaptation is second best. Best being to me the 1972 mini-series, do think that 'War and Peace' lends itself better to a mini-series than to a film due to its length and complexity.<br><br>Bondarchuk's adaptation is extremely long and might be something to be split over a few nights rather than see it in one sitting, but is quite an experience and one of those that fits under the category \"unlike anything you've seen before\". One of those experiences that is a must see, for anybody wanting a faithful adaptation in cinematic form and done incredibly well Bondarchuk's version is an absolute must. This final part in particular is worth it, being the most searingly intense and most emotional of what came before as well as being very important for the story and character development.<br><br>It may lack the book's sharp bite again at times, though with what is going on on screen there is really not an awful lot of time for that, and occasionally the acting is histrionic but not majorly.<br><br>This 'War and Peace' though is a visual marvel. The scenery and period detail is spectacular and gives a sense of time and place far better than any other version of 'War and Peace' and the cinematography is inventive and enough to take the breath away. The snowstorm tracking shot is indeed not one to forget and does hit hard. The scope and spectacle is also enormous and that is apparent throughout, the aforementioned burning of Moscow, especially with the inferno, is really quite extraordinary and stayed with me for a long time on an emotional level.<br><br>Music score again chills the bone, not only music that was emotionally powerful and beautiful to listen to but also gave a sense that the story was set in Russia in the way that few of the other versions, only 2016's, managed to achieve. The script is thoughtful and the story is compelling and with a lot of recognisable elements in detail and spirit. Bondarchuk's direction is again remarkable and Pierre, also played by Bondarchuk (there is no sense of him biting off more than he can chew with giving himself a lot to do, far from it), is at his most powerful and relatable here.<br><br>All the characters have come on a lot in development, Natasha being a strong example. None are caricatures, even Napoleon.<br><br>Overall, really powerful stuff and Tolstoy and Russian literature fans should make every effort to see it. 9/10","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Full of sound and fury, signifying a lot","rating":9,"date":"4 July 2019","review":"War and Peace Part IV, Pierre Bezukhov, might as well be called the \"Fire and Ice Edition\" given the prominence of the depiction of the great Fire of Moscow as well as some great (but unfortunately brief) shots of \"General Winter.\" Like Part III, the spectacle is grand and sweeping: According to The Criterion Collection, the fire scene had to be planned for 10 months and shot with helicopters and six ground-level cameras. If no one got killed making that scene, that's an achievement.<br><br>Aside from the sheer elaborateness of the production, director Sergei Bondarchuk once again justifies this with artistic vision: Even the shots of Napoleon looking over his conquered Moscow (pre-fire) are impressive and inspiring. The shot of Napoleon riding out of Russia are dynamic but moody and convey that sense of despair and defeat. The end cinematography of the Russian landscape is great, though it's a direct callback from Part I. Andrei's dream sequences are also artistically masterful.<br><br>Part IV is short by itself while covering a lot, but it still wraps things up a satisfying note. It captures that homecoming feeling after a war; Pierre seeing the grown Natasha (with flashbacks to their memories of each other), has that \"V-J Day in Times Square\" kissing sailor image written all over it. The full seven-hour experience can leave any viewer feeling exhausted but mightily impressed.","user":"gizmomogwai","rank":[1,1]}]
