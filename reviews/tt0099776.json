[{"title":"A Different Kind of Kulturkampf","rating":10,"date":"3 July 2003","review":"One has to be annoyed with comments that question either the historical verisimilitude or the integrity of this film, whether from the shaky ground of some rigid, illiberal ideological or religious prejudice or from some one-sided version of history.  Furthermore, negative ad hominem attacks on someone other than political leaders or other persons who willingly seek out the public eye are reprehensible.<br><br>Does this story ring true?  It does to me, and if there is even one-tenth as much basis in fact in the life of Salomon Perel as is represented in the film, I am satisfied. Having been to all the places and delved into the culture and history of all the nationalities that comprise its background, I am also convinced that much if not all of the story is correct at a level that goes well beyond whether this or that small factual detail is rooted in what actually happened to the real Perel.<br><br>Moreover, \"Hitlerjunge Salomon\" (better known in English-speaking countries as \"Europa, Europa\") is a masterful piece of cinema, beautifully produced and directed, and bearing a cachet of authenticity that few cross-cultural films achieve.  I can attest to the utterly convincing script and characterization within the German language portion, and the bits in Polish and Russian seem equally strong.<br><br>Why is it so difficult to believe that a malleable teenager raised in a cross-cultural environment would be any less rooted in one part of his life than another?  Marco Hofschneider captures precisely the right tone as he demonstrates how \"Solly\" and \"Jupp\" are two complementary aspects of the same person.  Indeed, there are even good Germans and bad Germans, good Poles and bad Poles, etc., etc. throughout the film.<br><br>None of this compromises the truth that millions of other Jews did not survive the Holocaust.  Nor does it demean their memory to cast a glance or two at this singular exception.  The survivors have their stories as do the victims, and to explore the wider spectrum of life that goes on is surely to find hope in the ruins of an otherwise depraved episode in world history.","user":"B24","rank":[69,81]},{"title":"Amazing but true tale of strength and the will to live","rating":8,"date":"5 August 1999","review":"This story is made even more amazing since it is based on fact. The real Solomon Perel has quite a story to tell. I have also read the book, and the movie is a bit factually inaccurate, but it is still tremendously well-made.<br><br>Young Solly is played by a beautiful young actor named Marco Hoffschneider. His good looks and charm are part of what get him to convince the Gestapo that he is not a Jew, but an ethnic German. But Solly has much more getting him through this ordeal. His determination and strength of spirit, plus blinding will to live, and perhaps the youthful exuberance of being able to accomplish it, help him to pull off the charade. The young boy speaks several languages, and is able to use this skill to convince Nazi soldiers that he is not Jewish. The soldiers adopt him as a sort of \"mascot.\" Solly is careful not to show his circumcised penis to anyone, including the German girl he falls in love with. Fate is also on his side, since several times when it seemed he might be found out, the hand of a higher power intervenes.<br><br>This is an engrossing film, sad and funny. Perhaps Solomon Perel is ashamed that he lived with the enemy to save his life, but, he is alive today to tell his story. The real Solomon Perel makes a brief appearance at the end.","user":"doeadear","rank":[37,44]},{"title":"If you want the truth, read the book","rating":23,"date":"23 May 1999","review":"OK, I saw \"Europa, Europa\" in the theater for the first time about 7 or 8 years ago. I always thought it was an amazing story about a young Jewish boy-man who survives WW2 masquerading as a Hitler-Jugend. I was moved to tears at the end of the story (but I won't give away how it ends). Anyway comparisons to Schindler's List and other movies are inevitable.<br><br>But I was so intrigued by Solomon Perel's story that I checked the book \"Europa, Europa\" out of the library and read it for myself. Now having read the book, I watched the movie again and I can tell you that many facts and details of Solly's life were changed to make the movie more dramatic and concise. \"Europa, Europa\" the movie was not in anyway described as a documentary, so you can take the dramatic moments with a grain of salt. They rewrote most of it in the process of making the movie. I don't know if these alterations were done with Perel's knowledge or permission. But he is shown at the end of the film, so he must have known that the movie was being made. All I can say is, the real truth is even more amazing than the fiction. Read the book for yourself and see what I mean!","user":"Kathy-70","rank":[50,65]}]
