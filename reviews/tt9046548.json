True crime and Marley fans alike will enjoy.","user":"iisdave-86245","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Easy to watch doc on Bob Marley","rating":7,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"My only criticism is that this documentary doesn't really get too involved in any particular area of bob marleys life. It details the assassination attempt and the political climate in Jamaica at the time, but doesn't spend too much time with either, and sort of dances around. Very noncommittal documentary, which can be nice to watch, but also can be a bit boring. Did learn a few things about bob Marley that I didn't know before.","user":"Calicodreamin","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Interesting","rating":6,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"This taught me a lot about bob Marley that I hadn't previously known","user":"Jessicanu94","rank":[3,8]}]
