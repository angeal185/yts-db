[{"title":"A misunderstood classic.","rating":10,"date":"8 March 2000","review":"CALIGULA is a terribly misunderstood film. I believe too many people think of it as a cheap porno,  and bash it due to that. \"All porn is bad,\" right?<br><br>\nCALIGULA was a daring film experiment incorporating big-name, established talent, and the raw energy of under ground film techniques. What results is nothing short of a fascinating product.<br><br>All of the acting is very good. Malcolm McDowell plays psychotic villains so well, one can't help but think he's like that in real life. His portrayal of Gaius Caligula just drips with maniacal megalomania. The little-known Teresa Ann Savoy is convincing as Drusilla, Caligula's sister. And Peter O'Toole's Tiberius Caesar, whose diseased face is rotting away, is truly an oddity to behold...put he pulls it off well. The acting in general is all very good.<br><br>The use of music is also to be noted. There are original, evocative pieces written for the film by Paul Clemente, no doubt a talented composer.<br><br>While some of the photography is stilted in this film, for the most part it's gorgeous. A lot of people say the colors are \"dark\" and \"washed out\", but I think that lends to the grittiness of the film.<br><br>Danilo Donati's sets are big and well designed, it kind of shocks you to see someone getting a blow job in them. They look like they belong in a run-of-the-mill Hollywood produced film. Aren't all pornos supposed to be filmed in the director's back yard?<br><br>And that right there is the point of the film. To shock you; you can't believe you're seeing what you're seeing. Beyond the violence and the sex is a well written, acted, and photographed film.<br><br>I have spoken!","user":"bighelsinki","rank":[391,526]},{"title":"The Ben-Hur of Porn: Gratuitous Sex, Violence, & Weirdness","rating":4,"date":"23 April 2005","review":"Some describe CALIGULIA as \"the\" most controversial film of its era. While this is debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film made an effort to distance themselves from it. Author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) to have his name removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film their reactions varied from loudly voiced disgust to strategic silence. What they wanted, of course, was for it to go away.<br><br>For a while it looked like it might. CALIGULA was a major box-office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theatres in order to get it screened at all), and although the film was released on VHS to the home market so many censorship issues were raised that it was re-edited, and the edited version was the only one widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both edited \"R\" and original \"Unrated\" versions. And no doubt John Gielgud is glad he didn't live to see it happen.<br><br>The only way to describe CALIGULIA is to say it is something like DEEP THROAT meets David Lynch's DUNE by way of Fellini having an off day. Vidal's script fell into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to bankroll the project and lure the big name stars--and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought in soft-porn director Tinto Brass. Then, when Guccione felt Brass' work wasn't explicit enough, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hardcore material on the sly.<br><br>Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what all the fuss is about, but those viewing the original cut will quickly realize that it leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. There is a tremendous amount of nudity, and that remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a grand orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in for good measure. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture, and mutilation the order of the day. In one particularly disturbing scene, a man is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on his corpse, and his genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs.<br><br>In a documentary that accompanies the DVD release, Guccione states he wanted the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he missed the mark. We know very little about Caligula--and what little we know is questionable at best. That aside, orgies and casual sex were not a commonplace of Roman society, where adultery was an offense punishable by death. And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like the strange, slightly Oriental, oddly space-age sets and costumes offered by the designers.<br><br>On the plus side, those sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful, and although the cinematography is commonplace it at least does them justice; the score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who manages to engage our interests and sympathies as the Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in reasonably good form. The same cannot be said for McDowell, but in justice to him he doesn't have much to work with.<br><br>The movie does possess a dark fascination, but ultimately it is an oddity, more interesting for its design and flat-out weirdness than for content. Some of the bodies on display (including McDowell's and Mirren's) are extremely beautiful, and some of the sex scenes work very well as pornography... but then again, some of them are so distasteful they might drive you to abstinence, and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film undercuts its eroticism. If you're up to it, it is worth seeing once, but once is likely to be enough.<br><br>Gary F.

As he loftily told reporters, \"X-rated films... are a force that has to be dealt with (and made) part of the establishment.\" Italian sexploitation king Tinto Brass was hired to direct a screenplay by Gore Vidal. RSC heavyweights Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud and Helen Mirren were cast as those murderous Romans, along with droog-of-the-moment Malcolm McDowell in the title role. This would be a truly groundbreaking picture, a (heavy) breathing Aubrey Beardsley illustration, combining high-art, high-drama and Penthouse Pets placing their ankles behind their ears.<br><br>It all went terribly wrong. With a trio of emperor-sized egos in bed, the Vidal-Brass-Guccione threesome collapsed under the weight of those old artistic differences. \"I want to screw theeez Penthouse!\" the anarchic Tinto informed McDowell, who envisaged Caligula as less an insane tyrant than an anarchic revolutionary, hastening the Senate's downfall from the top. Vidal was barred from the set; lawsuits pinged between Italy and the States; and the 'Penthouse' boss, tired of being dry-humped by Brass, finished the film off himself, inserting extra hardcore, willy-nilly, into the edit. \"I just tried to survive it\" McDowell explained later.<br><br>The result is utterly unique. One's enjoyment (the word used advisedly) may also depend on which version you're exposed to. The theatrical cut is a badly-dubbed, silly old mess, a third-rate Ken Russell. The uncut version, on the other hand, is a fascinating mess, made strange and mad through sheer licentiousness.<br><br>McDowell, who's on screen for pretty much the whole picture, is, well, very McDowell: whether coquettishly swiveling in his boots like a doe-eyed Biggus Dickus, quipping like Lurkio in Up Pompeii (\"I thought you didn't like virgins,\" he's chided. \"I've never known any,\" comes the reply) or simply shrieking like a bat.<br><br>Among other outrages, he has sex with his sister (dead or alive); marries \"the most promiscuous woman in Rome\" (Mirren); sleeps with his horse; turns the senators wives into prostitutes for an imperial brothel (\"A logical way to balance the state budget\"); and rapes a virgin bride on her wedding day. And then fists the groom. The fistee is later charged with being \"an honest man and therefore a bad Roman, and therefore a traitor\". His penis is cut off and fed to the hounds while cackling hags hoist up their togas and urinate on his corpse.<br><br>You can sort of see what they were trying to do. But it doesn't work. Caligula hiccups from one sorry sequence to the next, seemingly without connective tissue; the whole enlivened, if that's the right word, by repetitive and bewilderingly gratuitous money shots. If you want a picture of the future two hours and 36 minutes, imagine a scrotal sac slapping on a human face forever.<br><br>Wherever you look, men and women, often in jarringly different film stock, are performing every permutation of straight or gay sex, or vigorously masturbating to issue like glassy-eyed clockwork monkeys. The effect is exactly like watching distinguished thespians politely attempting to ignore a stage invasion at the Old Vic by furiously copulating naturists, right in the middle of a pivotal soliloquy. As if embarrassed, O'Toole bails out early, as does Gielgud. At least for the latter it was a warm-up for Prospero's Books.<br><br>\"I had to take my destiny with my own hands,\" cries Caligula, as everywhere, everyone is taking their own, and other people's, into their hands too. And yet the film - graphic and coy all at once - doesn't work as pornography either. Aside from the interminable zooms, hardcore is generally characterised by static shots, gentle pans and dissolves. Here, an elongated fellatio scene is continually intercut with an extremely camp sequence of soldiers mincing off to war.<br><br>Elsewhere, some sisters of Sappho have it off for what seems like an eternity, but the jump-cuts and addition of an ethereal chorus with strident orchestration should frustrate even the most determined onanist. During one early tableau, the film - already the cultural equivalent of PT Barnum's Fejee Mermaid - becomes a literal freakshow, featuring a lusty three-eyed woman and a four-handed man. It's about as erotic as a Francis Bacon retrospective.<br><br>Vidal's defence (pre-Guccione's meddling) was that regardless of whether the events portrayed in the movie were strictly accurate, they were representative of the kind of debauchery the ancient Romans indulged in. (After all, these were the self same people who'd reportedly dug up a frozen dinosaur from northern Europe and cooked and ate it for a feast.) Yet there's probably more historical veracity in Monty Python's Life Of Brian. Roman traitors were almost certainly not buried up to their necks and decapitated by a gigantic moving wall with swirling lawnmower blades, however impressive it looks.<br><br>Because visually, Caligula is undeniably fabulous: Derek Jarman meets Peter Greenaway and Federico Fellini - the alternative name for the film could well be '8Â½ Inches'. This may be a bad trip of a movie, dipped in the headache inducing 'deep reds' of Brass's fellow countryman Dario Argento, but here too are Danilo Donati's gorgeously grandiose sets; here are exquisite, hand-crafted larger-than-life sculptures modeled on real Roman artifacts; and everywhere, superbly strange details, rendered almost subliminal, such as a white rat pulling a tiny golden chariot.<br><br>Except we never get to see any of it properly. At one point, amid all the bump 'n' grind, a man on stilts clops into shot. As he slowly pegs it from one end of the sound stage to the other, you can't help wondering if he's muttering under his breath in Italian, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever. What *I* do takes skill, you know?\"","user":"Ali_John_Catterall","rank":[40,52]}]
