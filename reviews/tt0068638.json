[{"title":"Hypnotic, violent classic","rating":2,"date":"2 October 2002","review":"Was wondering why they don't make films like this anymore.  Then it dawned on me.  It has ambiguous morals and doesn't particularly ask for or seek redemption.  The hero is a killer and bank robber, he says little and therefore you should have to work hard to empathize with him.  But it comes easy because everyone else around Doc McCoy is ten times worse than he is. And Doc is played by Steve McQueen.  A magnificent brooding presence who's character doesn't stop to question his actions, because if he did he'd die or get arrested.  And this is where it is so much better than a contemporary film of the same vein.  It's not made with actors who are scared that their image might be tarnished or misunderstood, it is not made by film-makers who are scared they might upset someone, it is not made by people who particularly need to be loved.  So what you get is a story that rings true, a piece of fiction that at no time stops to apologize for itself.  It grabs you, says this is what I am, and if you're hooked then great.  If not go and watch Bambi or something.<br><br>A bona fide classic piece of storytelling.","user":"narmkids","rank":[135,148]},{"title":"This movie is a true masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"17 December 2001","review":"I consider \"The getaway\" a true masterpiece, on the same level of Sam Peckinpah's major achievements (save \"The wild bunch\", of course). I learn from IMDb comments that the final cut of the movie was made by other people (McQueen ?!) than the director. Moreover the plot is much unfaithful to the original novel... Well... anyway the result is excellent.<br><br>Doc (Steve McQueen) is a tough, laconic guy, Carol (Ali McGraw) a tough, laconic woman. In some sense, they mostly speak just for technical reasons: \"Take the money-bag\", \"Don't scratch your wound\"... If they've nothing to say, they keep quiet. They seem shy to express their reciprocal feelings, even unable to say \"I love you\". Doc cannot accept what Carol has done, although just to help him out of jail. They both silently suffer for this, with some explosions of violence by Doc, and a ready gritty reply by Carol. But the audience well understand from their body-language how much they love each other.   I think that McQueen and McGraw made a superb job in their difficult roles. Strangely enough, their performances, as well as their lines, received much criticism. I fear that people didn't like their job since they are too used to the current way of acting: hysterical, screaming, awfully clown-like. With lines that are just floods of stupid, pointless, annoying chats. A not welcome legacy of the style created by Tarantino, Oliver Stone and imitators. Nothing could be more far-away from Peckinpah's artistic taste.<br><br>\nThe story of the movie is linear, but not trivial. The cinematography and montage are outstanding. The pace is somewhat slow, partially due to the great care paid to details. But when it's the time of action, nobody can compete with Peckinpah's grand style.<br><br>In every movie of his, Peckinpah shows his genius with some astonishing, stark new cinematic ideas. In \"The getaway\" we find the paramount representation of the \"power of the shot-gun\". Doc's shot-gun bullets destroy police-cars, devastate a whole hotel, demolish an elevator, knock down a door slaughtering the thug hidden behind... the recoil of the weapon lifts Doc's shoulder... Who remembers that this stuff, nowadays almost a cliche in action-movies, was introduced in \"The getaway\"? It's worth noting that an early imitator of Peckinpah's \"shot-gun scenes\" was Steven Spielberg in \"Sugarland express\".<br><br>Some words on the sub-plot concerned with the hateful Rudy (Al Lettieri) and the cretinous Fran (Sally Struthers). This part of the film is deliberately disagreeable, up to an almost unbearable point. As usual, Peckinpah doesn't miss his chance to be hated by the feminists, with his design of Fran. A damned idiot, nymphomaniac just for stupidity. At the end, when Doc hits her (a punch straight on her prating, whimpering mouth!) the director nearly provokes a standing ovation by the audience (men and women, as well). If that's not cinematic genius, what else is it? And, speaking of imitators, how much Tarantino's characters owe to Rudy and Fran?<br><br>Perhaps \"The getaway\" could have been even better without extraneous interference. Nonetheless, it is a fantastic film, a must-see.","user":"pzanardo","rank":[61,67]},{"title":"Sam Peckinpah's Best Violence Ballet","rating":9,"date":"22 September 2007","review":"Steve McQueen and Sam Peckinpah teamed to do two straight films, probably some of the best work in both of their careers. But the difference in a nice character study like Junior Bonner and a tough crime drama like The Getaway shows the versatility of both these remarkable men. The Getaway seems to take its inspiration from John Huston's classic, The Asphalt Jungle.<br><br>McQueen is a career criminal whose parole has once again been denied in the ten year stretch he's doing. Wife Ali McGraw submits to parole board chief Ben Johnson's sexual advances to spring McQueen. <br><br>But the corrupt Johnson isn't just about sexual harassment. He wants McQueen to rob a bank that his brother is a director, to cover a nice case of embezzlement. He even recruits another pair of criminals, Bo Hopkins and Al Lettieri as part of the gang. <br><br>Of course the plan goes wrong as a bank guard is killed and then Hopkins is killed in a double-cross by Lettieri who then fails to do the same to McQueen and McGraw. After that it's a three way race to the border between Johnson's men, Lettieri, and McQueen. <br><br>Al Lettieri is a talent that was lost to us way too soon. He played some of the best villains in the early seventies and this one is one of them. He kidnaps veterinarian Jack Dodson and his slut of a wife Sally Struthers. Soon she's more than willing to go and be his girl. Struthers has a great part, so far from being Gloria Bunker Stivic on All in the Family.<br><br>My favorite Sam Peckinpah moment in all of his films is that climax at Dub Taylor's flea bag hotel where all the forces meet and shoot up the place. It's Peckinpah's best violence ballet in all of his films, I never tire of seeing it.<br><br>The whole film was shot in Texas and I'm not sure how residents of Texas might like this picture of their state. It seems to be one very violent place and a very corrupt one as well.<br><br>But I like The Getaway very much, it's my favorite Sam Peckinpah film next to Ride the High Country.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[29,32]}]
