[{"title":"Can't see a few future technology","rating":5,"date":"1 March 2018","review":"Like most of the movies starred Justin Chatwin, this is over the head for most of the viewers. As a sci-fi thriller film it focuses on a tech company, which is developing software capable of uploading a person's consciousness and memories to a virtual space. There is a lot of psychedelic drug referenced and shown used in the movie. But there is no special sort of instrument is shown in here, that's a huge downside. What is the fun and benefit of a sci-fi film, if you can't see a few future technology.","user":"robbierehman","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Posted to Balance out the fakes","rating":28,"date":"28 February 2018","review":"Out of three reviews, two of them are gushing 10-star from people who only signed up to IMDB a week or two ago and have no activity other than leaving those reviews. Don't trust them.","user":"ftpdnb102","rank":[21,29]},{"title":"Nothing special","rating":6,"date":"8 February 2018","review":"A typical C-grade amateur production with cheap props and a story told over many times. This is very low budget. Acting, directing and writing is very novice.","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[24,36]}]
