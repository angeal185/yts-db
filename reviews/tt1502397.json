[{"title":"Seems Sony bought over 100 10/10 reviews on this title","rating":5,"date":"28 March 2020","review":"First off: The moderation on this website is absolutely terrible. I just had a look at the 10/10 reviews for this movie, and there's over 150 written 10/10 reviews from accounts that have 'Bad Boys for Life' as their ONLY review... this is a very very strong indicator of a fake review. This movie's rating currently stands on 7.2 but if you take all the fake 10/10 reviews out, then this movie's ACTUAL score is more towards 6 or 5.5<br><br>Anyways, let me continue with my review:<br><br>Do you recognize the names 'Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah' at all? No? Me neither... But for some reason the production company chose to use these unknown guys, instead of Michael Bay who did the first 2 movies.<br><br>This movie spoils the reputation that Bad Boys 1 &amp; 2 had. This movie is significantly worse than the first two. It's very unrealistic in many scenes and it's extremely predictable too.<br><br>They also use more CGI fire in this movie than anything else. I'm sure that 10% of the movie's budget went to animate all the damn fire in this movie. If you wanna use 2nd rate directors, then you'll get 2nd rate results.","user":"0w0","rank":[202,244]},{"title":"Who writes this crap","rating":1,"date":"28 March 2020","review":"A terrible movie.\nScript horrible! Numerous goofs! Did they get paid for this? Not even entertaining. No acting....just fooling around. Plot? Copied and predictable. I'm nauseated.","user":"frankgarcia1957","rank":[139,182]},{"title":"Thrown together","rating":1,"date":"9 February 2020","review":"The plot is very predictable even though there are a load of mistakes when referencing the earlier movies.<br><br>Marcus and Mike went to the academy together, and somehow Mike got pulled out to do an undercover operation without Marcus knowing!?<br><br>Rather than just having the two lead characters, they've brought in a team for them to work with which takes the emphasis from them. It's like a cop version of Blade Trinity.","user":"steveavis-32783","rank":[144,191]}]
