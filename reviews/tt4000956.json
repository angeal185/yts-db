[{"title":"More Annoying Than Funny","rating":3,"date":"14 December 2016","review":"Former SNL cast member Taran Killam portrays Roger, a straight-laced and fastidious Chief of Staff to a Seattle Congressman, who suddenly informs Roger he's retiring. The Congressman offers to endorse Roger if he wants to run, and he enthusiastically accepts.<br><br>First though, Roger will take a week off and go with his girlfriend Gwen (Gillian Jacobs) to visit her family at their lakeside cabins, where he intends to propose. I imagine you have already guessed things will not go according to plan.<br><br>I'm sure most of us have seen movies where there's always one character that is incredibly frenetic and obnoxious with no respect for other's boundaries, yet the remainder of the family just thinks he's wonderful. Such is the case here with Todd (Bobby Moynihan), possibly Roger's future brother-in-law, who makes Roger's time at the cabin a living hell. <br><br>The late Chris Farley often played this type of character, but Farley had such an endearing quality about him that it was usually very funny. Unfortunately, the character of Todd here just became highly annoying, even painful to witness for me, as the film progressed. Despite the customary 180's near the end of the movie, the damage had already been done for me, The one bright spot in the film was the understated humor of Kumail Nanjami, who I thought was quite funny as Riggleman, Roger's top aide.<br><br>Overall, I felt this movie provided a few laughs here and there, but the intended humor just didn't work for me.","user":"larrys3","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"Not funny at all. A pitiful attempt at the holiday movie.","rating":1,"date":"28 September 2016","review":"This must be one of the worst movies I have seen all year. As a comedy there is almost nothing funny about this desperate attempt at humour. The characters are stereotypical and one dimensional, and though there was obviously a big enough budget to create a platform for some potential fun, the dialogue and character development doesn't fail to disappoint time and time again. I don't understand why good actors like Gillian Jacobs would sign up for this type of drivel. But actually I'm just saying this to try and fill up the prerequisite 10 line of print that this site requires for one to submit a review. Btw, the character of the step-brother is utterly pathetic. Why do people think this type of humour (South African spelling) is funny? I'm not asking for the next holy grail in comedy, but at least make a better attempt at finding authentic humour. <br><br>The only reason I am posting this review is to warn anyone who hasn't seen it not to waste their time.","user":"tinusoosthuizen86","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"A Saturnday Night Live sketch that becomes too long.","rating":5,"date":"30 September 2016","review":"Taran Killam and Bobby Moynihan,attempt to prove that they have what it takes to be like other Saturday Night Live not ready for Prime Time players, who have become movie stars with Brother Nature.<br><br>Produced by their boss over at SNL, Lorne Michaels, he gives these two (and another one of his employees, Kenan Thompson) the time off to make this flick.<br><br>Killan plays a campaign manager, about to run for congress at the same time propose to his girlfriend, when he goes on a weekend get away to meet her family that includes her sister's boyfriend, played by Moynihan whose far too into the idea that the two could poetically be brother-In-Laws <br><br>Nothing out of the ordinary that makes this very funny, expect for Moynihan whose performance does stand out despite Killan playing the lead straight man.<br><br>Kumail Nanjiani as Riggleman, Killan's friend and co worker in the movie, had some note worthy laughs as well, and the chemistry between Bill Pullman and Rita Wilson was hilarious too.<br><br>Altogether though it works if you are a Saturday Night Live fan cause that's the comedy that's displayed here.","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[5,8]}]
