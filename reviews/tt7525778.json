[{"title":"Late night laughs","rating":7,"date":"10 August 2018","review":"I put this on in the background with absolutely no expectations and ended up stopping what I was doing to watch it. An extremely silly, buddy-comedy that is surprisingly well executed, written and acted. It follows a lot of typical clich√©s for the genre, but does it well. Would recommend to anyone looking for a late-night stoner comedy and some good laughs.","user":"daniellejeanene","rank":[112,135]},{"title":"Realistic","rating":10,"date":"27 August 2018","review":"Contains the most realistic looking severed dick prosthetic I've ever seen","user":"mmday-14025","rank":[43,53]},{"title":"What's with the one star reviews?","rating":6,"date":"11 August 2018","review":"I really don't understand some imdb reviewers. Everything is too the extreme. Worst movie ever? Really? These are the same people who say this about every movie they don't like. It's the WORST.<br><br>This movie isn't spectacular. It's ok. It's worth watching. I felt like the laughs were consistent, but a little weak. It runs about fifteen mins longer than it needs to be as well.","user":"emceegusto","rank":[66,90]}]
