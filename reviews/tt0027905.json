[{"title":"Painful to watch, my eye. It's solid entertainment,","rating":6,"date":"18 April 2006","review":"The Lone Star and early Repulic two-reeler \"oaters,\" i.e., hour-long westerns, ably served as John Wayne's training ground throughout the Thirties. I think most of the Duke's 1933-39 oaters entertaining as hell.<br><br>The cast, writers and production crew get in, get it done and get out, all in an hour give or take a few minutes. And they usually did it well. Were they corny? You bet, pardner. We're they sappy? At times. We're they scrappy? You bet yer boots! <br><br>It was in these films that Wayne and actor/stuntman extraordinaire Yakima Canutt developed the draw-back punch that's become the standard in film fights ever since. <br><br>The Lonely Trail, an early Republic feature from it's first year, 1936, is involving and action-packed and loaded with classic early western character actors of the era, such as Cy Kendall, Sam Flint and the legendary Canutt. It was directed by the king of '30s B westerns, Joe Kane and also featured a young Ann Rutherford \"Snowflake.\" These are not up there with the great films of the era, not even close. However, for fans of the genre, they are a most entertaining way to spend an hour.","user":"estabansmythe","rank":[14,19]},{"title":"Great Cast for Republic","rating":10,"date":"23 September 2019","review":"John Wayne leads a great cast of western actors including Ann Rutherford with 2 stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Stuntman extraordinaire Yakima Canutt as Bull does some great work in front of the camera as well. Lafe McKee even does a cameo. It all starts when Duke is called upon to clean up some carpetbaggers led by Cy Kendall. Bob Burns starts shooting due to Jim Toney's Union hat and him and Duke are off to the races. Great to see Fred 'Snowflake' Toones with over 200 films and the most \"colorful\" face for Republic. Bob Kortman played a powerful role as the General's henchman and Dennis Moore is very convincing as the man on the run from the General and even his old friend Captain Ashley. \"The Lonely Trail\" has some wonderful moments and a must see for John Wayne fans.","user":"frank4122","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Enjoyable post Civil War drama about the power of intolerance.","rating":5,"date":"9 May 2014","review":"It seems that after the Civil War ended, some resentful Yankees took on the land of Dixie with a vengeance, sending in \"Carpetbaggers\" to try and teach the people of the south a lesson for having separated from the union. In doing so, these people are breaking the law themselves, stealing their land, increasing taxes to unspeakable amounts, and shooting rumored enemies on sight for no reason other than just trying to fight for their rights. John Wayne plays a Northern soldier who tries to expose the injustice, and takes up with an old childhood pal (Ann Rutherford) who at first doesn't think he's on their side. It's ironic to see Rutherford here, as just two years later, she would be the much younger Andy Hardy's girlfriend in a series of MGM comedies where she appeared to be younger than she was rather than someone who could be the same age as John Wayne. This mixes both comedy and drama with political intrigue, and ranks as one of John Wayne's best Republic films before he went on to superstardom with \"Stagecoach\". The print released through Olive Films is much better than some of the same films which he did at the same time that fell into the public domain, so that makes this one a lot more watchable, even though many of those films are entertaining in their own right.","user":"mark.waltz","rank":[3,4]}]
