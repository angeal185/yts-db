[{"title":"Love and redemption: great themes","rating":8,"date":"22 January 2014","review":"Last week I saw American HUSTLE and couldn't understand why the critics have so raved about it. Yesterday I saw THE RAILWAY MAN and can't understand why the critics have been so dismissive. It's a tense story about one of the great horrors of World War Two. Based on a true story, it's also a tale of love and redemption, two of the cinema's (and literature's) greatest themes. And it serves up a vivid reminder that the Japanese of the 1940s were, like the Nazis, from a different generation, almost from a different race. <br><br>David Lean's BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI casts a huge shadow over this movie. THE RAILWAY MAN lacks the \"majesty\" of Lean's famous epic, but I suspect that Alex Guinness's performance would seem very theatrical by the standards of screen acting today. If anything, Colin Firth gives a slightly under-powered performance (and Nicole Kidman's part gives her too little to work with), but Jeremy Irvine is intensely believable as the wartime Lomax, geeky and quietly heroic. The horrors of the forced labour that built the railway and the relentless brutality of the Japanese soldiers are both vividly conveyed, and the ending manages to be poignant without trespassing into mawkishness.<br><br>This is a strange movie, grim but highly watchable. Arguably, it could have been tougher, more savage, but then it might be harder to sit through.","user":"davidgee","rank":[92,104]},{"title":"Fantastic","rating":10,"date":"23 April 2014","review":"I read the short storyline of the film before viewing and it had intrigued me. I came into it with an open mind - at first romance and then the inescapable drama. The acting by Firth was amazing. I was mesmerized. It may be slow (to some of a lesser attention span) at first, but eased into a psychological drama that holds on tight and will not release until the finale. Spectacular cinematography, the scenes are beautiful and real. It is a wake up call to those who have not/do not understand the great span of WWII - brings much needed insight into the history of this particular banker's war. Ultimately, this film beautifully portrays the ultimate power of forgiveness. Which brought tears to my eyes, in the panic and hysteria that the world now feels due to war and terror, it is good to know that there is some shred of humanity that exists and has hope to exist in the future.","user":"allisonclaire81","rank":[63,73]},{"title":"What would you do if you came face to face with your enemy?","rating":9,"date":"10 January 2014","review":"Words cannot do this film justice. There are no words to describe how amazing the true story of Eric Lomax really was, and I do not want to give away the entire story here. But suffice to say that I was fully engrossed in the film throughout its entirety. From the moment we see Eric and Patty meet to the emotional ending,I could not bring myself to look away or even to reach down for my drink in the cinema. Be prepared for some harrowing and intense scenes. But bear in mind that these are required for us to understand completely the dilemma faced by Eric at the end of his story. The actors portray their characters beautifully, with so much angst and emotion that I found myself empathising with them all the way through. If you are interested whatsoever in stories of war, survival, trauma, revenge, forgiveness and the ethical dilemmas wrapped up in them all, then this is a film you should definitely see. Tears rolled down my face as the credits rolled, and I found myself thinking about the movie long after watching it. Highly recommended.","user":"Travel_Chick_UK","rank":[88,104]}]
