[{"title":"For Those Who Didn't Understand What Was Going On Events Explained ****Spoilers****","rating":8,"date":"31 May 2019","review":"If you watched the film to the end and have no idea what was happening, this \"review\" is for you. There are spoilers galore, so beware....<br><br>First, the movie's timeline is not linear. It's in the present and the past and sometimes goes back to previous scenes to give you a different perspective from what you originally thought you were seeing. We see the story arc of girls left behind at an all girls Catholic school during holiday: Rose an older student (who stayed behind at the school because she thinks she's pregnant and lied to her parents about when to pick her up so she could see her boyfriend about her pregnancy), Kat, a freshman student who's parents haven't come to get her either and its not entirely clear why (later Kat says they are dead), and Joan, a girl on her way to the all girls school.<br><br>Ostensibly, this movie is about the devil and possession. It is not. It is about longing, loneliness, and mental illness.<br><br>Little Kat is lonely. At first you assume she's just a little strange, but when near the end of the film we see some scenes again (marking the days on a calendar until mom and dad come, singing at the recital, staring out of the window while sitting alone in a classroom) we come to see that she is a very lonely little girl and most likely not right in her head and we start to realize she may have been mentally ill all along.<br><br>Everyone is saying that her transition to wanting and accepting possession by a demon was too sudden, but it's not (once you see those scenes again), she was already \"off\" and with the right suggestion (Rose tells her when they are alone that two of the nuns are devil worshipers), she goes right for it (later she tells Rose, she's \"too late\", i.e. her friendship is no longer needed, she has the devil for companionship now).<br><br>Early on we see \"Joan's\" arc and through quick cuts we can surmise that Joan has escaped from a mental hospital. She's headed toward the school. At first you think the journey is being taken at the same time Kat and Rose are staying at the school But \"Joan\" in reality is Kat, nine years after she killed everyone left at the school. She's escaped and is using Joan's ID (apparently a nurse strangled at the mental institution), whom she's killed to escape.<br><br>She's headed back to where she had companionship with the devil. Only to find out that the couple who give her a lift are the parents of Rose (whom she killed nine years ago) and are coincidentally headed up to the school. They apparently do not recognized sad goes outside to warm up the car because a storm is coming, Kat/Joan sees a a knife on a plate, which she later uses to kill Rose's parents while in their car, and brings their heads to her old companion, the devil.<br><br>The devil never existed, of course. But this is a Catholic school, so her mental illness manifested into devil possession.<br><br>Her phone calls may have been partly real or imagined. Early on Kat says her parents are dead. Are they? We have a brief scene at the beginning where it appears her dad comes to get her and silently walks her to a wrecked car where we see black hair (presumably mom's) blowing in the wind outside the window. When this did happen? The year before the events? Did her mom's death and apparent father's abandonment set off her mental illness and loneliness? That, I can't tell you. Maybe they both died in a car accident and she's dreaming her dad came to get her and show her the wreck. But then, why did the officials at the school believe her parents were coming for her? The existence of Kat's parents is not clear.<br><br>The carnage starts when Kat gets a phone call and a distorted voice tells her to kill all the c***ts, which she does. The headmaster shows up with the police (did Kat lure them with a phone call?), finds the dead bodies of Rose and the two nuns who had been caring for them until their parents showed. The cop finds her in the basement and after warning Kat repeatedly to put down her knife shoots her in the shoulder (you see the scar on \"Joan\" later). Presumably she's spent the last years in the mental hospital making no friends or feeling love and is heading back to rejoin the devil, when Rose's parents pick her up and she gets a chance to sacrifice them. The devil being fickle (and only in her mind) doesn't show up.","user":"Mehki_Girl","rank":[174,195]},{"title":"I think my expectations were too high, or this movie just missed the mark.","rating":4,"date":"5 July 2017","review":"The Blackcoat's Daughter, originally titled February, was a film that received quite some buzz during it's initial screenings at film festivals back in 2015. It eventually got a quiet release in limited theatrical screenings in February (of course) 2017 before its home release. <br><br>As a connoisseur of horror films, I was intrigued (even though I dislike Emma Roberts) especially because despite its derivative themes of demonic possession, the film apparently does new things with the formula. Bought it day one and I have to say I was kind of disappointed.<br><br>In a boarding school, students Katherine \"Kat\" (Kiernan Shipka) and Rose (Lucy Boynton) stay behind during school break while the other girls leave with their families. Kat's parents don't come because they are deceased while Rose intentionally gave her parents the wrong date, she suspects that she might be pregnant and doesn't yet want to face her parents about it. The third girl, \"Joan\" (Emma Roberts), is a mystery as she gets off on a bus stop and is implied to be an escaped mental patient as she removes her hospital bracelet in the bathroom. She is soon picked up by an elderly couple (James Remar and Lauren Holly) who mention that they are on their way to the boarding school.<br><br>Watching the film I was underwhelmed because it is hollow and has no soul. It's plenty creepy with looming hallways and dark spaces but there's never anything here that's actually frightening. Kat is orphaned and as a result is supposed to be metaphorically raised by darkness because she summons a demon in the boiler room after Rose taunts her with a story that the nuns are satanists and worship demons. I never once got the indication that Kat was lonely, sure she looks gloomy but she's like that for the entire movie even before we find out what happened, she never grieves her parents and never looks lost and desperate. She has no character arc or any semblance of a personality. It makes it hard to believe that she'd befriend the demon out of loneliness as a result, the demon itself also doesn't have a threatening presence. I never got chills of dread about the demon or what it's capable of, it isn't unnerving and almost feels like a plot device threaded thorough the film so that the movie can exist.<br><br>Rose is equally as uninteresting and hollow. Her entire character is just her hanging out with her boyfriend and interacting with Kat for a small conversation. I understand why she stayed behind but the problem is that I know it but I don't feel it. Rose never once looks anxious or panicked about the possibility of being pregnant, if you didn't catch it the first time you would probably never pick up on it. There's also never any friction or tension when she is with her boyfriend over the fact that he might have gotten her pregnant. She has no arc and never becomes involved in the plot as anything more than another plot device. In the third act she finally has her period, much to her relief, and is suddenly killed by a possessed Kat after she also murdered the nuns, and offers their decapitated heads as an offering to the demon before she is blasted with a shotgun by the police and sent to an institution. No resolution, nothing, her death carries no meaning because she never had any either as a character.<br><br>This leads me to my next point, the \"big\" twist in the film is that \"Joan\" is actually an older Kat after she escaped the asylum and has returned to the town 9 years later to return to the boarding school and is actually picked up by Rose's parents who are heading to the school to place flowers at her grave. The glaring problems with this twist is that it's pretty obvious. Joan/Kat is never in the same scene with the other girls and exists in her own subplot completely separated from the boarding school. While Joan/Kat is showering, we can see a shotgun wound on her shoulder where Kat was shot before the twist is revealed, she also looks extremely similar to Kat in terms of hair color and facial appearance. The dead giveaway is that in the diner scene with Joan/Kat and Rose's father, he reveals that their daughter Rose died 9 years earlier and shows her a picture of her before Joan/Kat heads to the bathroom and starts to giggle before we see the driver's license of the woman she killed and stole it from, who was named Joan Marsh.<br><br>The film clumsily ends with her killing the parents in their car before decapitating them and taking the heads to the now closed down boarding school. She again offers the heads as a sacrifice in the boiler room and yet nothing happens. She walks out in despair and starts to cry uncontrollably. The point you were supposed to get was that she is lonely and wanted the demon back, because she was exorcised by a priest before she was institutionalized and wanted it to stay with her. There's no raw emotions to this scene because we never got a sense of desperation or loneliness from Kat, the exorcism scene is the only time in the whole film she expresses her attachment to the demon. With no emotional knowledge of the situation there's no impact.<br><br>This film reminds me of Proxy, both have loosely attached events with a scattered plot messily clashed together with no semblance or fluidity to it. The few redeeming qualities I saw are the eerie and beautiful winter setting, the unnerving music, and the cinematography is somewhat creepy. But otherwise this movie is soulless and has no weight attached to it. It's forgettable. I still recommend you check it out if you're curious, just temper your expectations because it isn't as good as you'd hope it is.","user":"Internetghost","rank":[159,201]},{"title":"A Great Atmospheric Slow Burn that's not for everyone","rating":9,"date":"29 November 2016","review":"DISCLAIMER: This film requires a patient viewer who likes slow burns and atmospheric dread rather than jump scares or thriller action. Many of the user reviews on here trash the movie for being too slow or too boring, but this movie was never meant to appeal to everyone. If you thought this was boring or too slow, everyone has different taste and that's fine. <br><br>First off, the biggest strength of this movie is the icy dread and unease that this movie produces from the opening scene right up to the tragic final shot. This tense atmosphere never relents, even during mundane scenes, and left that dread in the pit of my stomach for the entirety of the film. Everything feels like there's something not quite right with it.<br><br>The cinematography and lighting are dark and brooding, with every room dimly lit and every setting having a sinister feel. This dreary feel to all the scenes almost never lets up and keeps the dread at a maximum. <br><br>The sound design is quite good, using prolonged silence to make scenes feel uneasy and eerie sound effects and music to heighten tension and fear. This is one of the loudest quiet movies I've ever seen, and the subtle arctic winds blowing and faint whispers and static drone are masterfully used. <br><br>The setting and environment add another layer to the dread of the film. Set in remote upstate New York in the dead of winter, the deep snow is suffocating and chilling. You can really feel the isolation of the school where Kat and Rose are staying, and the school itself is creepy in its own right, with dark and foreboding hallways and a glum exterior. <br><br>The story is not spoon-fed to viewers and is a bit of a puzzle that reveals itself one brief detail at a time, and it can be confusing on the first viewing of it. It keeps you guessing as to what's happening, and has some twists that make you rethink what you saw. The plot is told in an odd fashion, with each main character having their own \"arc\" in a sense and lots of brief flashbacks by Joan and Kat. The ending is a good payoff for all the dread and tension built up, though a bit rushed. The final shot is beautiful and haunting, and has stuck with me ever since. <br><br>Kiernan Shipka is very creepy and unsettling as Kat, and gives the best performance in the film. Even those who did not like this movie gave Shipka props for a wonderful job done. Emma Roberts steps into a different role than she usually does, and does an excellent job as Joan. Her body language said more than the few lines she has. The rest of the cast also turns in solid performances, the acting in this is a great strength next to its atmosphere.<br><br>This is an excellent but polarizing slow burn non-traditional possession horror film, and is impressive for Osgood Perkins' directorial debut.","user":"ReguIator","rank":[133,181]}]
