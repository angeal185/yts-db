[{"title":"The Trailer lied to me!!!","rating":2,"date":"27 June 2015","review":"In all honesty when I saw the trailer I thought to myself this looks like a good movie. The concept was a nice idea and it certainly had a creepy vibe to it. Even when I started watching it I could see it was getting straight into the story. Yet that is only where it had my interest. From there on out.... It started to fall apart for me....<br><br>First of all the way the story unfolded was pretty poor. Like I said earlier the concept of the film was good though how they laid it out was pretty weak. Like how Anna gets so seriously angry about Madison missing her wedding since Madison gained a fear of water since she nearly drowned to death. If it was my friend, I would give them the benefit of the doubt as they nearly died and are somewhat traumatised. Yet no we shall play along with the fact her friends have had enough and want to help her by stuffing her in a tub of water. (I have seen so many therapies for this particular phobia work exactly how they did it). Anyway I digress. Its little things like this in the story that drive me a little mad as it just doesn't flow well enough for me.<br><br>Now you may say, well its a horror, the story is not meant to matter. Be there for the scares! Well sorry but b*ll*cks to that. I never got a single jump out of it. Not even my fianc√©e and she jumps easy, she ended up slumping over from boredom. Other than the fact the Drownsman looked like a runaway Orc from Lord of the Rings hoping to pursue a new career in Hollywood, his killings just did not do it for me. He just killed them like his namesake, which clearly the writer couldn't make exciting. Plus all of his attacks were very much the same. You knew when he was coming and even when he did all it was, was his bloody hand!<br><br>So as you can see I was clearly disappointed by this film and if you do care about the storyline you will be too. I only gave this film two stars as I still reckon the plot line of this film could have worked. So please avoid this and watch something more interesting. Like the steam off a pile of sh*t.<br><br>P.S. The worst quote of the film was Madison saying \"To be honest, I didn't believe until today\" which brings up many questions.<br><br>And the worst reaction is when Madison trying to save her remaining living friend. Pathetic!","user":"madspike212","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"The parts are decent, but put together the result is not great.","rating":4,"date":"18 June 2015","review":"When I started watching this I was seriously considering giving up on it and watching something else. I checked my computer, surfed the web, not paying it full attention. (note, this is something I extremely rarely do) But it got hold of me just enough for me to watch it to the end.<br><br>(maybe I shouldn't have, it did not give me much)<br><br>The make up, the effects, the acting, everything is actually not bad, but the sum of it is just not very good, and not nearly entertaining enough. The story has it's kind of cool elements, but mostly it's not much to talk about.<br><br>The Drownsman is sort of like 'Nightmare on Elm Street' with water instead of dreams. <br><br>It's a shame this is not better, because I think it could have been pretty cool, had it just been.. better. And I can't really say what it is missing, either. I think it might have something to do with the premise. I don't want to spoil anything, but the parts happening in \"the other place\" didn't do it for me at all. Boring and uninspired.<br><br>I will say this though, good job to the actors! These girls must have been cold and wet a lot shooting this. Well done. Shame the movie isn't better.","user":"Finfrosk86","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"This movies all wet.","rating":1,"date":"16 June 2016","review":"I admit the beginning started out intriguing but after a scene involving a bathtub,a girl's fear of water, and some lame villain and hilariously bad attempt at using water as a tool to SCARE the viewer with I knew this movie was a loser.<br><br>The main actor was okay in the beginning , but then the movie kept going and her acting as well as the other ACTORS in this movie got worse and worse .<br><br>At least unlike the unneeded uninteresting cardboard characters she was at least...okay .<br><br>The end I won't ruin but I will say it was hilariously bad that's all really.<br><br>I thought this was gonna be SCARY...not the least bit.<br><br>I thought the villain would be interesting and creative ....none of the above.<br><br>I thought the PLOT would make sense ....No sense was made out of this film in any capacity whatsoever . <br><br>The special effects were unimaginative , the deaths were repetitive and hilarious, and the victims were some of the stupidest and useless victims I've seen in a while in a horror movie.<br><br>This isn't a horror movie either it's a HORRIBLE movie .","user":"avalonjoyous","rank":[4,4]}]
