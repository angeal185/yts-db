DO NOT WATCH!","rating":14,"date":"14 December 2018","review":"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I was maybe, MAYBE, 15 minutes in and knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that I wasn't going to like it. The worst acting, the worst plot, the worst everything. Don't waste your money on it. It's thundering outside and it's scarier than this movie. I've never written a review on a movie before, never. You're welcome.","user":"cosplaygirls","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Just a scam for money.","rating":2,"date":"10 September 2018","review":"Amy (Angela Durazo) is going to have twins and then decides not to have twins. She and John (Nathan Schellerup), father of said ex-twins, are journalists. They travel to a small town where \"crossbreeds\" live. These would be a cross from the children of Lilith through Cain, and those of Eve through Seth. Seth comes from the Egyptian Set, who was their Cain, just to confuse the issue with facts. These folks have twins and one is from Adam and the other is from...not Adam but Cain from Adam so the terminology and theology confused me. <br><br>Anyway, Amy doesn't know her parents, has a special medallion from her mother and an old woman in town is also a redhead who takes an interest in the medallion. They over-killed the clues and confused the theology. A guy in a mask flashing across the scene wasn't enough to hold my interest. I also hate soundtracks that are one finger playing a piano. <br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Redbox rental.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[3,3]}]
