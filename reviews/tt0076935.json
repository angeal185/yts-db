[{"title":"Very Good Road Film","rating":9,"date":"6 December 2009","review":"This is a film about three people who are very lonely for different reasons and find themselves all on the way to Hokkaido. What seemed like a very odd trio and a very odd premise became a wonderful film about hope, forgiveness and belonging. Extra points are given for the film being set in Hokkaido and not Tokyo, it gives the film much mire meaning and authenticity. Actually, Hokkaido itself is a co-star of this film, as you see it rolling along out the car window. The acting is superb and the film is a major crowd pleaser. Director Yamada Yoji's films are kind of hit and miss to me (I've only seen a few Tora-san films) but this one really kept me interested and, along the way, I cared about each character more. Watch this, its a feel good film about life.","user":"crossbow0106","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"A pleasant road trip","rating":24,"date":"24 December 2002","review":"The plot is a simple one but the characterizations and travel episodes fill the movie out. When the travelers near their destination, the film shows an affection for small towns as we look out the car window and see the old buildings and the residents passing by. I was surprised to hear a performance of the song \"Can-Can Musume\" which I haven't heard for over 50 years.","user":"noirfilm","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"The Yellow Handkerchief of Hope","rating":8,"date":"8 April 2006","review":"I watched the movie, and the plot is similar to the song. However, the \"ribbons\" were replaced with \"handkerchiefs\". A post was used in lieu of an oak tree.<br><br>Away from these similarities, I found the movie entertaining. The movie is a ballad of hope and friendship.<br><br>The ensemble performance is a perfect mix. Ken Takakura's stoicism versus Tetsuya Takeda's humor is balanced by Kaori Momoi's character.<br><br>The movie offers a lot of symbolisms. Their journey is same to life. The destination is uncertain. There might be ups and downs (vividly depicted by the good cinematography showing the different places in Hokkaido).<br><br>The handkerchief is a metaphor of a person's aspirations. There may be hindrances that discourage him or her to pursue it. Thankfully, there are friends and loved ones who cheer us up to go on.<br><br>A yellow handkerchief is a clear sunny day we are looking forward to every time we wake up. A movie like this deserved the recognition bestowed upon it.","user":"dchozenwan","rank":[8,12]}]
