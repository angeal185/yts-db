[{"title":"Painful to watch","rating":1,"date":"24 September 2014","review":"Really just a waste of time. The acting is incredibly stiff, I even found myself prompting the actors with their lines, it's so predictable. The score is incredibly cheesy and obviously put together by a student filmmaker. The timing is horrible, the actors lines being delivered too soon or too late in almost every scene. Glaringly obvious mistakes and bloopers throughout. I was going to point some out but I'd be here all day. The story did not flow, make any sense or engage the audience. I actually found myself rooting for the 'infected' just to kill off some of the more disappointing leads. I honestly think that the positive reviews on here are planted by the friends/relatives of the actors and producers because it's just that bad. Wooden acting. Poor score. Mediocre story. Don't bother.","user":"s0152374","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"I'd rather drive a Phillip's head into my skull","rating":1,"date":"3 April 2017","review":"This \"film\" is nothing more than a script of \"what not to do while acting\". I love Quarantine 1 and 2. I love the Rec films, but this Quarantine LA film is enough for you to wish a zombie infection happened and the actors of this film went first. I'd say the actors were flat, but I am curious if they even had a pulse...or a comprehension of how people even talk. The acting was garbage. The lighting was stupid (you have a light in front of the actor hanging from the ceiling, but close up shots you shine light from the side only? The director is licking-windows special). The film is the prolapsed rectum of the whole series. Gross. Unwatchable. Garbage.","user":"thetrueresidentevil","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Yes underwhelmed.","rating":29,"date":"29 November 2013","review":"It felt like you were watching it play out in real time.Good for some things,not this. They want me too say more It was as boring as watching Paint dry. Had no real connection to the characters Nor did I care about them. William F looked an acted like a crazy old coot,not a surgeon. The Boobs,well they were boobs for no reason. The infected looked like a bunch of fools at a backyard Halloween party looking for something to do. Have I said enough,it wasted our time,don't let it waste yours. It was a story idea that would've been something,Had the story more meat. I was hoping for it to be better than the M.M. show. If there were only something good to say about it I would,but I can't think of...oh wait it ended.","user":"vkka","rank":[9,13]}]
