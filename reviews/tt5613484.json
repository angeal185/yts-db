[{"title":"Like the 90's if you were there","rating":9,"date":"13 May 2019","review":"This movie was the 90's skate scene to a T. The music, a mix of punk, indie and hip hop, the clothes, baggy pants and 2XL tees, drugs, underage drinking, and of course street skating.\nIf you were there, you know, if not you can experience a time that will never come back. Skating is not the outlaw thing you do to escape your sh!tty life anymore, it's city built skateparks and X games.\nThat's why this film hits hard. Everyone who was around then had their crew and every crew had the jokester, the pro, the poor kid and the hanger-on who wasn't really good but a nice dude so you kept him. That's what Stevie is in this film and that's why you feel for him.\nJonah Hill has made an authentic time capsule into the mid 90's that feels real and not forced.","user":"b-suhr01","rank":[85,95]},{"title":"Mid9/10","rating":8,"date":"26 October 2018","review":"Aside from a couple minor issues I had with this film, I loved it. It just felt incredibly real. I didn't feel like I was watching actors. I felt like I was watching the lives of these kids unfold, and that those lives would just continue unfolding even when the camera wasn't rolling.","user":"ryansalamence","rank":[147,178]},{"title":"Our time \"was\" up","rating":9,"date":"9 May 2019","review":"Just incredible mixed feelings after watching: sadness for time passing by, melancholia for those ages and of course, joy for being part of them...Well done Jonah!","user":"kyosgod-39385","rank":[28,33]}]
