[{"title":"Very wonderful film!!","rating":10,"date":"14 September 1999","review":"My husband and I loved this film.  We laughed, cried and felt warm and fuzzy all over!  Very well made film.  Robin, as always did a great job with his part.  His co-actor/actress were very good too.  The movie made us a part of what was going on.  I want a doctor just like Patch.  To bad there aren't more doctors like that.","user":"Lindy-24","rank":[29,32]},{"title":"Drama that tried to be funny?","rating":8,"date":"2 July 1999","review":"I think that the critics missed an important aspect of this movie, as did many viewers who have commented before me.  Too many have claimed that this movie was a drama full of comedy, or a drama that was trying to be funny.  Whether the critics think it achieved that goal or not, they missed an important point.  The point is that Drama and Comedy are not two seperate things to be combined.  A movie shouldn't have to combine the two.  The two things are already combined.  This movie attempted to show that there is comedy and laughter inherent in the drama of our everyday life.  If we can find it, it can help us through the drama.  This is the reason we cry when we are happy and we cry when we are sad.  All emotions are part of something bigger and they are more similar than we think.  I think that's part of what Patch Adams is trying to say.","user":"Spebsqsa","rank":[42,51]},{"title":"Touched my heart","rating":10,"date":"17 March 2005","review":"The first time I watched this movie, it was truly wonderful and has been every time I've watched it since. \"Patch Adams\" delivers a powerful message of how to just be silly and break the rules when it's in the best interest of everyone around. He knew in his heart that all the patients needed to laugh. Laughter is after all the best medicine anyone could ask for. But Patch knew how to be serious and when to be. How he treated all the other students, faculty, nurses, and patients truly inspired more than just me, but many people I know. His way of life is one that I recommend for anyone.<br><br>Robin Williams give a 5-star performance in Patch Adams. He is a genius in creativity and comedy, but knows how to bring every aspect of a person's life out on the screen. I know that he is just playing the role, but he wraps you entirely into a movie and makes it seem like he is the man.<br><br>I recommend this movie to all...young and old. It's a winner forever in my heart.","user":"Vampera66","rank":[95,122]}]
