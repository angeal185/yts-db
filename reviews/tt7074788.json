[{"title":"Short but fun...","rating":6,"date":"9 June 2019","review":"Right, well I had expected a bit more than just a mere 30 minutes of entertainment. But hey, guess I should have checked the running time of the feature.<br><br>But still, the 30 minutes, while they went by pretty quick, was actually a fun 30 minutes, and I was actually quite entertained with what I watched. The characters here were nicely fleshed out and detailed, and definitely have potential for a TV series or a continuation of the story told here in this 2017 TV movie.<br><br>They actually had quite nice CGI effects, I will say that much, and that really added a very enjoyable element to the movie, especially when it was dealing with magic.<br><br>\"The Outer Boroughs\" is listed as a comedy horror, but the emphasis is mostly on the comedy here. I was entertained, just a shame that it was a mere 30 minutes. It felt like it was just getting started and then it was all over. And the best part is that I was actually left wanting more.<br><br>So thumbs up for director and writer Eugene Lehnert, as well as writers Michael Furth and Daniel Wolfe. This is definitely something that could have potential to be a funny TV series.","user":"paul_haakonsen","rank":[2,2]}]
