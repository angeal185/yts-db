[{"title":"Just say no to the red pills","rating":8,"date":"7 April 2008","review":"From start to finish this film is a great laugh, it never takes itself seriously. The characters aren't consciously making jokes, what they say is just inherently funny. Be warned though if you don't like swearing in your films this isn't the one for you as just about every line contains more than one obscenity.<br><br>The film stars Samuel L Jackson as an ultra-cool, kilt wearing drugs chemist wanting to make one high-profit deal, Robert Carlyle as a Liverpool gangster and Emily Mortimer as the hottest assassin I've seen in a film.<br><br>I won't post any spoilers but if you enjoy films with car chases, funny dialogue and over the top action involving guns, golf clubs and heavy duty laxatives then this is the film for you.","user":"Tweekums","rank":[31,37]},{"title":"Worth a watch","rating":6,"date":"19 March 2007","review":"The 51st State is certainly no classic, but its funny and has a half-decent storyline. Being from the Liverpool area, I'm glad to see a film set there, even if it is about crime. Samuel L. Jackson is as cool as ever as kilt-wearin', drug-dealin' Elmo McElroy, and Robert Carlyle is in good form as Felix DeSouza, desperately trying to get himself a cut in the deal. The use of Ricky Tomlinson, a very funny actor pretty much unknown to American audiences, was also a nice touch. I'm very much a believer that British comedy is (almost) always better than American. I always enjoy the inclusion of English words and slang, and with Elmo not having a clue about English customs, such as the different language and the Mini Cooper, makes this film very funny. I'm not sure about Americans, but English people will appreciate the hilarity of the situation as Elmo and Felix run around Liverpool, with Elmo wanting his 20 million, and Felix just wanting to watch the Liverpool vs. Man Utd game! A clever twist at the end adds a bit of a philosophical side to the film, and shows The 51st State is more than just a few laughs.","user":"grezza_2004","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"Formula 51 (as it's also known) rocks!","rating":9,"date":"9 May 2004","review":"What do you get when you put Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Carlyle,  Meatloaf, Rhys Ifans, and Emily Mortimer together in a movie? A  rollicking good time! This movie is pure entertainment and has some  very, very funny moments. The dialogue is mostly tongue-in-cheek and  snappy. The soundtrack is excellent (this coming from someone who  doesn't really like techno, club, rap, or hip-hop music), and I would  definitely buy this movie to watch again. It may not be for everyone,  but the cast is first-rate; the story line believable, and seeing  Samuel L. Jackson in a kilt couldn't be beat! I give this movie a 9 out  of 10. It's not Academy Award material, but who cares!","user":"ehawke-1","rank":[70,104]}]
