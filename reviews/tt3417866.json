[{"title":"Idiotic","rating":1,"date":"3 March 2018","review":"SEXSQUATCH is another insufferable indie comedy from director Chris Seaver and a group of his mates. They hang out at a lakeside retreat, where a guy dressed in a bad bigfoot costume runs around a bit and various gross-out humour ensues. Mucho eye crossing, breast fixation, and cheesy stupidity is what this film is made up of, making this the worst of the worst.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"What Can I Say, I Like Stupid Horror-Esque Movies with Eye Candy","rating":6,"date":"13 October 2018","review":"As stated, stupid horror, but harmless fun. Just sit back and relax and enjoy the beautiful women, the over the top lines and funny scenarios.<br><br>Yes it looks a bit amateurish, but who doesn't want to hear about a mother, describing her son's penis, to her girlfriends.<br><br>Sexsquatch is just that type of movie. And yes the title explains it all. You can enjoy this with friends and make fun of it, or in my case alone with some lotion near by.<br><br>It's funny to laugh at, stimulating to watch and I do recommend it...SERIOUSLY! Not a joke! I found sick pleasure in this movie.<br><br>6 out of 10. It's a fairly harmless, low budget, but funny enough horror.","user":"Dark_Lord_Mark","rank":[6,14]},{"title":"Samsquanch","rating":5,"date":"19 February 2019","review":"It's movies like this that make me question what I'm doing in my life that has lead me here....","user":"whoaisme-57683","rank":[2,3]}]
