[{"title":"Mostly visually amazing, but not as into the story as I hoped","rating":6,"date":"11 February 2016","review":"I know the Monkey King is a huge thing in China. I herd about it before and have see the American adaption, the Forbidden Kingdom, with Jet Li as the Monkey king.<br><br>This movie was visually bad ass. I loved the design of the title character. All the CGI actually worked to make the movie feel very big and very epic. It makes me wish it was released in IMAX here in the States, not just in 3D. The final battle in the movie was mind blowing.<br><br>But I just did not get into the tale of the Monkey King. I don't know why this story is so popular and the movie did nothing to change this thought. It was suppose to be funny in certain places, but I did not get it and it just seem that a lot of things were happen just to produce a cool special effect for it, not to drive any story.<br><br>It was fun to look at but not the most compelling story, speaking as someone unfamiliar with the story being told","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[20,28]},{"title":"Much much better than the first movie","rating":8,"date":"29 April 2016","review":"I wasn't expecting a sequel after watching the disappointing first film that was 2 years behind the original scheduled release. Despite the plethora of well-known actors/actresses, it turned out to be a huge disappointment due to the deviation from the original story. Chow Yun Fat was the most miscast actor when he was chosen to play the Jade Emperor :(<br><br>I'm glad to say that this sequel is much better than the first movie in every aspect. The script focuses mainly on Sun Wukong and the Bone Demoness. The monk is left to look like a bumbling idiot. He looks and acts like the same role in the Stephen Chow's Journey to the West. Aaron Kwok's portrayal of Sun Wukong is much less flamboyant than Donnie Yen's portrayal - and for that, I am glad.<br><br>The special effects are very well done, which is a relief considering the disaster in the first movie. If I hadn't watched Iron Man or Harry Potter before, I would be even more impressed with some of the effects in the final battle scene.<br><br>Gong Li visual presence was, for me, the epitome of womanhood :)","user":"tdevil9","rank":[10,14]},{"title":"A Spiritual Journey with Man-pigs, Blue Guy and a Giant Skeleton","rating":7,"date":"27 December 2016","review":"Just watched this on pay per view after seeing the first one last week on Netflix.<br><br>Not going to compare the first to the second, except to say that the second movie has better special effects; otherwise, it's two different movies with two different casts. I enjoyed both.<br><br>This movie concerns the maturation of the Monkey King. After being imprisoned for five hundred years to learn humility, meditation and how to live in a very tiny space, Wudong is freed by a monk, but forced to aid the monk in his quest for a holy scroll by a torture crown that causes pain when the monk chants.<br><br>There are a lot of fun but baffling fight scenes in this one. Wudong fights a pig-man and a blue man who are both allies, it turns out. There are some nifty demons. And, of course, the fact that there is a giant skeleton who is made out of smaller skeletons goes without saying...<br><br>The acting in this one was good and the effects were great. What didn't I like? The subtitles were just awful... unreadable at least half the time. My Mandarin is a little rusty, so it made the plot hard to follow much of the time.<br><br>So, I can recommend this movie. There is the death of a child and torture of children, so I'd advise no one younger than teenager to watch.","user":"masercot","rank":[3,3]}]
