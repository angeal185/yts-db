There are a few things in this film that to me would deem it more as a 15 rather than 12A","user":"gemzee","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"PARENTS GUIDE IS WRONG!!","rating":1,"date":"27 February 2019","review":"The violence part of the parents guide for this movie is wrong. There was no stabbing, hanging or cutting hands off. I don't know who wrote that","user":"mariacarpino","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Mild high school fantasy","rating":7,"date":"1 May 2018","review":"High schooler Kyle feels out of place until he acquires a mysterious and magical app which grants him the ability to be successful in assorted popular high school activities. He thus becomes a hot lead in the high school musical (and cute singer/songwriter Dani falls for him), plus he also becomes a star ice hockey player, which raises him as a target for high school princess Charlotte. Kyle has to decide which path to follow, and how to put right the things which have gone wrong on the way.<br><br>This high school fantasy romcom is utterly formulaic and contains no surprises whatsoever. It's not unpleasant, the leads are attractive and fulfil their part in the proceedings well enough (although I never bought into Kyle being isolated), and the final musical number is effective.<br><br>Famke Janssen puts in an unexpectedly funny turn as a Mom with too much wine oh her hands.<br><br>This is a tolerable time-passer.","user":"neil-476","rank":[8,13]}]
