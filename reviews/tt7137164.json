[{"title":"If you like \"Troma style\".","rating":6,"date":"20 October 2018","review":"An anthology of shorts made by various directors. There are highs and lows but the thing is that the highs are really highs.<br><br>Quality is beyond bad for some of them although others are intentionally bad. They are distributed, apparently, by Troma FIlms so you have an idea of the work.<br><br>My picks in order of laughs:\n-Conrad-or something-the Bavarian I &amp; II (this one is the best, please a movie from here);\n-Tourist A (another very good one, for hilarious);\n-Feed to Kill (similar to the previous one);\n-and last \"the most accurate Vietnam War film\" with... Hitler!!!<br><br>So, you have two hours and fifty minutes of pure trash, I had to watch it in two half but the overall; Horror, Comedies, and Horror Comedies the vast of it, it is interesting to watch.","user":"gimailito","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Bad enough for a Drive-in theater...","rating":1,"date":"31 May 2019","review":"How appropriate that the poster for this collection of awful is a Drive-in theater!\nFor those of us old enough to remember, fooling around with your girlfriend was the only excuse to go because the movie was basically unwatchable. Unlike the only other reviewer to leave a comment I skipped through this just to verify it was truly awful -- it was.","user":"gossip-5","rank":[0,1]}]
