[{"title":"Entertaining, fun giallo-esque murder mystery with a B-Movie feel...","rating":8,"date":"2 February 2019","review":"I have a sick sense of humor.<br><br>So it wasn't a surprise that during most of the run time for \"Heart + Knife\" I was laughing my-ass off. The scenario was ridiculous, but I found a lot to relate to here as a gay man, and as a B-Movie, Giallo and cheesy gay art porn lover.<br><br>This is good camp. Like an absurd mash up of early Pedro Almodovar, James Bigod, John Waters and Gregg Araki with a little Clair Denis drama for good measure.<br><br>For me, it worked. And is one of the better queer films I've seen in a while. It's refreshingly shameless and at times very funny. You wouldn't see a film like this made in the US nowadays!<br><br>Actor Nicolas Maury was a standout for me, playing the assistant to troubled porno directress Vanessa Paradis. Every time he appeared he was reliable for a good laugh, especially during the film within a film porno scenes.<br><br>So yeah, this isn't heady stuff. It's fromage.<br><br>The kind of film that goes well with wine, weed and an open mind. Film snobs and conservatives should leave their badges at the door.","user":"b-c-tolbert","rank":[35,48]},{"title":"A stylish yet astoundingly derivative dumpster fire","rating":2,"date":"27 August 2019","review":"Cultural stereotypes abound in this test of patience from France, acted so broadly that it makes the Three Stooges look subtle. Vanessa Paradis is charming in her own way, but she can't carry this poorly-composed dumpster fire, even if it is beautifully-shot and has a gorgeous soundtrack from M83.<br><br>Make no mistake: this is a movie more about a failed lesbian love affair than it is anything else, and it's about as enjoyable as watching a series of hate crimes. Which is to say, not at all. It's unforgivably boring, and for a French film and a film dealing with gay pornography as a focus, it's also terrified of actually committing to the topic. There's barely any nudity to speak of, and certainly nothing surprising or even approaching shocking. If you're going to make a lurid horror film about a violent killer in the very sketchy territory of porn production -- especially gay porn -- you have to actually commit to it. Real giallo didn't exactly shy away from nudity or sex and, even if most of the movies weren't much count, they at least could keep an audience engaged with things happening, whether or not they led to a satisfying conclusion.<br><br>But speaking as a gay man and someone who has seen quite a lot of both French cinema and gay cinema (not to mention giallo), this was less than mediocre at best and incredibly offensive at worst. All in all, it's boring, and that's one of the worst things something supposed to entertain can be. Inane, pretentious, unhappy, unentertaining, unamusing, and incredibly superficial -- that's this movie. When it's at its lowest, it comes off as a homophobic parade of poorly-written and poorly-realized nonsense. When it's at its best, it relies on visuals and score...which makes the story pointless.<br><br>It's a shame, since the same director also did You And The Night, which was a fantastic film. You And The Night worked because it was a fantasy, with a tremendous magic to the thread of its story, and its at-times incoherent quality seemed dreamlike and engaging. It's a much better choice to watch than this turd, and it's also given a soundtrack by the brilliant M83. Watch it instead.","user":"moonmonday","rank":[10,19]},{"title":"Another post-modern giallo from another promising film stylist","rating":7,"date":"14 October 2018","review":"The re-make of \"Suspiria\" has been preceded in the UK by at least two hommages to its creator Dario Argento. In Argentina Endelman and Montejano produced \"Crystal Eyes\" while in France Yann Gonzalez paid tribute with \"Knife + Heart\", a perfect choice for a midnight screening at the London Film Festival. \"Crystal Eyes\" is marginally the more creative work, certainly the camper, but Gonzalez is a great stylist, who knows his slashers and can flawlessly recreate the exploitation era. In 1979 Paris lesbian film-maker Lois (Vanessa Paradis!) makes arty gay porn that suddenly attracts the attention of a masked fiend, who begins murdering her cast. The opening sequence, which intercuts gay skin flicks with real life, sets the tone. \"Knife + Heart\" is very pro-porn, pro-gay and intensely cinematic. Although Gonzalez is mainly parodying and poking fun here, he's clearly a gifted stylist, choosing great locations and revelling in that \"Suspiria\" colour scheme. Two thirds of the way through, the daft story takes a dip, but then builds to a rousing finale in which the heroes are the patrons of a gay grindhouse. At the screening I attended people left the cinema during the main end credits, thereby missing the \"message\" about life and cinema which comes before the end crawl. Some will be appalled at the idea of Paradis starring in a gay slasher. But she throws herself into her work and is a commanding presence throughout despite strong support from everyone. As with \"Crystal Eyes\" it'll be interesting to see whether \"Knife + Heart\" can cross over from the festival circuit. If not it'll also be interesting to see what Gonzalez tries next. A talent to watch.","user":"davidvmcgillivray-24-905811","rank":[15,34]}]
