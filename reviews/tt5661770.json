[{"title":"It just seems incomplete","rating":6,"date":"18 September 2017","review":"The movie was amazing. The actors were perfect for the roles that they were selected for but the movie ended on a such an incomplete note. It left so many things unresolved. So many plot lines left in the wind that it completely ruined the movie for me. It would be nice for a follow up movie or even a series to be created. If not, this movie would be completely a waste of time to watch. Nothing is resolved throughout the movie.","user":"Fifi0131","rank":[21,23]},{"title":"Worst ending ever","rating":3,"date":"24 September 2017","review":"I do not understand this movie. How was Miranda connected to the sea walkers? Why did her mom behave to strange? Why did Leo think Miranda could save them? Why did Naomi want to hurt or kill Miranda (Leo's sister)? The last 15 minutes was a mess and the end the worst end ever without any answers at all! It was like they came short of money and never finished the movie! It started so good, excitement built up and the movie ended like a dropped egg on the floor :(","user":"lillalejon","rank":[21,24]},{"title":"Strong start but weak finish","rating":6,"date":"7 April 2018","review":"I read the book first and really hoped for a sequel but it never happened. So when I saw the movie I was excited and hoped we'd get the ending that was missing. Alas, while I enjoyed the movie, it ended just as abruptly as the book and I still have no clue what's happening at this point. Ultimately worth watching but be prepared to have questions about the ending.","user":"andreaheltsleybooks","rank":[13,14]}]
