[{"title":"Inspiring look at coaching in a low-income area","rating":7,"date":"4 August 2015","review":"Okay, Kevin Costner can do this character in his sleep. His \"Coach/Manager/Player who has seen it all\" character is standard stuff for him. It's basically \"Bull Durham\", \"Draft Day\", \"For Love of the Game\" all rolled into the same guy. That's not a bad thing. I like him in those roles. It's just nothing new. What's surprising is the plethora of fabulous performances by the kids and townspeople in this terrific little TRUE story. They ROCK this picture. Special recognition to the set designers who created a beautiful location for all the running sequences. It was a rich assortment of landscapes that mesmerized the visual senses on BluRay.<br><br>Basic plot: Costner (Jim White) is a football coach at a reasonably successful high school program. Because of a mistake in the opening sequence, the coach is fired and lands in a dead-end town in Nowhere'sville, USA - aka McFarland, CA. The fish-out-of-water family has a few brushes with the local Mexican population where they think being the only (seemingly) white family in the area is a bad idea and are intending on moving immediately. Then Costner sees a kid running a sub-5-minute mile on his way to work in the produce fields with the rest of the population of minority workers in the area. What follows is fairly standard Disney stuff of our innocent but willing racially-inferior minnows who fight to get better against the racist, elitist killer whales (rich kids) of the other schools. What makes this watchable is how true the story is. Don't get me wrong. There are some formulaic sequences here. But how they pull it off is worth the cinematic journey. For Disney, I'm proud of them for taking a racial theme and turning it into a positive story for all involved.<br><br>I have to say the reason I'm giving this a \"7\" is because of the EXCELLENT behind-the-scenes stories where the filmmakers interview the runners from the team, along with the real coach, Jim White, and Kevin Costner all at the same sitting. Hearing them reminiscing (the movie is set in 1989), talking about the movie, and showing genuine care and respect for their beloved coach and each other... It's what a coach could only hope for in the children who grow up to be fine adults. Mr. White created a dynasty of runners that forged an ironclad identity with hope for the future in this nothing town when nobody was giving them a chance. One man can still make a difference on a global scale if you work hard enough. It's inspiring stuff.<br><br>The highest praise I can give this movie: My two teenage athlete children (soccer and baseball/softball) who have watched literally hundreds and hundreds of movies were against it. It was Disney for crying out loud. And a movie about CROSS COUNTRY no less. They would rather watch \"Mission Impossible 15\" or anything else. These are seasoned moviephiles. But Dad just wouldn't be denied. ;-) Within the first 15 minutes, they were hooked and enjoyed every minute of the rest of the movie. They even sat through the behind-the-scenes interviews. It was a family experience I won't forget. Well done, Disney.<br><br>As a coach myself, this is the kind of stuff that inspires me to work with kids who don't have a future in their current situation. And if you're already a coach, it may open your eyes to kids who have natural talents that may be wasted on something other than where their true skills lie. Much recommended. :-)","user":"BobbyT24","rank":[49,49]},{"title":"Great Movie","rating":8,"date":"1 October 2015","review":"McFarland USA is much more than the regular feel good sports movie. The setting, acting, music, and story line blend perfectly to deliver a heart-warming tale. It is a film that touches all sides of this true story to make it stand out against the rest. By the time it's all done, you will feel like part of the McFarland family. <br><br>Kevin Costner plays Jim White, a coach whose anger forces him move to a struggling, McFarland, California, where he begins a job teaching science and gym. In this predominately Latino town Jim and his family experience a culture they hadn't been exposed to in Boise, Idaho. Very early on something about these kids catches Jim's eye, their ability to run. With a little bit of work and convincing of some students and the school administration, Jim creates a cross-country team that he believes, can achieve greatness. <br><br>The setting for this movie perfectly captures the feel for McFarland. Featuring plenty of dead grass, roaming dogs, endless fields, and low riders with ridiculous paint jobs, the viewer gets a feel for the town at the very beginning of the movie. Most of the people in this town are migrant workers. The run down buildings, chipping paint, and collapsing school display the poverty level of the town quite clearly. With a prison located across the street from the school, it is made clear that most kids have the choice of going to jail, or working in the fields. While the town is rather plain, the director did a great job of capturing the beautiful mountains and landscapes of the surrounding area. In addition to the beautiful scenery, the music chosen makes it feel like there is a mariachi band right in your room. The setting as a whole was delivered in a way that makes the viewer understand the economic state of the town and the surrounding area, which is a big help in supporting the plot.<br><br>Every singe one of the actors in this movie played the role perfectly. I was stunned by the amount of character development in such a short period of time. By the end of the movie, you will feel connected to every character. Kevin Costner seems to be simply playing himself, but Carlos Pratts steals the show with his amazing portrayal of Thomas Valles. During a training session, Thomas has an emotional break down due to the combination of a stressful life at home and the endless cycle of poverty that the people of McFarland can't seem to break. It is here that the crying, shouting, angry voice of Thomas spills all the struggles of the migrant workers and the lives they live. The characters and the writing also allow for some comic relief. A man who's last name is White struggles to pronounce Hispanic names, and the stock character of a chubby Danny Diaz who is trying his best to keep up with the rest of the team.<br><br>I'm impressed that the movie didn't contain a crazy amount of over dramatizations, because we all know that is the worst thing in the world. Considering it's a Disney sports movie based on a true story, you should know how it ends before you even watch it. I highly recommend you watch it anyways. It contains scenes that leave your hands sweating and your heart beating, and creates feelings similar to the first time you ever saw the Italian Stallion beat Apollo Creed in the ring. When it's all said and done, the town of McFarland, and especially its cross-country team, will hold a special place in your heart. Before you watch this movie, make sure your mom signs the permission slip, because you're about to go on a feel trip.","user":"aarrestadain","rank":[23,24]},{"title":"Beautiful, organic, touching film","rating":10,"date":"28 January 2016","review":"After a million years as an IMDb member I'm finally inspired to write a review. This movie is guileless and sweet in the most beautiful way. Not heavy-handed, no huge buildup over the races (in all aspects of the word), but rather huge focus on interpersonal relationships and the judgments every human makes about one another. There's also huge pride in the small working towns I've personally driven through on my way to somewhere else, and the seemingly small people whose backs we live off of. There is so much heart here. I'm surprised this is a Disney movie.<br><br>Anyway, I believe love drives us. And this is such an affirmation of the different types of love and relationships that can push us in the best ways and help us achieve greatness. I'm so deeply pleased to have seen this film. Every one of us has a moment or period when we are down for the count. We don't always handle it with grace. That doesn't mean we are without grace.","user":"LAtoSEA","rank":[18,19]}]
