[{"title":"Second Best of The Entire Series","rating":10,"date":"26 May 2012","review":"As a child, I loved this film! I didn't like any of the others besides the first one, and my opinion stands 10 years later. There was something magical about this one, and I still remember all of the exciting and fantastic elements that made this my second favorite. The first one had some scary moments(for a kid, that is) but this one was much more upbeat and friendly. It will always have a special place in my heart, and my children's hearts as well. I can't believe the people who've panned this film! You need to re-live your childhoods again, or lighten up! <br><br>10/10","user":"zack_wall","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Good!","rating":8,"date":"21 February 2007","review":"This movie despite what others say is actually quite good. In my opinion this is the best Land before time. It does not fail in the plot and it does not fail in the entertainment value. This is overall a solid movie and I cannot get enough. I think anyone who is a true Land Before time fan will fully and whole-heartedly love The Land Before Time: Journey through the mists. This has more of a mature plot than the others,seeing that it has something to do with a potentially fatal situation, not just because of sharp teeth but also because of a journey they must take and a deadly illness. I cannot believe that people are saying this movie blows mad chunks when it really is not bad at all.","user":"mary-361","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Journey Through The Mists","rating":5,"date":"30 March 2009","review":"The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists, the fourth installment into the Land Before Time series. I've been watching the sequels in the Land Before Time series because I'm curious about them, I loved the first Land Before Time and despite the sequels not having the best reputation, I still wanted to see what they were about. So far I really did enjoy the second movie, the third was decent and now Journey Through the Mists is pretty good. I think it's just as good as the third one, there's nothing that really stands out about it, but it still has a very good message about friendship and learning how to make new friends. It's very good for the kids to watch and I'm sure even some of the adults can get into this series as well for some light hearted fun.<br><br>Littlefoot notices a longneck herd entering the Great Valley, and informs his grandparents. They tell him that the longnecks are their cousins, and that they must go and greet them. As the Old One, the leader of the herd, tells the residents of the Great Valley that her herd has been migratory since a heavy rain period turned their old home into a marshland called \"The Land of Mists\", and became the home of many dangerous creatures, Littlefoot meets a longneck girl named Ali, and invites her to play. He introduces her to his friends, but as she is not used to associating with diverse species, she is afraid of them. Grandpa Longneck falls ill, and the Old One notes that the illness is lethal unless the victim eats the petals of the \"Night Flower\", a flower which can only be found in the Land of Mists. Though Littlefoot is warned that the journey is too dangerous, he feels determined to save his grandfather, and asks Ali to take him there. She agrees, as the two of them make their way, they pass through a cave, and sudden earthquake causes a wall of rocks to crash down, separating them. Ali decides the others will have to help her free Littlefoot, and runs off to get them. Littlefoot, in the meantime, tries to find a way out, and meets Archie, who offers to help him dig through the rocks. They are interrupted by a belly dragger and a sharp beak named Dil and Ichy, who have their minds set to eat them. But Littlefoot's friends are not too far behind as they help Littlefoot and Ali. Together they continue the journey to help save Littlefoot's grandfather.<br><br>The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists is a good animated film that I'm sure if you have an open mind, you'll enjoy it. There is so much dislike for these films, I think it's not just the songs but everyone is so determined that the first was the best and can't accept that there is a newer generation who wants to see new stories with Littlefoot and his friends. Over all I'm enjoying the series, even if it is a little cheesy, so far there hasn't been anything to hate. The fourth installment is a good one so I'm excited for the 5th movie and I'll give you an honest review of that movie as well.<br><br>5/10","user":"Smells_Like_Cheese","rank":[5,7]}]
