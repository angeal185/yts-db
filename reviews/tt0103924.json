[{"title":"Don't worry Boss, it'll get outta our way...","rating":9,"date":"29 December 1998","review":"This is one of my favorites.  So much so I ran out and purchased it. I'm puzzled as to why this movie was not rated higher, it is at least on a parr with DAVE, NINE MONTHS, GROUNDHOG DAY and THE BIG LEBOWSKI.  I liked all those movies and CAPTAIN RON is just as good.  Kurt Russell's performance is hilarious and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what he will do next.  I would never have seen this movie based on the score it was given, lucky for me I saw the movie first.  Terrific, hilarious and enjoyable entertainment.  Don't miss this one.","user":"INDIANA-4","rank":[39,43]},{"title":"Light hearted comedy about a family trying to control their life on a sailboat.","rating":10,"date":"6 September 2004","review":"This is wonderful movie, one of my favorite movies of all time! A family inherits a sailboat and decides to flee the urban rat race. They don't realize that they will have to over come many hurdles, including aspects of them selves, Capt. Ron, the boat and the environment.<br><br>The daughter plays a teenager that is simultaneously apathetic and nearly out of control. The son is a kid who hasn't taken an interest in life until now. The father assumes that Capt. Ron can't know anything while the family begins to believe that it's the father who doesn't know anything.<br><br>This movie was one of the triggers to me moving to a tropical island to live, oh and to buy a boat.","user":"dukemarsh","rank":[33,38]},{"title":"It is pure joy to watch and absorb over and over!","rating":10,"date":"15 March 2006","review":"I don't understand the many poor reviews I have seen from the \"professional reviewers\". I think this movie is incredibly funny in a quiet sort of way. I have seen it many times. It reminds me of the many Jackie Gleason Honeymooners I have seen over and over. I know what punch line is coming and I begin laughing before the punch line is even delivered.<br><br>Martin Short is not his usual manic self and this is refreshing. Kurt Russell is a master as he plays against the heroic roles he has played so often.<br><br>The play of the use of \"gorillas\" versus \"guerillas\" is laid back genius. I saw this movie again last night for the umpteenth time. I love it!","user":"jpaynter3","rank":[10,10]}]
