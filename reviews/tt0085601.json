[{"title":"¨GO FOR IT¨ is an amusing film with Hill and Spencer posing as secret agents in the sunny Miami","rating":6,"date":"12 October 2009","review":"The pic deals with the intimate friends , Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, now as two drifters who meet each other and being mistaken as thieves . But they get to escape thanks to the ventriloquist skills of Hill . Later on , while the hustlers travel by airplane are confused for two international spies , and someone give them a luggage full of million of dollars . After that, the pair become involved in several adventures , and rare situations full of risks , dangers and fun.<br><br>The big time duo from Spahetti Western wrapped in humor as ¨They call me Trinity ¨ and its followings as ¨Trinity is still my name¨ and ¨Trouble makers¨ were run out and then they're transfered to Police and action genre . As they played the Miami series which are set in Florida , such as ¨Miami Supercops¨, ¨Crime Busters¨, and ¨Superfuzz¨ . Here Terence Hill and Bud Spencer play characters mistaken for spies in this spy spoof . Similarly, in their next movie , Miami Supercops (1985), the two play secret agents who go undercover as policemen . There are plenty of humor based on diverse personality and physical differences among them . This one packs silly comedy with James Bond influence , tongue-in-cheek , slapstick and ordinary struggles , neither blood , nor violence ; besides , including some car pursuits. It appears usual secondaries who customarily intervene on their films , as David Huddleston and Ricardo Pizutti . Average cinematography and lousy musical score composed by means of synthesizer , being composed by the usual La Bionda . The motion picture was regularly directed by Enzo Barboni who previously was a notorious cameraman as proved in ¨Django¨, ¨Hellbenders¨ , and ¨Goodbye Texas¨ and made the classics : ¨Trinity¨ and ¨Trinity is still my name¨. The tale will appeal to Hill and Spencer fans.","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"Easily The Most Bizarre Spencer/Hill Flick - And One Of Their Funniest","rating":9,"date":"17 August 2007","review":"Enzo Barboni's \"Nati Con La Camicia\" aka. \"Trinity: Hits The Road\" is easily the most bizarre movie with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, and also one of their funniest and best. The movie has everything we love about Bud and Terence flicks - but plenty of fistfights and ass-kicking, wonderful lowbrow humor, extremely dumb villains, the typical jokes and feeling - plus the most bizarre ending of any of their movies (which I won't give away).<br><br>Bud and Terence star as the typical proletarian drifters they always are, Rosco (Hill) and Doug (Spencer). Doug is a Truck driver who makes the mistake of taking Rosco, a hitchhiker, along. After escaping a police control, the two are mistaken for criminals at first, for two secret agents named Steinberg and Mason later...<br><br>In case you are looking for intellectual comedy no film with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill will be your taste. In case you like Bud and Terence, however, you should certainly not miss \"Trinity: Hits The Road\". It is admittedly silly, but so are all the Spencer/Hill comedies; for a fan of the two, this is perfect entertainment, and I personally laugh my ass off each time I see it. Out of their non-Western movies, this is one of my favorites. Spencer/Hill movies are certainly not everybody's taste, but in case you're a fan you certainly can't allow yourself to miss this one!","user":"Witchfinder-General-666","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Funny beyond description","rating":10,"date":"2 December 2006","review":"What can be said about this except that it's gut busting funny! If Hitchock's North by Northwest has an interesting yet quite believable identity switch (and it has), then this one works in the same way. By answering to a certain name a new identity is given to our heroes and the plot thickens. OK, the bad guy is an ultimate idiot, but that's to be taken into the account - after all this one is a comedy.<br><br>Quite a lot of stunts and many humorous punches. Slapstick at it's best and it meets up with a great storytelling talent. Not to mention it's actually a feel-good movie. It lifts your spirits with it's lightness and humor. Can't go wrong with this one!","user":"jalilidalili","rank":[11,13]}]
