They are pursued by a chief policeman who blackmails to Peter Ustinov to get undercover in the band.<br><br>From the beginning until ending the good mood and humor is continued . The plot is very amusing and the final has got an extraordinary surprise . In the movie there are comedy , action , tongue-in-cheek , giggles and results to be very bemusing . The highlight and great climax , of course , is the heist which is developed with imposing tension and intrigue .

Full of original ideas, smartly written and joyfully directed. And, if all that wasn't enough, Peter Ustinov! He won his second Oscar as best supporting actor for this creation - an unsuccessful small time crook, intelligent enough to know that he's not intelligent enough - without country and without future. Ustinov soars. He is surrounded by a group of Euro-heavy weights, Melina Mercouri, Maximilian Schell, Robert Morley, Akim Tammiroff. The suspense, fun filled entrance to the Topkapi museum was stolen and disguised with a multi dollar budget by Brian De Palma and his accomplices in the first Mission Impossible without being able to duplicate the suspense, the fun, the humanity or the innocence of the proceedings. The locations are another treat, the music, the costumes and the honesty with which the dishonesty of the characters is portrayed. A true delight.","user":"littlemartinarocena","rank":[89,105]},{"title":"Hard-to-beat in the big caper category. A fun film.","rating":8,"date":"13 January 2001","review":"Before \"Mission Impossible\" made every big heist a challenge for technology, there were movie efforts like \"Topkapi\" which played the human element in the big scam.<br><br>A wonderful and truly international cast is assembled here for this 60's effort that showcases Istanbul.  Melina Mercouri is marvelous, blending humor and sensuality with her hard side.  Maximillian Schell is excellent as the leading man with all the answers while Peter Ustinov is the classic bumbler.  Akim Tamiroff adds additional levity as the irascible cook.<br><br>Not sure I was totally satisfied with the outcome but it's such a rollicking and colorful ride, give director Jules Dassin top marks anyway.","user":"Steve-318","rank":[30,37]}]
