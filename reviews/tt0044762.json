[{"title":"Wonderful bean-planting","rating":25,"date":"25 April 2004","review":"I turn to this movie when I'm feeling down.  My 5-year old niece (with no prompting from me) prefers it to any Disney you care to name.  It's one of those movies that's so bad it's brilliant.  And why Jack's Mother's line, uttered in sheer frustration, \"Plant the Beans, Jack!\" has not become a revered movie catchphrase I'll never know.  I always shout \"Plant the Beans, Jack!\" at the Kiefer Sutherland character in \"24\", especially when he's a little slow on the uptake.  Abbott and Costello's \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" is a little gem and does not deserve the criticism levelled at it on IMDB.  The humour may be basic, the characters may be of the cardboard variety, but the director has managed to create a special little world that children and adults can enjoyable enter .","user":"chouchoulane","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"very good Abbott and Costello movie","rating":10,"date":"15 August 2003","review":"I've loved this movie since I was a little kid. I remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me. I loved it and I still do. I think it's very funny and original. There are also some very catchy tunes in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors that portray Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are okay too, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavyweight boxing sensation Buddy Baer, also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer is good in this movie as the cop and The giant. He's a better actor than boxer. He had a natural talent. The beginning of this movie is hilarious how Lou Costello keeps crashing the car and how he gets into trouble with Buddy Baer. The slapstick in the house is good too. I especially like the comedy in the Giant's castle. My favorite parts are; the part were Lou is climbing the beanstalk and they're all singing as a farewell. Jack is singing back to them that he'll return. Lou Costello is a very good at singing. My other favorite part is the part when Jack is fighting with the Giant. I like when Jack makes exploding eggs and when he tries to make the Giant an omelet they keep exploding. Abbott and Costello are hilarious and the greatest comedians of all time. This is only one of their great movies that I will love and cherish. The reviews for this movie aren't very good and I can't understand why. This is a very good Abbott and Costello movie. I also love how Lou Costello comes back to reality in the end and thinks he's back in the dream when Bud hits him. He starts singing his song and leaves with an attitude like no one is going to push me around. Very good movie.","user":"mercury4","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"A wonderful comic vehicle.","rating":8,"date":"12 January 2007","review":"Abbott and Costello's talents shine in the happily childish version of \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". The use of sepia tone and colour, the music and choreography, song and dance, the crossing over of players from one role to another, plus various other aspects of this very fine movie make it obvious that techniques and styles used for \"The Wizard of Oz\" are being toyed with here. And that works right well for our intrepid duo. There are certain other things involved that make this movie a treat for me ... Buddy Baer's, Max Baer Jr. of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" uncle, appearance as the cop and the giant. Pat Costello, Lou's brother, having been involved in the writing of the script. These things help make this film fun. It does, however, have it's down side. I do think that the choreography is poorly done. But the cute tunes and accompanying vocals help detract from the rather sloppy dance numbers. Some of the players, the couple in love ( prince and princess ) to be precise, aren't very good at their trade. But these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise throughly enjoyable walk down the yellow brick ... er, I mean ... climb up the beanstalk.","user":"KennethEagleSpirit","rank":[13,14]}]
