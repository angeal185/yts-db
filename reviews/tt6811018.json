[{"title":"Awesome for kids up to 10","rating":9,"date":"15 April 2019","review":"This movie is surprisingly good for kids the right age. My girls, 7 and 9 loved it.<br><br>It's a modern Arthurian tale, so set in the UK with all the adventure movie cliches you might expect which is no bad thing.\nI'm really surprised by some of the lower-scoring reviews. This movie is formulaic and predictable but it really isn't intended to keep a 44 year old man like me on the edge of his seat.<br><br>For it's target audience - kids - it's awesome.<br><br>The visual effects were far better than expected for what I thought was a low budget movie (it's $60m) and having Patrick Stewart to bolster the cast as the old Merlin helped too.<br><br>There's enough humor and pace along the way stopping it from feeling stuffy and too serious which keeps it light and positive.<br><br>Best family movie in ages :)","user":"scubax","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"A joyful British Arthurian romp","rating":9,"date":"21 January 2019","review":"I didn't know if it were possible to get kids' films like this anymore. It was great fun from start to finish, it's (possibly) about 15 minutes too long (the middle section drags a tiny bit), but it's so enjoyable and there are excellent quips throughout. My kids went away quoting the jokes from the film, and that must be a good sign.<br><br>I read another review that director Joe Cornish was a big fan of Time Bandits Terry Gilliam's 1981 fantasy movie. Both have strong leads, slightly oblique plots, together with wizardry and magic<br><br>Time Bandits had Sean Connery, The Kid Who Would Be King has Patrick Stewart who puts in a sterling alternating performance (with Angus Imrie) as Merlin.<br><br>Louis Ashbourne Serkis is fabulous as Alex the main protagonist. He's got an acting pedigree (both his parents, Andy Serkis and Lorraine Ashbourne) are excellent actors. His Dad is best known for his portrayal of Gollum...fancy having a Dad who was Gollum?!<br><br>Anyway, TKWWBK is terrific. As a teenager I loved Excalibur but it's too long (and dark) for my 10 and 11 year olds. This was a perfect antidote. Arthurian Legend and heraldry but without (too much) bloodthirstiness.<br><br>Go and see it, it's the best film (whether aimed at children or adults) I've seen for months and months.","user":"TrevorHickman","rank":[84,112]},{"title":"Suspend disbelief and simply enjoy.","rating":7,"date":"4 May 2019","review":"Didn't expect much from this but the kids are good, Merlin (both old and young) is a delight and it's actually rather corny fun. If you expected it to be anything else, why are you watching it?\nOnly effect I thought weak was the one for 'MorganaDragon' and the rest are up to par, in the main.\nStory isn't overlong, unless you can only tolerate cartoons. Neither the best, nor the worst film you'll see.\nGive it a go. Avoid preconceptions. If you're disappointed, you simply have no soul. Particularly if you can't warm to Bedders immediately.","user":"rptrezise","rank":[11,12]}]
