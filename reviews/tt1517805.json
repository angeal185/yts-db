[{"title":"A remarkable first film","rating":9,"date":"15 December 2012","review":"A remarkable first film, made by Amadei from his own real life experience of going to Iraq in 2003 to be an assistant director on a film, and almost winding up dead. <br><br>The war sequences are terrific and powerful in execution; harrowing, cinematic, real and yet stylized, largely seen from a subjective camera. <br><br>The film is quite moving in the end, and Amadei is willing to let himself (played very well by Vincio Marchioni) come off as a flawed, real human being. Re-examining one's self and one's traumatic experience with a sense of clarity, but without losing emotion would be a challenge for any artist, but as a first feature it is very special. <br><br>I also liked that the film wasn't afraid to be a very disturbing film about the realities of war, but still have a comedic edge at time. Life is both tragic and funny, but rare is the film that can walk both sides of that street. <br><br>Once in a while the style gets a bit overdone, to the point of breaking a sense of reality, but that's a small fly in a very rich ointment.<br><br>I hope Amadei's immense talent can translate to telling stories other than his own.","user":"runamokprods","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"200 Cigarettes","rating":7,"date":"14 December 2010","review":"It's a autobiographical film about the experience of the director himself, as a debut feature, I'm glad to watch it while the director was visiting Shanghai and had a screen at Tongji University. The film won CONTROCAMPO ITALIANO prize in the Venice festival this year. <br><br>The film combines comedic element with all the tragic incident during the war of Iraq. The close-ups of smoking cigarette is hovering round the film and renders proficiently sober impact on the audience, meanwhile, highlights the motif, a farce full of ridicule, sarcasm which a war could bring forth. <br><br>The DV-styled photography carries deep turbulence on viewer's organs of senses, mainly optically though, it bizarrely diffuses persuasively into a self-tortured experience after the bloody bomb and shooting scene, then our protagonist's gory appearance could be daringly disturbing; on the other hand, one can sense the ambition of the director to face the true grit and mockery and the same time. <br><br>The acting in the film is compelling with a humorous undertone, Vinicio Marchioni gives the protagonist a libertine quality and easily could appeal to the audience. <br><br>So, 20 Cigarettes is a comparatively mature debut for novice director Aureliano Amadei, who has a potential to swing swiftly between drama and comedy, I'm eager to wait to see his next move and hope his skills will be honed to a higher level.","user":"lasttimeisaw","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"A good movie","rating":7,"date":"27 June 2018","review":"Really great movie.
