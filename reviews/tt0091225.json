[{"title":"This is the only Marvel film I like","rating":9,"date":"31 July 2019","review":"It is funny, clever and I enjoy the jokes. The music is not so good, but I have to say Howard is cute and sympathetic.","user":"emerickarthur","rank":[38,40]},{"title":"What More Could You Want?","rating":8,"date":"28 January 2019","review":"A funny duck, sexy super thin chick, in-movie jokes and interesting characters you really like or hate. There is even an upskirt scene. In other words, best Marvel film ever and probably the best comic book adaptation this side of Watchmen.\nAll Hail Howard.","user":"uzj-32006","rank":[52,57]},{"title":"A Fun Family Film","rating":22,"date":"22 December 2018","review":"This is an original Marvel film that is actually funny. It is not lame laden with what Disney thinks is funny. It is actually funny and adventurous and cute and has pathos. Howard generates more sympathy than any 2018 CGI. Not a fan of the music, but the band members are cute.","user":"wgk-07214","rank":[71,81]}]
