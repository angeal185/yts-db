[{"title":"Lesbians, Palance and Snakes... Oh My!","rating":25,"date":"25 November 2002","review":"If you're like me, you grew up watching late nite softies on Cinemax every Friday nite.  If this is the case, then you have definitely heard and probably seen quite a bit of the lovely Laura Gemser.  After seeing \"BLACK EMANUELLE\" many, many moons ago, I became an instant fan and have since viewed several of her films.<br><br>This particular gem qualifies as one of her lesser known films. Essentially, this is a variation on her Emanuelle role with Jack Palance and a whole lot of snakin' goin' on!  Fun stuff most likely, if you are a fan of Gemser.<br><br>Gemser plays an exotic dancer named Eva.  Performing with snakes is her specialty.  No, not those kind!  Now, you're getting ahead of me!<br><br>Anywayz... Gemser's real-life husband, Gabrielle Tinti, portrays Jules Carmichael. Jules is an executive of some sort, who persuades his brother Judas (Palance) to visit a nightclub with him to watch one of Eva's nightly performances.<br><br>Judas loves snakes (No, not those kind!) and his apartment is filled with them.  So, along with her beauty, it's natural that Judas would fall for a gal like Eva.  He soon arranges to meet and introduce her to his snakey friends.  Judas hires Eva to take care of his pets while he is away on business.  From here on out, you know the drill... While the cat's away, the mice will play... and dance around naked with the cat's snakes.<br><br>We soon learn that Eva really digs the lady-lovin' which overrides her tendencies to charm any snake other than the reptile kind.  Several nude scenes later, Eva's girlfriend is killed mysteriously and Eva must find out who killed her and why.  This is a common filmmaking trait known as a \"mild plot motivator\".  I guess they need to keep things moving along but I, for one, wasn't complaining.  I thought the pacing was just fine.  Do what you gotta do, Eva.  I'm all for it.<br><br>These are all the details I gathered.  Aside from Gemser and the fact that this was one of those \"Palance earns a week's pay\" performances, I deemed all other plot elements unnecessary and naturally focused on the good parts, of which there are plenty.<br><br>You cannot go wrong with any film featuring a topless Gemser within the first five minutes, and fully nude around the eight minute mark.  It's just a damn fact.  Why can't more filmmakers hint on this?<br><br>\"BLACK COBRA\" was directed by the masterful eye of Joe D'Amato (Aristide Massaccesi), who would later collaborate on several films with Gemser and eventually go on to a successful career directing real pornos with an entirely different breed of snake.<br><br>Sadly, Gemser has pretty much left the filmmaking scene and her films no longer play on Cinemax.  Most of them have since gone out of print on video here in the States, making them nearly impossible to find.<br><br>A quick program note: This is a long, long movie!  Over four hours in length!  Actually, it only clocks in at around 90 minutes, but if you find yourself using the slow-motion and pause feature on your VCR as much as I did, expect to gain an additional 2 1/2 hours of screening time.<br><br>In closing, I highly recommend this film. A truly uplifting experience! Teachers, show it to your classes today. They'll thank you for it! Trust me.<br><br>\nLater kids! -NM.","user":"johnmorghen","rank":[29,33]},{"title":"A cheese filled creep fest classic","rating":10,"date":"23 June 2004","review":"Quite simply a cinematic treasure that will never get the exposure it so richly deserves. Jack Palance gives quite simply his best ever performance by a country mile in the role of Judas. Palance breathes an awkward and devilishly creepy life into the snake obsessed sleaze Judas. His own fabulous performance crackles magically against Gabriele Tinti's Jules, his jealous and treacherous, even creepier, sociopathic brother.The film is intended as soft porn but works wonderfully as comedy, whenever I need a laugh this guarantee's it. It works woefully on just about any level. If you expect any kind of sexual excitement from Erotic Eva, look elsewhere. The superb score by Umiliani adds essential 70s style and character. The whole film centers around the brothers attempt to gain the affections of bisexual snake dancer Eva, played by the painfully skinny real life wife of Gabriele Tinti, Laura Gemser. The film is filled with magical dialogue, always involving Jack Palance. His spine twitchingly awkward seduction scenes with Gemser, and his subliminally hate filled smarm drenched chats with Jules are truly worthy of legendary status. Fast forward through the attempts at porn, except the scene with the prematurely ejaculating Japanese businessman. In short cheesier than a cheese puff factory, and as amusing and entertaining as cinema gets.","user":"martin-530","rank":[15,19]},{"title":"Disappointing D'Amato sleaze","rating":5,"date":"5 September 2008","review":"When Laura Gemser and Joe D'Amato team up to make a movie; you can bet that no matter what the movie is about or what character Gemser is playing that some of the alternate titles will include the word 'Emanuelle'. And this film is no exception, as it got branded with the unimaginative title 'Emmanuelle Goes Japanese'. Naturally, the film has nothing to do with Gemser's most famous character and thankfully the title Black Cobra Woman is generally the more accepted one - and the one that I saw the film under. From the plot description I was actually thinking that this film might be half decent...and it does at least get off to a decent start. The film focuses on Judas; a rich man who surrounds himself with exotic snakes but has little contact with people. One night, Judas goes with his brother to see an act at a nightclub that involves a beautiful woman dancing with a snake. Naturally, he is immediately taken in by this woman (she's played by Laura Gemser so this part of the film is quite realistic) and decides to take her back to his home...<br><br>Laura Gemser takes the lead role and spends most of the film either naked, getting it on with other women or both; which is all well and good, but anyone familiar with Gemser's filmography will have seen it all so many times before and it's particularly disappointing in this film as we actually have the basis for a decent plot here. One of the more bizarre casting decisions is represented by Jack Palance, who I guess was either not getting a lot of work around the time or just couldn't resist a starring role alongside the beautiful Laura Gemser. Naturally for a Joe D'Amato flick, it features plenty of sleaze and it's really all encompassing so there wouldn't really have been room to flesh out the story even if the director wanted to. The film does at least deliver on the title's implied promise of featuring snakes; and seeing Gemser dance with a big Cobra is worthwhile. A scene that sees a snake skinned alive and cooked was a bit needless, though. Overall, however, this film is not really worthwhile; it's better than some of the lesser Emanuelle flicks, but that's not really saying anything. I can't recommend tracking Black Cobra Woman down.","user":"The_Void","rank":[6,7]}]
