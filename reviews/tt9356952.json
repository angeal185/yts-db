[{"title":"Thus continueth the wonderful legacy of A24 studio","rating":8,"date":"11 October 2019","review":"This is not that funny of a film. The stupidity of the characters actually plays more to tragedy than comedy in my opinion. The movie is a mixture of dark comedy, situational humor, investigative ineptitude, surprisingly good acting, and an entertaining (if aimless) narrative.<br><br>Maybe my love for the Trailer Park Boys predisposed me to liking podunk humor, but I was entertained throughout the whole thing.<br><br>It just feels weird to give this an 8...because...you'll understand when you see it.","user":"gabethurau","rank":[28,37]},{"title":"Fargo in Alabama","rating":7,"date":"8 October 2019","review":"This is a dark comedy that's rarely makes one laugh out loud, but it's still funny, and extremely weird. For me it has hints of Fargo, Beavis and Butthead, and Dale and Tucker vs Evil. The twist is disturbing (without being graphic), unique and utterly unexpected. The characters are (sadly) believable, even if most are stereotypical. Worth a watch.","user":"garymathe-76173","rank":[35,52]},{"title":"Weird is one way to put it","rating":8,"date":"28 September 2019","review":"I didn't know what the expect but man... they did get weird. I was expecting Fargo vibes but this took a whole different turn. The dark comedy is done well I must say.","user":"juliekim-88493","rank":[30,50]}]
