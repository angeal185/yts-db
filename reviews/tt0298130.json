[{"title":"A Big Scare","rating":15,"date":"15 October 2002","review":"I must say that I consider myself to be a lover of horror, but much too often, sex and gore is subsituted for real horror and you don't get that feeling of genuine fear in the pit of your stomach.  Not so with \"The Ring\". Never have I seen a film that has affected me so.  The images seem to tug at your subconscious, at the dark things we keep inside.  I haven't been able to close my eyes without replaying bits of the film behind my eyelids. I have slept with the light on since I've seen it, and we can't stop talking about it.  Hands down, it was the best, the scariest, the creepiest, and the most intense horror film ever.  The audience in the theater all gripped their armrests, breathed heavily and felt everything the characters were experiencing.  It was excellent!  But beware.... don't expect to leave \"The Ring\" in the movie theater, it will certainly be with you for a long time.","user":"hlakey79","rank":[304,367]},{"title":"Great!","rating":10,"date":"17 August 2006","review":"This movie makes you realize why so many other movies fail to be scary...not enough psychological elements. What this movie does right is that it skips the gore, and blood, and over-the-top overacting crazed lunatics that seem the norm in horror movies.<br><br>I saw this with a friend in the theater and 10 minutes in we were sinking into our chairs with fear. Not even the annoying teens making their phones ring to scare their friends (when you see the movie you will understand why) were a powerful enough distraction to undo the terror we felt.<br><br>Definitely see it, make sure you have as big a TV as you can get your hands on when you rent it, and that you watch it at night in the dark...if you want the full effect. Also, make sure you rent it on DVD and NOT cassette...you know, just to be safe ;)","user":"rafajs77","rank":[194,234]},{"title":"disturbing, unsettling and downright creepy.","rating":9,"date":"24 December 2008","review":"I first watched this movie with a couple of friends. To be honest, I was expecting a teenage, slasher flick, I was proved wrong.<br><br>The film circles around a cursed videotape that causes it's viewers to die in seven days. Investigative journalist, Rachel Keller, begins to uncover the secrets of the videotape, and must race against the clock to save herself.<br><br>The movie was very unsettling and disturbing, which worked more effectively than some teens getting slashed with axes. The videotape was nightmarish and disturbing, and the images will stay with you long after the movie. The setting was gloomy and atmospheric, which enhanced the mood. Naomi Watts portrayed Rachel perfectly, her emotions are believable and haunting. <br><br>So if you are looking for a horror flick to watch on Friday night, be sure to watch The Ring, just make sure to watch it at night with the lights off.","user":"monsoon_11","rank":[75,87]}]
