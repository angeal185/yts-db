[{"title":"Fantasy for the light of heart","rating":10,"date":"23 May 2015","review":"My daughter, wife &amp; I all loved this film. Thank you once again Mr. Lucas for staying true to your vision and creating a truly delightful story. Critics are by nature cynical and often lack the ability to see things with an open heart and mind. <br><br>This was a nice change of pace from the cookie-cutter scripts and stories that keep being churned out year after year. We laughed and marveled at the story and the always magnificent ILM visuals.<br><br>I think if you are the type of person who allows hundreds of little things to irritate and annoy you on a daily basis and have a cynical &amp; negative view of life and people in general, then it stands to reason that this film will irritate and annoy you to no end.<br><br>If by contrast, you still have the ability to see the beauty in life &amp; humanity in spite of the horrors that plague us, then you will see the beauty of this story and allow your heart and imagination to just go with it and smile:) That is what we do on a regular basis &amp; I know that we are happier people for it. Quick Fact: critics and studio executives all hated Lucas' little space fantasy film in 1977 called Star Wars!","user":"Thenewt45","rank":[26,28]},{"title":"Not for everyone but definitely worth a watch","rating":10,"date":"14 May 2015","review":"I absolutely love this film, but I'll admit it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Pretty much non-stop singing through the first half and some odd song placement can be a bit jarring to some people. Overall though, it's a very cute and BEAUTIFULLY animated film with some great humor, on point voice acting, and top notch singing. Off beat in the best of ways with very memorable characters that really make the movie. I LOOOOVE Bog King and Marianne and their interactions with each other. Just weird enough to be a cult classic, in my opinion. Definitely worth a shot, if you have an hour and a half to spare some day. You may just love it!","user":"donotquestionme","rank":[63,74]},{"title":"Misunderstood","rating":9,"date":"26 May 2015","review":"First, comment on one star ratings. I can see where children under the age of six (6) or so might not be as captivated as they would be for PBS style kids' programming: expecting simple graphics and age readability appropriate dialogue such as few syllables; short sentences; concrete familiar references; simple, not abstract concepts. Add to this mix some scary visuals. Also, some of the songs are teen and above. So Â… Second, for all ages (except above mentioned) the blend of straight dialogue with pop music (some oldies; some newer) dialogue to move the story forward was artfully blended. Admittedly I didn't quite get it in the beginning, but I was able to overcome some of my dumbness and learned to appreciate it. The singing vocal quality from the voice actors was surprisingly good. Third, computer hardware and graphics' programs continue to evolve and are producing scaringly realistic animations: surfaces, modeling, mattes, compositing naturalistic movement. Kudos to all involved. Fourth, the film's messages of seeing in a new way; looking under the surface; love - all make the film worth watching just for that reason.","user":"westsideschl","rank":[39,45]}]
