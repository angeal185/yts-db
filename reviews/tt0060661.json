[{"title":"A good follow up to the original show!","rating":7,"date":"14 April 2001","review":"I grew up watching the re-runs of the original Flintstones and tried to avoid the new Flintstone shows.  Some of these new shows had the kids all grown up and many of the original voices were not used or not available. However, the original show, especially before the Great Gazoo(sp) was bought into the series, were great.  The only real follow up to the original show that was any good was The Man Called Flintstone.<br><br>This movie had most of the original voices, except for Betty, and has a good story line.  Fred fills in as a substitute for an injured spy and takes on James Bond type missions.<br><br>I found this film held my attention and when I watch it now it brings back the good memories from when I was a kid.  I hope the DVD is released soon.","user":"AbeStreet","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"A Childhood Fave Grownups Can Enjoy!","rating":13,"date":"13 September 1999","review":"Since I was a mere tot of 3 when THE MAN CALLED FLINTSTONE was in theaters, I first discovered it when our local ABC TV affiliate showed it yearly on Thanksgiving morning. It became my fave thing about Turkey Day next to the Macy's parade, and when it became available on home video a few years ago, I found I still loved it! Lovable loudmouth Fred Flintstone is recruited by spymaster Chief Boulder to fill in for injured Fred lookalike Rock Slag, the James Bond of the Stone Age, to capture the megalomaniacal \"Green Goose.\" Wacky hijinks ensue as Fred's chased all over \"Eurock\" by sinister yet bumbling henchmen and slinky glamour gals (the only people in the movie who wear shoes!) while trying to keep Wilma and the Rubbles in the dark about his new \"Spy Type Guy\" temp job. The spy spoofery ranges from grinworthy to hilarious, the songs are catchy, the voice work is delightful--what's not to like? Best of all for me, now that my toddler daughter has discovered...FLINTSTONE, I don't have to wait for Thanksgiving to watch it (and you know how often little kids watch their fave videos! ;-)!","user":"dtb","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"Pure Annimated Classic","rating":10,"date":"12 January 2001","review":"This movie based on the famous TV series may be one of the best annimated movies ever made.  It is a spoof of James Bond movies of the era.  The script is well written with an interesting story line and an exciting ending.  The musical numbers are fun too.  There is a song that Pebbles &amp; Bamm-Bamm sing where they are dreaming about their futures and the visuals during the song are animated in stick figures that look to be drawn by kids. This has to be the cutest song and animation that I have ever seen.","user":"dragonphan","rank":[6,6]}]
