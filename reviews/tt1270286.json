[{"title":"Authentic","rating":7,"date":"23 January 2010","review":"Listen - although I understand the passion behind this movie, I'm not going to sing uncritical praises as some have. It has flaws but it's also not as bad as the weighted user rating suggests (at the time I wrote this review, it was hovering around a 4.6) However, after viewing it tonight, I would not say this movie is for the public at large (thus the undeserved 1 star ratings its garnered - which I believe is more a rejection of the worldview espoused by the film than an authentic impression of the movie itself).<br><br>Although I contest the sincerity of the low ratings, I think I know why: To Save A Life is produced by a church and it feels like it. Primarily - it's a film exhorting Christians to BE followers of Jesus rather than passive egocentric judgmental consumers. Secondarily - it's a powerful listening ear to the hurt, depressed and marginalized among us who may feel invisible to the cold world around them. It also empathizes with those who wrestle with fundamental questions of purpose and meaning. Where I appreciated this about the movie, I'm not too sure how well its narrative will translate to disinterested audiences. It might come across cliché or as religiously charged melodramatic propaganda. And I wouldn't blame anyone for feeling this way. Regardless, you can't go into a horror movie and expect a comedy. Know what to expect: It's a Christian movie. <br><br>That being said, for what it is (and what it was intended to be) my wife and I both thought it was solid. Narratively and artistically. Our 17 year old cousin Nathan agreed. I'm 30 and my wife is 29 so we're not too far removed from the high school experience ourselves. As Christians, we all found the story very authentic. The characters followed natural paths and the emotion captured never felt disingenuous. Dialogue can be tricky - and save a few perfectly-timed cliché moments and pedestrian deliveries, it was engaging and believable. We also appreciated the humility of Jim Britts writing - self-indicting the Church as a major contributor to the pain its trying to heal was both surprising and refreshing.<br><br>Also, this may sound lame, but I went in with the preconceived notion that this would be another 'rich white person' saves 'poor disenfranchised minority' movie. Ironic - I'm white - but for whatever reason, it's something I've noticed in movies and television lately and it's been bothering me. But To Save A Life isn't like that. When I saw the trailer, I almost wrote it off, thinking it would just carry the torch. Angry black dude kills himself. Stud white dude saves the day. I was pleased to be proved wrong as minorities play prominent positive roles in this movie and its not the rich white kid who rides off into the sunset as hero as you might have reasonably assumed. Turns out - dude needs saving too.<br><br>On a technical note, as someone who loves film (context - my favorites include Godfather, John Hillcoat's The Road, PT Anderson's Magnolia, American Beauty, Children of Men, Fight Club) I'm always mindful of the cinematography, editing, etc. I especially pay attention in Christian films - which are typically inept. But not so here. The crew should be proud. <br><br>No matter what harsh criticisms will eventually befall To Save A Life (there will be plenty), this movie exists for people who need to know they're not alone. Leaders and outcasts. The churched and unchurched. We all need saving.<br><br>7/10","user":"reduxinflux-1","rank":[63,71]},{"title":"A 10-Rating, Must-See Film!","rating":10,"date":"23 January 2010","review":"We seldom go to the movies because most aren't worth watching (in our opinion) but my husband &amp; I went to see \"To Save A Life\" yesterday (opening day) knowing it was a faith based movie. We're 40-50 something in age &amp; have been in prison ministry for around 14-15 yrs. This film is a true-to-life movie that shows the reality of what the kids &amp; youth of America go through every day. The suicide rate for teens is unbelievable. Too many of those who don't kill themselves, kill someone else or get into crime &amp; end up in prison...all because they believe nobody cares &amp; life is hopeless. We were impressed with the movie in many ways &amp; found it to be made as very true. I left bawling (that's Texan for crying hard) even though it was humorous in places, too, because we've seen the results of those who have managed to stay alive on the street, but get sentenced (most for the majority of their lives) to prison, just to fight &amp; struggle to survive. Prison life isn't living, only existing. It really is true that we each can save lives...you never know what someone is going through &amp; sometimes just a smile or friendly gesture can make the difference in life &amp; death. We don't think this is just a young people's movie - everyone should see it! We are Christians &amp; have been quite some time, but after viewing this movie, I left changed. Go see it...you won't regret it.","user":"inshock","rank":[42,54]},{"title":"FINALLY a Great Christian Film Without all the Preaching","rating":23,"date":"23 October 2009","review":"Let me start out with saying I was VERY surprised with the production value of this movie. I managed to catch an early showing on 10-22-09, and I have to Say this is the BEST (if not only) Christian film to hit theaters since The Passion.<br><br>Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you off, the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film (divorce, teen pregnancy, drug use, and suicide), but nothing in the film is gratuitous. This is definitely a movie that a Junior High youth group could see without upsetting (most) parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is this is not a film FOR Christians, it is a Family film without the cheesy 7th Heaven feel.<br><br>The laughs are there, and several times in the theater everyone was laughing, the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced, and that made for good pacing in such a serious film. Teens and young adult, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film. The plot is not in any way predictable, and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit. Christians, fortunately, are not shown as all mighty know it all's of \"The Word\", but instead people just trying to understand life. Humans make mistakes and no one is perfect, not even in this film... not by a long shot.<br><br>The acting is top notch, the writing spot on, and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy Christian rhetoric. This is a great film that will make you and your teens think, talk, and perhaps question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family film in January check your local listings for this film, and you might learn something about yourself.<br><br>And I am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie.","user":"Metalcoholic","rank":[63,87]}]
