[{"title":"Confusing and erratic","rating":3,"date":"12 January 2019","review":"I loved the premise and the concepts were intriguing, but it was so poorly written and edited. There were too many cyberpunk tech horror themes crammed in, but none of them were developed well. Since the themes and characters weren't developed well all the scenes felt so jumpy as it just kept cutting to one disparate scene to another or suddenly the characters level of emotion or direction had changed. Then there was weird sexual undertones that I haven't even processed yet lol. The director of the operations was so creepy, felt like he was going to molest everyone, so maybe he was actually well casted if that was his role. The monopoly scene was so weird, I was waiting for a pillow fight to break out. The acting was so over the top that it ruined any potential payoff on the jumpy scenes. Music selection was odd, it felt like It should be playing in an indie coffee shop and a lot of times was used as a transition. I wanted to like this film and I tried to be understanding of its limited indie budget but it's just so bad in many ways.","user":"brent-fontes","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Do not watch","rating":2,"date":"27 March 2019","review":"Waste of time. I should have followed my gut when I saw the horrible trailer.","user":"bwalden-50355","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Senseless","rating":1,"date":"10 June 2018","review":"THE GENERATOR is a senseless British indie science fiction picture with a virtual reality-themed cyber plot. Unfortunately it also has no consistency in its premise and the jumbled storyline is full of incoherence and little else. There are scenes of guys being hooked up to wires and lots of computer stuff, but there are virtually no proper characters and mere snippets about people being connected to a larger matrix. And what's that extended scene with the half naked guys playing Monopoly all about?","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[10,14]}]
