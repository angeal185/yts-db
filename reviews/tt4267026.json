[{"title":"Surprisingly creepy","rating":25,"date":"25 September 2017","review":"I approach all modern found footage movies with a sense of cynicism nowadays - mainly because they're usually atrocious - and going by the trailer, cover and even title of this film, it was no exception. But what a pleasant surprise! Great twists, a real and genuine sense of dread in the hotel and intense up until the end. <br><br>Location was perfect, fairly rural and run down but without giving in to the cliché, 'cabin in the woods' scenario. Great use of Halloween props for creating some ultra-spooky scenes and a decent enough original storyline to keep the viewer interested throughout. <br><br>Not perfect by any stretch, I'm still a bit muddled as to what actually happened in the house but otherwise highly recommended.","user":"johndu-78390","rank":[35,36]},{"title":"Genuinely Creepy","rating":7,"date":"21 July 2017","review":"Not sure what the folks giving the really low reviews were expecting, but for me, this was a genuinely creepy, edge-of-your-seat, horror flick. I tend to like a bit of gore with my horror, of which this has none, but I was, nonetheless, kept interested throughout the film, always wondering what might happen next. If you have a fear of clowns, this isn't going to help you get over it. The film does really well with subtle scares. No clichéd cat-jumping-out-of-a-closet stuff, nor does it need a scary musical score to clue you that it's supposed to be scary. Some might have difficulty handling the hand-held camera viewpoint, but if that doesn't bother you, and you are a fan of the 'found footage' genre, this is worth a look.","user":"jordan2240","rank":[31,34]},{"title":"Genuinely scary and underrated.","rating":7,"date":"7 September 2017","review":"Hell House LLC was probably the biggest surprise for me in the found footage genre. The movie flowed well throughout the whole duration, not becoming too boring like some horror movies often do. While there is a lack of character development at the start, they begin to flesh out later on in the film. The story seems believable as well, while some movies may explore a haunted area \"because they want to see what is there\", Hell House LLC sets up a more stable backstory, explaining how setting up haunted houses is a practice for the crew and that they need to go through with it for financial reasons.<br><br>If you want a found footage horror film and don't want cheesy jump scares then this movie is great for you.","user":"mitchellzelenak","rank":[19,21]}]
