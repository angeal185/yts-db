[{"title":"Worth taking a look at","rating":7,"date":"23 April 2018","review":"So much more than what I was expecting. If you saw the trailer to this movie, not only does it barely scrape the surface of what's going on but it's a little misleading to what the film is really about. It's not the best movie in the world, as it's a little too obviously being used as a vehicle for Paula Patton (who also produced it) to show how well she can do in the driver's seat as a leading lady, but the overall direction it's heading down was very satisfying to see.","user":"subxerogravity","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Had me scared...","rating":9,"date":"25 April 2018","review":"I would like to think I don't scare easily. This movie had unexpected twists &amp; I loved it. I hated Paula's make-up &amp; dingy ways in the beginning but I got over it. Really enjoyed the characters &amp; story line.","user":"muziklover804","rank":[858,961]},{"title":"Regardless the movie quality, I recommend all girls should watch the movie","rating":22,"date":"22 April 2018","review":"This movie is based on a real case happened in North Cal, which is where I'm currently living. I used to think this kind of criminal - human traffic - would only take place in the area where it's far and less developed. However, this movie made me realize the hidden danger. I became more cautious like double check the front and back door lock every night before going to bed. I also began to avoid going to places in the middle of no where by myself (which I did a lot before). <br><br>I think all girls should have this sense in their mind, that the world is not as safe as we though. It's really important to learn to protect ourselves. <br><br>Therefore, regardless how good/bad the movie is ( i think it's pretty good), I give it a 10/10 star and recommend every girl to watch it for the lesson it taught us and the public awareness it raises.","user":"chengcheng202","rank":[1,1]}]
