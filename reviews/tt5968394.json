[{"title":"A rare movie","rating":8,"date":"24 August 2019","review":"Personally, I am glad such movies are made. \"Rare\" doesn't always mean \"good\" but in this case it does. That said, it certainly is far from entertaining and hardly suitable for some light-hearted Saturday night family past-time. Also, don't expect a sci-fi action - it's a (political) thriller and the alien invasion here could be replaced with any dictatorship. It is not fully clear whether the film-makers chose aliens for dramatic effect or just to make it easier for the audience to decide who the bad guys are. Sadly, history proved that not all freedom fighters make their country a better place.\nAs for the story, acting, cinematography - everything works well together to create the atmosphere of oppression, hopelessness and despair. There have been complaints that the script is messy. Well, it is not. If you accept the fact that there is no main character, no hero, no saviour, no deus ex machina and just watch closely, you are in for a decent detective story as well where each scene has a purpose and makes sense (honestly, I was able to predict the final \"twist\" something like 30% into the movie and still enjoyed sitting it through).\nAll in all, Captive State is bound to be misunderstood by those who want to unwind and is a rare gem for those who are open to a dark and thought-provoking story and are fed up with superhero extravaganza","user":"ostrovskydanielbackup","rank":[65,79]},{"title":"I was somewhat captivated..","rating":6,"date":"30 October 2019","review":"There seems to be a lot of hate for this one, whereas to me, it was a decent and gritty little slice of dystopian fiction that came out of nowhere.\nI mean, it's not great, but I've seen worse. Way worse.<br><br>The story is basically The Man in the High Castle but with strange aliens rather than human invaders. So there's a secret band of insurgents working individually towards an opportunity to fight back.\nNothing new there.<br><br>Character development also suffers because there are too many players and too little time.\nThis should have been a limited series at best, but to what end, since we've seen it all before and, as mentioned, we already have Philip K. Dick's inspired The Man in the High Castle, for those who are interested in the long game.<br><br>Despite all that, I thought the actors did a decent job in their respective roles, and I'm really liking John Goodman's choice in movies this decade.<br><br>However, I did not expect the final twist at the end Ã  la a Trojan Horse.\nThat was either very clever or very dumb of me to not see it coming.<br><br>Also, the fact that we, the audience, did not get a chance to even catch a glimpse of the so-called Closed Zone, was such a cop-out.\nHow dare they force me to use my imagination when whatever it was they were cooking up in there could've been anything!","user":"alexqueens","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts","rating":6,"date":"5 April 2019","review":"A powerful alien invasion. A surrender to avoid an ineluctable annihilation. The whole humanity under alien domination.<br><br>After this quick introduction, we elliptically switch nine years later, without really understanding how the human/alien cohabitation works. But this is definitely unimportant. <a href=\"/title/tt5968394/\">Captive State (2019)</a> is indeed a suspenseful thriller full of undercover agents, spies, policemen and a few aliens, with a profoundly dark and hardly optimistic atmosphere. The story takes place in Chicago in the near future and that, in some respects, looks like Paris, between June 14, 1940 and August 24, 1944, with resistance fighters and collaborators, and with aliens instead of German soldiers.<br><br>Thus, <a href=\"/title/tt5968394/\">Captive State (2019)</a> is obviously not an action/war movie, in a science-fiction context. And absolutely not a pop corn movie! The actors (especially <a href=\"/name/nm0000422/\">John Goodman</a>), the photography, the special effects, the atmosphere, ... that's heavy! Nevertheless, the script is a bit messy. We must wait for the very last scene in order to stick the pieces back together and have a global picture. The making is sometimes clumsy which may confuse the audience. Besides, some people left the movie theater during the screening I attended. Personally, it took me a while to understand and appreciate this story. Slightly frustrating.<br><br>As a synthesis: 6/7 of 10.","user":"FrenchEddieFelson","rank":[126,184]}]
