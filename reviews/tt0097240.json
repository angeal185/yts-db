[{"title":"an unregarded masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"20 January 2001","review":"This is a period picture that takes place in 1971, but there are no references to Vietnam, the flower power movement, Kent State or any other issues or events of the day. This is because the characters have nothing to do with that world. Bob's thoughts revolve around drugstores like planets around the sun. His family of dope thieves lives in almost total isolation. Even junkies who come to do business are admitted to their home with reluctance and then rudely sent on their way. Their only contact with the \"other\" world is its drugstores and its cops. They live in a world not ruled by the authorities, but by \"the dark forces that lie hidden beneath the surface, the ones that some people call superstitions: howling banshees, black cats, hats on beds, dogs, the evil eye...\" In his world, Bob's lunatic logic makes perfect sense and serves him as a guide for living better than any \"sane\" worldview.<br><br>When the crew goes \"crossroading\" to the tune of \"the Israelites\" we realize that they, too, are like children of a different god; wanderers whose only contact with others is hostile confrontation. They are either \"attacking\" drug stores or being attacked by ball-breaking cops.<br><br>Kelly Lynch, who plays Diane, said in an interview that, \"The first take was terrible and Matt (Dillon) said he wouldn't support the film.\" It is not surprising that a film this ambitious should run into some snags. A great film like \"DC\" is a tightrope act. The best scenes in the film are also the riskiest; they would have fallen apart in the hands of lesser actors.<br><br>If you like the film you might get a kick out of the autobiographical novel on which it is based, by James Fogle, the original drugstore cowboy. At the time of the film's release (1989) Fogle had spent \"thirty-five of his fifty-three years in prison on drug-related charges.\" I wonder what ever became of him.","user":"meisterpuck","rank":[65,70]},{"title":"Please see below","rating":9,"date":"5 September 2009","review":"This movie has much personal meaning to me. In 1990, I had the unfortunate pleasure to be incarcerated at the Northern Nevada Correctional Center in Stewart(Carson City, NV.) Yea, we had cable TV, and first run movies. This was one of them. After viewing the movie, I laughed w/ my co-horts about suing for copy right infringement. (joking, of coarse). My prison stint was drug related. but the interesting thing is: I and my girlfriend at the time made these sames moves:(Seizures and all)at a southwestern state small town where the Dilaudids were actually kept on the shelf.(1981-83)We hit this one pharmacy -3- times(largest haul:470 Dilaudids-1,2,3,and 4mg--Smallest: one bottle of 100 # 4's).I lived in Nevada all my life. I did several small stints in several prisons. In closing. I wanted to write this and note, it was a looong time ago. I have lived in Portland ,OR. now for 19 yrs. And I celebrated my -11- year clean anniversary date last Thurs. (8/28/09). After a medical detox, I hooked up w/ a local methadone prgm. and never looked back. It saved MY and my WIFE's life. Take from this what you will. But it's true and I still get a kick out of this movie and \"my story\" as it relates w/ it. I rarely tell it often. But I did want to post this message. Thank you for allowing me to express myself...Sincerely, doctom1973......","user":"Doctom1973","rank":[59,64]},{"title":"I saw many, many people like these in the 1970's in San Francisco","rating":10,"date":"26 November 2007","review":"I lived in San Francisco all through the 1970's and saw tons of these kinds of people. They all tended to \"group\" together for the common purpose of scoring and getting high on any kind of drugs available, but the drug of choice always seemed to be heroin. These groups, or small communes, always tended to have a strong leader who ran the whole show for the group and issued \"orders\" like a drill sergeant, but interestingly, in a very \"loving\" way. And nobody ever seemed to question this leader. In fact, HE always seemed to be treated with complete deference (reverence???) as if HE were some kind of a star. Everybody in the group seemed to have a specific \"job\" to do within the group, and their jobs seemed to define their value to the group and, hence, their \"right\" to be there. Except for the fact that they existed in the general \"hippy\" milieu of the time, they never showed any signs of being interested in the presumed hippy world view. I always felt the groups simply represented highly efficient, small business concerns. These people were known thieves, drug dealers, and small-time con artists and, if left alone, they were not considered dangerous. In fact, they were typically very intelligent and interesting people, but very closed-off to the world outside their group. Each group was like its own little cult. <br><br>The group portrayed in Drugstore Cowboy would have fit in perfectly with what I remember from that time, except that there were typically more people in the groups than just four. I would say these groups numbered more like six to eight people, certainly enough to occupy a large flat or house in one of the cheap neighborhoods. The fact that the cost of living was so much cheaper back then allowed for this type of lifestyle. And it was only when the real estate boom in San Francisco in the mid-to-late 1970's precluded this type of communal existence (lease applications, leases, personal references, high deposits, etc.) that these \"illegal\" groups tended to disappear. The ease with which the group in DC moved from one living space to the other would become impossible due to these new economic and social realities (higher rents and stiffer rules). Yes, even in Portland. <br><br>Anyway, this movie really resonnated with me and triggered my memories of that time, and I think it's accurate to say that this is truly a \"period piece.\" I'm certain that the DC group could have only existed in the early 1970's, and certainly no later than say 1974-5. <br><br>I have no idea why I felt compelled to write all this seeing as how it has very little to do with the movie, which I loved. Thank you!","user":"jingster666","rank":[43,53]}]
