[{"title":"Excellent Movie with Superb Production Value (Highly Recommended!)","rating":4,"date":"4 March 2006","review":"The movie Ultimate Avengers is a very impressive first effort from Marvel animation. Captain America is frozen in the 1940's and rediscovered in the present day. Nick Fury goes about putting together a team of \"earth's mightiest heroes\" to halt a vile global threat, including the incredible Iron Man, Giant-Man, the Wasp, and the Black Widow. Bruce \"The Hulk\" Banner is also working as a scientist, attempting to recreate the super soldier program that created Captain America.<br><br>The animation is spectacular. Computer animation is used perfectly to enhance the realism of the scenes. This feature carries weight on its own, soldiers actually visibly die on screen and heroes actually bleed in this universe.<br><br>As good as the action is, the dialogue holds its owns and characters are developed perfectly to add more weight to the story. The threat feels real. In the end, the threat is eliminated but to the treat of the viewer, that's just when the real fun begins! I most certainly recommend this amazing movie. Nothing you'll see on Saturday morning (or night for that matter) can compare to this epic tale.","user":"assman200","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"One Brilliant Animated Production!","rating":10,"date":"26 February 2006","review":"Where to begin? Ultimate Avengers is simply one brilliant rendition of Marvel's (and Earth's) Mightiest Heroes. I've read different reactions and I've heard from both sides of this debate. Some serious Ultimates fans wanted this movie to be an exact reenactment of the comic book. Marvel instead made a conscious decision to infuse the old school Avengers in to the Ultimates mix. It was a masterful decision. The combination works very well. Gone are the overblown and, quite frankly, juvenile elements of the Ultimates. Having a horny Hulk or an outrageously abusive Henry Pym may work to capture the teenage comic crowd (which is exactly why the Ultimate Universe was created) but it doesn't play with main stream audiences. The title Ultimate Avengers fits because it's just that, a perfect meshing together of two separate universe of characters. The edge that made the Ultimates popular is still present but the characters that made the Ultimates possible in the first place still shine through. Captain America is perfect. You can really see why Marvel is lining up to give him his own live action movie. It'll be great, maybe even better then this masterful animated treat.","user":"peevedoff2","rank":[47,60]},{"title":"One extremely satisfying thrill ride!","rating":10,"date":"21 February 2006","review":"The action is spectacular and the storyline keeps you riveted from start to finish. This movie grabs with its cinematic lead in and flashback to World War Two. (Complete with throwback radio broadcast) From there, it's one big roller coaster ride to the pulse pounding finish. The battle sequences are some of the best ever animated. I think the PG-13 rating really helps. Soldiers die and heroes bleed, that completely draws the viewer in to the feature. I think movie fans of all ages will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers upon. This is a smart and surprisingly interesting film that really delivers. Calling this movie a cartoon doesn't really seem right or do it justice.<br><br>Like my title says, one extremely satisfying thrill ride!","user":"youyouaction","rank":[50,67]}]
