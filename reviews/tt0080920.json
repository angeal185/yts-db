[{"title":"Excellent piece of exploitation","rating":10,"date":"27 February 2001","review":"Derek Jarman used some of his 70s home movie footage to produce this wonderful piece of exploitational avantgarde cinema. Actually the original material has been slowed down to a speed of 3-6 frames, then Jarman added colour effects and the pulsating, menacing score by Industrial supergroup Throbbing Gristle (\"Hot on the Heels of Love\").<br><br>The result is a piece of art not to dissimilar to JarmanÂ´s painting work in using found footage as elements of memory and mind that resemble ideas reflected in the Cabala and in C.G. Jung`s writings about an archetypical past that is hidden in everyone of us.","user":"fammyM","rank":[14,23]}]
