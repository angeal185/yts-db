[{"title":"Ok 10 might be stretching it","rating":6,"date":"13 May 2019","review":"People who are giving 10/10...come on now...this doesn't compare to Inside Out, Zootopia, Toy Story, Lion King etc\nWas it terrible...no but it was missing something. Yes the message was good but could have been delivered more powerfully and the best part was definitely all the musical scenes. So at least a 6 is fair.","user":"phylicia1","rank":[54,70]},{"title":"I can't believe this has such a low rating","rating":9,"date":"26 August 2019","review":"This was one of the best shows I have seen in a long time. It isn't your typical show. The message is great though, and it is so adorable. Spoiler alert, I think the ugly dolls are cuter. If it weren't for the incessant songs, I would give it a 10.","user":"eheughins-61447","rank":[11,13]},{"title":"Don't believe the bad rating. Watch for yourself.","rating":9,"date":"25 December 2019","review":"This was a great movie! I can't believe the bad rating, I usually don't even enjoy kids movies. I came into this movie thinking wow a rip off of trolls this is going to be trash looking at the reviews &amp; then once I actually watched till the middle I was loving it! My girls also loved the movies, 5 and 7, both enjoyed it!","user":"lexisandkaylie","rank":[7,8]}]
