[{"title":"Bad acting","rating":2,"date":"7 November 2018","review":"The movie starts off with some nice camera angles and gives a rather professional impression, until you get to the first meaningful scenes. The acting is rather amateuristic and you doesn't pull you into the movie. Instead, you start questioning the somewhat forced/unnatural reactions the characters show. I do not get the rather high 6/10 rating here, which made me gave this movie a chance, unfortunately.","user":"gregorylambelin","rank":[13,16]},{"title":"How did this get to production?","rating":1,"date":"6 November 2018","review":"This film is mostly meaningless.\nA contrived storyline, poor acting and an extremely annoying and unsuitable soundtrack add up to one of the worst films I've ever forced myself to sit through.\nIf you like Kraftwerk you might give this two stars.","user":"mbprocter","rank":[16,22]},{"title":"The film dies in the first two minutes","rating":1,"date":"10 November 2018","review":"This really is an awful film. Pick any aspect of film making and this is BAD.<br><br>Acting? What acting!!<br><br>To be fair, and the reason I gave this film a star, is because Kateryna Korchynska does try to make the best of a bad job. Obviously the directing was atrocious, and her 'co-star' (David White) is one of the worst 'actors' I have seen in a long time,<br><br>On a different environment with professionals she might make a good actress in time. But this movie certainly doesn't do anything for her career.<br><br>The camerawork was fairly acceptable, there was no thought given to any artistic aspect of the film, such as lighting - or continuity for that matter - and the sound (in the bits that needed some thought and effort) was absolutely atrocious.<br><br>As for the editing - I think someone must just have taken whatever they were given and tacked it on to the end of whatever they had done so far.<br><br>The trouble with a film like this is there isn't even any comic relief - something to laugh at until your sides burst. It is mediocrity done very badly.<br><br>How on earth this movie could have attained three stars let alone five is beyond my comprehension. I think there has been a bit of dodgy voting going on by families and friends.<br><br>A terribly made affront to film - avoid.","user":"mjsreg","rank":[7,10]}]
