[{"title":"Boring piece of crap","rating":1,"date":"29 May 2002","review":"I bought this movie for about 2,5 dollars at a local flea market. I thought that with the cast present in this movie (Ice-T, Rob Lowe &amp; Mario Van Peebles are all OK), it would be pretty good. Boy, was I wrong. This movie annoyed the hell out of me. Almost every scene drags on too long. The scene where Rob Lowe is watching this girl singing and dancing in a bar lasts forever! It was one of the worst scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie. The rest is no picknick either. My guess is when they finished the movie, they only had 30 minutes of film, so they made everything last 3x longer.<br><br>Conclusion: The current 1,9 rating here on imdb is right on the money. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Go watch some paint dry for 1,5 hour instead of watching this!<br><br>If you want to see some better movies made by this director, watch 'Mean Guns'(with Christopher Lambert &amp; Ice-T) or 'Postmortem' (with Charlie Sheen) instead.","user":"saviovega","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"All style; no substance","rating":2,"date":"23 March 2000","review":"Honestly, I didn't really have high expectations for this movie, but at the same time I was hopeful. Having it be directed by Albert Pyun - a well known b-movie auteur - didn't exactly raise my hopes. I mean how many Albert Pyun flicks rank that highly? Yeah, exactly ... but still the movie advertised a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles.<br><br>It all amounts to squat however as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that the energy just seemed to drain right out of me the longer it went on. It runs over 90 minutes, but it's telling a story that could have been told in 30 minutes flat. I don't know what Pyun was going for here. I mean the movie drips artsy-like style, but it's a blur at times and maybe I'm an idiot for expecting more from Pyun this time around. Here he seemed to actually have a budget and a potentially great cast for the material, but it's all wasted. Crazy Six isn't much of an action film, it's not much of anything really.<br><br>I guess what's the saddest here is the fact that I found the end credits the most entertaining part of the movie. The music score is actually half-decent with some smooth female vocals too, but the rest is a complete waste and the less said the better. Avoid.","user":"refinedsugar","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"it's not quite that bad...","rating":6,"date":"20 July 2002","review":"Granted, it's no Mean Guns, but it doesn't quite deserve to have a rating under 2. It had a fair few dull scenes, but the last half hour is pretty good. It's true that the credits are the best part though, but that's because the music's so good, much too good for this movie.","user":"Zargo","rank":[7,10]}]
