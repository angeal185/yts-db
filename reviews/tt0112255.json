[{"title":"Part Crouching Tiger, Part Surf Ninjas, this rollercoaster ride gets Three Knuckles up!","rating":7,"date":"7 February 2002","review":"One would think that after the previous two adrenaline-soaked installments in this series that the franchise would run out of steam, but instead of moving forward at the breakneck speed one would expect, instead it slows down and looks inward, finding fertile new ground to explore.  One such example is when the boys first meet their native american uncle, and are illuminated to the ecological problems in our consumer specific culture. Not since \"Fire Down Below\", has their plight been so real that you cannot ignore it, and must hold yourself to blame.  Another prime example is when Tum Tum runs afoul of the Yakuza, and his brothers steadfast protection of him in the face of danger.  A bold, artistic statement, Three Ninjas Knuckle Up gives up the way of punches and kicks, and chooses the love of family over blitzkreig martial arts shenanigans in what is the most refreshing film of the year, and a prime candidate for film preservation.  (All things said, I must admit that my review may be a little biased, being that I played \"Ninja who gets hit in the crotch #3\", so I hope you'll bear with me)","user":"Meifumado","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"The best of the series its a really good film for kids and adults may enjoy too","rating":5,"date":"5 January 2010","review":"I just watched all three of these movies and I couldn't recommend the first two to anyone really. The first one might be enjoyed by some kids but the second was awful.<br><br>This film was shot a year after part one with the same cast and it was held up in post production and a third film was made but the third film made was actually released second. The kids in this film came back two years later and did some re-shoots and additional scenes and the boy who played Rocky actually has braces and is much taller as is the kid playing Colt.<br><br>This movie isn't flawless by any means it has a very high cheese level to it, a lot of over acting and silly gags aimed at kids. The movie got a PG-13 rating because it had lots more ninja action and a few somewhat adult language bombs dropped, but nothing a kid couldn't watch. I can't imagine older kids enjoying it, but young kids would eat it up.<br><br>As an adult I compared it to a Steven Seagal movie for kids with a touch of old Dukes of Hazard episodes thrown in. It had some great actors doing some not so great roles but it was fun to watch. Donal Logue was funny as one of the bad guys and Charles Napier is great in anything and makes a wonderful bad guy.<br><br>The plot here was different and actually had a message which is good. It is a movie about bad guys dumping hazardous materials on an Indian reservation and the kids go in and try to put a stop to it.<br><br>Fun film - I think if you like kids movies you should enjoy this one, look over flaws and goofs and cheesiness and just watch it.<br><br>The worst thing about this movie was the way the kids yelled A-YAA every time they kicked or hit someone.","user":"pkzeewiz","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"A Delightful, kid-classic popcorn flick","rating":8,"date":"6 February 2004","review":"This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously and alot of people make the mistake of taking it seriously.  It's just plain fun.  I enjoyed it when I was a kid and I still enjoy it now.  It's a classic boy movie.  It was alot better than the other kids movies that came out that year.  These are the kinds of movies I want my kids to see one day because they are entertaining.","user":"alecx5494","rank":[7,12]}]
