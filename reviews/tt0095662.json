[{"title":"Pretty funny.","rating":20,"date":"20 February 2004","review":"Moving should be rated higher! This movie's premise is great as it turns the act of moving into an absolute hilarity!! Family moves from  New Jersey to Boise Idaho!  You just know plenty of wacky hijinks are gonna occur!<br><br>I really think anyone who has ever experienced  moving from one type of place to a completely different one, or anyone who just has had frustrations with moving in general will be able to relate. Nothing offensive about it, just plain good comedy, pretty fun to watch.","user":"triple8","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"You'll use the quote \"we're taking it with us\" forever!","rating":10,"date":"29 January 2006","review":"You can't beat the comedy in this movie. It's all so funny, you'll be in stitches. From the Schizophrenic SAAB driver, to the scary next door neighbour you can't get away from fast enough, to the dog who you have to put a mirror under it's nose to see if he's still breathing! And when the previous owners joke \"we're taking it with us!\", you have ask, \"are they really just joking\"... Richard Pryor, who has now left us, should be so proud of this movie, his comedy is rare and so well timed. Dana Carvey also shines, as the clean cut SAAB driver with multiple personalities. And who can forget Randy Quaid playing both parts of the neighbour from hell, both in New Jersey, and in Boise, Idaho. You'll never want to move again, but you'll die laughing at the Pear's attempt to move!<br><br>PLEASE PLEASE get this movie brought to DVD!","user":"shelleyamber","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"LOTS OF LAUGHS","rating":8,"date":"5 November 1998","review":"This movie is silly as hell, but if you watch it just for laughs it's very good.  There are some nice cameo appearances, especially Dana Carvey and Randy Quaid, that make this worth checking out.  Don't expect any kind of blockbuster, cause it's not.  But for a good laugh be sure and check it.","user":"steve-216","rank":[11,14]}]
