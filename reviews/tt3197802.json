[{"title":"Paramhansa Yogananda as the star of a movie","rating":10,"date":"26 June 2019","review":"So rare these days to find a truly uplifting spiritual movie. .Paramhansa Yogananda's, AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A YOGI, helped launch and continues to inspire a worldwide spiritual revolution. First published in 1946, it continues to be a best seller. Yet in all these years, there have been almost no films about this towering spiritual figure. Now we have an extraordinary, internationally produced story about the Guru and one of his foremost disciples, Swami Kriyananda. Kriyananda is American; Yogananda is from India. It is a full dramatization based on the disciple's autobiography, THE NEW PATH. Gorgeous cinetography, beautiful musical soundtrack, extraordinary performance by the famous Indian actor Victor Bannerjee as the Guru.","user":"asha-55493","rank":[14,14]},{"title":"Touching story!","rating":10,"date":"26 June 2019","review":"It's hard to play a sat guru but Victor Banerjee does an incredible job. He is funny, down to earth, natural, powerful, and believable in the role of Yogananda. You feel as if you are at the feet of the guru. Leon G conveys young Swami Kriyananda's sincerity, enthusiasm, and love for his guru. Highly recommended for anyone wanted to know what it was like to be with the Master.","user":"romanophilip","rank":[19,20]},{"title":"Extremely well done","rating":10,"date":"26 June 2019","review":"One of the best movies l have seen on the spiritual journey.
