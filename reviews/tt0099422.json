[{"title":"Why Wait for the Sunday Funnies Section?","rating":8,"date":"12 October 2003","review":"\"Dick Tracy\" is one of our family's favorites -- the actors are great -- the art direction is exceptional -- the music is magic. It's not supposed to be \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" -- it's a fun experience.<br><br>Stephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: \"Back in Business\" is energetic, \"Sooner or Later\" is just right, \"What Can You Lose\" is haunting -- even tunes like \"Live Alone and Like It\" add to the story<br><br>Got to love the giddily over-the-top performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting villains...  The list is far too long. And, yes -- even Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome.  Written with a smile a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said, \"Wait a minute -- I'm having a thought -- it's gone!\"?).<br><br>However, one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time -- and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer.  So, if you haven't already, why not give \"Dick Tracy\" a chance -- accept it for what it is -- a Sunday comic strip brought to life -- and in a wonderful way!!","user":"pamkirkliz","rank":[43,51]},{"title":"Incredible Colors, Incredible Cast","rating":9,"date":"21 March 2006","review":"This is amazing-looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out over 15 years ago, it stunned audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors, for me at least, make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork.<br><br>The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, but they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing \"Flatop,\" \"Pruneface,\" \"Lips,\" \"Mumbles,\" etc.<br><br>Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and she's as sweet and soft as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed.<br><br>The only negatives I found were Pacino's voice which grates on you after awhile, Madonna's off-key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes. Those \"faults\" are all minor because overall, this is a fun movie....a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly-colorful fashion.....like nothing you have ever seen.","user":"ccthemovieman-1","rank":[74,92]},{"title":"Fun, Exciting and Underrated.","rating":7,"date":"12 November 2007","review":"After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6.99$ bin at Future Shop I decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very fun, smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. The movie moves along well, it has of course another solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city. Madonna was great as the damsel in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give Dick Tracy a try. I don't think you will be disappointed. And Watch for the cameos from Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.","user":"Scorsese_Fan44","rank":[9,9]}]
