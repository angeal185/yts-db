[{"title":"Sensual 90's Flick","rating":9,"date":"28 January 2010","review":"Personally I thought the film was very entertaining.<br><br>The plot itself was very well planned out and the actors were fantastic. I'd describe this film as a great representation of a 90's genre flick, being that it was sensual and erotic while at the same time providing a thrilling storyline.<br><br>As a fan of Alyssa Milano I'd say this was one of her best films and Jonathon Schaech did a great job in this film as well. More than just a movie full of sexual scenes, it touches and delves into a topic we can all relate to. I mean how many of us haven't imitated a person we've idolized? It's not unnatural to want to be like someone you thoroughly admire.<br><br>Overall, this movie was very entertaining and worth the watch. If you're looking for a throwback to the good old 90's while getting to see some sensual action, then this is the movie for you. Definitely better than the first I'd say. But then, why don't you see for yourself?","user":"fairydustsetmefree","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Very Hot, Very Sexy, Very Erotic","rating":24,"date":"24 May 2000","review":"Poison Ivy 2:  Lily is a great movie, much better than the first.  While the original Poison Ivy was very tame  (it's only nudity was a brief shot of a bare butt)  Poison Ivy 2: Lily contains loads of nudity.  Lily arrives at an art college where she takes up with sculptor Gredin and poses nude for her art teacher Donald Falk.  Soon Donald is so obsessed with Lily that he tries to rape her and that leads to some tragic consequences for all involved.  I did enjoy the original Poison Ivy but enjoyed the 2nd much more because it dared to show more bare flesh and had a good storyline.  I recommend that you see both films.<br><br>Poison Ivy 2:  Lily is Rated R for strong sexuality and nudity, adult language, and for some violence.<br><br>NOTE:  Poison Ivy 2:  Lily was released in two versions:  an R Rated version that trims some sex scenes, and an UNRATED version that contains two more minutes of sexual sequences.","user":"Ride-3","rank":[29,39]},{"title":"the seductress","rating":6,"date":"30 December 2007","review":"wow......Alyssa Milano, dang i'll never watch Who's the Boss the same way ever again. She does have a banging body let me say that much,, as for the movie.. where do i start, well here goes nothing, the premise i thought was okay,, i mean finding a diary, then trying to be somebody y our'e not to gain attention,, hmmm., anyway, she discovers her body, and what she want to do,, she is betrayed, betrays others, and is downright cold. i didn't care for the ending though, but everything else in between made sense to me. This isn't a bad sequel,, i thought the original was better, but this one was more sensual, and had more depth to it sexually than the first. This film reminds me of like a Soft Core Porn almost, sort of like Nicolas Cage in Zandalee, but softer, overall not a bad pic,","user":"kairingler","rank":[5,5]}]
