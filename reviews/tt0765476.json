[{"title":"Wonderful feel-good movie...no matter what anyone else says","rating":26,"date":"26 July 2008","review":"It is rare for me to feel so strongly about something that I actually register on a website JUST to add my own comment to it. Well, this is what I just did here on IMDb because.... this movie rocks. I'm looking at the ratings breakdown and almost half of the votes are 1 out of 10 while the other half is evenly spread over ratings from 2 to 10. Is it just me or does someone want to bring this gem of a movie down? o_O <br><br>Eddie Murphy is awesome as both Dave (the ship) and its captain, and the supporting cast is brilliant...I smiled throughout the whole movie and had some real laughs, the plot is tight with no real holes I could make out, AND... whoever it was that said the whole premise is silly and laughable is forgetting one important thing about these kind of movies: They're fantasy entertainment. <br><br>And on that basis, \"Meet Dave\" works. Humor, warmth, a friendship/self-confidence message, faith in the good in humans, it's all there and wonderfully done. Of course the plot is more than unlikely, but that's the beauty of movies in general - they can take you to an imaginary world and let you be amazed at the \"what-ifs.\" <br><br>It's just such a shame that most people aren't even going to bother seeing this once they glance at the IMDb rating. As for me, I can't wait for the DVD release. It rocks, from the first minute to the last.<br><br>Welcome back, Eddie Murphy :)","user":"ronniebun","rank":[133,169]},{"title":"I totally agree ! A great family comedy film","rating":8,"date":"27 July 2008","review":"I've just watched the film and wanted to take a look at it on IMDb. I actually couldn't believe that it's scored only 3.2 . Well, if your understanding of comedy is chicks with no tops in it and using slang language, then maybe this is not a film for you. But the film has clearly nice, fun jokes. It's suitable for families. I actually enjoyed the film and would suggest it. I have enjoyed watching film of Eddie Murphy since my childhood and with this film he still shows he's really a nice comedian. So i can say to people who would like to spend some time with laughing, they can go and see this movie. I don't think they'd not like it if comedy is what they are looking for.","user":"noalpha","rank":[122,160]},{"title":"A lot better than expected!","rating":8,"date":"24 August 2008","review":"I am part of those people who surfed on IMDb to check the rating of this movie and was amazed to see it scoring less then a 4... Obviously this is not going to deserve an Academy Award, but still I don't get all those people who gave it a 1/10. What where they expecting from a movie with this kind of plot? <br><br>On the other hand, I found the movie a LOT more entertaining than expected! I had \"normal\" expectations for the movie, thinking that I would have sat having a decent time for a couple of hours. Instead I found myself laughing out loud most of the time! Eddie Murphy proved to be in great shape, as just his facial expressions were enough to set the audience on fire! The movie was also carried on in a smart way, without turning boring or too obvious. <br><br>This is STRONGLY suggested if you have kids!","user":"kbros11","rank":[49,61]}]
