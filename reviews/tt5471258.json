[{"title":"Forgive Me","rating":8,"date":"28 November 2018","review":"The film spans 2 eras in Irish history. In 1916 a young priest in a rural town leads villagers and a young boy in the Dublin uprising. Years later in 1969, they come together again.<br><br>Overall the film was excellent but sad. It doesn't make any kind of statement about the struggle for Irish Independence, other than families get destroyed.<br><br>English subtitles.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[4,6]}]
