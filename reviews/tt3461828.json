[{"title":"Slightly more serious at the same time way more ridiculous","rating":5,"date":"7 March 2015","review":"Nothing like watching a flick were a girl gets into a gun battle wearing nothing but a pair of boots.<br><br>The two detectives from the first movie are back. This time with a new cat (the old one does not do straight-to-video, I guess) on the run.<br><br>Replacing the beautiful scenery of Serbia, with a not as nicely shoot New Orleans, This time a hot stripper steals blue prints from an army base and is being hunted for them.<br><br>Antony and Julian come into the case when the Julian's cousin, who was there when the whole thing went down, needs his help to figure out what happen.<br><br>It's far cheesier and pokes fun at itself and the original movie by being far more over the top, but that's what makes it fun.<br><br>Julian seems to get to be the better detective in this film, and this time both Antony and Julian get love interest. <br><br>The movie also dabbles in the area of superhero movie with the new Cat having a Wolverine style origin, and a villain who looks like a reject from an Iron Man movie. You usually don't use the term \"jumping the Shark\" when it comes to movies, but this bad boy changed genres and becomes a complete different, outrageous, element, but I found the whole thing noting but hilarious. <br><br>I really liked it. I found it interesting in ways that differ and the first one.","user":"bbickley13-921-58664","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Good light action","rating":7,"date":"26 March 2015","review":"In the intro two Russian strippers are taken to a military base. During their routine, one of them makes her way to the server room and downloads some info on a drive. She's caught. A firefighter ensues, for some reason this stripper decides to sacrifice herself, while the other escapes.<br><br>Then we meet the two goofs from part 1. They now have a restaurant. One of them gets the other, the chef, on some cooking contest. So off they go to New Orleans. There they discover that a cousin of one of them is being held responsible for some of the mess of the intro. So they decide to use their private investigator skills to clear his name.<br><br>They visit the morgue and take a look at the dead stripper's body. Suddenly the other stripper arrives. She says good-bye to her friend and finds the drive hidden among her clothes. The goofs manage not to get caught. They then go to the strip joint and interrogate the owner. Meanwhile, ninjas are after the stripper and want the info on the drive. We meet the stripper's handler and the boss.<br><br>When the info the stripper recovers proves rather useless, the boss decides that the stripper is disposable. That changes things quite a bit.<br><br>Cat Run 2 is more accomplished than part 1. Fortunately the two goofs aren't all that much in the center of the movie. Rather the story of the stripper/agent is, the info, and the guys after her. But it retains some of the silliness; a good part of the dialogue is just adolescent stuff. The nudity is outstanding though and much improved compared to part one. The action is surprisingly well done. For a sexy light action movie, an uncommon genre to begin with, Cat Run 2 is an enjoyable and recommended movie.","user":"TdSmth5","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"the sequel fails the original","rating":3,"date":"27 August 2014","review":"The cinematography doesn't hold up to the original as you can tell that they were on a limited budget. None the less the action gets spliced with humor that seems comical and changes the tone for a moment but doesn't integrate well. The writing could of been better and quite honestly they could of been more inventive. There were characters the were interesting but so many missed opportunities to exploit them fully. I was disappointed but mildly entertained. I'm glad at least the two main characters are in there but was very disappointed to see that was it and there wasn't necessary much continuity from the previous movie as the first one suggested that they created an agency which seemed to only continue in this movie as a brief mention. I want to say it had to be budgetary constraints otherwise this could of been a better movie (also poor story plot).","user":"norman-washington-bent","rank":[9,21]}]
