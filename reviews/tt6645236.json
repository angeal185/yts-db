[{"title":"A fantastic story","rating":9,"date":"6 June 2019","review":"Passionate and shocking, Blue really struck a chord with me. I really hope this film is spread far and wide, as it does have a great message about the stresses that can lead someone to suicide.","user":"jeff-33085","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Fantastic!","rating":10,"date":"8 November 2019","review":"This movie handles tough subjects with dignity, and makes it approachable and puts it within grasp for someone with limited firsthand exposure. It doesn't gloss over anything though, and handles the highs and lows with a straight lens and some humor.","user":"martiyoman-24695","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Finding hope through darkness with light, laughter & some tears","rating":9,"date":"23 October 2019","review":"I was SO happily surprised by the beautiful mix of laughter &amp; tears watching this movie. It is a wonderful film with brilliant acting, the leads have great chemistry. It can be a heavy subject but there's so much light &amp; life within it. Loved it! It shows that when you feel you have nothing left, you can dig deep within yourself or find even the tiniest bit of hope from another to keep going.","user":"dramacow","rank":[7,8]}]
