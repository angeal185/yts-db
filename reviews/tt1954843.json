[{"title":"A strange gem in a big universe!","rating":7,"date":"12 March 2014","review":"This film completely passed my radar and I only came across it by accident. Some well-known actors in a film that draws on the same dead-pan humor and special effects as Red Dwarf.<br><br>Kristin Kreuk looks great as usual. Amanda Tapping gives a good performance not too far removed from her character on Star Gate and, as expected, George Takei from Star Trek does a great voice for a very unusual visitor to the space station.<br><br>Personally, I liked it. Just don't expect Star Wars - the budget wouldn't have stretched that far. Don't take it seriously and just go along for the ride. It's daft in places - but laugh-out loud in others. Worth a watch!","user":"C.J.-4","rank":[35,41]},{"title":"Quirky","rating":7,"date":"6 December 2019","review":"Funny little movie that I stumbled across completely by accident.\nAlthough I knew all the actors from previous projects, this film flew completely under my radar.\nIt has some offbeat humor and the cast pulls it off and what could have easily been an unwatchable movie is actually quite good.<br><br>Although the entire cast does a good job, Billy Boyd stands out playing the station captain and is outright hilarious as is George Takei for his voice work.<br><br>The one strange thing is that from what I have read this film cost about 30 million to make, and I can't quite justify that amount of money based on the sets and effects I saw.\nUnless the actors were paid an insane amount, something is off with the budget numbers.<br><br>Recommended for a light hearted fun time.","user":"Athanatos173","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Funny sci-fi","rating":8,"date":"10 June 2018","review":"Hey Hollywood, <br><br>See this movie?\nMade on a budget, yet it manages to be better than any of your recent blockbusters.<br><br>An interesting idea, interesting characters, and good acting. <br><br>It's also funny. <br><br>Watch it, take notes, and please try to learn something. <br><br>Thanks.","user":"ijameson","rank":[7,10]}]
