[{"title":"Worst film I have seen in a very long time","rating":1,"date":"19 June 2017","review":"This is the worst film I have seen in a very long time. And I have seen some very very bad films. Some of the actors are not bad - I wonder how they got involved in this turd - but some of it is very cringy, but the writing is appalling too. The photography is not great, but hey this is an indie film, and I can forgive that. But the story, oh dear... It has so many plot holes, it's pretty much impossible to follow half of the time. References to characters that never make it into the film, references building up to situations that are not eventually on screen, it makes no sense whatsoever. It tries really hard to be Bridesmaids or Sex and the city, but it really doesn't manage. I mean, if you want to watch an awful film with your friends and laugh at it, this is the one, give it a go, otherwise, don't waste your time, you've been warned.","user":"berasatubi","rank":[10,18]},{"title":"A Real Drag","rating":2,"date":"1 May 2019","review":"Totally disjointed, aimless, waste of time on utter crap. The writers may have had several memory implants in their brains in conceiving this mess. It lacks plot, depth, imagination or continuity. If you are a prospective viewer, then take this hint- if you have been ever been to a China shop , then here the bull, donkey and horse are all there.","user":"mahindaradio","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Well-shot, fun romcom featuring some lovely female camaraderie!","rating":9,"date":"11 October 2018","review":"The headline says it all. this film looked really good! High quality/well shot. It's a feel good romcom that features some lovely leading ladies. It's fun, give it a watch!","user":"thewoz-1","rank":[0,0]}]
