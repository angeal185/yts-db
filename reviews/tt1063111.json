[{"title":"Intense Small Town Kaleidoscope","rating":8,"date":"19 April 2010","review":"Is everybody too busy watching blockbusters to see this nice example of Indie film-making? It would be a pity, because they'd be missing a well-crafted cinematic narrative covering twenty-four hours in the small mountain town of Prospect. The film begins at dawn as a promising young country musician prepares for one last gig at the town bar, before heading off to see if he can make it in Nashville. As the day unfolds other citizens make their appearances - a regretful sheriff, his estranged wife, an alcoholic father, an overweight brother, a troubled ex-con and an overbearing mother. Their stories mingle in an varied mix of compact narratives, most of which are concerned with the relationships of parents and their children - some of them sentimental in tone, and others which display cold cruelty and pain.<br><br>A fine cast portrays this collection of characters realistically, while cinematographer Matt Kovalakides captures their high-country summer world so intensely that one can almost smell the pine resin. Everything speaks of a well-balanced team effort, and the characters and their stories are worth the dedication. By the time night falls over Prospect, a discerning audience might well feel they got more bang for their buck than if they'd seen a dozen self-important, hundred-million-dollar vanity projects.","user":"tigerfish50","rank":[37,51]},{"title":"Not a bad way to pass the time.","rating":6,"date":"7 December 2010","review":"'SMALL TOWN Saturday NIGHT': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br><br>Chris Pine (of 'STAR TREK' and 'UNSTOPPABLE' fame) headlines this ensemble piece indie character drama. The film also features performances by Shawn Christian, John Hawkes (who also turned in an impressive performance in this year's 'WINTER'S BONE'), and Bre Blair. It's written and directed by TV director Ryan Craig, who also plays a part in the film. Pine not only acts in the film but also wrote the song 'Someday Came Today' for the movie (and sings).<br><br>Pine plays Rhett Ryan, a small time country singer / songwriter with dreams of making it in Nashville. Just days before he's supposed to leave the small town of Prospect to follow his dreams his girlfriend (Blair) tells him she's not going with him and has decided that what's best for her daughter might be to stay with her father, Tommy Carson (Christian), the town sheriff. Tommy's brother Donnie (Hawkes) just got out of prison and has came back into town getting himself in more trouble again.<br><br>The film is well made and the characters are all pretty believable and their drama realistic. The acting is all impressive, especially Pine and Hawkes, and the directing is adequate. The film isn't extremely entertaining or memorable and although the characters are believable it's not especially emotionally involving either but it's not a bad way to pass the time in my opinion. There's definitely nothing in it to really complain about. It's a nice little movie.<br><br>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN5KZOE7p28","user":"Hellmant","rank":[9,14]},{"title":"Some Fine Performances in an Ultimately Weak Film","rating":5,"date":"19 July 2013","review":"Let me say up front that I think it's incredibly difficult and rare for a first time film director to have the discipline to effectively direct his own script. Granted Ryan Craig's written and directed a couple of TV movies, but things change a lot when you're doing a real grownup film. The chance to see your every word and decision on the big screen makes it agonizing to cut a single scene... hey! You wrote that! That said, there are some excellent performances from a cast loaded with accomplished actors, not least Shawn Christian who's best known for his soap opera career and Chris Pine who gets to indulge his hunky looks while playing some seriously downer scenes. I don't think John Hawke (Winter's Bone and The Sessions) is capable of a bad performance and this one gives him plenty of room.<br><br>I gave it a 5 because of the writer-director's failure to make the fullest use of this wealth of talent, but since the film is playing on HBO and it's not a halfbad way to spend an evening.","user":"PDXozoner","rank":[5,7]}]
