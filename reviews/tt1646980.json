[{"title":"Slow, clich√©d, predictable, poorly executed","rating":3,"date":"20 January 2012","review":"Boy, how Richard Gere's career has dived since the days of American Gigolo and Internal Affairs. Yes, occasionally he shows up in a fairly good movie like Hachiko or Unfaithful, but then the superior performances are from other actors (Diane Lane, in that particular case).<br><br>This movie really shows the one-dimensional acting Gere does when given a poorly written script. Why he even bothers is mystifying.<br><br>Anyway, the movie is about Paul Sheperdson, a retired CIA agent played by Richard Gere, that once hunted down and killed 6 assassins of a group of 7. This was back in the 80s. He never got the last guy, and suddenly chose to retire.<br><br>Now 20 years later, he's asked to help track down the one who got away by working with a rookie FBI agent. <br><br>**Minor Spoiler alert** Early on, the film dispenses with mystery by revealing that Gere the retired CIA agent really is the escaped assassin himself. With that out of the way, the rest of the movie is about the rookie FBI agent getting closer and closer to finding out who the assassin is, and about Gere the assassin / CIA agent killing a few people here and there. **End Spoiler**<br><br>Of course, there is another twist towards the end. I won't say, but it feels contrived. Besides, by the time it comes you've long given up connecting to the characters, so who cares?<br><br>Problems: The major problems with this movie are: the script is poor, with gaping holes and poorly developed characters. There is absolutely no chance in hell you will ever care for any of the characters. The story is dull - you've seen it a thousand times before, and sometimes a thousand times better. The ex-spy / assassin theme doesn't resonate with anything on anybody's mind in our world, so nobody cares what happens in the movie at any point.<br><br>Direction: The film contains a few flashbacks to the 80s, where we get to see Richard Gere play Paul Sheperdson as a young agent. Except they FORGOT to make him look younger! For sure, Gere the actor looks incredible for his age (63, he's born in 1949) with his gray, full hair. But you wouldn't expect the CIA operative he plays to have the same hair color 20 years ago, would you?<br><br>The action sequences are not very exciting. Gere wielding his The acting is very bad. Topher Grace as the (supposedly brilliant) rookie FBI Agent is seriously miscast, while Richard Gere needs to ditch the action genre. Martin Sheen is there, and does an OK job I guess. No other characters will make any impression on you.<br><br>Conclusion: It doesn't suck completely, it just isn't worth your while and there are more exciting things to do.","user":"roger-foss","rank":[42,53]},{"title":"A good film but it could have let the viewer think a bit more.","rating":7,"date":"9 January 2012","review":"Richard Gere plays \"Paul Shepherdson,\" a decorated CIA veteran who is just pulled out of retirement &amp; teamed up with new &amp; upcoming agent, Ben Geary (Topher Grace) to find the truth about the Russian assassin \"Cassius,\" who Shepherdson claimed to have killed years before. The intel says he lives &amp; is now in the US. The movie follows the duo as the real truth of the matter comes closer, and things are not always as they seem, not like we haven't heard that line before in countless intelligence genre films. It just failed to deliver surprise as very early we are bombarded with hints as to who's who. All the elements where there, great actors &amp; production but the script wasn't as brilliant as it could have been. They could have played out an extraordinary cat &amp; mouse game if things in the script were changed. I did enjoy watching this and I give a 7/10 generously as I'm a fan of both Grace &amp; Gere.<br><br>Also I would recommend a watch at least on the web, cause the ad campaign failed so horribly in marketing the film, maybe they could at least go VOD or STV cause it really deserves more.","user":"Thrill_KillZ","rank":[60,81]},{"title":"This plot hole sums up the whole film.","rating":2,"date":"17 January 2012","review":"\"Plot holes The logic by which Agent Geary \"proves\" that Shepherdson (Richard Gere) is Cassius is flawed. The \"proof\" is that Gere is in every crime scene photo, thus proving \"Cassius comes back to the crime scene\". But as Gere was in fact posing as investigating CIA agent, supposedly chasing Cassius, it was not only normal, but essential for him to go to all the crime scenes of Cassius' murders. \"<br><br>This film is dumb. It has the budget and the actors but it can't make up for the dumb script. The actors performances were disappointing, probably because they couldn't bring themselves to believe and immerse themselves in such a lame plot.","user":"matt-lamellama","rank":[50,67]}]
