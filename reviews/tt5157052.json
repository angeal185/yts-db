[{"title":"Nightworld: Should have been a tad better","rating":5,"date":"22 October 2017","review":"I was drawn to this because of the cast, I tend to like the work of B movie twins the Londons and it goes without saying that Robert Englund is worth taking the time for.<br><br>Telling the story of a security guard given the task of protecting a single room but he isn't allowed in it. He has to watch the security footage of this pitch black room and gets to live rent free in the same building. Easiest job ever right? But doubts begin to arise as strange things begin to happen and his shady employers retain their secrets.<br><br>The movie starts off strong, it gives you a mystery and baits you making you desire to know the answers but when the answers come out they really aren't that good.<br><br>Nice concept, weak delivery but still not the worst out there.<br><br>Passable feature saved by some nice ideas and a decent cast.<br><br>The Good: <br><br>Decent cast <br><br>Nice idea <br><br>The Bad: <br><br>One actors accent repeatedly shifts <br><br>Story feels a bit incomplete <br><br>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br><br>Jason London has the worlds hairiest nipples <br><br>If the world hangs in the balance if something isn't protected then just hire one single security guard and don't tell him anything","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[42,44]},{"title":"A very promising plot with average execution","rating":5,"date":"10 December 2017","review":"I liked the theme and still believe that the story had the potential to deliver a blockbuster movie but the film fell apart due to sloppy direction, script and time constraints. Half explained story and hurriedly completed scenes made this an average film. The acting was OK but really handicapped by the how the film evolved. First half was fairly enjoyable but the second half was rushed and left too many gaps.In short, This film needed a better director and script writer.","user":"hasnain0099","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"Not bad, really.","rating":6,"date":"24 February 2018","review":"I agree with a number of other reviews of this film: it started off really well. The acting was good, the premise strong, and the direction was deliberate and moody. However, where it should have kicked into high gear, it actually sort of fell apart. The last act could have stood at least one more good pass at the script, and the low budget really didn't help there either. <br><br>Overall I would say that you should know that the ending won't be as satisfying as you might like, and armed with that information you might enjoy it more. Unfortunately the movie must be thought of as a lost opportunity.","user":"patrick-413","rank":[16,20]}]
