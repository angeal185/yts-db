[{"title":"Meh...It's Not Great But I've Seen Worse","rating":4,"date":"29 July 2018","review":"So, this is a sequel to the movie 13 Cameras (2015). This is low budget and for a low budget film, I think it is bearable. The acting is so-so. The story is shaky but you can see what is trying to come across. The slumlord is a disturbing character to watch. He looks, walks, talks and behaves super creepy. Apparently he can't breathe through his nose unless he's sniffing some girl's panties, so, yeah, he's totally weird. If you are looking for a great movie, this probably won't be it but if you don't really care and are just killing some time, it's a \"Meh\" film.","user":"Foutainoflife","rank":[31,35]},{"title":"Will think twice before booking Airbnb again.","rating":7,"date":"29 October 2018","review":"Creepy level 10+ Makes me never want to rent a vacation rental ever again! Mouth breather was off the charts psycho. I will watch 13 Cameras next, enjoyed this creepiest but kind of ashamed to admit it.","user":"digitalparadise-2","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"Good sequel with some suspenseful moments.","rating":5,"date":"31 October 2018","review":"I don't think this movie deserves the low 1 and 2 scores it has been given. This movie has decent suspense and is a good follow on from the first one.<br><br>Its not going to be everyones cup of tea because its creepy in an uncomfortable sort or way. I enjoyed it. Sticks in my mind a bit given its about hidden cameras it's unnerving.","user":"mudvayne-90245","rank":[11,12]}]
