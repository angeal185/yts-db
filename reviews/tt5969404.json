[{"title":"Copycat","rating":1,"date":"1 October 2017","review":"I love Aussie movies, good or bad I'll see them all. (clear bias) I neither liked nor disliked this movie. Acting was patchy and editing failed it miserably. Brown was typically the lynch pin and perhaps without his presence the movie would have been completely lost. My gripe about this movie was the obvious mirroring of the movie Crash. Crash is an extraordinary movie, this movie is not.","user":"Unimatrix_Zero","rank":[16,25]},{"title":"Not sure what this film was about","rating":3,"date":"31 December 2017","review":"No interesting characters infact all the characters should be in jail. A lot of scenes with people running around the streets of Brisbane. Nothing to do with Australia Day just set on that day. Has a very strange scene between brother and sister.","user":"kjc248","rank":[17,32]},{"title":"Worst movie ever made","rating":1,"date":"9 January 2019","review":"I watched 20 minutes of this awful movie and it's everything Australia is not.\nIt's an anti-Australian movie from the eyes of socialist lefties in the lame movie industry in this country.\nDon't bother watching.","user":"PaddysMovieReview","rank":[11,19]}]
