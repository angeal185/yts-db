[{"title":"Nemesis 5 The New Model: I'm in awe","rating":1,"date":"30 January 2019","review":"The New Model is the 10th movie in the Cyborg/Nemesis franchise which started all the way back in 1989 with Jean Claude Van-Damme's Cyborg. 21 years after the last movie from the series was made (Nemesis 4 1996) it returns with this \"delight\".<br><br>You see the movies have never been been good, they've simply ranged from bad to very bad but this is certainly a new low.<br><br>Sue Price returns yet again as Alex though only briefly. I can only assume she returned for the nostalgia or must have been desperate for money.<br><br>You see here is the issue, though all the Cyborg/Nemesis movies were bad they at least looked the b-movie part whereas this is something else altogether. The New Model is a hyper low budget independent movie which truth be told I'm absolutely stunned at the quality of (Or lack thereof). Instead of professional b-movie, this is VHS camcorder, toy laser guns and dreadful Adobe Aftereffects sfx.<br><br>No really, I can't stress enough how bad it looks. It's one stage up from being done on someones phone, the acting is some of the worst I've seen in years, the sfx are cringe inducing and the whole thing is really embarrassing.<br><br>Whatever my opinions of the franchise it really didn't deserve this. Considering they started in the 80's and this was released in 2017 it raises all kind of questions why this is the ugliest and cheapest of them all.<br><br>Incredibly there is another one in production, this is a franchise that died in the 90's but nobody had the heart to tell it.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Absolutely nothing<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Beyond ugly<br><br>Dreadful CGI<br><br>Cringe inducing acting<br><br>The fight sequences are some of the worst ever put to film<br><br>Awful filler scenes<br><br>Stock screams","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[27,33]},{"title":"Skip this at all cost","rating":1,"date":"20 December 2018","review":"This movie is total crap, the first Nemesis was pretty good can you believe it was filmed in 1992 and the special effects, the way the movie was filmed is more professional then this pile of garbage, that is amateur at best, with the worst FX i have seen on a sci fi movie, its part of a so called Nemesis franchise......... why is this so amateurish? awful from start to finish, when you cringe at the first frame you know you are in for a long awful movie.","user":"kaefab","rank":[21,27]},{"title":"No One Can Appreciate The Simple Things In Life Like Smelling A Flower","rating":2,"date":"15 August 2019","review":"After two plus decades without a Nemesis movie we finally got one here. And it's about time! Thank God because I was planning on killing myself if another one didn't come to fruition. Nemesis 5 has everything: ugly actors, CGI so bad even a blind man can perceive it, horrible acting, cheesy EBM soundtrack, abysmal action sequences, excruciatingly slow pacing and meaningless fillers and, the cherry on top, one of the worst anticlimactic endings of all time. And, of course, it has a political message involving communism battling fascism which is mentally deficient. Anyways, I can't keep up the charade. This movie sucked and is nowhere near as good as the first three Nemesis movies but I will say this; it was better than Nemesis 4. So there's a plus. You might get a chuckle out of this one but this is the Hindenburg times infinity. For maniacal and desperate completists at the very best.","user":"ThyDavideth","rank":[3,4]}]
