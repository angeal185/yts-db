[{"title":"The Gingerdead Man made more sense.","rating":2,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"Pumpkins is something that sincerely needs to be avoided at all cost, because it really does look incredibly bad. From camera work, to plot, actors, dialogue, there is simply put, not one good thing about it. It did nothing to redeem itself and also has one of the weirdest endings I've seen so far, cutting out of a scene during the climax and that was all.<br><br>I tried to enjoyed it, but after no more than 10 minutes you realize that there is nothing to see here, a movie that perhaps would have worked far better if it tried the dark comedy approach, yet sadly, it takes itself quite seriously.<br><br>If any of you really want to watch this, well, you're a braver person than I am, cause I only did it out of the lack of information about it. You've all been warned.<br><br>Cheer!","user":"gothic-fiction","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Don't waste your time","rating":1,"date":"25 December 2019","review":"I found it to be tedious and boring. It could have been a great slasher. There was not much gore and the storyline was non existent.","user":"firstmom","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Teach him some respect","rating":1,"date":"31 October 2019","review":"Uncle (Terry Wood) dies from a heart attack because some punks graffitied his prize pumpkins. Some fluorescent green ooze seeps into the ground and Uncle is turned in a killing Pumpkin Head. A group of campers, hikers, and folks at the pub who aren't trespassing.<br><br>This is a low budget Irish film. It seems to include some low-brow locals in the filming. Other than a pumpkin, the plot didn't have much bite. Pumpkin man breathed like Darth Vadar. He initially spewed deadly green acid on people then he went to the stabbing. Good accents.<br><br>Guide: F-wood. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[5,5]}]
