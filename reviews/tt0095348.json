[{"title":"That's the Shakespere!!!!!","rating":7,"date":"7 September 2000","review":"ï»¿Where do you begin with this film.  It had so much that was hilarious that I don't know where to begin.  One of my all time favorite scenes is when they mock the stunt doubles and you have Jack Spade's mother who is about to beat up some thugs.  She turns around and then suddenly the camera cuts from a black lady to a white male with a mustache and afro wig wearing the same clothes she is wearing, he does some back flips and then beats up the thugs. Then when the stuntman turns around, it's back to the actress playing Spade's Mother.  I loved it.<br><br>If you don't see this movie it is a shame.  Wayans did a wonderful job mocking the ridiculous exploitation movies of the seventies.   The cost of the rental alone is worth watching the scene where the guy gets out of prison, and he has been incarcerated for so long that his clothes are out of style.  You'll love the Pimp of the Year contest, Kung Fu Joe, the Big Brim Bar,  Soul Train, Hammer, Slammer, Slade and Flyguy.  The movie was a blast and you'll roll on the floor in hysteria watching as Ann Marie Johnson reveals her flaws to Jack Spade.<br><br>Rent this movie.  You'll love it.","user":"Cyclops-13","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"A hilarious parody of the seventies \"black\" exploitation cinema.","rating":9,"date":"18 August 2005","review":"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka (1988) was Keenan Ivory Wayans directorial debut. He also wrote and stars in this production. Keenan stars as Jack Spade an ex-veteran who returns home after a stint in the army. The death of his younger brother June-Bug Spade and the vicious \"assault\" on his mother by two local thugs (Damon Wayans and Kardeem Hardison) causes Jack to wage war on the criminal elements in his neighborhood. But he's going to need help toppling the evil Mister Big (John Vernon). So he enlists the help of the former local crime fighter Slade (Bernie Casey) and his co-horts Hammer, Slammer and Kung-Fu Joe (Jim Brown, Issac Hayes and Steven James). Will these vigilantes be enough to end the crime spree of Mister Big?<br><br>A flat out funny film from Keenan Ivory Wayans. Not only did this film jump start all of these older actors careers, but it was popular enough to warrant a series pilot (a t.v. remake of this film called Slade, Hammer and Slammer) and it helped the Wayans create another show for Fox called In Living Color. The rest is history.<br><br>Highly recommended.","user":"Captain_Couth","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"A Wacky Movie","rating":25,"date":"25 July 2000","review":"\"I'm Gonna Git You Sucka\" is a blast! Keenan Ivory Wayans wrote, directed, and starred in this spoof of blaxploitation movies and I've got to say, He did a very accurate job. This is REALLY how blaxploitation movies look and feel like, right down to the huge hats. The funniest part in the movie is when the nightclub singer is singing...Oh, Can't spoil a joke. Or when the Youth Gang Competition...Can't spoil that either. Even as a bonus, Isaac \"Wrote Best Movie Song on Earth\" Hayes is in the movie and the \"Shaft\" theme gets played!!!!! TWICE!!!!!! So Jump in Your Car, Drive to a video store and rent it. If they don't have it, than steal it from the guy who rented it! **** out of ****","user":"jmcool5164","rank":[26,30]}]
