[{"title":"A Fine Story Mired By Poor Acting.","rating":5,"date":"23 June 2019","review":"You'll notice right away there's a problem with Disappearance. All 6 or so actors are about as natural as robots at delivering their lines. This does ruin what is otherwise a very well produced film. The script may not be worthy of Hitchcock but it's definitely believable and intriguing as a mystery crime thriller. The cinematography, editing and pacing is also quite good. The wooden actors do improve slightly as the film progresses with a couple of laughable dramatic exceptions. I'd like to see this movie redone with capable thespians. Nice effort though. Worth a watch for the decent plot.","user":"pete1-2","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"This Movie needs to Disappear!","rating":3,"date":"5 July 2019","review":"A book- writing husband and his wife fed up in their relationship go on a boat trip with his girlfriend plus the boats skipper.\nLater the husband disappears. Was he murdered or did he jump etc?\nWho cares?!\nEveryone in this movie is dull and boring.\nThe pace of the film is far too slow; there is no excitement or real interest.\nOnly the ocean and beach scenes are worth any merit or a rating:<br><br>3/10.","user":"rbrb","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Predictable but not terrible","rating":4,"date":"4 December 2019","review":"This movie was so predictable that I knew how it was going to end within the first 5 minutes.\nI'm sure it wouldn't take long to find a much better movie to sit through but if you're in a lazy mood and simply don't feel like searching this film is definitely watchable.","user":"shellyrowland28","rank":[0,0]}]
