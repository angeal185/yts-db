[{"title":"A must-see for petrolheads...or anyone with an interest in what makes other people tick...","rating":9,"date":"20 April 2011","review":"Just got back from seeing this in a packed house at the local fleapit, and it seemed most of the crowd were as impressed as I was, although to be fair most of them were probably predisposed to enjoying an hour and a half of on- and off-track action from the run-up to the 2010 TT, and the event itself.<br><br>The Isle Of Man TT Races are familiar to motorsport fans around the world as the Holy Grail of roadracing, an astonishing course set over, in, through and around 37 and a bit miles of the Isle Of Man's countryside, mountains, towns, villages and 'road furniture'. Riders blast through narrow country lanes with stone walls, lamp-posts, kerbs...at speeds approaching 200mph.<br><br>To some people in this risk-averse age, the obvious question is \"Why do these men (and the odd woman) risk their lives?\". The majority of the non-racing scenes in the film give the riders point of view on this; it will not spoil anything to say that the consensus is that riding is a thrill like no other; riding at the extreme is something else beyond that. The passion for the race is all-consuming.<br><br>When considering the risks these riders take, it is worth bearing in mind that for many of the riders (and their crews) this is not a full time job. They are not millionaires like formula 1 drivers. While other people get a look in, the focus and star of the show here is Guy Martin, the part-time lorry mechanic, part-time superbike racer, full-time charismatic rebel who has the talent, drive and popular support of a great champion but has never won a TT. Will he do it this year ? Those who follow the sport know the answer, those who don't will be willing him on during the film's race scenes.<br><br>I would recommend this without hesitation to anyone who is into motorsport, anyone who wants to understand why other people are into it, and most strongly I would recommend it to anyone who has the slightest interest in learning about other people, what makes them tick, and what you can learn from them.","user":"johnnychimpo","rank":[31,31]},{"title":"Almost unbelievable","rating":10,"date":"21 April 2011","review":"The first film that has affected me enough to bother writing a review. Excellent throughout, tense, terrifying, well filmed and good narration. Much more than just another bike documentary.<br><br>Few weak spots - narration, although technically good, was in a weak American tone, not ideally suited to something as British as the Isle of Man. Some of the solo footage of Guy riding was a bit weak. He was obviously not going fast, but made to appear so. The on boards were incredible. The atmosphere incredible. The passion incredible.<br><br>Never has a cinema completely full of men (99%) been so quiet for so long. The film finished to a stunned silence.<br><br>Excellent","user":"philrusted","rank":[23,24]},{"title":"A must see film.","rating":10,"date":"22 April 2011","review":"What an amazing film. It was everything that I Superbiker wasn't. Has made me love Guy Martin even more (if that was possible). I had read that the film focuses too much on the deaths and crashes that have been present through the history of the race. I disagree; I think they dealt with them well and in a way that really does bring home what this circuit means to all those who race there.<br><br>I certainly don't think this is just a film for the boys (being a female motorcyclist myself) and I don't even think you need to have a love of bikes. Right from the start you care about the characters, the race footage and interviews etc keep you on the edge of your seat, with your heart in your mouth throughout the film I hope this film does a lot for for the world of motorcycle racing; both circuits and road racing alike.","user":"samanthajanekay-35-901000","rank":[13,13]}]
