[{"title":"An original homage that helps break the current biopic trend","rating":7,"date":"14 August 2019","review":"After being subjected to a number of films documenting the lives of musicians - most notably \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Rocketman\" and \"Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story\" - it is truly a pleasure to be presented with a film that sheds light on the work and life of an artist while not adhering to the strict (though desirable) biographical approach. That is exactly what makes the piece so marvellous; I came out of the cinema with a greater appreciation of The Beatles, and their music, through a fictional story that did not feature the four men we are familiar with at all. Quite often the film achieved my admiration for the band without me consciously noticing.<br><br>On another level, the film made a satire of the modern music industry. It revealed how the apparent \"solo\" artists are far from their titles; with huge teams of people pushing them in a preferred, and more commercial, creative direction, taking the musicians' creative power. This was done in a humorous light (as most themes are presented in the film). The romantic aspect of the film is evident from the beginning and is a dominant aspect of the story, possibly shifting the focus of the piece a little too much. However, it still helps provides a satisfying ending.<br><br>The film pays a great amount of respect in a fresh way while cleverly interweaving other conflicts.","user":"naveen64","rank":[208,247]},{"title":"The antidote to sequels and super heroes","rating":10,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"Refreshingly original and entertaining. The story flows and the characters are relatable and well developed. Not what I expected from the trailer but I liked it better than what I expected. So nice to see someone take a chance on an original story.","user":"jkanderson-74461","rank":[322,427]},{"title":"Could have been great","rating":6,"date":"1 July 2019","review":"The original premise of the movie was fantastic - only one man knows that The Beatles ever existed and brings their music to the world.<br><br>It could have been really really great. Unfortunately the idea was under developed, it felt as if the film's makers weren't quite sure what to do with it.<br><br>It ended up being \"nice\" and \"sweet\" when it could have been brilliant.","user":"oshanda","rank":[450,606]}]
