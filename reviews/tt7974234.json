[{"title":"Ehh","rating":4,"date":"26 July 2018","review":"Good and important but honestly a little boring. It was also short though which was good","user":"Jessicanu94","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Tough","rating":6,"date":"22 December 2018","review":"Another reviewer said it best: The subject matter is important and it should be something we should cherish and celebrate. But overall the documentary comes off as a bit boring and even seems a bit long (and it's just over an hour). I'm not sure if it had to do with funding (running time to get to a festival or get money to realize this project), but it could have been half as long and be way more efficient in delivering its message.<br><br>Having said that, I hope that people will not be too annoyed and understand what this is about. The light this documentary is shining on these projects is one that is really important. Keep up the good work is what we should be thinking and I guess if anyone is interested, the World Wide Web is here for anyone to search ways to delve into the subject matter","user":"kosmasp","rank":[1,1]}]
