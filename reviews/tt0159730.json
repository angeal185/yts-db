[{"title":"Funny but NOT Erotic","rating":6,"date":"15 September 2005","review":"Sex Monster 1999<br><br>A movie with some very funny moments. There were a few scenes that caused me to laugh hysterically and that is unusual for me. Although Mariel Hemmingway has never been a favorite of mine, she definitely brings strong acting talent to this movie. Her wardrobe is interesting yet appropriate for the scenes in the movie. Mike Binder does a great job of carrying the movie with a combination of almost dramatic acting skills but definite ability as a straight man and the occasional goof ball. Missy Crider is always a good actress, in this movie I don't think she was given a strong enough role and the role she had did not give her adequate room to demonstrate her true skills or to allow her usual sensual self to come through. I believe the movie would have been much better had Mariel and Missy had each other's roles. But obviously the director thought otherwise. Directors always have the right to be wrong I guess. Warning; do not let the title or the movie synopsis fool you. There is almost nothing erotic about this movie. It is funny, but not erotic. The jacket suggests a lot of lesbian activity. Most of that activity is not seen however but alluded to or happens with the camera elsewhere. On the eroticism scale this movie is a 2 out of 10. There is also very little nudity. For the most part (with the exception of what I noted above) the movie was well cast. The plot is plausible but the sequence of events is not, hence we have a clever comedy. I recommend this movie for a good laugh only. It is not a movie to watch for the whole family due to the adult theme of lesbianism and sexual threesomes. As a non-erotic comedy I would rate this 6 out of 10.","user":"excellentprovider","rank":[19,21]},{"title":"Maybe a little more?","rating":6,"date":"13 May 2004","review":"This movie is moderately funny and humorous in spots.I would have liked to have \"seen\" a little more. It would have been nice to have seen Mariel Hemingway or Renee Humphrey or Missy Crider or any of the other actresses actually naked!!! I'm not talking about hard core or explicit scenes but just a little bit of what's supposedly going on on the bed between the women or even one of them walking around topless would have been okay. The sex wasn't there. The plot was however and the \"monster\" that was created by the husband's urgings became slightly funny. Not a great film but one that was amusing in some respects. Maybe worth watching keeping in mine that it's there for the implications and the laughs.","user":"doyce4sub","rank":[14,18]},{"title":"Witty satire of gender roles and sexuality","rating":8,"date":"14 September 2000","review":"When you're not expecting much, it doesn't take a masterpiece to impress you. I watched The Sex Monster knowing that it had a bisexual-relevant theme, but uncertain of whether it would be a positive or negative portrayal of bisexuality and sexual experimentation in general. I was not disappointed.<br><br>Mike Binder somehow managed to take all of the tired stereotypes about gender and sexuality, weave them into exaggerated characters, put the characters in awkward situations, and make it all uproariously hilarious. Some viewers, no doubt, will interpret the caricatured portrayals as perpetuating outmoded stereotypes and perhaps even contributing to those stereotypes. But Binder's wit is both subtle and blatant: the dialogue makes use of every cliche imaginable, yet is still fresh and funny.<br><br>If you're cheek is prepared to accommodate your tongue, definitely see this movie (rent it! and then buy it to show all your friends). Be warned, though, that what you assume about people may be forever changed.","user":"kaethe","rank":[13,17]}]
