[{"title":"Like a bad stage play.","rating":2,"date":"23 March 2014","review":"It is kind of hard to write a review that would be kind to this movie. First of all, I like Noir movies, I'll give most movies a bit of thought before I decide whether I like, or don't like. Now this movie is neither an drama, an action movie nor a comedy, it's more like a bad stage play. The acting was only just above amateur (kind of), the camera work was noticeably (kind of) bad. The effects were (kind of) tacky, the dialogue was cringefully bad (not kind of), the casting was all wrong (definatly), everything, and I mean everything about this movie was kind of wrong, in fact I'll go one step further and say, it was just plain awful. There was nothing about this movie that I liked, no wait, I lie... some of the cars were pretty cool, the biscuits I had with my cup of tea were pretty good, and I liked the bit where the movies disclaimer came up at the end, yeah, that was the best bit! Hmph. I did say a few kind words about it after all.","user":"kruizer04","rank":[68,92]},{"title":"Reviews biased","rating":2,"date":"27 March 2014","review":"Take the link to see the reviews of other users who gave this film high marks and one gets the impression that they were involved in the film somehow, since it's the only movie listed in their profile.<br><br>Pamela Costa, from examiner.com called this and all star cast. That's true, if high school plays are included. This movie is a joke. It would seem that Chase Williamson must be related to the producer/director, since he couldn't get the lead in a play starring him, directed by him and produced by; you guessed it, him.<br><br>The action scenes are not action, but the camera work is passable, while not done well and the script is just plain bad. Chase looks stiff, like a deer in the headlights, and his voice over seems to have been done in one take and completely over-acted, as is most of the rest of the film.<br><br>Chase, watch a couple of boxing matches...or a couple of real movies before taking on a fight scene. Even my child knows how to make a fist, friend.<br><br>Don't wast your time on this \"40s Noir Film\" as one user put it. Watch grass grow instead. You'll be better off.","user":"hatman28","rank":[81,114]},{"title":"This movie may prove some Internet conspiracy theory...","rating":1,"date":"10 April 2014","review":"I like movies. I like a bit of cheese. I'll forego big budget effects all day long if you're ready to give me a bit of fun dialogue, a neat story, even just some good facial expressions and clever timing with the cuts.<br><br>This film is just bad. I'm sorry. It's bad.<br><br>So why did it have an IMDb rating of 7.3 when I decided to give it a whirl?<br><br>To be fair, that rating is now down to 6.7 a few days later. But there were THOUSANDS of 8, 9, and 10 reviews according to the breakdown link. For a movie with, I'm sorry, very amateur acting, a derivative storyline that's half Watchmen, half Kick-Ass, and none of the goodness of either. GLOWING user reviews written and then \"found useful\" by dozens of others.<br><br>I... I think the producer got all his friends and family to write nice things. :( I feel sorry for him, I know it can be hard to break out into the larger world with a small budget movie, but the first thing you need is SOME QUALITY, dude. Look at Primer. Look at Pi. Look at The Man From Earth.","user":"ted-cooper","rank":[52,75]}]
