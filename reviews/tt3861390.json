[{"title":"Sorely lacking heart","rating":6,"date":"4 April 2019","review":"You'd think a movie called Dumbo would be more about Dumbo. There are so many side plots and needless characters that it complicates a relatively straightforward story. There are a few moments of wonder, but they are far too few in between predictable tropes. Tim Burton was an odd choice to direct this film as well. The whole film is covered with his trademark murky aesthetic and it just doesn't fit. Danny DeVito is the only saving grace as far as actors. He is fantastic while Keaton hams it up and plays the over the top bad guy. Danny Elfman's score is decent. The film is just kind of boring though. It's so paint-by-numbers and lacking in imagination. Disney hopefully learns from this with any future live-action remakes of animated classics.","user":"cardsrock","rank":[152,214]},{"title":"I don't get what people saw... It was magical","rating":9,"date":"31 August 2019","review":"I don't get what people saw... I thought the movie was great &amp; full of magic.<br><br>I will admit, the children seemed lacking and a little dull. It would have been nice if they had a little more emotion. The rest of the characters where great.<br><br>Now the story line is very emotional &amp; yes, dark.... But what Time Burton fill isn't?<br><br>Dumbo.... Oh man, those eyes! The character himself makes your heart melt &amp; explode with cuteness.<br><br>When he is trying to save the monkey &amp; he flies is so magical. I was in awe. Each time he continues to fly, I felt the same!<br><br>Ultimately in the end, the sadness &amp; darkness of the film is put aside. Dumbo &amp; him mom are free to live in the forest amoung all the wild elephants.<br><br>I enjoyed the movie! Hopefully people can see past the lack of emotion from the kids but enjoy it for dumbo himself &amp; the story","user":"caitlinmaryjean","rank":[35,48]},{"title":"What are the bad reviews about ?","rating":9,"date":"5 April 2019","review":"I was in tears within the first 10 seconds of the movie. I have a soft spot for Dumbo and Casey Jr is my jam. Danny Devito is a national treasure and can do no wrong. Michael Keaton's character was a delight. Colin Farrell's character could have been better developed , but the kids were his saving grace. I loved the story and the whole world Tim burton creates on the screen. You can see the painstaking detail he puts in every part of the film. The costumes were SUPERB!!! I would have appreciated a bit more back story for the circus folks but all in all Dumbo was the cutest !!! I really think it's a great message against terrible animal cruelty which the original showed as well. The pink elephant scene was imaginative. It is a beautiful film to watch, can't wait to add this to my collection. Please go in with and open mind and heart and let go of unfair expectations. Tim is an artist and artists evolve. This is a collaboration of strange, unusual, and creative minds that wish to share their visions with the world.","user":"alexornelas","rank":[178,285]}]
