[{"title":"Would have made a better short than a feature length movie","rating":4,"date":"27 May 2018","review":"It's well made and accomplishes telling its simple story effectively, I just think it could have been done in a lot less time without much being lost.","user":"WhatIWatched","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"Original Take on Female Coming-of-Age Story","rating":7,"date":"21 March 2018","review":"Cold November is a unique coming-of-age tale from the perspective of a young girl in a matrilineal family. Exploring activities usually portrayed by male characters in movies, it is a refreshing approach on themes without the familiar gender bias. It deftly blends hunting, familial rites of passage, and the biological maturity of becoming a woman. It functions as a tone poem, with a contemplative exploration, focusing on quiet moments, and it explores the internal struggles of coming into one's own place in a family and, in a greater sense, society.","user":"Mr. Gore","rank":[8,18]},{"title":"Cute Story of Change, Loss And Survival","rating":7,"date":"29 May 2018","review":"I really enjoyed this bittersweet drama intermixing a child's coming of age, mourning, resiliency and imagination. There is something very satisfying about how this kid grows up and its a shame nowadays more lives don't develop this way.","user":"screenchills","rank":[4,8]}]
