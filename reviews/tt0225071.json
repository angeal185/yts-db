[{"title":"A *Good* \"Bad Movie\"","rating":7,"date":"11 June 2005","review":"If you're a hard core movie fan, you learn to appreciate good \"Bad Movies.\" There are movies that go so far off the tracks in terms of one or several essential features of film art -- casting, script, sets, pacing, editing, lighting, coherence -- that there is no way that you could, being honest, recommend them without qualifications to an unsuspecting viewer.<br><br>Movies that go off the tracks in these essentials and offer no redeeming features are just plain Bad Movies. You you make fun of them, and then you forget about them.<br><br>But some Bad Movies offer, amidst the badness, unique moments of grace and truth. You allow yourself to be sucked in, and you studiously ignore or forgive all the screw-ups that went into making them \"Bad Movies.\" \"Angel Eyes\" is a *Good* Bad Movie.<br><br>Why Bad? Genre incoherence is the biggest problem here. \"Angel Eyes\" was marketed as a supernatural thriller that offered spooky, scary insights into fate, love, danger, and perhaps life after death. Ads, and the first portion of the movie, hinted at a weird alternate identity for one character. Was he a ghost? An angel? A devil? Would \"Angel Eyes\" be another \"Sixth Sense\" or \"Wings of Desire\"? That's all just smokescreen. I'm not revealing any spoilers by saying that no one in the movie is a ghost, an angel, or a devil; that conceit from the ads is jettisoned pretty quickly.<br><br>There is a subtext of fate, destiny, love and death, but that isn't worked really hard, either. That whole subtext could have been skipped and you'd still have pretty much the same movie.<br><br>The movie you get is a movie about traumatized people finding love and rebirth. And that is one great theme.<br><br>Another problem with the movie is its misunderstanding of how quickly people can recover from trauma. But, hey.<br><br>I say \"but, hey,\" because this movie has a lot going for it, and it's worth seeing for what it has going for it.<br><br>Jim Caviezel is an underrated actor. He's not wooden; he's subtle. It's tragic that we've gotten to an era where audience's eyes can't appreciate a quiet actor in the Gary Cooper mode.<br><br>Caviezel is a worthy inheritor of the Gary Cooper mantle. He's stunningly handsome, has a big, gorgeous body -- he's a former basketball player, and it shows -- and he possesses Cooper's quiet masculine tenderness and humility.<br><br>All these qualities have allowed him to strike the perfect note of a very male spirituality in a number of films, from \"Frequency\" to \"Thin Red Line\" to \"Pay It Forward\" to \"The Passion\" to \"Angel Eyes.\" In his early scenes, when the movie doesn't want you to know quite what he's about, he is perfect as a perhaps ghost-angel-devil-weirdo homeless bum-savior.<br><br>He's equally good, later, as an entirely corporeal lover.<br><br>He plays a wounded man, and Caviezel has the gifts to convey his character's inner pain. You believe that he cares as much as he does about what wounded him; you believe that his wounds could have done to him what the movie wants you to believe they did to him.<br><br>Jennifer Lopez is equally good. Face it -- Jennifer Lopez is a fine actress. Yes, she appears on tabloid covers. Yes, she made \"Gigli.\" Yes, she poses in naughty clothes a lot. Yes, she is a Puerto Rican from the Bronx.<br><br>And you know what? She's a fine actress. Don't let her non-silver-spoon pedigree keep you from appreciating what she can do on screen.<br><br>Lopez is as good as a cop here as she was in the more celebrated film, \"Out of Sight.\" She's winning, charismatic, natural, and lovely to look at. Even in a white t-shirt and navy blue cop uniform slacks, she is beautiful.<br><br>Like Caviezel, Lopez plays a wounded character ready to be reborn by love. She's equally as good as he, but she conveys her different wounds in a different way. One wounded person retreats; another lashes out in violence. It's interesting to see which party picks which method.<br><br>Sonia Braga is in this movie. Any movie with Sonia Braga in it can't be all bad.<br><br>Victor Argo, in a very small part as a very flawed man, is JUST PERFECT. 100% believable and heart-wrenching. I'll never forget his moments locked in silent misery, a misery he causes and a misery he feels.<br><br>Finally, there is a not-to-be-missed scene between an abused family member and the abuser. A character speaks into a video camera at a family reunion and ... the scene just took my breath away. At that point I wanted to cry and surrender my full respect to the movie, in spite of everything it had done wrong so far.<br><br>Don't let bad reviews prevent you from seeing this movie. Nothing's perfect. There's enough heart and beauty here for the discerning viewer to appreciate.","user":"Danusha_Goska","rank":[107,120]},{"title":"A gem of a film, best appreciated after you dust off the dirt","rating":8,"date":"26 November 2004","review":"I stumbled on this film--because there was nothing obvious that made it look like a film worth your time. It's a film with a lot of misplaced evaluations. For instance, Jennifer Lopez was nominated for a \"Razzie\" award but the film shows a very fine effort from the lady. Again some comments on the photography infer the late cinematographer Piotr Sobocinsky has done a shoddy job because obvious Toronto landmarks appear in a film set in Chicago. This again is a fault of the Director and editor, not the cameraman who was one of the finest in his business (Kieslowski's \"Dekalog\" and \"Three Colors--Red\"). An intense viewing of the film affords the viewer to appreciate the opening shots, the alley shots, and the corridor shots that evoke feelings. It is quite different from the typical Hollywood camera-work.<br><br>There are flaws in the film. The film jumps to situations without a build up--Catch appears on a life saving situation, seemingly out of nowhere; two beers appear on Catch's table in the restaurant, without him ordering the second; no mention is made of why Catch chose this name; etc.<br><br>Yet despite those faults the film sails through as fine entertainment because of fine believable performances from Caviezel, Lopez, Sonia Braga, and Shirley Knight. The casting of these four was perfect (thank you Lopez for insisting on Caviezel!). The film is great entertainment because the film refrains from sex and promotes fine values--including family values, reconciliation, dealing with bereavement and doing good to make a better world. How many films are brave enough to deal with such subjects today without depicting sex and violence?<br><br>The film touches on subplots that could have been fleshed out--Catch's lonely neighbor who invites him share a pizza, Catch's friend who recognizes him at the restaurant but Director Mandoki clearly steers clear to present the two psychologically wounded persons and their healing by coming together through a sheer accident. The film may be very Christian in character but it presents a very secular, humane scenario that will uplift any viewer. Though unevenly woven, the film has several sequences that show Mandoki has fine capabilities. One only wishes he took greater care of details.<br><br>Flaws apart, the film is above average cinema that the publicity has shrouded by misplaced evaluations.","user":"JuguAbraham","rank":[62,70]},{"title":"Absorbing, human, and very good characters. *** (out of four)","rating":8,"date":"12 June 2001","review":"ANGEL EYES / (2001) *** (out of four)<br><br>By Blake French:<br><br>\tLuis Mandoki's \"Angel Eyes\" begins as a melodramatic tragedy that feels as if it's missing something. Its centerpiece is a love story between an unlikely couple who save each other's lives under different circumstances. At first, the film plays with interesting ideas about fate, love, destiny, mystery, and the past, but does so with stunning blandness. The male lead, James Caviezel, plays Catch, a mysterious character with an absorbing, revealing past. But his inceptive existence switches back and forth between two negative impressions: Catch is either a balmy character, or Caviezel delivers a boring, uninteresting performance. To my pleasant surprise, however, by the time the movie reaches its emotionally effective climax, it proves these original perceptions to be wrong.  <br><br>\tJennifer Lopez stars as a tough Chicago cop named Sharon Pogue. She patrols the crime-ridden South Side of Chicago with her police buddies, including her partner and friend Robby (Terrence Dashon Howard). In the same neighborhood lives Catch-who sleeps in an empty apartment and delivers goodwill to many around him. He wanders around the area as if he is in some kind of existential daze, thus some believe him to be a lunatic, but for most, he appears to be a peculiar but harmless figure.<br><br>\n\tBoth of these characters have undergone deep emotional struggles. The vast majority of the conflict in \"Angel Eyes\" lies inside the characters. I do not want to give away any of the movie. Therefore, I must be terse in my explanation. Experiencing violence early in her childhood, Sharon has taken a stand against her father's abusive ways and is still paying the price; her entire family disowned her. However, her parents have invited Sharon to an upcoming marriage celebration. Should she attend, forcing her to come to terms with inner demons and face her father for the first time in years?<br><br>\n\t\"Angel Eyes\" provides no easy answers for its characters. Sharon's private and public lives are well developed and intriguing. The film gives her a lot of dimension-I especially like her family related aspects. I will not reveal any more information about Catch; based on the advertisements, his different people will have different expectations of his identity. By explaining anymore about him, I risk giving away a large portion of the movie. Although the film does not contain startling identity twists or surprising ninety degree turns, it is very deliberate about what information is revealed at what time-thus the lack of information in the beginning. \"Angel Eyes\" deserves to reveal itself on a full scale, rather than me giving its plot away right here and now.  <br><br>Luis Mandoki has a certain knack with directing love stories that disclose their plot at the perfect moment. In 1999, his film \"Message in a Bottle\" examined another troubled soul coming to terms with his future. He does the same kind of thing with \"Angel Eyes.\" \"He's keeping a lid on his demons as Sharon does with hers, explains Mandoki about the character's behaviors. \"It's only when they fall in love and then risk losing that love that they are forced to examine who they really are, present and past.\"<br><br>\tScreenwriter Gerald DiPego creates character's who connect with the audience. The story is about \"the conflict between isolation and connection,\" says DiPego. \"We become isolated because we're afraid of opening up to each other, especially these days. On the other hand, there's a longing inside of us to connect. I think our salvation lies in keeping connected.\" <br><br>\tAs \"Angel Eyes\" concludes, each of the two character's has come to terms with their troubles and past. What they discover, I will leave up to you to find out. This is an uncommonly absorbing picture because we believe these characters live in our world, not in face their most private and deepest fears, and, although nothing is truly solved by the end of the movie, for Sharon and Catch, for better or worse, their problems become a different, more fulfilling internal battle. some movie fantasy. So often movies end with a fluffy, soft attitude for their characters-but not in \"Angel Eyes.\"","user":"Movie-12","rank":[46,56]}]
