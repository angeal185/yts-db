[{"title":"Bats%t crazy, but unfortunately ..","rating":6,"date":"9 March 2019","review":"There is a brash, surreal, out-the-box vibe to Braid that I have to appreciate, but it's hard to ignore the amateurish aspects which make it feel more like a B-movie, whether it's the uneven acting, bratty characters, unstable tone, and almost random attempts to be edgy and experimental.<br><br>I absolutely love overt weirdness in movies, but I also believe there must be a solid vision to be able to employ it successfully. What makes surrealism work or not, is perhaps down to personal taste, and since it becomes clear very early on that the director has every intent of sabotaging a 'normal' telling of this story, one then has to rely on intuition as a guide.<br><br>My problem is that despite watching with full attention, my intuition kept telling me that this whole ordeal is bupkis. As it devolved into predictably violent terrain, with a poorly drawn detective character, the film began to feel less intelligent, and deliberately inchoate, as though its director put this whole thing together during a manic coke binge.<br><br>Instead of the pleasure of watching little pieces of brilliance come together like pieces of a dream, I was simply lost very early on, and when I submitted to that loss, I was bored. There are moments of crazed greatness here, but they are unfortunately not well enough sustained, and arrive along with a mixed bag of scenes and characters that don't amount to a whole lot.","user":"Camoo","rank":[30,33]},{"title":"I didn't hate it but.....","rating":5,"date":"5 May 2019","review":"I really thought it was going to come together in the end..there is usually suspense built into a plot and you have to remember bits and pieces so when the story starts coming together your questions are answered. For the most part of the movie I enjoyed it. I thought it was quirky I thought it was a bit out there but it did not bore me. What I do not like is, spending my time watching a movie only to have nothing explained AND for it to get even more confusing when it comes to the end. There was literally no explanation for anything concerning the game concerning the girls concerning the cop their childhood The Treehouse it goes on and on and then at the very end who the hell is that at the sink? If anyone can tell me what happened in the end I would be extremely happy.... because /spoiler alert/ it appeared as every girl took her own life. So I could not give it anything higher than a five and I would not recommend watching it unless you literally have time to kill.","user":"dontquoteme","rank":[17,19]},{"title":"All play and no work makes three girls a bit loopy","rating":5,"date":"29 August 2018","review":"I nearly gave this a 4 because I really didn't enjoy it but opted on 5 in the end as that doesn't reflect it is at least a solid piece of film making.<br><br>In brief: three girls in a house, two of which are there to get paid, for playing along with the hostesses odd fetishes and fantasies. Not all is as it seems ... but for whom?<br><br>It takes quite a while to get to the point and is hoping to wow the audience with some innovative plot turns late in the day, which might work for you but I didn't really get much out of it.<br><br>However, if you're happy with its style and enjoy the off-beat characters, you might find this film a pretty satisfying watch. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me and its lack of an evolving plot left it feeling like a stuck-record.","user":"mungflesh","rank":[32,39]}]
