[{"title":"Horrendous - Leaves viewers with MANY unaswered questions.","rating":1,"date":"8 November 2019","review":"If you are in a miserable mood do not watch this, and if you're in a happy mood DON'T watch this. nobody smiles at all in this film?? and everyone speaks in monotone. Nothing makes sense. The gyno is missing some front teeth, I think they hired him from skid row. So basically this boring unhappy girl gets an IUD for free from a friend of a friend. The Friend supposedly slips something he's been working on in her instead of a real IUD which makes her kill men she sleeps with, with her vagina. Turning them to mush. Yeah there's lots of blood but nothing is even gross, just stupid. Eventually she get caught by a detective (Who, in 1 shot, has some HUGE man boobs) She goes to prison and the prison Dr. goes to remove the IUD and guess what, she has no IUD in her. The End. No explanation whatsoever. I wish people who made movies like this spent the money on cleaning up the planet. Seriously, I am warning you this is a joke.","user":"Markyajv","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"HORRIBLE","rating":3,"date":"19 November 2019","review":"Well, the acting was horrible for starters, the lead actress who was also the director could not act to save her life., all the other actors in the story also did not act to par, the story was alright, it had potential and the gore was good, it's what got me to watch in the first place, a must avoid if you're looking for a good movie.,<br><br>I have watched unknown films where there were good acting, and this was not one of them.","user":"lifelinespublishing","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Disappointed","rating":2,"date":"9 November 2019","review":"I'm no expert on movies - as are a lot of guys on here - but personally, didn't enjoy the film. It was slow, and not much of a horror movie effects wise?<br><br>Nowadays, I judge a movie on whether it grabs my attention, and this didn't. I was confused as to why the main character had this reason for the horror part, but didn't get it? Even the end was a bit confusing. Maybe its me, and others will, so look forward to their enlightenments.<br><br>Wanted to enjoy it, but didn't 1/10","user":"enquries_2","rank":[5,7]}]
