[{"title":"Seriously? Another one?","rating":1,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"Wow, if Keys To The Kingdom was not bad enough, Lionsgate actually has the nerve to give us a second sequel, and it's just as bad. The plot is basically Norm finds a human named Jin who crashed in the Artic trying to keep a Chinese artifact out of the hands of Dexter, a villainous archeologist. Jin has Norm promise if he does not make it, to take the artifact to his grandson, Chen, in Beijing, having Norm go on a quest while also keeping his promise to do his grandfather's wedding. Also, there's a B story where Quinn is acting king to help with wedding preparations, and he acts like a total jerk to everyone.<br><br>While the movie tries to teach kids a moral about keeping promises, it does not do well. The Lemmings are a bad rip-off of Chip and Dale, the B story is horrible and adds nothing to the plot, only being there to force the moral down our throats, and the humor is not funny. Your kids deserve better animated films than this garbage, so if you are a parent, steer clear of this king size abomination and buy something from Disney or Warner Bros.","user":"jeremycrimsonfox","rank":[14,20]},{"title":"Ew","rating":1,"date":"10 January 2020","review":"I almost throw up While watching i Ughhhhh hhbxbxbxbxbxbxhxh","user":"sultana-94489","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"During these troubled times, value your kids' entertainment","rating":1,"date":"22 March 2020","review":"If you want to distract your offspring during the shut-in, at least give them something of average quality. Norm of the North and its sequels are the kind of animation that you'd find in the 99 cent bin. Even there, it's not worth it.<br><br>King Sized Adventure follows Norm's journey to Beijing to restore an ancient artifact while avoiding a wicked English (?) archaeologist. In a completely pointless subplot, Norm's oldest Quinn is left acting king of the North Pole, where his ego takes over.<br><br>There's a message to be had here, one of keeping your word. Not only is it driven into the ice but it's also done very poorly. Honestly, ANYTHING else on Netflix is better.","user":"ILeftMyCakeOutInTheRain","rank":[1,1]}]
