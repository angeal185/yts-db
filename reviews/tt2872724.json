[{"title":"Run Of The Mill Supernatural Type Movie","rating":4,"date":"14 January 2015","review":"Not a whole lot to say about this film. It probably could have been decent given that that they seemed to have a good budget and some good actors, but they chose to go a very mediocre clichéd route with it instead.<br><br>The story was very predictable, which really hurt the film since this is pretty much all story. Aside from a few jump scares, the entire thing was pretty dull and boring.<br><br>It wasn't horrible, I watched the whole thing with out any temptation to shut it off, but it just felt like something I have already seen over and over again.<br><br>4/10","user":"HorrorOverEverything","rank":[34,44]},{"title":"My Review Of \"Out Of The Dark\"","rating":7,"date":"16 October 2015","review":"The story is one that has been seen before in similar films to \"Out Of The Dark\" with a family moving to a new place but unfortunately pick one cursed by a tragic past, and lingering paranormal influence. Quilez's story is a good one though, framing this construct in a beautiful, subtropical location, disturbing historical area steeped in superstition and legend. Plus he gives us a clear message of cruelties brought about by foreign companies exploitation of almost \"third world\" regions for profit, all wrapped nicely in a chilling supernatural thriller with some vengeful spirits. <br><br>\"Out Of The Dark\" does have some pretty cool make-up artistry and special effects. It is a mix of semi-gory practical design and expected CGI ghost-y stuff. Although instead of feeling redundant, the CGI in \"Out Of The Dark\" is creative and at times beautiful in its cinematography. The atmosphere is a blend of warming with the family taking in the beauty of their new home, and the darker, chilling aspects of past tragedy, a cursed people, and a family hunted by angry spirits. The soundtrack is equally intense and eerie. Plus there are moments when the quick shock gimmicks actually scared me a bit. <br><br>Overall \"Out Of The Dark\" is a nicely produced, creative thriller with a lot of suspense and drama. The cast give acceptable performances and the characters are developed nicely, the native Colombians more so than the family. The ghost children are haunting and creepy. On the down side though it becomes too clear too early in the story as to the true nature of \"Out Of The Dark\" so some of the thrill and suspense does get lost during the final 3rd of the film. The ending feels a bit drawn out and unnecessary at the very end, not in the actually story aspects but more the visual- conceptual stuff used at the end. It could have used less theatrics and been more effective. Anyway \"Out Of The Dark\" is a cool, entertaining story with a more mature narrative that shows some real heart.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[8,10]},{"title":"Into the light","rating":4,"date":"2 November 2014","review":"Actually you are not so much in the dark during the movie (metaphorically speaking, literally there is quite some darkness here). But the clichés and the direction the movie takes is so obvious, that some might feel insulted by the movie. Still the acting is decent enough and the story flows in the right direction.<br><br>Kids in danger/peril is always something that will get peoples attention, especially under the circumstances it happens here. The decisions people make are not always great, but we have seen characters behave worse in other horror movies. Plus the little girl is really sweet and it will be tough not to like her for people. A thing needed, otherwise the movie wouldn't work at all ...","user":"kosmasp","rank":[23,38]}]
