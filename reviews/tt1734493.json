[{"title":"A plot that thickens.....................","rating":7,"date":"1 October 2017","review":"Every once in awhile a movie will come out that surprises you with how good it is. Unlocked is such a movie. It has everything a movie goer wants. It has an intelligent plot, It has twists and turns within that plot, it has good acting by an A-list cast and a fast tempo delivery that holds your attention for the whole movie. All in all a very entertaining movie and I think that is all the audience wants for their money. Kudos on a job well done!","user":"abadguy44","rank":[36,39]},{"title":"Nice \"Covert Action\" in the field.","rating":7,"date":"22 April 2018","review":"Entertaining several twists. Female lead is a bit of prodigy like the main character in \"Covert Action\". Some differences, i.e. is already in field, no mention of personal history on the main character, except that she is depressed by inability to stop a bombing in time, and how she came to be sourced by CIA. <br><br>Character development could be better. More flashbacks, fleshing out would have been good for identifying with characters. <br><br>Follow up (what outcome) on some of the supporting cast would be nice as well. <br><br>I'd like to see this arrangement again though in sequel - think it could do well.","user":"Rcellich","rank":[20,22]},{"title":"Better late than never...","rating":9,"date":"25 June 2019","review":"So, I just happened upon this movie on Netflix. I loved it! First of all, Noomi Rapace. Need I say more? I will, though. John Malkovich. Hello? Michael Douglas. Toni Collett. Omg! (John M was hilarious during the video chat.) And Noomi. I'm having a hard time understanding why she's not all over the movie screens. What does she have to do?! Whatever Happened To Monday. Was that not enough?! Ok. I'm in love with this movie and I need this to be a series. ASAP!","user":"dawne-07464","rank":[28,32]}]
