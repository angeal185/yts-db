[{"title":"Terrible teen horror.","rating":3,"date":"8 June 2008","review":"5ive Girls is set in St. Marks correctional school for girls where Alex Garrison (Jennifer Miller) has been sent, after having been closed for five years the school has been reopened with a small experimental group of five female teenage delinquents. Run by the strict authoritarian headmistress Anna Pearce (Amy Lalonde) &amp; a kindly priest Father Drake (Ron Pearlman) the girls, Mara (Jordan Madley), Connie (Tasha May), Cecilia (Tara Vnesa), Leah (Barbara Mamabolo) &amp; Alex are told not to venture onto the third floor. Obviously that's precisely what they do &amp; they find a pentagram &amp; evidence of devil worship as an evil demon called Legion wants to possess the five gifted girls...<br><br>This Canadian production was written &amp; directed by Warren P. Sonoda &amp; I have to admit that I really didn't like 5ive Girls that much at all. The script &amp; feel of the film instantly reminded me of The Craft (1996) with the basic concept of it's female gang of teenage outcasts who have some sort of magical ability, then 5ive Girls turns into a The Exorcist (1973) rip-off as a deep voiced demon from hell starts to possess the girls &amp; there's even a vomiting scene as well (with a terrible CGI computer effect to go with it). The twists &amp; turns of the plot aren't anything any seasoned horror film fan won't have seen dozens of times before &amp; felt rather lacklustre to me, there's not much build up or suspense &amp; even though all five girls are meant to have some sort of supernatural ability this aspect of the story is very poorly handled. It's not really clear what ability a couple of the girls have &amp; none of them use their abilities to any great effect at all, in fact this subplot about these abilities goes nowhere. Also at the end the demon Legion states that he wants five victims with only Alex left but technically Legion had killed Father Drake so in fact he had killed five people &amp; nowhere in the film did it state that it had to be five girls. This lacks any great pace, the twists aren't overly surprising, the character's are fairly clichéd &amp; unlikable &amp; the story is just very forgettable bar the spanking scene...<br><br>There's a great scene in this when the rather sexy headmistress makes Alex bend over a table, pulls her skirt up &amp; smacks her bottom with a ruler! I was sitting there &amp; kind of thought that looked rather fun actually, I mean the headmistress could spank my bottom anytime she wanted or is that just me being a weird pervert? A rather kinky but entertainingly memorable corporal punishment scene, probably the best scene in the film. There is some nudity too, couple the nudity with the fact they are schoolgirls in school uniforms &amp; it left me with a very unpleasant feeling. One could argue that 5ive Girls has a slightly paedophilia tone, unintentional I am sure but school uniforms, young girls &amp; nudity? Horror wise there's not too much here to get excited about, there are the usual flashes of ghosts, there's a bit of blood splatter &amp; someone is impaled on a large cross at the end. There are some average looking CGI computer effects here with a rather black skeletal looking demon at the end. The mystery elements of the film just don't play out that well, I was never really overly bothered by what was happening to anyone &amp; the story just didn't grab me.<br><br>With a supposed budget of about $3,000,000 all I can say is where did all the money go? The film takes place entirely within the confines of the school, the cast numbers about seven &amp; I doubt even Hollywood star Ron Pearlman's wages were that demanding. Apparently shot in Hamilton in Ontario in Canada. The acting is alright, Pearlman looks disinterested while I must admit I had the hots for sexy strict headmistress miss Pearce or maybe that's just me being weird again...<br><br>5ive Girls is not a film that I could recommend to anyone, I just didn't like it really &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that. It's reasonably well made but when a film fails to grab you or entertain you so what?","user":"poolandrews","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Five Girls and a Legion of Two Thousand Demons","rating":6,"date":"5 May 2007","review":"In St. Marks catholic boarding school for girls, the religious student Elizabeth (Krysta Carter) is attacked by evil forces and disappears from the classroom and the impotent Father Drake (Ron Perlman) is incapable of saving her. The school is closed and five years later it is reopened. Five troubled unwanted girls - Alex (Jennifer Miller), Mara (Jordan Madley), the blind Cecilia (Terra Vnesa), Leah (Barbara Mamabolo) and Connie (Tasha May Currie)  are left by their family in the institution, severely directed by the headmistress Miss Pearce (Amy Ciupak Lalonde) with hands of iron. Father Drake is their teacher and the girls are forbidden to go to the mysterious third floor. When Alex has visions of the possessed Elizabeth, weird things happen in the spot and the girls have to fight against a legion of two thousand demons.<br><br>\"5ive Girls\" is not a bad horror movie as mentioned in some reviews. The problem is that the story is too ambitious for a low-budget movie. There are at least three great flaws in the plot. The first one is how could a school so big have only five students and one teacher? Would figurants be so expensive? The second one is the lack of an explanation why the demons attacked the boarding school. Last but not the least, why Mara has healing power? But anyway the story startles, the atmosphere is creepy, the gorgeous actresses have good performances and Ron Pearlman is efficient as usual. If you see this film with low expectations and disregard the flaws in the screenplay you may have a good surprise. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Demônios\" (\"Demons\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[25,30]},{"title":"Schlock nonsense","rating":4,"date":"17 March 2015","review":"Some sub-standard religious nonsense about five teenage girls at a finishing school that turns out to be haunted by demons. Mired in the middle of the mess is none other than Ron Perlman, doing his very best with the disappointing material and enlivening the screen with his presence whenever he appears - which is far too infrequently, unfortunately.<br><br>For most of the running time this is a cheesy variant on the likes of THE CRAFT, with the young actresses vamping it up and stripping at various intervals to keep the (male) viewers interested. As it's a B-movie about demonic possession, there's also a smattering of gore, alongside lots of cheesy/lousy CGI effects involving demonic goo being thrown around. None of it makes much sense and it's all very predictable and uninteresting; even the inclusion of some extra spicy corporal punishment fails to lift the spirits. Aside from a fun CGI demon this is pretty nonsensical.","user":"Leofwine_draca","rank":[6,6]}]
