[{"title":"Pulled to Sleep","rating":1,"date":"6 July 2019","review":"What is this movie really about makes no sense out of context stupid and very poor acting and budget I could have fell asleep but had to Review it to save your Lives ..","user":"dgosset-828-807085","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"The Food Chain","rating":4,"date":"1 July 2019","review":"Mickey (April Ezell Wilson) Kyle (Toochukwu T.C. Anyachonkeya) and Charles (Tim Holt ) are night stalkers who stealth around ina Country Squire. Not as cool as Kolchak, but they never manage to save anyone. They kill vampire like cannibals. Mickey's foster mom Delores (Bonnie Johnson) has visions of kidnapped victims/lunches and sends Mickey out to get them. Over the years they developed a hate-hate relationship. Delores' daughter Tina (Valerie Bobo) also has \"the gift\" of sight.<br><br>The film shows them killing one of those \"things\" and then hunting a bigger badder uglier thing.<br><br>The acting left something to be desired especially the poorly scripted exchange at the hospital. The production incorporated dark scenes with camera shaking to create a scare effect, most likely because they didn't have the budget to shot too many decent kill scenes.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[9,11]},{"title":"I'm a better actor!","rating":1,"date":"29 July 2019","review":"Garbage. The storyline seemed interesting so I gave it a go. The horrible acting really annoyed me. Lead actress was maybe the worst of all. Lot of conversations were just people screaming at each other for no other reason than annoying the viewer. Don't waste your time on this one, unless you like crappy acting.","user":"evelyn-arfeuille","rank":[5,6]}]
