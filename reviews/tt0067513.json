[{"title":"Laid-back and eccentric Italian murder-mystery","rating":8,"date":"26 May 2009","review":"This little seen movie is a languid and laid-back giallo. It veers away from some of the clich√©'s of the genre and adopts a looser approach. It's about a woman searching for her missing lover; a psychiatrist who has suddenly vanished for no apparent reason. Her search leads her to a villa populated by a group of eccentric individuals. In true giallo style, murder is never far away.<br><br>The cast is really rather good. We have Aldofo Celi (Thunderball), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat o' Nine Tails) and a very young Sybil Danning (80's scream queen). The lead actress is Rosemary Dexter, and while I am not familiar with her, she does a good job in leading the picture.<br><br>One of the defining features of Eye in the Labyrinth is its music. Atypically for a giallo it features a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack. This score, composed by Roberto Nicolosi, is reminiscent of Miles Davis, especially his work on In A Silent Way. It's an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel than most gialli. The fusion groove accentuates the languid atmosphere and compliments the sunny, sea-front scenery that the film is mostly made up of.<br><br>This is a giallo so we really need to talk about the murder set-pieces. Well, this film falls a little short in this regard. It's certainly not devoid of them but they are few and far between. The opening dream-murder being probably the best on offer as well as a memorable burning car sequence. But this really isn't a particularly violent film. Still, I don't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre. The mystery is fairly compelling and it has enough eccentric characters (the idiot boy Saro and THAT unsettlingly inappropriate dubbed accent?) and moments of the bizarre to satisfy; while the sleaze-factor is upheld with a smattering of nudity throughout.<br><br>Eye in the Labyrinth plays like a giallo version of an Agatha Christie mystery, as it features a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa, all under suspicion of murder; we have the obligatory flashbacks detailing their connections with the final hours of the (highly unsympathetic) murder victim. While this isn't a grade-A example of the genre, it's certainly an appealingly different one, as it doesn't borrow too heavily from other films of the sub-genre. For giallo enthusiasts I give this a thumbs up and hope one day it's given a nice DVD transfer. It certainly deserves the treatment.","user":"Red-Barracuda","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Very well made giallo","rating":10,"date":"22 September 1999","review":"Giallo fans, seek out this rare film. It is well written, and full of all sorts of the usual low lifes that populate these films. I don't want to give anything away, so I wont even say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect. Recommended! The only place I've seen to get this film in english is from European Trash Cinema, for $15.","user":"Udo","rank":[16,21]},{"title":"Crafty Little Giallo","rating":6,"date":"26 September 2016","review":"A woman searches for her missing boyfriend (who happens to be a psychiatrist) and ends up at a resort full of eclectic characters who could all be guilty of something. While the woman is there murders start happening.<br><br>This an early 70's giallo that stars the bad dude from Thunderball (1965) Adolfe Celi and a really young Sybil Danning who only has a bit part. This one is a real slow burner but it rocks. It keeps you wondering all the way through. More mystery than mayhem.<br><br>Of course my guess as to who did it was way wrong but then again I couldn't figure who the killer was in Friday the 13th Part 2 (he was masked ). Not a very violent giallo. The copy I seen was a third generation VHS transfer so maybe soon there will be a decent release. So if you are a fan of Italian giallos watch this one for sure.","user":"shawnblackman","rank":[3,3]}]
