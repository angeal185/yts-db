[{"title":"Beautiful made movie","rating":9,"date":"11 August 2019","review":"Beautiful made movie! It's a movies which didn't bring out the violence of the war, but a emotional and touchy story of a hero. It's really rare that we even see a Vietnam war movies. I literally cried throughout the whole movies. Very glad to see.\nGreat pick on actor and subject! Love the concept that this movie has brought hope to our life. PTSD was well written and showed in front of us. All the suffers that those veterans had been through. Great storyline based on real story. For sure that this story has \"heart\" , I really hope that people can see, feel and understand what veterans had been through and provide support for them. Definitely recommend!","user":"rachelbbbbb","rank":[157,219]},{"title":"A True American Hero!","rating":10,"date":"21 January 2020","review":"After seeing 1917 I really wasn't expecting much when I started watching the movie. 1917 would be a tough act to follow. I have to say now that at least for me...the true war Story vs a hearsay war story was way better.. At the time I knew nothing about William Pitsenbarger. I'm glad I refused all temptation to do a Google Search before watching the movie, I simply followed the story and was not disappointed. Beautifully written and I'm sure you will tear up, once you hear multiple witnesses describing the Airman's heroics.","user":"ncoutlander","rank":[60,83]},{"title":"Great Movie","rating":9,"date":"23 January 2020","review":"This was a great movie. People who nit-pick it miss the point. Movies are supposed to entertain us, they are not history lessons. Sure there are a few mistakes, but nothing that detracts from the story or the man's heroism.<br><br>And for you guys talking about his \"sergeant strips\" that change did not take effect until Oct. 1967 and this action happened in April 1966. At the time of the action his 3-stripes indicated Senior Airman, which is still an Airman.<br><br>Sit back and enjoy the film. I'm sure you won't regret it. God bless you William Pitsenbarger.","user":"jstrandberg-885-301593","rank":[48,67]}]
