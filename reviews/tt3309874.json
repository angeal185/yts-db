[{"title":"Delightful! Worth watching!","rating":10,"date":"12 February 2020","review":"While at first glance Eleven Eleven may appear to be just another entertaining, slightly risqu√© film, this delightful comedy offers real substance for a healthier body and mind. Is this a stretch? How is that even possible? Because not only are endorphins released through hearty laughter, so good for our immune system, (I laugh myself silly each time I watch this film) but the mind is also refreshed by the script's subtle undercurrent values of integrity, trust, loyalty, and forgiveness.<br><br>If you are tired of having your senses bombarded with the harsh, ugly, negative, and unyielding realities of life, take time to just relax and enjoy the funny nonsensical escapades of Tim Faris (so delightfully played by Charlie Baker) in this light-hearted sci-fi film. All cast members were exemplary in their roles but Charlie Baker and Krista Allen (who played Andromeda) were superb!","user":"kittchap","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Fun movie","rating":10,"date":"10 February 2020","review":"Sedona AZ has a reputation for alien ship activity. This movie capitalizes on that reputation. It's a fun satire of life in Sedona from the point of view of what people who don't actually live there may believe. Charlie Baker plays the nerdy loveable UFO tour guide. Krista Allen plays the sexy and funny alien.","user":"marytautimer","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Quirky, funny off beat movie","rating":8,"date":"6 February 2020","review":"Thought this movie was a giggler. Fun to see Charlie Baker in something besides Breaking Bad but Krista Allen is a scene stealer. Love the line where she pulls out a book on Satan in front of the Priest. It should a vine. Worth a watch.","user":"jheflebower","rank":[5,6]}]
