[{"title":"One of the worst movies in a long while","rating":1,"date":"17 December 2019","review":"Where to start with this one, how about don't. Truly terrible acting throughout, cheap effects and amateur cinematography. How this got made, or how this made it out of a college project, I have no idea.<br><br>I could do a better job making a film with a handheld, a couple of friends and a night in a woods. I could likewise choose a scarier location and some better lighting, and somehow work the effects better perhaps by using suspense and eerie, extended shots with nice angles. In fact I have done, but I wouldn't let my movie see the light of day, because I know it's not at the level that consumers deserve, just like this atrocious movie fails to live up to any decent level of expectancy.","user":"Jeff_Saps","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"A Joke of a Movie.

Unbeknownst to them, a mysterious old creature starts to hunt them and what was once an innocent bet is now a fight for survival. As the night goes on, none of them may make it out alive.<br><br>The PR for this promises \"a pulse-racing profusion of Stranger Things and Predator.\" No pressure, right?<br><br>This is the first full-length film from director Paul Anthony Rogers.<br><br>Honestly, it's pretty basic. There's a weird creature that ends up looking like Gollum on steroids and he kills just about everyone. I've had an entire holiday of arguments that I'm still getting over, so I really didn't feel like listening to an hour plus of idiots in the woods fighting and then yelling one another's names as they are chased and murdered. Your mileage may vary.<br><br>It certainly looks nice and the non-CGI practical monster is a definite plus.","user":"BandSAboutMovies","rank":[0,0]}]
