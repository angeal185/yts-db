[{"title":"Who doesn't like to see bad/racist cops get a solid beating?","rating":8,"date":"4 February 2020","review":"I first saw this in a theater when it released. Revisited bits of it few days back.\nIt is about a vigilante (John Abraham) who kills corrupt cops by setting them on fire, thereby gaining public support for wiping out the corrupt cops.\nWorried by the rising body count and seeing other cops terrified, an officer is assigned to hunt down the killer.\nThe film has lots of violent killings, an item song, some melodrama, Bollywood romance n a script straight outta the 80s but the end product is a decent action thriller with lots of dead corrupt cops.\nWatch out for the beating of the bald cop.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[27,28]},{"title":"Unwanted","rating":1,"date":"7 September 2018","review":"How can bollywood make such films in 21st century?","user":"eyeton","rank":[7,8]},{"title":"Satyameva Jayate is a fairly illogical commercial thriller fronted by two actors who deliver forceful performances.","rating":4,"date":"15 August 2018","review":"It's foolhardy to expect nuance from a jaded action drama that not only recycles 80s clich√©s, but also expects to pull off a reckless revenge in the absence of Amitabh Bachchan's charisma and Sunny Deol's fury. Only Satyamev Jayate's predictable twists and superficial emotions have absolutely nothing new to offer.<br><br>Satyameva Jayate is a fairly illogical commercial thriller fronted by two actors who deliver forceful performances. It may not be the most intelligent thriller, but its lack of pretence is its greatest asset. It's entertaining for some of the right reasons, and plenty of unintended ones.<br><br>Milap Milan Zaveri's story is simplistic, massy and something that the masses would applaud. Milap Milan Zaveri's direction reminds one of the 90s action dramas. Although it works in most parts, at some places the film begins to give a dated feel. On the whole, SATYAMEVA JAYATE is a powerful and gripping drama that leaves an impact as it resonates with the problems of the common man. It is sure to work big time in the single screens where the various scenes are bound to induce claps and whistles. This one is for the masses!<br><br>Milap Milan Zaveri with Satyameva Jayate shamelessly gets on the ground just with the thought of entertaining people. Never for a scene you'll feel Milap thinks that this is something 'a certain section' will not appreciate and does what he thinks is the best. Many hits, few misses but a honest product overall. All said and done, Satyameva Jayate provides unabashed entertainment. John Abraham - the Indian Hulk, Milap's seeti-maar dialogues will make you miss the times when masala entertainment was a trend in Bollywood.<br><br>'SMJ' desperately tries very hard to sell the age-old idea of revenge and righteousness. But the big booming treatment is a little too hard to accept and digest. With John in the film, one can expect good action, but it's gruesome and a little too bloody at times. Truth be told, the story is relevant in today's times, but too many cliches in the story and the style of storytelling will make you want to cop out of this one.","user":"fillerruth","rank":[44,72]}]
