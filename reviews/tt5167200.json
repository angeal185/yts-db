Seems they prefer to please the world rather than bring a genuine Christian \"fantasty\" movie. A \"fabled good king\"? Meaning God?\nThe acting, the special effects, the story, it is all bad as can be. And much in this movie is more from the evil side than from the good side.\nThe only good work is the cinematography/camerawork. Some may see this as finally a \"Christian fantasy\" movie, but the last part is more present than the first one. Avoid it if you can.","user":"annus_sanctus","rank":[3,7]},{"title":"You have to know what you're watching...","rating":8,"date":"13 March 2020","review":"This is a low budget movie. Yes, and I could hammer it for it's shortcomings, but I did think that it had some great moments too. A few bad ones, but some moments it felt like a big movie. So I liked it overall. I mean I like fantasy movies, and I am a Christian. Bad acting? Not like tons of other b movies. The guy that said bad acting is not correct. While some over acted a bit, sure, the main cast was pretty good albeit unknown.<br><br>The guy that gave it a 1 because it wasn't a Christian movie. Um, metaphors and allegories? Um, Jesus spoke in parables? It's about as plain as day in this movie.","user":"ZyaRep20","rank":[2,4]}]
