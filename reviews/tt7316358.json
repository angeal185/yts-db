[{"title":"Beautiful film","rating":9,"date":"18 May 2019","review":"I really enjoyed this film featuring Laia Costa, who is arguably one of the most talented female actors working today. It's a raw and real look at a man and woman who serendipitously come together while hiking the Appalachian trail. Laia plays Bluebird, a tormented woman looking to reclaim her identity while becoming emotionally connected to Lake, played by Thomas Mann, while hiking alone in the Appalachian wilderness. As chemistry develops, Bluebird works through her demons while Lake pursues her with real and honest feelings of love. Ultimately it becomes a voyeuristic exercise for viewers to experience emotional intimacy on a trail hike with an incredibly beautiful and complex woman.","user":"ScoobySnacks66","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Fantastic Movie","rating":9,"date":"17 March 2019","review":"What a fantastic independent movie. It's a dialogue-based movie that really hits you in the heart. The acting was excellent and this movie made me relate to the dynamics of brief relationships that often come and go. These bad reviews are hard to read. Not every movie needs to be about a pointless superhero with magical powers.","user":"jjl_1111","rank":[9,12]},{"title":"I'm giving this a 2 mainly for the nice countryside scenery","rating":1,"date":"24 December 2018","review":"This would have been FAR more interesting had they called it \"From Spain to Maine\" and had her swimming across the ocean for the entire movie.<br><br>As it is, it's about an annoying young woman hiking through Maine and that's really about it. I kept wondering while watching it, how little it must have cost to make it. In this Youtube generation, pretty much anyone can afford to make something people can watch. However, judging from this film that is also the downside to it all.","user":"Sean_Biggins","rank":[7,17]}]
