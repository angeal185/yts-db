[{"title":"Can't Recommend","rating":3,"date":"6 July 2019","review":"B-movie type film marked by stilted dialogue and cliched plot elements.<br><br>A terrorist leader, dying of a terminal illness, seeks revenge against a group of Native American trackers. During one of the Gulf Wars, the trackers had led the U.S. military to the home of the terrorist and subsequently a drone strike wiped out his family.<br><br>The trackers are now patrolling the U.S./Mexican border to try and stop the passage of drugs, human trafficking, and possible terrorist weapons. They are secretly being funded by a former fellow soldier who is now a Colonel with the NSA.<br><br>Overall, can't recommend this one.","user":"larrys3","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Ex-Porn Stars","rating":1,"date":"4 August 2019","review":"The actors have the worst monotone, scripted, unemotional delivery of their lines, like a bunch of  stars trying to break into \"real movies\". It doesn't qualify as even a B movie, that would insult every B movie ever made.","user":"alberteinstein-90912","rank":[14,23]},{"title":"Absolutely dire","rating":1,"date":"27 November 2019","review":"Imagine Matt Stone and Trey Parker's brilliant Team America, only without the satire, humor, self awareness or interest. Filmed like a really , with dire scripts, leaden direction and with a cast who simply can't act - even the good actors seem aware they're taking part in a total turkey and are phoning in their performances. Stupdendously bad - a textbook lesson in bad drama.","user":"oliviakirby-93766","rank":[2,2]}]
