[{"title":"Not Bad. Painful To listen to At times","rating":5,"date":"20 August 2017","review":"Movie was decent. Above average for a found footage. The Black guy and his stereotypical loud voice nearly caused me to give this movie a 1 star as he was SO annoying. And I mean SO annoying I had to cover my ears sometimes when he went on his rants. Don't know why they still think that that's needed.","user":"jxfa","rank":[33,37]},{"title":"A well made film with some effective SFX. Shame about some of the actors, though.","rating":6,"date":"18 August 2017","review":"I saw the trailer for this film, and I thought the premise was unique, interesting and could potentially yield an entertaining and thoughtfully made film, and I was almost completely right in my assessment. From the onset, the film makes no qualms about what it is trying to achieve. A group of people set out to prove that monsters are real by interviewing 3 people who claim to be real life monsters. It is a premise that writes itself. The acting is competent, and most of the actors are quite talented. The standout of this film, by far, are the special effects. The Skinwalker and the vampire were really well done, and the action scenes were filmed with a competence usually exerted by bigger budget films. It seems like whoever budgeted this movie made it a point to not skimp out on the SFX, and this elevated the film to a much higher standard. I was constantly impressed by some of the make-up and transformations. If more independent movies allocated their funds to SFX, they would produce much more entertaining films. Overall, it is a decent film that does some incredibly clever things that have not been attempted before. If nothing else, people should watch this film just to see an original and unique production. It is a rarity in this age of sequels.<br><br>I will end my review with this; The character who played \"Jamal\" was horrible, offensive, needlessly loud, and entirely stereotypical. Whoever wrote his character should be ashamed of themselves for perpetuating such limited and thoughtless characteristics on any character. Never mind that he was the absolute worst of the entire cast, every time he spoke, it was like nails on a chalkboard. 2 points were removed from my score simply because I hated the character so much. He nearly ruined what was a very decent and entertaining film.","user":"manuelasaez","rank":[27,37]},{"title":"Good visuals but a poor story","rating":6,"date":"18 August 2017","review":"This is going to be a brief review for a average movie.<br><br>Plott not interesting enough to glue me to my chair but I've seen worse.<br><br>Visualfx and especial effects are good has well the audio,the ambiance was OK too.<br><br>Acting was not that good but the effort was there to make the viewer at least curious to see what this will unfold in the end.<br><br>A clich√© ending in my opinion.<br><br>The trailer spoils a lot of the movie and to many predictable jump scares,i give it a 6 for the visuals and audio.","user":"jhitman-826-877694","rank":[25,35]}]
