[{"title":"What Star Wars should be.","rating":8,"date":"30 December 2018","review":"Yes this review is 2 years after the film's release, but it has to be said that this film is what I hoped all the new Star Wars films would be like. Rouge One to me is the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy. The pace and scripting of the movie are great, The story provide just enough time in each of the characters so that you feel invested in what happens to them, and the script is well written compared to any of the recent Star Wars movies, we even get a droid that gives CP3O a run for his money, providing just enough funny quips to keep the movie light in what to me is one of the darkest Star Wars films since the Empire Strikes Back.<br><br>Gareth Edwards has done the Star Wars universe proud, which sadly can't be said for the current mess that Disney has been releasing.<br><br>If you haven't managed to catch Rouge One yet, then give it ago as it will take you back to the fun and action of the originals, and also make you believe that the Star Wars franchise can produce something good when placed in the hands of someone who understood what Star Wars means to its loyal fans.<br><br>Is it perfect no, but it's dam close for me, so much so that this is the only Star Wars movie i have bought since the original trilogy.","user":"Rusticcrayon","rank":[319,361]},{"title":"This IS Star Wars. At its best.","rating":10,"date":"12 November 2019","review":"What has made Star Wars into the internationally recognized genre that it is today? Two things in particular - original material and a touch of humor/wit. Rogue One is a plethora of both. In addition, even in an area where previous Star Wars may have lacked (perhaps even overlooked, understandably), the acting is superb, top of the line. Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg in what becomes an epic, near-perfectly written plot that connects episodes III and IV. It is haunting, it is funny, devastating, cheesy, and it is wonderful. It IS Star Wars.","user":"MOVIE-REVIEW-POOPSHOOTs","rank":[112,125]},{"title":"Best modern star wars","rating":9,"date":"28 February 2019","review":"This felt like an original trilogy movie.
