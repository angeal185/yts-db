[{"title":"Missing in Action 2: The Beginning is his most personal mission of all!","rating":9,"date":"19 October 2016","review":"When we last left Colonel James Braddock, he was shoving it up Vietnamese butt by barging into their press conference about how they didn't have any POWs in Vietnam with a POW he just rescued. Truly a fairy tale ending, but what about the beginning of the fairy tale? Missing in Action 2: The Beginning is his most personal mission of all! Because it's when he was a POW himself! Which we already saw in sporadic flashbacks in the first movie.<br><br>Missing in Action 2: The Beginning shows the capture of Colonel Braddock (Chuck Norris) during the Vietnam war in the 1970s, his captivity with other American POWs in a brutal prison camp, and his plans to escape. Norris and his crew are holed up in a prison camp for the whole picture, ruled by tyrannical Colonel Yin (Soon-Tek Oh) who resorts to psychological mind games, torture and murder to try to make Braddock sign a statement admitting to war atrocities he never committed.<br><br>There seems to be no end to the different scenarios and interesting scenes that play out during the film: escape attempts, arranged fights between prisoners, a guy who stumbles onto the prison camp and gets executed. Things really start to pick up when Braddock gets really mad and you see him sneaking here and there, setting bombs, picking off people one by one, freeing people, blowing up stuff, and staying behind after everyone leaves because he doesn't believe Yin really died when he bombed Yin's hut. <br><br>But Chuck really delivers in the end, especially in his final feel good showdown with Yin. In my opinion, Missing in Action 2: The Beginning is the best of the Braddock movies, it's part action film and part action drama, which sets it apart from the other movies.<br><br>The first time i ever watched this film was in the early 80's in the cinema and it was great, and i still think it's great...","user":"HarryLags","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Exciting prequel dealing with Vietnam prison camps , it stars the incomparable Norris' Colonel Braddock as liberator","rating":6,"date":"24 October 2005","review":"The picture focuses Colonel Braddock (Chuck Norris) aboard a helicopter which is down . He is imprisoned , along with various Vietnam soldiers (Steven Williams , John Wesley..), by a hideous and sadist POW camp chief warden (Soon-Teck-Oh) and underlings (professor Tanaka..) . The tough Braddock continuously attempts to free the prisoners held captives and they receive numerous tortures and sufferings in charge of the concentration camp wardens and their evil ruler .<br><br>The screenplay of the movie is plain and simple . It's a predictable routine and formula actioner film . It's all obvious , unconvincing and overblown . However if you appealed the first part , you'll probably love this picture . It deals upon horrible conditions of prisoners and grueling efforts of the meager band of captives to survive , confronting starvation , mistreats , rampage and continuous violence by hitting , punches , lashes , knocks and incredible tortures . Storyline is a bit ridiculous , embarrassing and shallow , it concerns on prisoners trying to escape and subsequent revenge executed by Braddock as a headstrong and reckless Colonel . In the wake of : ¨Uncommon valor¨ (directed by Ted Kocheff) and ¨Rambo II¨ (by George Pan Cosmatos) and Norris imitating to Silvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger as one army man , shooting and killing numerous enemies <br><br>The film results to be the second installment from a trilogy , concerning the first ¨Missing in action¨ (made by Joseph Zito) on Braddock accused of war crimes by a Vietnam general and he then escapes to free inmates ; this second part (directed by Lance Hool , the first one 's producer) about tortures and Braddock suffering in a prisoner camp , and the third part (directed by Aaron Norris , Chuck's brother , who in 'Missing in action 1' was the stunt coordinator) upon looking for his wife after downfall Saigon . Filmed back to back with Missing in action (1984) , this picture was supposed to be released first . However , when ¨Cannon¨ realized the second film was the better of the two , they released it first and re-titled this movie as a prequel . The three films contain ominous and villain enemies played by oriental actors (James Hong , Soon Teck Oh , Aki Aelong) with offensive racial stereotypes . Nice support cast formed by Steven Williams (TV L.A. Heat) and Professor Tanaka (a wrestler who possessed incredible strength) who was arguably the successor to Harald Sakata (Golfinger) as the archetypal Asian henchman . Appropriate musical score by Jay Chattaway and adequate as well as atmospheric cinematography by cameraman Joao Fernandez , filmed on location in Philippines . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Lance Hool , also producer . Rating : Average but entertaining . The motion picture will appeal to Chuck Norris fans .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[18,23]},{"title":"One of Norris' best films","rating":7,"date":"7 March 2001","review":"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br><br>1985 was a top year for Chuck Norris,with Invasion USA and this immensely enjoyable actioner coming out.Following on from the disappointing,slow moving original,this charts his highly involving experiences in a Vietnamise POW camp,and his eventual escape.A lot of depth is invested into the characters,which fully envelops at the end when Norris faces off against Soon Tech Oh.Given that the films were created by Chuck as a tribute to his brother Wieland who was killed in Vietnam,it's not really so surprising in hindsight to notice the extra invested energy and emotion he displays in these films.And all the better for it.****","user":"davideo-2","rank":[25,34]}]
