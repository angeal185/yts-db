[{"title":"The Worst Serial Killer Movie You'll See","rating":4,"date":"25 November 2017","review":"No need to get too long with it, the movie is just bad.<br><br>A horribly pretentious story that is full of holes and just doesn't work, pair that up with terrible acting from good actors, just a disappointing mess.<br><br>Just give it a miss.","user":"rapshade","rank":[97,122]},{"title":"Good story, bad directing, the worst acting.","rating":2,"date":"29 May 2018","review":"Love crime thrillers, and the storyline for the movie was actually really good. Serial killer who leaves clues taunting the detectives to try and catch him...<br><br>Unfortunately the words given to you describing the plot of the movie is the best that it gets.<br><br>Pacino couldn't figure how to pull of that deep Louisiana accent. Seemed to be casted to play a support role, but he either didn't believe in the movie or didn't care because that was some of his worst acting.<br><br>Karl Urban's character story was a mess, Wife was brutally murdered, what could have been key in the focus of the movie was just lost until it was as if the writer/director was like oh yeah, about that.<br><br>Brittany Stone was the lone brightspot in the movie. She did a better job \"playing detective\" (was a reporter) then the two lead actors who were actually playing detectives. <br><br>Movie had a strong resemblence to the Saw series, go figure as this was also a Lionsgate film.<br><br>Overall felt the story was promising, but as the movie progressed, the acting, writing, and directing regressed.","user":"mrtylerjwatson","rank":[32,38]},{"title":"I want to see a movie made by professionals, not this.","rating":3,"date":"26 November 2017","review":"In this film you will find exceptionally bad acting. Even the two heavy-weight names of Hollywood, Pacino and Urban can only do so much with the terrible script. Like in other flicks similar to this one, the makers probably meant to give a realistic edge to their storytelling, by having half the people stutter, filming the car chase like a YouTube video, or having the actors stare into nothing with a thoughtful (dumb) expression on their faces. <br><br>Whoever gave the director/editor/writer of \"Hangman\" money for this abomination, next time give that money to me please, I promise not to flush it down the toilet.<br><br>Two extra stars for Al and Karl, I love you guys.","user":"thejoudblitz","rank":[71,94]}]
