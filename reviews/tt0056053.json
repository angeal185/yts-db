[{"title":"Light and unbeaten.","rating":27,"date":"27 September 1999","review":"A very bizarre low budget comedy about two men who take to the woods to purge their obsessive attraction to a woman named Vera who dumped them both for a shmuck.  This quirky little film is on the verge of being hilarious. However, it never quite gets all the laughs it shoots for.  As a result, it is only mildly amusing, but worth a viewing if you're in the mood for something light and off the beaten path.","user":"Cutter John","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"an understated masterpiece!","rating":6,"date":"5 November 2006","review":"I don't think there's any way to spoil this film. It is definitely an acquired taste. The other review gives you a fair idea of what plot there is; all I can add is that there may be some genuine laughs to be rescued from the Hava Nagheela scene. Remember that the story is pretty much as described above. So how does Hava Nagheela come into it? You will have to watch it to find out. I would not recommend watching this film on a hot date, unless your date has even more bizarre taste than you do. If so, this one might make him or her see you in an entirely new light. <br><br>This film is a pretty good example of what happens when a cluster of New York eccentrics with inarguable abilities in music, art, photography, and writing decides to make a home movie. I think that says it all.","user":"birck","rank":[4,8]}]
