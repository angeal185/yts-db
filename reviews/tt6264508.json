[{"title":"A Companion to \"13th\"","rating":9,"date":"23 August 2018","review":"Frances Causey takes a brave journey into her own family history in this timely film. A southern white film-maker dares to learn for herself the racial history of her family. The result is a film both personal and public. It is historical and contemporary. It belongs beside Ava Duvernay's \"13th\" as expose and catalyst for racial understanding.","user":"tdadpete","rank":[10,21]},{"title":"Excellent Scholarship with a very engaging story","rating":10,"date":"27 January 2020","review":"Some of the most prolific and brilliant contemporary researchers and scholars unfold real American History.

I was shocked but glad to learn what I did, although I'm white. Not just well-done but fascinating.","user":"jpeerhaas","rank":[0,0]}]
