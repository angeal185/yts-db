[{"title":"Too scary for a 3 year old","rating":1,"date":"11 August 2014","review":"I took my three year old son to see this movie as his first experience of cinema. I thought I was fairly safe with Postman Pat, but we left the film early with my son in floods of tears.<br><br>So if you've got a captive audience of young kids with a favorite character, what do you don't want to do is make a movie that rides roughshod over him. You don't want to replace the characterful hand animation with flat and poorly executed CGI. You don't want to base the plot on concepts that a 5 year old would struggle with let alone a 3 year old. You don't want to introduce lots of examples of things like newspaper cuttings that your average 3 year old can't actually read. And top of the list, you REALLY don't want to populate the film with robot versions of the children's' favorite characters that march menacingly towards them while firing lasers from red eyes! This movie is not just a flop, it's an open invitation for parents of traumatised children with recurrent nightmares to sue the film's makers. For heaven's sake, if you're going to make a film for small children, get advice on what's appropriate for that age group!","user":"Richard-Vialls","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Postman pat: not for the younger ones...","rating":3,"date":"15 June 2014","review":"We've been enjoying Postman Pat for years, but this new movie wasn't what we expected at all. The Robots in the movie were actually quite scary for the youngest children. Several kids were crying during the movie. The storyline is more suitable for children for ages up from 7 or something like that. A pity... <br><br>The older, short, stories never even had bad guys in it. Just normal things happening to people in normal life. And that might be quite interesting enough for young kids...<br><br>So, a great person he remains, our beloved hero Postman Pat. But the story he's in didn't touch our hearts.","user":"f_boekhoorn","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Postman Pat hits the big screen","rating":7,"date":"27 May 2014","review":"Just been to see this with my 2 year old. Didn't have any real expectations, I was just hoping my little girl would enjoy the film. However I was very much surprised. Firstly the negative stuff: The animation wasn't very good. The CGI looked a little cheap. Also It would have been good if they could have used the same voices for the main characters. Saying that these things things spoil the film. The makers of the film have really thought of the adults who will be seeing this film with their little ones. Simon Cowbell is a good example. A miserable headhunter, hosting a talent show. He even wore clothes very much similar to a certain person with a similar name. The plot wasn't anything new, but as it's for very little children that can be forgiven. My two year old was laughing and clapping to the film.<br><br>However their are a few scenes that might scare some children. <br><br>Above all a great young children's film that parents will enjoy watching too.","user":"stephenwilletts68","rank":[11,17]}]
