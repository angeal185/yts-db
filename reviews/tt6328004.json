[{"title":"Quite Good For What It Is","rating":7,"date":"4 December 2018","review":"Went into this one not expecting much but i actually found myself laughing at at it, along with the gory stuff going on.I'd say it was a Black Comedy/Horror, if you don't like gore, then i would give this one a miss as the gore comes thick and fast but boy, it's funny too.Not going to go into anything that happens in it, just sit down and enjoy the fest.","user":"gloopy-45239","rank":[15,24]},{"title":"Fun stuff","rating":7,"date":"23 December 2019","review":"Seen some really negative reviews of this on here. Don't get it. Played like an Xmas version of the Crossed comic. Very black humour but a welcome addition to the list of Xmas films for the less jovial of us.","user":"bmeanie","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"So bad. Just so bad.","rating":1,"date":"22 December 2018","review":"I've never written an IMDB review before but I always had a feeling the time would come when I had to be a good citizen and set off a warning flare. That time is now. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. As a horror fan I have seen a lot of low calibre productions over the years but this takes the biscuit. I am struggling to find a single redeeming feature...I suppose the acting is just about passable but other than that it's just so so bad. It tries to be funny but misses the mark horribly, the direction is hideously pretentious in trying to be cool and different, and the whole thing looks like it's been filmed on a 2004 camera phone. Oh and I haven't even finished watching it yet, I don't think I'll bother. Merry Xmas.","user":"srwood-83999","rank":[20,43]}]
