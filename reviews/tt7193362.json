[{"title":"A Worthy Documentary","rating":8,"date":"21 September 2019","review":"As someone who followed Cohn's career in real time it's clear that the film tells real truths about a complicated and fascinating man with no moral boundaries or bottom. And the lesson of Cohn's life, never admit anything, never apologize, and always hit back harder than you were hit, is abundantly demonstrated. Even his own relatives understood the truth.\nYou will not lose interest in this film.","user":"PaulonWestend","rank":[52,65]},{"title":"Ignore the creepy republican trolls","rating":10,"date":"20 September 2019","review":"This is a smartly made and entertaining portrait of a narcissistic sociopath ala our current idiot-in-chief. It's good to be informed about how awful men can be. And aspire to be better.","user":"jjdausey","rank":[79,116]},{"title":"This Is How We Got Trump","rating":10,"date":"22 September 2019","review":"Don't miss this exhaustively comprehensive look at the odious Roy Cohn, who in spite of living only 59 years did decades' worth of damage to the U.S.<br><br>Tyrnauer's finest film.","user":"mattrett","rank":[48,73]}]
