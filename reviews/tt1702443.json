[{"title":"Crap","rating":1,"date":"15 February 2011","review":"Honestly the worst movie ever made. Theatre full of 10 year old girls screaming their heads off at the sight of him. <br><br>Could not stand sitting there for the entire time. Left early.<br><br>DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS. <br><br>I don't even understand how people agreed to turn this into a movie.<br><br>1/10, only because 0 isn't an option.<br><br>If anyone wants to see this movie, don't pay money for it. It is one of the worst films I've ever come across.<br><br>Im not sure why this became a movie, but im sure it was just so they could milk money from the current state of how popular the kid is and get even more money out of him. Never say never is bad.","user":"steven_adkins_101","rank":[605,697]},{"title":"Screaming 10 year old girls will be in heaven. Anyone else....no....","rating":1,"date":"14 February 2011","review":"OK. So I walk in the movie, and Every time the great Biebs comes on the screen, I hear the most annoying, loud, and irritating screaming little girls who somehow worship and adore this boy. 90% of the theater were young girls who thought this guy was the \"hottest person alive.\" So annoying.<br><br>And onto the movie, it is a waste of time, just watching his annoying confident face, and people like Usher talking about his talent. I hope so much you wont pay 10 bucks to see this crap. Really. The kid is just annoying. Please just stay away from this movie. Unless your a 10 year old girl, this is an utter waste of time.<br><br>1/10. No, 0/10, because of the crowd.","user":"prestonsaccount","rank":[825,957]},{"title":"A boring and pointless \"movie.\"","rating":13,"date":"13 February 2011","review":"I went to see this movie simply because I thought it would be interesting to learn about the Biebs and because I'd heard it was actually very good. I was not a fan of Justin nor did I dislike him, I was just neutral, so I figured it would be interesting to see if I would enjoy the movie or not.<br><br>Sadly, I did not. <br><br>Although it was interesting to see how Justin started out, (which was like a year ago???) the movie was SO incredibly boring. Half of the movie was Justin on stage singing his songs (which all sound the same) and the other half was him having a cold. So basically I learned that the hardest situation Justin has ever had to deal with was the cold he cold before performing.<br><br>I ended up leaving the theater about five minutes early partially because I couldn't take listening to one of his songs and partially because I couldn't take the annoying fans in the theater screaming every time he was on the screen.<br><br>So if you are already a fan of the Biebster, feel free to watch this movie. If you are not a fan, you aren't going to want to see it and will be mad for wasting ten bucks on a documentary that could have been aired on MTV.","user":"mary72195","rank":[564,654]}]
