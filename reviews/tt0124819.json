[{"title":"Rude, crude, and hilarious","rating":9,"date":"21 January 2003","review":"Sometimes I just need brain candy.  When I need brain candy, I can rely on Matt Stone and Trey Parker to deliver.<br><br>Orgazmo is full of potty humour, blasphemy, and other rudeness.  It relentlessly mocks  religious zealots, the porn industry, and nearly everything in between.<br><br>There is nothing good about the acting or production qualities -- in fact, the *poor* acting and production qualities add to the humour, I think, in the same way that the cheesy attempt at animation adds to the humour of South Park.  The entertainment value of 'Orgazmo' lies primarily in the situation -- and even if the individual jokes are not fantastically original, the situation *is*.  It's just good, stupid fun.<br><br>Think of the rudest, raunchiest of all the South Park episodes -- like the one where Cartman joins NAMBLA, or the one where the kids start a fad of sexually stimulating dogs.  If you enjoyed those, you will probably enjoy Orgazmo.  If you didn't appreciate the humour or found them offensive, don't bother with this movie.<br><br>Personally, my tastes are so base that I consider this one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.","user":"darthmaus","rank":[89,100]},{"title":"You can't hold the cheesiness against it.","rating":8,"date":"18 November 2001","review":"Orgazmo is the kind of movie that is cheesy to the point that it's obviously meant to be that way. You can't watch a movie like this and think even for a second that it is meant to be taken seriously, or even that it takes itself seriously. And all of this is clear just from looking at the cover box, so you know from the minute that you pick the movie up that you are about to watch an extremely goofball comedy. With that in mind, you can really appreciate Orgazmo for what it is.<br><br>Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the famous creators of South Park and the hilarious BASEketball, have returned with another comedy, this one with much less taste but at least as many laughs. Orgazmo is the story of a Mormon missionary who inadvertently winds up starring in an adult film in Los Angeles, but who never seems to lose his faith. Trey Parker plays Elder Young, the above-mentioned missionary, and also writes and directs this unusually amusing b-movie.<br><br>Orgazmo is a straightforward film that has a very obvious intent. It is aimed at the same audience as other infinitely inferior movies like Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2, but it actually succeeds because its creators have some filmmaking talent that goes beyond a simple purge of every disgusting joke that they learned in fourth grade. Parker and Stone are just naturally funny guys, as has become obvious by now, which is why they have managed to take the potential-free combination of the porn industry and a tiny budget and make it into a hilarious comedy.<br><br>Trey Parker plays Elder Young, a missionary assigned to do his mission work in Hollywood, and in a hilarious run-in with porn director Max Orbison, he ends up defending himself against a gang of thugs and thereby earning a high paying position as the leading man in Orbison's newest porno. Seduced by the offer of a huge amount of money, which he plans to spend on a house for himself and his ridiculous girlfriend (`Jesus and I love you!'), Young agrees to take on the role, provided he doesn't have to do any actual intercourse. Sound like the makings for a great comedy? No? Exactly! That's what makes it so good! This material is total crap, but that's where the comedy comes from! This is a spoof of lots of different types of films, not the least of which are martial arts films, for reasons which you'll just have to watch the movie to see, and it succeeds on many different levels.<br><br>\nThe characters are hilarious (there is a truly classic moment when Choda Boy explains to Young that, believe it or not, he doesn't get a lot of action from women. The fact that he's strapping a dildo to the top of his head might have something to do with that.), and there are just some great scenes. The movie is aware of its place, and it doesn't try to pretend that it is something that it's not. Get a bunch of your buddies together and have a couple beers while you watch this movie, you'll love it.","user":"Anonymous_Maxine","rank":[38,43]},{"title":"Underrated porn parody from Trey Parker and Matt Stone.","rating":9,"date":"27 October 2004","review":"Orgazmo (1997) was the second live action feature film from the South Park duo. Following Cannibal: The Musical, the duo of Trey Parker and Matt Stone satire the world of \"Adult Entertainment\".<br><br>The story follows the exploits of a Mormon missionary named Joe (Trey Parker) who by accident becomes the industry's biggest star \"Orgazmo\". A sleazy producer makes Trey an unwilling indentured servant. Joe's life is also plagued by his religious devotion to the mother church and his fianc√©e. Can Joe resolves these problems by the movie's end? Matt Stone co-stars as a set still photographer. Dian Bachar also co-stars as Orgazmo's sidekick and friend Choda Boy. Lloyd Kaufmann (founder of Troma Studios) and many stars of the \"Adult Entertainment\" make cameo appearances as well.<br><br>I enjoyed this movie. It was real funny and highly entertaining. Trey Parker did a great job of writing and directing this movie. The movie is even better if you're familiar with the porn business or know some of the stars. Too bad this movie was barely released and it seems to have been forgotten about on video. If you love South Park or enjoyed Cannibal: The Musical then I advise you to pick up a copy of this movie. You will not be disappointed.<br><br>Highly recommended.","user":"Captain_Couth","rank":[56,70]}]
