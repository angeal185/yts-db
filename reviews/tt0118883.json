[{"title":"A Surprisingly Good Film","rating":23,"date":"23 July 2000","review":"Let me say immediately that I would recommend this film to almost anyone but the most literal-minded.  This film will be different things to different people.  It can be a macho thriller, a subtle romance, an ironic look at ourselves, or a combination of all these things.  The great thing about this movie is not so much the plot, but the individual situations and scenes. What is meant to be portrayed as paranoid behaviour by Mel Gibson's character, Jerry Fletcher, becomes quite funny when the viewer recognizes his or her own self doing similar things, but in a context that is supposedly \"normal.\"  Jerry's having a padlock on his refrigerator and a combination lock on his coffee will bring a smile to the lips of anyone who has to deal with numerous computer \"logons\" and passwords to gain access to even the most mundane things in our computer-dominated workplaces. Likewise, the writers and director are spot on when they show poor paranoid Jerry going to separate mailboxes to post his various letters, while many of us here in the on-line world will routinely use pseudonyms, proxies, remailers, etc for the very same reason that Jerry takes his seemingly abnormal precautions, i.e., to avoid potentially prying eyes.   So, who's paranoid?  I thought this was very insightful.  As for overt humour, perhaps my guard was down, but I laughed until tears came to my eyes when Jerry tossed off joke about a man who had only three minutes to live.  Mel Gibson's delivery of the punch line was perfect.  As for pathos and those human moments, scenes in which Jerry would gladly die for just a brushing kiss from his worshipped Julia Roberts might bring  back memories of anyone's naive, tender years and momentarily make your heart ache.  And a scene in which Jerry is unable to explain why he compulsively buys copies of the same book over and over again is very poignant, indeed.  Mel Gibson put a lot of energy into what was obviously a demanding role and, as usual, Julia Roberts lights up the screen in every scene she's in.  The film might be a fantasy, but it's the sort of fantasy many of us can appreciate.","user":"astrid-3","rank":[80,93]},{"title":"Difficult to get into ... but worth the wait in the end.","rating":7,"date":"4 July 1999","review":"I found this film really hard to focus on, there was Mel Gibson playing a paranoid crazy guy, being dragged off by government/non-government 'spooks' and having some sort of weird obsession with Julia Roberts.  But as the film unfolded, and the storyline, a complex one, began to unravel it all started to make some kind of sense.  My favorite part has to be the self destruction of his apartment, that was quite imaginative.  Before I saw this i was expecting something along the lines of Lethal Weapon, being the same star, and same director.  But it was so completely different from what I thought it would be and it actually ended up being a better film as a consequence. Mel Gibson played a completely different character than what we usually see, which worked to his benefit and Julia Roberts proved with this film, that she still had star power.  Definitely worth a look.","user":"Meredith-7","rank":[40,46]},{"title":"Mel Gibson wonderful, chemistry with Julia Roberts tops","rating":10,"date":"27 December 2000","review":"The thing that stands out for me in this movie is the wonderful (and underrated) performance given by Mel Gibson.  His part calls for an uneasy balance between a paranoid psychotic and romantic leading man and he treds that fine line beautifully.  Despite all his craziness, he is totally likeable and his relationship with the Julia Roberts character is wonderfully complex and believable.  Julia Roberts also gives an excellent performance and the chemistry between the two leads is perfect.<br><br>All in all, I loved this film and didn't understand why it was so underrated by the critics.","user":"eb999","rank":[47,55]}]
