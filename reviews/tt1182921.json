[{"title":"Ninjawesome!","rating":7,"date":"18 December 2012","review":"So at one point, the leader of a cult that really has little bearing on anything in this movie proclaims, \"We control the life blood of this planet!\"<br><br>Wait, what? It's not just that it makes little sense. It makes no sense whatsoever. Not much of this movie does.<br><br>But hey, you want a tight plot that makes sense and gives you pause to think? Netflix \"Glengarry Glen ****ing Ross.\" This ain't that.<br><br>You want to see a ninja cut a man's arm off with his ninja sword and the man goes \"Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!\" while blood spurts out of his stump, then this is the movie for you.<br><br>You want to see a stacked gravure idol as a dojo master's daughter who always needs to be saved just because she's a stacked gravure idol and even though she's a ninja, too, then this is the movie for you.<br><br>You want shurikens, poison blowgun darts, a ninja flying suit, and an SUV that rolls over and blows up spectacularly for NO FREAKING REASON, then this is the movie for you.<br><br>You want to see two ninjas have swordfight on the rooftop of a skyscraper with the Empire State Building in the background and you say, \"This is the most awesomest thing ever!\" in your best Peter Griffin voice, then babe, this is the ****ing movie for you.<br><br>You want sense? Read Jane ****ing Austen.

It's lean and mean and gets right down to the point: ninjas! It's a scientific fact that ninjas are way cooler than pirates and robots combined. Even dead people know this to be true. That's why it's hard to even muster the energy to attempt to try to bag on a movie like Ninja. The script is flimsier than a leaf in a hurricane, the dialogue is spotty at best and trying to make sense of every plot detail just outs you as an unpatriotic ninja hater. What the movie does do well is show you ninjas killing the crap out of everyone on screen. Scott Adkins and Tsuyoshi Ihara have a hellacious final duel and everything leading up to it is paced faster than a one hundred yard dash. Let's be honest, you didn't have any interest in this movie for its stern position on global politics and the humane treatment of thoroughly owned ninja victims. You came here for ninja-on-ninja action. It's way better than Casper Van Dien's suckfest Mask of The Ninja and in my opinion slightly better than Ninja Assassin. It is not, however, better than Chris Lambert's The Hunted. That one is the high water mark for trashy non-Japanese ninja movies.","user":"loogenhausen","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Dudikoff never moved like that!","rating":7,"date":"24 November 2009","review":"\"Ninja\" does something that is hard to do.... it updates something from the past but still retains a nostalgic feel about it. Sometimes it felt like it was 1985 and I was a kid sitting on the living room floor eating popcorn and watching American Ninja. But then I see Scott Adkins do an amazing aerial kick and I know I'm not watching Michael Dudikoff. \"Ninja\" takes a similar formula and story from those ninja movies from the 80's and combines it with a hard hitting and acrobatic fighting style seen in today's martial arts movies. This movie was a lot of fun and if you grew up watching ninja and martial arts movies in the 80s like me, you will definitely enjoy it.","user":"ericthered01","rank":[47,58]}]
