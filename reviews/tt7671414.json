This is the worst thing I've ever seen. It doesnt even warrant a break down.","user":"danielortiz26","rank":[24,32]},{"title":"90 mins I'll never get back","rating":1,"date":"23 April 2019","review":"This has to be the worst movie ever created. The acting is beyond disgraceful, and even worse UNIVERSAL PICTURES picked it up. Shame on u universal ,I'm truly disappointed.","user":"lost-boi81","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Painful to watch","rating":2,"date":"21 April 2019","review":"Quite possibly the most cliche ridden horror movie of the century so far, which is quite a feat considering the screenplay is so underwritten. There is not a single redeemable character here, or a half developed one. Some people should never get a second chance at filmmaking, the writer/director here should top that list.","user":"haskel-72951","rank":[12,16]}]
