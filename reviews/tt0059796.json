[{"title":"Good cast, good story=good film","rating":16,"date":"16 September 1999","review":"Disney which is best known now for their animated films made a number of good movies with real actors and actresses.  This 1965 feature is one of those movies.  An excellent cast of talented actors headed up by the late Brian Keith and the beautiful Vera Miles tells the tale of a family whose dream is to create a sanctuary for wild Geese.  Certain interest groups have other ideas however for the fate of the Geese.  If you've never seen this Disney movie from the mid 60's then check it out on the Disney channel or rent it.  A young Linda Evans and Tom Skerritt also costar along with Brandon DeWilde the legendary Walter Brennan and Ed Wynn.","user":"yenlo","rank":[20,20]},{"title":"More for adults than kids","rating":2,"date":"2 April 2014","review":"During his lifetime, Walt Disney made a number of serious-minded movies for family audiences, but quite often families ignored them and favored his goofball comedies and animated movies. \"Those Calloways\" is one such movie, not doing very well at the box office. Though I personally liked the movie, I can see why not many people were attracted to it. It's a long movie for one thing, over two hours in length. And the storytelling is kind of episodic than being one strong story. Still, I found the movie to have a lot of charm. It's shot on attractive New England locations, the characters are interesting, and the various vignettes are not boring. That is, if you are a (patient) adult. Though Disney intended this movie for a family audience, I think most modern day kids would be bored stiff by this movie with its slow pace and lack of action and special effects. Too bad - kids might learn a few things along the way.","user":"Wizard-8","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"Better than some might think","rating":10,"date":"10 November 2003","review":"This movie is one of the better movies that Disney put out in the '60s. Many of the movies that they were producing in this time period were obviously family oriented, but all had a much lighter tone to them. This was a serious look at a serious time in US History, and I think they did a fantastic job with it. Overall, the performances are memorable, and the cast has stars, but is not overweighted. Some supporting roles of note are done by Ed Wynn and Walter Brennan. The music is also well scripted. Definitely worth a look.","user":"ecteon","rank":[12,13]}]
