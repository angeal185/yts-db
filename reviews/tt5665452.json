[{"title":"How to Save a Life","rating":8,"date":"11 April 2018","review":"This movie is funny, sweet, sad, happy, and uniquely pleasing, as life can be at its best. <br><br>Two thirds of the way through the film I found myself hoping the movie would have a happy ending, not just for Ned, but for Tally. They were just two people the world had passed by and forgotten; the deserved it.<br><br>It's nice to root for nice people. It's nice to see nice people get nice things in life.<br><br>You don't need a full deck to have a good hand or to lend a hand -- anyone can save lives. <br><br>It's a nice movie, well worth the time.","user":"gensbill","rank":[12,17]},{"title":"A disappointment","rating":4,"date":"14 April 2018","review":"Sun Dogs is a quirky Indie film that whilst is above average in terms of acting, direction and production standards, it just isn't very interesting. The story focuses on Ned who since the events of 9/11 has become obsessed with wanting to help In the war on terror. He wants to and tries to join the marines. Ned is mentally challenged which causes him unusual and immature behavior. He is delusional. I suppose this is the heart and soul of the movie. Watching it unfold I hovered between pity for him vs. his immaturity creating amusement. This makes for an awkward watch where to get the most out of the drama you need to admire his drive and persistence despite his disadvantage. I found the whole thing to be preposterous.\nWorst of all I don't think I could drop in a spoiler on this one as there's nothing to spoil. The story is weak and the movie ends fairly abruptly without a satisfying ending. I was drawn into viewing it by the five positive imdb reviews at the time. Unfortunately I see retrospectively that 2 of those reviewers have only ever written 1 review each which I find suspicious.\nMy rating 4/10\nNot recommended. Time is precious and there's far better movies to watch out there.","user":"Frame-By-Frame","rank":[16,28]},{"title":"heartwarming!","rating":9,"date":"11 April 2018","review":"One of those movies that makes you smile. \nGive it a go.","user":"mejiadaniel-70925","rank":[12,20]}]
