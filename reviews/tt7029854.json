[{"title":"Le manoir: Better than expected","rating":7,"date":"8 March 2019","review":"The Mansion is a French comedy horror that despite diving headfirst into the usual tropes and cliches actually manages to be fairly enjoyable.<br><br>It tells the story of 10 friends who rent out a mansion for the night to celebrate new years. But in traditional style people begin to get picked off one by one.<br><br>Comedy? Check, plenty of laughs are to be had. Sure a lot of it is \"Stoner\" humor but it works, in fact fans of Tucker &amp; Dale vs Evil (2010) may well appreciate this as it's in a very similar vein.<br><br>Horror? Check, but not a vast amount. If this was a scale it would lean heavily towards comedy but there is enough horror to justify the tag. We have an antagonist, we have a couple of jump scares, but it's still light on the horror as a whole.<br><br>I laughed out loud a fair few times, I think not only were many of the jokes great but the delivery from this mostly unknown cast was done well.<br><br>This is a fantastic example of people needing to break out of their little mainstream Hollywood bubble and see what world cinema has to offer.<br><br>Plenty of flaws but nothing crippling, an enjoyable goofy comedy horror.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Some great laughs<br><br>Decent character development<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>One needlessly grosse scene<br><br>Leave the pets alone for crying out loud<br><br>Stock scream","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Confusing at first.. but! Very candidly funny","rating":8,"date":"5 August 2018","review":"I wasn't sure if I would like it at first, cuz I felt like I couldn't tell if it was a comedy or a horror flick. But honestly this is the first time I think that a movie had equal parts of both. Go into the movie knowing that it will be randomly funny. But also have it's creepy parts","user":"dgonzalez-40797","rank":[11,14]},{"title":"Much better than rated.","rating":8,"date":"11 October 2018","review":"I am a fan of foreign language film. I love to see how they do it elsewhere. This movie was great. Funny as hell. Comedy and horror together. A group of friends with each personality type included. It could be your friends, exaggerated with hyperbole, but you will recognize the different types in there. The couple broken up with the woman moving on and the guy still clinging to hope. The stoner. The narcissist. The moody guy who's never happy. The party guy. The tough chick. You get it. The nerdy girl who feels out of place and then gets an education in the real world and she changes. Cool stuff. Nothing a good mix of mushroom/mushroom muffins cant fix.","user":"gokeymichael","rank":[4,4]}]
