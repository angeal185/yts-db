[{"title":"An amazing adaptation of an excellent novel","rating":10,"date":"10 March 2020","review":"All the elements you loved from Crane's impressive novel WE ONLY KNOW SO MUCH found their way into this charming, emotionally charged feature, adapted by the novelist herself. Funny, difficult, timely, and realistic -- an unsparing look at a family falling apart and returning to each other.","user":"literarydisco","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Depressive and Boring","rating":3,"date":"27 February 2020","review":"Drama that deals with multiple generations in a family who each struggle with their own predicaments. It's not that relatable because the broad focus means it doesn't target a particular audience. The mood through the film remains mostly lifeless and unhappy. I believe the film strives to carry some sort of overall message about the life experience. But it's hard to get inspired by the meandering and depressed plot. It's decently made and acted but the material just isn't compelling enough to suceed.","user":"franklindf","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Very real","rating":6,"date":"28 March 2020","review":"That's life and not dramatic at all. It's not as boring as I thought as just feel the story told what it suppose to tell in a nice way. Who wasn't deal with such issue in our own life. Face and conquer it.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[2,3]}]
