[{"title":"Awesome movie.","rating":10,"date":"24 March 2018","review":"Hichki - 10/10 . Must Watch.<br><br>I went to the movie theater after going through multiple mixed reviews from the so-called movie critics. \nFor those who have seen the trailer, this will be nothing new\nPlot: The main protagonist Naina Mathur has Tourette's syndrome who desperately wants to be a teacher. Even after multiple rejections, her decision to take up teaching as a profession remains firm. Finally, she gets offered, a job @ St.Nautkers but her class of 14 is full of rebels. We get glimpses of her childhood, as to how irritating it must have been to have been misunderstood and made fun of. She even shares an estranged relationship with her father. So basically, how she deals with all these hichkis is the story all about.<br><br>Its a very simple plot of underdog meets underdogs and how they excel, but to make such a predictable plot interesting and watchable is where lies the craft of cinema. The direction, screenplay, cinematography, casting all in all was top notch. From the word go the movie started connecting. Everything was expressed in a subtle way. Nothing was over the top. There were many tear-jerking moments in the movie. There was never a dull moment. Every single character was bang on.<br><br>Coming to performance, the 14 slum students(especially Aatish) were so good at their respective roles. Niraj Kabi as the other teacher was top notch, his transition in body language and dialogue delivery towards the end spoke leaps and bounds about how seasoned an actor he was. Sachin and Supriya as Naina's parents were apt. For obvious reasons, the belongs to Rani Mukerji. Rani as Naina Mathur is brilliant. She has given an outstanding performance which will guide many upcoming actors.No words to express my thoughts about how good an actor she is.<br><br>As a die-hard Rani fan, I was nervous. I was just happy seeing her after 4 long years on the silver screen. Had no big expectation from the movie. But oh boy was I taken aback. The movie was something else. It was class apart.It was just awesome. It had the right pinch of ingredients.The main thing about the movie is that there is nothing forced, The music is not loud to drive you emotionally. You are at your own free will. It doesn't try to influence you. \nThe teacher-student relationship has been portrayed so well. A student will be fortunate to have a Naina Mathur teach them. Everything was intact. You will start reminiscing. It for sure will be a nostalgic experience for many. For the 1st time in my life, I clapped once the movie got over. That was the impact it had on me.<br><br>One piece of advice to all the people out here, please comment after watching a movie. Don't mislead people with your prejudice. This movie deserves to be a hit. Only then more of such will be made. All we get to see is stupid masala flicks crossing 100 crores with ease. But movies like Hichki in spite of having a very strong content end up doing an average business, one main reason, without doubt, it has a female protagonist. Come on guys times are changing. Appreciate movie's content. Every teacher/student/parent should watch the movie. Hoping for the movie to do good business. All the best to the team of Hichki.","user":"dolphin2687","rank":[27,30]},{"title":"Ideal teacher....Not only teaches lessons from book.....But for life!!","rating":8,"date":"14 April 2018","review":"This movie teaches us,\n<ul><li>How should be a teacher?</li><li>How important is knowing your students?</li><li>How teacher can influence a students life forever</li></ul><br><br>Definitely a must watch movie for all,\nHats off to Rani Mukerji &amp; direction team!!","user":"rangrejsomnath","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"A beautiful film masquerading as an ordinary one","rating":6,"date":"30 March 2018","review":"On the first viewing, I was too distracted by the simplicity of the plot, the characters' need to pontificate all too often and the old-world Bollywood technique of emotional manipulation to tug at your heartstrings. I found it to be an average film. \nBut after a second viewing (which I was drawn to for no conceivable reason), I was moved by the story and the connection between the characters came across in a much more effective way. The teacher does not seek to impress/command to the students but be like a guide and inspire them while being \"at their level\". Don't be fooled, the film's power is in its simplicity.","user":"toolatenow112","rank":[7,7]}]
