[{"title":"Painful","rating":3,"date":"25 February 2020","review":"This movie has an identity crisis; it can't decide if it's a thriller, mystery, drama, comedy or romance! As a result, it's somewhat of a mess and difficult to sit through. It's a shame because the acting is really good; the script just can't keep up.","user":"moladdy","rank":[23,27]},{"title":"Strong acting in an okay film","rating":6,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"Both the male and female leads were superb. Very talented actors who have huge careers ahead of them. The film was okay. His character was interesting. But the way he filmed guests was a little unbelievable and didn't make sense. But I could ride with that. The story was a gentle run but with nothing of note to remember. I probably wouldn't watch it again but I will be keen to see both the actors in something new. I recommend this film for a relaxed afternoon. Oh, and I think Helen Hunt is in it. Or someone who looks a bit like her.","user":"fallyhag","rank":[26,36]},{"title":"Absolute waste of an exceptional cast","rating":3,"date":"22 February 2020","review":"This one is a head scratcher....and by head scratcher i mean after the film is over you will scratch your head wondering why anyone would sign onto this movie. To say that the story was poorly conceived would be a an understatement. The movie goes absolutely no where and ultimately you're left with a feeling of regret for how you chose to spend the last hour and a half of your life<br><br>The Good : Tye Sheridan's performance as a high functioning man with Asperger's , seeing John Leguizamo in something since John Wick Chapter 2 and a briefly topless Ana de Armas<br><br>The Bad : Everything else<br><br>TLDR: Skip this one for sure","user":"venividivintage","rank":[24,35]}]
