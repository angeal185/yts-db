[{"title":"Do not need a functioning brain to watch this (II)","rating":1,"date":"21 March 2018","review":"The distributors are Asylum. That word \"Asylum\" should be used as a warning to movie goers around the world. The acting was extremely bad, even by Asylum's standards. The \"story\" is as understandable as the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The special effects were extremely \"special\" (as \"special\" as that person everyone knows and avoids). Asylum should be taken to court for numerous rip offs of big movie productions. It beggars belief that this company is still in existence and that no movie company has sued them. This movie is so bad that I want to start up a GoFundMe page so that I can personally commence legal action to shut this company down.","user":"coivaln007","rank":[42,43]},{"title":"Wow...it went from bad, to unbearable","rating":2,"date":"18 March 2018","review":"This could very well be one of the worst movies ever made. The acting was absolutely horrible. The plot was non-existent. The special effects...well, we can't even call them special...more like, special-ed effects! I'm not kidding, this movie is a complete waste of time. You might was well just watch a candle melt - it will be more entertaining. I wouldn't watch this movie again even if someone paid me $1,000. It's THAT bad!","user":"ironbrad","rank":[31,33]},{"title":"OK.... This Is A Joke Right?","rating":1,"date":"27 March 2018","review":"I managed to watch it, but I've really no idea how.... woeful, terrible, pointless - I honestly can't express enough how bad this film really is.\nAs other reviews have said... from the 'acting' to the script, to the CGI, everything about this excuse for a movie is just wrong wrong wrong on so many levels, and should be put out of it's misery. It's not even good enough for the bargain bin!<br><br>If it was a B Movie from the early 80's, it may just have warranted a 2/10, but as it's supposed to be 2018, and obviously a rip-off of 'Pacific Rim', I honestly can't find the words to describe this complete waste of time and effort - what were you guys seriously thinking?<br><br>No idea how I made it through this - yes.. I feel tremendous shame that I actually did, if not just to warn others to avoid at all costs.<br><br>0/10","user":"Info-241-562323","rank":[15,15]}]
