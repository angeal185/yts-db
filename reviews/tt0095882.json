[{"title":"The worst of the franchise.","rating":1,"date":"16 January 2020","review":"I watched the first recently for the first time in a while, and really enjoyed it. I remember not being such a fan of this one, it's a painful, excruciating watch, it's a dismal movie. Steve Guttenberg had been the central figure, his absence really tells, and the rest of the cast struggle to make up for it, mainly because of the bad script and poor jokes. I tried to laugh, but there were no moments to merit one. Even Lassard and Harris are of form.<br><br>Even six is better. 1/10","user":"Sleepin_Dragon","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"That's enough! No more PA for me.","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2007","review":"The first \"Police Academy\" movie was good. The second one was interesting. The third and fourth were forgettable. But this one is abysmal. Note to the producers: this is suppose to be funny. There's a few scenes that merit a smile, but the movie is generally boring. Great to see Harris and Lessard, but I miss Mahoney and Sweetchuck. Thank God it's got a short running time. And thank God I got it for free at my local library. This is it for me folks, I'll stop at the 5th installment of the series and leave the rest to those who want to waste their time.

Literally. In my outrage at how awful the film was, I left the cinema early, grumbling and grasping around in the darkened auditorium. I passed a famous golfer who was sitting in my aisle, however I slipped on one of his loose golf balls and tumbled to the floor. The whole cinema audience started laughing! They were pleased that they had gained at least one laugh from their miserable experience. Such a shame that a man breaking his back in real life is funnier than Police Academy 5. I was visited by the golfer some months later, he arrived at my hospital ward. He had brought me some grapes and a copy of Police Academy 7...","user":"s-woodier","rank":[9,13]}]
