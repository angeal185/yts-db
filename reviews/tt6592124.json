[{"title":"Now I Lame Me Down....","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2018","review":"Good photography and editing, music often did not work with the scenes, motion of the doll ruined the creepy affect of the film. Wooden acting, and the action scenes in the end were pitiful. If it had been played in a theater it would have emptied the room in short order. Nice try on the film makers part but a very amateur film.","user":"gennymikel","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"Will you play with me?","rating":4,"date":"13 July 2018","review":"In 1910, Mandy is locked in a church room by some boys. She freezes to death clutching a doll which possesses her soul. We quickly switch to modern times where we see the doll come \"alive\" and kill. Then onto the next victims. <br><br>Instead of asking to be our friend, Mandy asks \"will you play with me?\". The motion of the doll is less than Gumby with it being...the doll is there, pan camera away and then the doll is creepily gone. Effective scare if you still sleep in a crib. The acting was hit and miss...mostly miss. Phoebe Torrance makes the film palatable, but not a treat.<br><br>Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"A good laugh","rating":1,"date":"9 September 2018","review":"So.. not a great movie. The timeline is hard to follow and the storyline makes very little sense. The acting is subpar. The cinematography is okay in places, but mostly rather bland. The lighting throughout is not great, obviously filmed during the day when it's supposed to be 10pm. And the doll movements.. made the whole thing fairly funny. We had a great time watching it and laughing at it, but it certainly is not a good movie.","user":"makenziew13","rank":[5,9]}]
