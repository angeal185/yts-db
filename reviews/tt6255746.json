No! Will I ever surf? Certainly not! But did I enjoy this documentary about surfing? I certainly did! The photography is just stunning. I can't imagine how many hours of footage they had to shoot to get those stunning shots. With Distance Between Dreams you just get a bit over an hour of just surfing. You follow the amazing surfing stunts from the four Walsh brothers. It's not really about the narrating voice explaining the whole surfing scene that did it to me, even though it was interesting. To me it was just about men defying the power of nature. Giant waves are really impressive to watch and here they are shot like you are riding that wave yourself, without getting wet or risking your life. So even if you never surfed before this documentary is worth a watch.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[1,2]}]
