[{"title":"\"What do you think, does family come first?\"","rating":2,"date":"2 August 2005","review":"A wonderful, little known movie. I join the others here who wonder how this jewel slipped past recognition in theaters. I was amazed when I stumbled across it- I don't even recall how.<br><br>What a joy. I remain shocked that such a good film is so unknown. The timing, the dialogue, the hilarious writing... What distribution company dropped the ball on this one? The dinner table scene at the beginning is the best ensemble five minutes or so I have ever watched. It's like a brilliant verbal volleyball game, comments popped from one character to the next, no one letting the ball drop. This family deserves each other. I, like \"Little Daniel\" was rooting for \"the Limey Chick.\" <br><br>The blending of actors is perfect. Michael J. Fox, being Michael J. Fox alone should have assured the movie's recognition...oh yeah, that's why I rented it. Phil Hartman- what a brilliant man- but enough of that. He was unique and perfect as the spearhead of the obnoxious clan.<br><br>This movie does not make the common mistake of relying on well known actors and letting the script fend for itself. The concept, writing, acting, and unusual twists are well crafted. Everyone did his job.<br><br>Except that distribution company. Does anybody have their address?","user":"annmason1","rank":[27,29]},{"title":"Extremely Underrated, Hilarious!","rating":9,"date":"10 June 2004","review":"Greedy is a film you may have passed on Showtime, or glanced at in the TV Guide and thought, \"never heard of it\". To be honest, I can't recall its stint in the theaters either. However, on the recommendation of my father, I gave it a chance.<br><br>The interaction between all of the characters is terrific. Phil Hartman gives comic brilliance, mixed with wit and sarcasm in his usual way. <br><br>This movie has a lot of laugh out loud moments for people who are into clever comedy with a slightly twisted mind. It is cemented in my comedy top 5 with Stripes, Planes Trains and Automobiles, Ferris Buellers Day Off, and Ridgemont. Highly recommended! 9/10","user":"GLRworshipper","rank":[31,34]},{"title":"Very Underrated Comedy","rating":7,"date":"7 May 2004","review":"You must see this movie if you like Phil Hartman and offbeat comedies! And if you simply don't care about popular opinion and what critics say, then you should definitely see this movie!<br><br>This film tackles a subject matter that I've never seen in a movie: inheriting money and being included in a will. Kirk Douglas plays a wealthy and eccentric business man bound to a wheelchair who says what he wants and gets whatever he asks for. Retired from his coal mining business, his days now consist of toying with his asskissing moneyhungry family who secretly are waiting for him to die, and being with his sexy live in housemaid (played by The Wonder Years' Olivia D'abo, whom I did not know was British, not to mention the daughter of Doo Wa Diddy's Manfred Mann).  Led by the hilarious and unfortunately late Phil Hartman in top form, the family take turns accomodating Douglas and verbally assaulting him in private. The movie takes a turn when they decide to call Douglas' favorite nephew, played by Michael J. Fox, who has moved away to get away from his gold digging cousins, in order to cheer up Douglas. Fox, and his wife, played by the charming Nancy Travis, are the only ones who aren't after their uncle's money. Or are they?<br><br>With many twists and an ending to die for, this movie is my pick for the most underrated comedy of the 90's. See it!","user":"enzobaker77","rank":[19,21]}]
