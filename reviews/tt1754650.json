[{"title":"So slow, bad voice acting, stiff movements of the characters, hence, it's not a good animation.","rating":1,"date":"9 October 2019","review":"Last Prince of Atlantis is one of those animations that I've stopped watching in the middle. The animation is so boring and a bit dull. Moreover, it's too slow. Terribly slow. After 20 minutes of running time, nothing much happened yet. I tried to be patient, but patience isn't my strongest suit. So, I stopped watching after some minutes later.<br><br>It's a 3D animation, so, I was kind of impressed to see it. But the animation skill is a bit low to those animations that I've watched. The way the characters move is so stiff and the voice acting is bad, especially the one who acts as Adriana. She's the worst. It's so not natural and I felt like she's acting. Thus, voice acting needs to be improved somehow.<br><br>Moreover, the characters are a bit dirty. Maybe because of the quality of the one I've got. But I feel like they are so dirty. How and why the hell did they do like that? It's kind of disgusting to see that.<br><br>So, to say it in overall, this animation cannot be compared to the other good animations. Since I didn't watch it to the end, I don't know how it ends. The story might be great, but because of the facts that I've stated in above, this animation isn't that much good. It's somehow bad. It doesn't even make it to the fine one. If I were you, I wouldn't watch this one. I would rather find the other good ones instead of this one. It's not worth to spend time and money.","user":"silvermistvio","rank":[0,0]}]
