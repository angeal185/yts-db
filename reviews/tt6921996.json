[{"title":"good to watch with the family","rating":7,"date":"21 February 2020","review":"While the 007 movie getting deep and dark minded, the Johnny English movie still be funny. And it is funny enough to not outdated by using the old school tools to cause jokes.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[37,38]},{"title":"I did not want to go","rating":9,"date":"19 September 2018","review":"I ended up at the movies because my wife, niece and daughter invited me. When they said Johnny English, I was far from excited. Turns out I ended up having a great time and a huge laugh. Would watch it again. Great mood therapy.","user":"alanavella-453-241233","rank":[193,265]},{"title":"Hilarious Movie.","rating":10,"date":"10 October 2018","review":"I enjoyed the first two Johnny English outings. Admittedly I wasnt expecting the latest adventure to be anywhere near as good due to Johnny being that bit older.\nBut he still has that inimitable magic ! To appreciate these movies, it is suggested that your brain is turned off and reality is suspended for the duration. Its all incredibly silly, an unashamed spoof of Bond films. If you can do that, then you will love this movie. I have not laughed so much in years.","user":"daviddunn-90653","rank":[148,210]}]
