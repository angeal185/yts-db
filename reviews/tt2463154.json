[{"title":"Remembering why I love Brit Marling's movies","rating":8,"date":"21 October 2015","review":"I decided to watch this film immediately I saw that Brit Marling acts in it, and certainly, I wasn't disappointed. In this movie the breathtaking beauty of this actress can be tested again, as it was in \"Another Earth\" or in \"The East\". And it's not only her gorgeous face what captivated my sight, also her performance took me into the deepest emotional side of my mind, not for crying, of course, but honestly, in every time I've seen her acting, I felt in love of her character. This film lets the viewer not only to have a nice romantic moment, such as anyone can get in any classical movie from Hollywood. Instead, its value is due to the topics that are treated on it; to be with someone that loves you is not enough, he or she has to be your biggest fan. To have someone to be with is amazing, but also its desirable if that person makes you explore your most creative parts of yourself. What would anyone prefer, happiness or greatness? If the most recognized artists' lives are read, you can find out that they weren't happy.","user":"alfredormzr","rank":[12,15]},{"title":"Great movie. Watch it","rating":8,"date":"7 October 2015","review":"I loved this movie. I think that it is very under rated. I loved the characters. Jack Houston as Liam and Brit Marling as McKenzie were complex and great together. I loved Jack Houston as a leading man. I found that i wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over. <br><br>It is a simple romantic story, but not predictable. It is not the most original story. A tortured artist. A reporter personally involved in the story. But it didn't feel old. It felt new. I liked the pace at which this story was told. It allowed me to fall in love with both characters. <br><br>I loved the music in this movie. It matched the feeling and the vibe perfectly. <br><br>I have not seen either of these actors before, but i will be looking for them both now. <br><br>Overall, i just thought it was very well done.","user":"emlohary","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"as expected from Brit Marling","rating":10,"date":"16 September 2015","review":"It a shame that there is very few reviews about this fantastic movie.<br><br>I am becoming a fan of Brit Marling as watching her works. There is always some sort of mystery behind stories that i have so far seen played by Brit Marling. This movie is not a difference. While it seems as an ordinary comedy movie. But it is not. There is some mystery behind it.<br><br>The movie makes you think. It combines different senses, those senses that you may not realize their existing. It is not a pure love story neither a Drama. <br><br>The other thing the i realize is its similarities with the titanic movie. Not the story itself, but some feelings that you get with titanic. I hope you see this too.<br><br>It is also worth noting that while the movie seems predictable, it has some lovely surprises.<br><br>Good work.","user":"Mas-87","rank":[11,19]}]
