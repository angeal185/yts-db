[{"title":"Best movie ever. recommend 100%","rating":10,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"In this journey through the struggles and trials that single father, Chris Gardner, has to take, you see the real side of hardwork and integrity. Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[45,46]},{"title":"Will Smith is Oscar-worthy, no doubt about it.","rating":9,"date":"15 December 2006","review":"Here's the deal: It's real, it's heavy, and it's inspirational, but NOT AT ALL cheesy. Don't like that? Don't see it. I won't say much else. I will say that Will Smith was shockingly good now that he's paid his dues with \"Men in Black\" and \"Bad Boys.\"<br><br>I was very happy that this film never got political and blamed Reagan for the number of \"down on their luck\" people that were shown, nor was the race card ever pulled out. It was also refreshing that Smith's character never blamed anybody for his troubles.<br><br>It's very funny at parts, but be prepared for some serious drama. In no ways is it clich√© or contrived or boring. Let's just say that's it not Oliver Stone dramatic. This truly is a must see. To say \"I laughed, I cried\" would be really lame. It is the truth, though. <br><br>We know that Scorsese's crowning achievement \"The Departed\" is going to take the cake at the Oscars, and I won't be complaining. But this movie deserves to be experienced and taken in by the masses.","user":"roachG-1","rank":[549,651]},{"title":"If You've Ever Been Poor, This Movie May Be Hard to Watch","rating":8,"date":"18 December 2006","review":"If you've ever been poor, this movie may be hard to watch. It depicts poverty in America in gut wrenchingly accurate ways. I've been as poor as Chris Gardner, and, like him, I've been poor among very rich people in the Bay Area while trying to work my way up.<br><br>Chris Gardner is a loving father and failing businessman. He is chosen for a competitive internship at Dean Witter, a stock brokerage. The internship, which offers Chris a very long shot at a better life, doesn't pay any salary. Chris has to live without a salary for six months while risking just about everything for that long shot gamble.<br><br>Chris is really smart. He can solve a Rubrik's cube in minutes. But, he's poor. Poverty, like an octopus, keeps trying to suck him down to the bottom, and make him stay there.<br><br>His car is towed. His wife walks out on him, leaving him with a five year old son. He is arrested for unpaid traffic tickets. He becomes homeless. He has to rely on a homeless shelter.<br><br>All this while, he must appear for work in the morning in a suit and tie, and be ready to charm some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the Bay Area. These people take wealth so much for granted that two of them stiff him for cab fare.<br><br>Having lived through similar experiences, I cringed throughout this movie. My stomach hurt. I winced. I cried. I hugged my knees to my chest.<br><br>The movie is very accurate, but painful to watch. I hope a lot of rich people, who think that they understand poverty, see it.<br><br>This movie will be politically controversial. First of all, it doesn't touch the race issue with a ten foot pole. For example, when Chris appears to stiff a taxi driver for fare (it was really the rich white guy who failed to pay), the taxi driver never uses the \"n\" word. In real life, I think he probably would have.<br><br>Is the movie afraid to talk about race, or does it not want to? I don't know, but I know that some will protest the movie's not shoving race in the movie goer's face. I'm not one of those people. The movie's approach to race -- treating it as almost incidental -- worked for me. As a poor white person, I can tell you that poor white people face the same obstacles Chris did.<br><br>Second, does the movie sell the message that if you work hard, you will succeed, no matter what, and does that message tell the truth about success in America? I think that the movie is open to interpretation. Some will see it as an indictment of poverty in America. The scene of carefree rich people driving past the line to get into a homeless shelter is pretty devastating. Other people will become angry because they believe that the movie's depiction of hard work leading to rewards, in some cases, is too facile. I disagree, but that's what you'll hear.<br><br>Third, is this movie meant to chastise black men who abandon their children? Chris is a role model exactly because he moves heaven and earth to be a good father to his son. This will be debated back and forth.<br><br>The movie has a big philosophical statement to make, that has been lost on many reviewers, for example, Richard Schickel in TIME.<br><br>Chris is shown running throughout the movie. Remember the title of the movie: \"The PURSUIT of Happiness.\" Chris places emphasis on \"pursuit.\" Jefferson, when he penned the Declaration of Independence, did not promise Americans happiness, but only the right to pursue it. Chris says, at one point in the movie, paraphrase, \"I am happy right now. It is a fleeting moment.\" We experience happiness in eyeblinks. The rest of the time we, like Chris, are chasing after it.","user":"Danusha_Goska","rank":[305,360]}]
