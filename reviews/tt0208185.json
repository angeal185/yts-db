[{"title":"A great, funny movie for both kids and adults","rating":10,"date":"1 March 2000","review":"I was a big fan of the original 'A Goofy Movie' and was eagerly awaiting the sequel when I saw an advertisement for it prior to Thanksgiving in 1999.<br><br>An Extremely Goofy Movie takes place Four or five years after the original and involves Goofy's son Max going off to collage and freedom. This depresses the Goof who then is fired from his job at a toy factory. In today's economy one cannot get a good job without a degree and the Goof decides to go back to collage, the same college as Max.<br><br>Max on the other hand has visions of freedom and the 'X games' dancing in his head and presumably girls and keggers as well; though he former is glossed over and the latter ignored for the sake of the small set. These dreams are rudely interrupted by the return of Goofy who, dressed in '70's clothes, immediately begins treating his boy as, well his boy.<br><br>Max must contend with both his father and a group of yuppie skum low lives known as the gammas. The gammas are all about winning at any cost and not above cheating to accomplish that.<br><br>A sub plot involves Goofy dating the school's librarian and the only other person in the world who shares Goofy's affinity for the '70s.<br><br>At its heart 'An Extremely Goofy Movie' is about how despite the fact that children grow up there is still a bond between parent and child that cannot be broken. It does this without becoming too sappy and always retains its good humor. My only complaint is that Disney did not release it to theaters first this is definitely a movie that would have worked on the big screen. Go buy it or at least rent it.","user":"czarnicky2","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Improves upon its predecessor.","rating":9,"date":"10 May 2018","review":"It is rare I feel that way, but !An Extremely Goofy Movie\" is in my opinion a sequel which improves upon its predecessor in almost every way.<br><br>Max is approximately five years older now and is heading off to college with Bobby and PJ and away from his dad Goofy. This makes Goofy really sad and takes you through lots of sentimental scenes which really make you care about him. <br><br>Later Goofy is fired from his job and must acquire a college degree to increase his chances to get a new job. From that moment on we get a tremendously entertaining ride through Goofy's time with Max at college. <br><br>If you noticed, I wrote much about Goofy. That's one of the minor problems I had with this movie. Max is not a very interesting character in here, he is more like just a college student, but the drama between him and Goofy is just as effective in this movie as in the first one. <br><br>An Extremely Goofy Movie actually has more quiet moments than its predecessor, and I am thankful of that, because the first movie some times had too many hyperactive ones if you ask me. <br><br>The college X-Games competition, as engaging as it is, made me feel a little mnipulated, because I just felt like it was shouting \"you want to go to the x-games\" to my face. It could have been more timeless just by changing the name, but if you can look past that you get a good amount of tension and exitement which keeps you wanting to see the outcome. You really want Max and his team to win. <br><br>The absence of Roxanne doesn't bother me, because while their flirt in the first movie was cute, I see it as a bolt move from Disney not to make it a \"happily ever after\"-relationship, but accepting that many youngsters don't have those kinds of relationships. <br><br>The problems I have listed are the only ones to keep it from a ten, because I feel that An Extremely Goofy Movie delivers lots of entertainment for both kids and adults.","user":"Animany94","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"A good movie. (No Spoilers)","rating":9,"date":"11 June 2016","review":"It's a good movie, I watched it on Netflix today. It wouldn't be good for fans of the first. But it would be good for Goof Troop fans. Anyways, it's a good movie Although it gets a little sad But it does have a happy ending I suggest it for all Goofy fans There is some positive messages It's not released on Blu-Ray yet but on Netflix. Enjoy the movie on Netflix then get it on DVD if you want, or if you don't like it you don't have to watch it again but it is a good movie for kids (mainly tweens) And if you like it you can watch goof troop or the first movie. Last thing, Enjoy the movie on Netfilx :D :D :D :D :D :D","user":"maddoxacox","rank":[7,7]}]
