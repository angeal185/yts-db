[{"title":"Quite possibly the worst movie ever made","rating":1,"date":"17 July 2019","review":"I made a account just to write this review. This \"movie\" has easily the worst acting in existence. It's obviously trying to be a movie like drive but the acting is so bad that the \"cool\" main character sounds like he's just playing pretend, it's like if you took a kid playing and pretending to be a assassin and made it into a movie.","user":"lucasandrew","rank":[8,14]},{"title":"Just shoot me","rating":1,"date":"22 July 2019","review":"I was skeptical after watching the trailer, but decided to give this movie a shot because rom coms are my not-so-guilty pleasure (and this popped up on my list of recommendations, which usually serves me well). I should've listened to my instincts, because now I feel like I've lost 80 minutes of my life. I really tried to give this one a \"shot\", but I'd recommend others learn from my mistake and skip this one.<br><br>If the late great Roger Ebert has his film vault up in heaven, let's just say he won't be giving this one two thumbs up.","user":"stantyee","rank":[7,12]},{"title":"Favorite indie movie so far","rating":7,"date":"9 August 2019","review":"Love Shot was a cool movie! Funny, good dialogue, and the part where the 3 dudes sat around the table was the best. Not a big fan of the romance in the movie and a couple of the lens used in shots but overall it was awesome, especially for an indie film!","user":"aytew","rank":[4,6]}]
