[{"title":"Decent - entertaining and watchable","rating":6,"date":"15 June 2019","review":"Loss Prevention is not a terrible low budget action-ish movie. I've seen far worse from the WWE studio. But it's certainly not a \"10\", either. Good shootouts, decent acting, one major continuity gaff, and acceptable writing. Except for the overuse of the \"corporate America bad\" trope. In the end, it's worth a watch.","user":"BustedHalo","rank":[2,3]},{"title":"Fun independent film!","rating":9,"date":"7 November 2018","review":"I enjoyed this independent film more than some big-budget films with star-studded casts! A bartender with plans for bigger and better things (Abisha Uhl) is working in her father's bar when the woman of her dreams walks in, and her troubles really begin. My favorite character in this film was Murphy, the bar owner, played to perfection by Al Snow. Action film fans should watch out for Vernon Wells (best known for Wez in \"The Road Warrior\" and Bennett in \"Commando.\") late in the film. Enjoy!","user":"marlobrowntx","rank":[4,13]},{"title":"its a sin....","rating":1,"date":"12 June 2019","review":"This is not a good film, so if you decide not to watch then you make a wise descision, because its a sin to make bad movies like this. it has a story, but the technical quality of the work is so bad. just check the light angles and youll understand.<br><br>when noticing that 60% of the cast is also on the crew list, then a bell starts ringing.. the grumpy old man thinks that brian is cunning us all, and therefore will get tuna instead of ham on the bread for the rest of his life, its cunningly well done mr cunningham, you stole a part of my life tonight. defnately not recommended.","user":"ops-52535","rank":[3,9]}]
