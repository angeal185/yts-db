[{"title":"Brilliantly cinematic adaptation in the grand Hollywood style","rating":10,"date":"31 October 2000","review":"I discovered this movie only recently and have watched it three times in the last two months. It's the kind of movie that rewards repeated viewings. The story, as others have commented, is moving and inspiring and way ahead of its time, dealing as it does with topics (the philosophical/spiritual quest for meaning in life, alcoholism, psychic healing, class divisions, post-war trauma, greed vs. self sacrifice) that one would expect in a movie taking place in the nineteen sixties rather than one taking place immediately following World War I.  It offers the pleasure of Hollywood glamour of a very high order with one spectacular set-piece after another. Over and over, one is amazed at the staging of scenes set at balls, restaurants, night-clubs, Paris streets, factories, etc. Many jaw-dropping, pre-steadycam long takes involve the choreography of dozens of elements, e.g. one long take outside a Paris railway station, or another crane shot in a Paris night club as the camera searches the crowd for the protagonists. Everyone involved with the film seems to be working at his or her peak, from director Goulding to composer Alfred Newman, to all the perfectly cast actors. The screenplay is filled with brilliant cinematic story-telling devices (ironic voice-overs, montage sequences, foreshadowings, symbolism (the use of water and the ocean in so many scenes)that keep a long and complex story moving so smoothly that the two-hour-plus running time is hardly noticed at all. The cinematography by someone named Arthur Miller is gorgeous with lighting effects and moving camerawork that rank in the pantheon of Hollywood's visual creations. This is a great film.","user":"kinolieber","rank":[88,101]},{"title":"a coming of age film","rating":10,"date":"5 February 2001","review":"This film, and the book on which it is based, made strong impressions on me in my youth, but even more so now that I am past middle age. A magnificent cast - Tyrone Power, Gene Tierney, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, John Payne, Herbert Marshall, help to tell the story of a man who walks \"in another man's shoes\" -- and totally to his own drummer -- after the first world war. In his quest for spirituality and goodness, he is at odds with the materialism and obsession around him. The different layers of \"The Razor's Edge\" demand attention: Larry's physical desire for Isabel, a woman it turns out he doesn't even know; Isabel's cold-heartedness and desire to possess Larry; and Larry's search for the meaning of life, while the people he loves disintegrate around him from lack of values or hope. These are all seen through the eyes of Somerset Maugham, played by Marshall. Larry's final confrontation scene with Isabel (Tierney) about Sophie (Baxter) is bone-chilling -- Power, who had a tendency to be sometimes stiff and a bit removed from his material, uses that flaw to excellent advantage as Larry Darrell. It's not a showy role, but he's wonderful, and he's reading of poetry in Sophie's room is unforgettable.<br><br>Highly recommended.","user":"blanche-2","rank":[72,84]},{"title":"Best of the best!","rating":17,"date":"17 December 2002","review":"This has got to be one of my favorite films of all.  It ranks in my books up there with PLACE IN THE SUN, REAP THE WILD WIND and THE HURRICANE.<br><br>Made in the 40s by 20th Century Fox and Producer Darryl F. Zanuck, it stars Tyrone Power as Larry Farrell, a man on a journey to find the values of life. This fascinating journey takes him all over the world until he reaches a summit in India and there he meets a Holy Man, superbly played by Cecil Humphreys, who helps him understand his questions and then sends him back to the real world where he must then take his place in life.  Based on the 1943 book of the same name, by W. Somerset Maugham, it does the story justice with the help of Lamar Trotti in transferring it to the screen.  I read the book before seeing the film and was not disappointed.  Congratulations also goes to director, Edmound Goulding for bringing the truth of the book to life.<br><br>Other noteworthy performances were delivered by the lovely Gene Tierney, as Isabel, again in Cassini dresses, and yet another co-starring Tyrone Power film; John Payne, as Gray, in a different type of role as Miss Tierney's husband, Anne Baxter, as the doomed Sophie, in her Academy Award performance, and was she excellent, Clifton Webb as Elliott Templeton, another of Webb's limp-wristed performances and another Academy Award nomination.  Herbert Marshall as Maugham himself.  Did anyone get the \"gay\" relationship between he and Templeton?  Then there's Lucile Watson, Frank Gilmore and the delightful Elsa Lanchester in supporting roles.  I liked Fritz Kortner as Kosti, the de-frocked priest Larry meets at a bar when he is working the mines.<br><br>Ray Dorey along with Alfred Newman wrote the theme song \"Mam'selle\" for the film.  This is the best of the times.  You can't get better.  Power was superb in this.  He was an underrated actor because he was such a handsome man.  Yet, his abilities as an actor were terrific.  He brought the intelligence of Maugham's writing to focus.  Miss Baxter showed you the stuff good performers are made of with her shaded performance in this film. Also watch Marshall's reactions.  His eyes are fantastic.  They way his looks go from actor to actor.  And look for the gay undertones between he and Clifton Webb as the eccentric uncle who delves in the upper crust life. Even to the extreme of having a coat of arms embroidered on his underwear. In the final minutes of the film Marshall speaks to Isabel after Larry leaves her for good, saying, \"Goodness is, after all, the greatest force in the world . . .and he's got it.\"  This speaks for the film and it's greatness.  I think Marshall should have been nominated for his underplayed performance.  He is credited with many fine roles in his career.  See this classic.  It's on VHS.  Not to be confused with the pale remake with Bill Murray.","user":"guil12","rank":[52,61]}]
