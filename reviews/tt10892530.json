[{"title":"Don't expect a pure comedy ...","rating":15,"date":"15 March 2020","review":"The drama set in a Joseon era features King Sejo, who has taken over by killing off his nephew and all of his opposition. Deok- ho and his jester-men are hired to lift the questionable king's reputation. I guess we're dealing with the first historical advertising office üòÅ.<br><br>The drama has a comedy tag. BUT it doesn't mean it's funny at that. I must admit the only scene that put smile on my face was the last one of the drama.\nThe writer isn't lucking the imagination and a lot of scenes are visually impressive and that's the biggest strength of this drama.<br><br>In conclusion: It's overall a good drama. An intriguing plot and solid acting make it worth watching. IT isn't a pure comedy that makes you laugh every single dialog. But... You might have a different opinion.
