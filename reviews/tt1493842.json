[{"title":"This movie is pathetic!","rating":1,"date":"15 February 2011","review":"This movie is sooo bad! Actually working in the office environment(an accountant), and being privy to many office meetings and know how directors think and how in general people act at work, this movie is so bad and I'm not sure I think I heard one financial word used in the movie \"Hedging\",where they said this is the hedging department. Wow! That is a big word for them. I wonder if they know what hedges are or is that beyond the brainscope? To have Tom, (Michael McMillan) say that he can save the coy by introducing a program for recycled paper! What the.......??? And the Directors love it!!!! Umm, huh? Gee, if I knew that, I would've suggested in my company. hahaha!! What a joke.<br><br>Why they had Lane (Hilary Duff) putting some sort of tangled bead curtain up around her desk and everyone still respects her and thinks she is smart and not a ditzy looney, I have serious doubts. I love to dress well, look smart but Hilary Duff's character is a shame to any person looking to enter the finance world. She is an embarrassment.<br><br>Another thing, I totally dislike about this movie is the fact that Lane wants to meet Mr Right but she is a shame to the female sex in the way that she treats men. She can't believe a man would try and be somebody else to impress a woman (so dumps Liam as he is a waiter and not a high professional star as he told her) and goes for businessman Tom (whom we can tell the relationship will last one month if that), however she has also been dating all the men in the office for a story, and date she does! She doesn't really give any of them the time of day or really show any interest in them. However, they all seem to line up to date her as she is beautiful. However, she is doing it for a story as she feels what it would be like to date an office guy as they would be committed. she is a hypocrite, user, deceitful, a fake. I'm sorry, don't expect us to respect Lane. She is a shame to all women.","user":"ysic2","rank":[19,24]},{"title":"What a horrible piece of celluloid or digital capture","rating":2,"date":"20 September 2010","review":"Wow...bad as bad can get on a ROMCOM.<br><br>I don't know how to write this without actually using a grand host of swear words to try to conjure up images of how stupid and retarded and insane this entire premise and development and production actually was.<br><br>Not a fan of many romantic comedies, this certainly has to be at the bottom of the pile.<br><br>Even for MADE FOR TELEVISION, this was on a low scale presence of pure absurdity and stupidity combined.<br><br>Oh...what some people will sit through on a rainy day, so as not to get wet leaving the house. That was me...too lazy to step outside my door and have rain fall on my head...<br><br>Well I had to suffer somehow...and to watch this only made me want to get soaked instead.<br><br>This was stupid from 2 minutes in, till the end...and hopefully I will be a touch smarter the next time something like this comes my way.","user":"vampyrecowboy","rank":[25,41]},{"title":"Ouch.","rating":1,"date":"28 February 2011","review":"First of all, let me tell you that, after using IMDb for years, I just now registered so I can post this review.<br><br>Hilary Duff is at it again... \"acting\" in a horrid movie. It's not only painfully unrealistic, but while watching you feel like you're in Hilary's cheesy fantasy. The acting is terrible, and the story is very superficial. The ending seems like they felt the need to wrap it up quickly, so it's rushed and just awful! And this isn't a romantic comedy. I love romantic comedies. This is a ridiculously embarrassing story that makes women seem conceited and men seem foolish.<br><br>Don't waste your time watching this. I can't believe I wasted mine!","user":"stonemaiden058","rank":[7,9]}]
