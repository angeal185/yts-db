[{"title":"Good Enough","rating":6,"date":"31 March 2019","review":"Hit and Run Squad had a nice idea about the plot. However, it felt like that idea got lost. I liked that the story had a main lead but a hidden lead as well. And the performances from all the actors and actresses were really good. However, some scenes were confusing and they made it difficult to understand the whole story. But, the action scenes were enjoyable as well as the car chasing scenes that were exciting and entertaining. So, six out of ten, because, even though the cinematography and the performances were good, the story felt a bit short.","user":"pennyelenabooks","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Enjoyable but...","rating":6,"date":"25 August 2019","review":"The movie is good, from the characters, scenes and chemistry. However, the background of the story is just like a typical korean action crime movie or drama. Nothing special...","user":"misyelhasanah-06139","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Surpassed My Expectation!","rating":9,"date":"8 April 2019","review":"I was imagining this plot in my mind before and while watching the movie, but there are unexpectedly lots of twists, so it was kinda refreshing to watch!\nPlus, the lead casts and supporting roles' acting were awesome!\nImmediately went to spread the words about this movie to my friends!\nGood work!","user":"pratisthitawarsa","rank":[2,2]}]
