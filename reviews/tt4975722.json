[{"title":"Simple, Painful, Outstandingly Beautiful","rating":10,"date":"1 March 2017","review":"Moonlight is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching films that I have ever seen. Many users are expressing disdain or presumed it to be dull. Yet, to see it as such misses the whole point of the film. Moonlight wasn't intended to overtly wow us or give us knowledge about something we didn't already know. Rather the film allowed us to enter and follow a life that I'm sure many have never considered living. Yes, we know some about poverty, queerness, masculinity, and Blackness individually, but to see the conflict of it all so succinctly woven together allowed the complexity of some folks lives to be seen in an unadulterated way. Moonlight wasn't supposed to give us some grandiose finale or even answers, but simply present a narrative that we often don't see. And that's what makes it so simple, painful, yet outstandingly beautiful. <br><br>It's also important to remember that just because you don't understand something, that doesn't mean it is unimportant or invalid. Just because you can't relate to the entire story doesn't mean pieces of it can't teach you something about life. Just because the narrative is one that isn't widely told, doesn't mean it should be disregarded. If you don't understand this film or find it a waste, look deep inside yourself and ask why. <br><br>10/10 would recommend.","user":"greeenchik","rank":[518,751]},{"title":"A tapestry of lyrical moments and finely wrought detail on a journey for self-identity","rating":9,"date":"18 January 2017","review":"Some films are best consumed whole while others give more joy through their fragments. For example, a holistic story with a big legacy is Brokeback Mountain (2005), the modern-day Western with two white gay cowboys as its ground-breaking heroes. Twelve years later, the remarkable film Moonlight (2016) walks into the Brokeback narrative space to echo similar themes but from the African-American experience. Rather than a big story, Moonlight is more a tapestry of lyrical moments and finely wrought detail that are best savoured piece by piece.<br><br>Unlike plot-driven stories with big dramatic events, Moonlight feels like an introspective meditation on human experience. It is framed into the three parts of a black person's search for identity: Chiron the bullied loner kid, growing into the troubled teenager, to become the self-accepting man. Along the way, his physicality transitions from vulnerability, through confusion, to defiant strength, yet at each stage he is the same kid who doesn't fit in. There are only three human anchors in his life: his unstable drug-addict mother Paul, a drug-dealing proxy father Juan, and his only friend Kevin with whom he shares his sexual awakening. He grows with few words spoken from behind a psychological shield that he carries to ease the pain of disconnectedness. The film's all-black cast takes away the focus on race; what remains is a universal lonely man on a path to gay masculinity.<br><br>The best-fit genre label for this narrative is 'coming-of-age', but this story is less about happenings and more about being and becoming. In so many scenes we are hauled in to share how Chiron physically experiences his forward propulsion. The filming style is key to its intimacy, with its close- framed detail conveying a tactile sensuality and personal connection to Chiron. The film is a swirling montage of memorable metaphors: such as Chiron's deer-like eyes reflecting terror of attacker and rescuer; a single falling tear depicting a torrent of pain; being cradled on water as a yearning for trust; his forgiving glare when Kevin betrays him; the open fingers grasping slipping sand one moment and physical pleasure the next; and his tortoise shell of heavy jewellery as a badge of machismo. Exquisite ambiguity and moral ambivalence is the colour palette of Moonlight, captured by hand-held camera-work that conveys frenzied realism and uncertainty about what is around the corner. No other recent film has such an understated narrative with such an overwhelming richness of moment and detail.<br><br>Moonlight has more in common with impressionist paintings than modern cinema. It is soft-focused and visceral. It is not about race or sexuality or masculinity, yet it takes us into those spaces to experience the film rather than just watch. It defies holistic labels and compels engagement with its fragments. You do not see this film for entertainment but to share a journey into darkness to find light.","user":"CineMuseFilms","rank":[86,141]},{"title":"Identity Takes Time to Discover","rating":10,"date":"2 November 2016","review":"To solely categorize this film as an examination of Chiron, a young  African American who has to deal with being gay is accurate but  inadequate. It wouldn't be inadequate to also categorize it as a movie  about drug abuse, school bullying, and isolation. However, if someone  were to ask me what MOONLIGHT is truly about I would say that, at it's  core, it's a film about teaching a child how to swim, feeling the sand  on your skin, and cooking a meal for an old friend.   Director Berry Jenkins is not afraid to be poetic, to guide his film  away from conventional storytelling and offer his audience something to  connect to in their own way. The way his camera roams around is  sensually magnificent; he knows when to cut to the next shot and when  to linger a few seconds longer. But above all else, his ability to add  an extra texture to each scene is awe-inspiring; it's more than just  style for the sake of style; it's essential to the movie's argument.  From the very first shot to the very last, MOONLIGHT is about as  beautiful a movie as you're likely to see this year. The colours are  rich and luminous; James Laxton's cinematography is visually immersive  leaving you stranded inside the story of the film. It moves at a  smooth, welcoming pace. The music, whether it be the classical or  hip-hop selections as well as Nicholas Britell's subtle score, is  perfect. And the performance are, wellÂ… they're the cherry on top.   It's uncanny how similar the 3 actors, who played the kid, teenage, and  adult versions of Chiron behaved and acted; you'd almost think it was  the same actor who played all three roles. Mahershala Ali and Naomie  Harris are more deserving of Oscar nominations than just about anyone  I've seen this year. They may be the standouts, but all the  performances, ranging from the children to the adults, are so raw and  powerful; a standing ovation for the casting director is in order.   But perhaps the thing about this movie that deserves the most acclaim  is its open-endedness; it's fight against straightforward  categorization and recap. MOONLIGHT so much more than a movie about  growing up gay; it's about overcoming your adversities and, despite  being a product of your environment, figuring out who you want to  become. Identity takes time to discover, and that's something anyone  can relate to.","user":"bardia-moose","rank":[309,548]}]
