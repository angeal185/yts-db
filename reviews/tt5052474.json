[{"title":"Sicario","rating":9,"date":"14 February 2020","review":"Okay, so this doesn't come close to the first movie in the series. But, it comes close enough to being close that it's much more than watchable. It's actually a very good movie. If it was a standalone movie and Sicario never happened, people would more appreciative. Del Toro is his usual badass self. The cartels and U.S. law enforcement are brutal, per the usual. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast action.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[43,44]},{"title":"I liked it and hope there is a 3rd instalment","rating":10,"date":"6 July 2019","review":"Struggling to understand the sub 6 scores.<br><br>This isn't meant to be a popcorn die hard style action flick. Instead it shows the dark and seedy sides in the cartel and Gov't conflict in both sides of the border.<br><br>Really hope there is a 3rd instalment made","user":"bsutton-23899","rank":[25,28]},{"title":"It's a worthy follow-up","rating":7,"date":"12 August 2018","review":"This is one of those action movies that it only job is to give you as real as possible experience with its beautiful cinematography. It doesn't feel as real as ''Children of Men'' and it probably won't get a Oscar but it serves its job. The movie may not be as masterful as Villeneuve's original, but it achieves to keep you on the screen. There are really good heart-pumping scenes that beautifully blended with the score in its convoluted plot. Just like in the first movie, the story gets darker and darker. It reflects real-life situations, that's why it's so dreary and compelling. All the events is a buildup to our main story. It all ties together perfectly in the end. And even though key cast member Emily Blunt no longer here, the movie stands alone as a powerful modern-day Western, thanks to the Josh Brolin, Benicio del Toro, and Taylor Sheridan who also penned the screenplay of the first movie.<br><br>I'll definitely watch this again.","user":"nothimme","rank":[312,411]}]
