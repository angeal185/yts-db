[{"title":"Atmospheric, creepy slow-burner.","rating":8,"date":"30 September 2018","review":"I tend to rate movies based on my enjoyment of them, more than the more technical values. That being said, we really liked this for the lack of clich√©d jump scares and gratuitous gore. The \"Pyewacket\" bits, though few and far between and a mere matter of seconds, were so well done, that in places it reminded me a bit of the first Insidious, and perhaps some J-horror, like The Ring/The Grudge. The modulating voice was a nice touch. Also, the pacing was a bit like Hereditary.<br><br>Don't get me wrong; this isn't going to win any major awards (like I expect Hereditary to), but I did enjoy it and Ontario was a worthy backdrop. Plus, I'm a firm believer in \"the real threat comes from the things you can't see\" .<br><br>Love Steve Peck (ha), hope he does more creepiness.","user":"boilerhogs","rank":[22,23]},{"title":"Clever and suspenseful, felt sincere","rating":9,"date":"28 October 2018","review":"We really enjoyed this and we are avid horror fans, definitely leaning firmly to suspense and story over gore and torture.<br><br>Fell short of being a classic but was a very good horror film.","user":"bengiles","rank":[23,26]},{"title":"Scary and great","rating":9,"date":"15 January 2019","review":"We loved this one! It has some scary scenes. Some of it kept me up at night and I had to sleep with the light on. Highly recommend!","user":"saphira_dragon-80270","rank":[24,28]}]
