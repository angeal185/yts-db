[{"title":"Cheesy sequel. Happy ending for everyone.","rating":6,"date":"30 September 2006","review":"Same plot... different characters... over the top fantasy plot... over acting... \"Mannequin On The Move\" is an uncalled for sequel to a popular romantic comedy. It was obvious that a sequel was on it's way but my real question is: \"why did it take 4 years to produce this sequel?\". There isn't real effort in my opinion.<br><br>Still, the movie is entertaining , pop corn entertaining. Meshach Taylor returns as well as the ultra flamboyant Hollywood. His character is probably the most likable in the movie. Not that William Ragsdale or Kristy Swanson are not good but Taylor steals the show. Talking about the lead couple, I felt that Ms. Swanson wasn't very natural in her role. She's extremely cute and had this \"girl I would like to protect\" personality but she lacks of a vibe. Ragsdale (a different kind of hero in \"Fright Night\") delivers a less usual performance as a geeky hero. It works. Terry Kiser of \"Weekend At Bernie's \" fame delivers an over the top performance but strangely enough, it works for the movie. <br><br>Ah, what the heck. Give a chance to this sequel and you might have a good time if you are into the post 80's mess. It's a cheesy movie with a happy ending. You can't go wrong.","user":"insomniac_rod","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"\"Polyester? What plant is that from?\"","rating":5,"date":"8 August 2015","review":"Sequel to Mannequin has little in common with the first movie, outside of Meshach Taylor's character Hollywood and the Jefferson Starship song played at the end. A lot of people hated the first Mannequin but I'm one of its fans. It's a movie that never fails to bring a smile to my face, despite its perceived faults. This one is not as good, for a variety of reasons, but it is watchable fluff. It recycles some elements from the first movie but goes in its own direction with the cursed necklace and all that. It's not very funny but there are some laughs here and there. The romance this time doesn't work as well due to the bland chemistry between William Ragsdale and Kristy Swanson. Despite this, both of them are cute and fun individually. Terry Kiser is amusing as the villain. Meshach Taylor aggressively steals every scene he's in. The trio of German bodybuilding guys are very lame. I assume they were put in this because Hans &amp; Franz was a thing on Saturday Night Live back then. Aside from \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\", this is a terrible soundtrack. The gagworthy \"Can't Believe My Eyes\" by Gene Miller (who?) is just one of the tacky songs in this. If you liked Mannequin, give this one a shot but keep expectations low. Oh, and be prepared for a surprising fate for one of the characters. I doubt you'll see it coming.","user":"utgard14","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"A GREAT ROMANTIC COMEDY","rating":2,"date":"2 September 2002","review":"I found this film a thrill to watch. I never intended to watch it but one day it was on and I decided to give it a go. I have not seen the original and I had not even heard of it. But when I got in to this story I found very entertaining. The characters are wonderful. Kristy Swanson is beautiful as the mannequin. Hollywood is hilarious. I also like the lead character as a lot of people, maybe myself can relate to him. After Watching it I rate it as my favourite Romantic Comedy. It is one that the whole family can enjoy. I would highly recommend it as a film worth watching.","user":"devoted_englandfan","rank":[14,21]}]
