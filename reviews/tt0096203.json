[{"title":"Sooo much better than Broadcast News","rating":9,"date":"23 February 2004","review":"This is really worth rediscovering - Turner and co really throw themselves into it and (shock) Reeve sends himself up excellently (particularly good in the 'vertigo in the lift' scene.<br><br>As revealed elsewhere, it's a remake of The Front Page - in fact right now can't think of a better way to spend a rainy afternoon than a double bill of these two in front of a nice fire :-)<br><br>So - not going to change your life - but I'll cheer you up.","user":"badmanllp","rank":[14,17]},{"title":"Great late 80's comedy","rating":10,"date":"14 July 2006","review":"This is my favorite comedy from the 1980's. I really wish this movie was out on DVD but for now I have to settle for my old VHS of it. It is a remake of the old Cary Grant \"His Gal Friday\" movie from the 1940's. Christopher Reeve, Burt Reynolds &amp; Kathleen Turner play off one another and have great chemistry together. One funny scene has Christopher Reeve in a glass elevator having a panic attack because he has a fear of heights. This movie also stars Chris Reeve's \"Superman I &amp; II\" co-star Ned Beaty as a crooked politician running for governor. All in all, this a highly fast passed, really funny comedy. I very much recommend renting this from your local video store.","user":"JohnLonce","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Very funny","rating":8,"date":"16 January 2003","review":"Updating of \"The Front Page\" to 1988. Star reporter Christy (Kathleen Turner) on the Satellite Network News is burnt out. She takes a vacation and meets big, hunky, rich Blaine (Christopher Reeve) and falls in love (only in movies...). She plans to leave work to marry Blaine, but her ex-husband and boss Sully (Burt Reynolds) is unwilling to let her go and tries to sabotage their plans any way he can.<br><br>Not as good as 1940s \"His Girl Friday\" but not as bad as the 1970s \"The Front Page\"--it really does work. It's quick, loud and never stops moving (especially at the end). It also helps that the entire cast is in full throttle--Turner, Reeve and Reynolds are relaxed, eager and full of energy--they really put across the movie. Turner and Reynolds especially are surprising--who knew they could do comedy? And Reeve kids his goody two-shoes image and his Superman character (he's afraid of heights in this one). Also Ned Beatty has quite a few funny moments as a slimy politician.<br><br>The updating from the newspaper world to cable TV occasionally doesn't work and there are some really contrived situations here and there but not enough to destroy the movie. Also quite dated--get a look at those HUGE cordless phones! Still I enjoyed this film a lot.<br><br>A bomb (sadly) in its day--this deserves rediscovery.","user":"preppy-3","rank":[13,18]}]
