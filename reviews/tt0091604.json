[{"title":"Revenge genre","rating":5,"date":"5 July 2009","review":"I played Arnie, one of the five rapists of the female lead played by Deborah Tranelli. Naked Vengeance was one of the early \"Chick Vengeance\" genre films.<br><br>Doing a rape scene was very difficult as the mood on the set is very tense, especially from the women on set. Anyone familiar with film production knows that it is a surreal atmosphere but standing around with nothing on but a jockstrap became almost natural by the end of the long night. Deborah was a real professional, detaching herself from direct contact friendly conversation. Before and after the \"rape scene\" she was friendly but she got \"into character\" during the very intense, violent, demeaning, dehumanizing sequence.<br><br>I think any woman seeing this movie would be deeply moved, emotionally and stunned by the brutality of the sequence. The entire production crew did a great professional job, though it was a long time before some of the female staff would even talk to me. It was that realistic and graphic. I never understood the horror of rape until I \"took part\" in trying to reproduce the crime in \"ReeL life\".","user":"dongordonbell","rank":[31,36]},{"title":"Good","rating":8,"date":"7 August 2005","review":"Hi, My name is Phil Morrell. I worked for Roger Corman and Cannon films 1980/1987 mostly in the art department/set construction. Naked Vengeance was my first and last experience in front of the camera. I played the killer that started the film, and was at the end. It was fun. It's nice to see my name in the credits. As I have just read the guidelines I guess I'd better give my opinion of the film. I think it is a reasonably good film considering the budget. I think it may be one of the first woman vengeance films. I'm no expert. It may be too gruesome for some. It did play on channel 13 in the early 90's although very much censored. I liked it.","user":"angrycars","rank":[21,24]},{"title":"The rape scene is incredibly realistic,","rating":10,"date":"2 June 2005","review":"The plot is great as well as the presentation of it. I could not believe the rape scene to be anything but REAL. The movie as a whole is really worth viewing and is really enjoyable with all the suspense and tension in it. I think it is a classic, and you will never forget it. Actually, I viewed it for the first time in the cinema, and I find myself looking for it on the internet 15 yrs later. I could not find it yet, but i will continue my digging. In the mean time, I encourage anyone who have a copy to make it available for others as I hate to see such a great movie be forgotten. Deborah Tarnelli was really great on this film and I think this movie had contributed a lot to her later success.","user":"hatemfouad","rank":[14,16]}]
