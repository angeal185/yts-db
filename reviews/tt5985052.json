[{"title":"Hilarious satire - one of my faves","rating":9,"date":"17 April 2020","review":"I really don't understand the low rating. This movie is genius! Its satirical humor is easily on the level of \"Scream Queens\". Honestly, there are so many iconic quotes. I've probably seen it six times now and I still laugh out loud. People who dislike this, must have no understanding of satire and hate fun.\nThe star-studded cast perfectly embody these clichéd characters and play really well off each other. (I also loved seeing Rick Kavanian again - in a role that is just perfect for him and will have you remember the times of Bully Parade). Furthermore, every straight woman, gay man (and straight man who is secure in his sexuality) will REALLY appreciate Jannis Niewöhner in a police uniform. I mean, damn...<br><br>\"High Society\" will have you in stitches with its dark and satirical humor but it still manages to have its tender moments and heartfelt scenes. You can even shed a tear, if you're in the mood.<br><br>So, star-studded cast, hilarious satire, a lot of heart, a good soundtrack,... what else could you want?\nNot to mention the production value makes you forget you're watching a German movie - and not a Hollywood production.<br><br>The only reason I'm not giving this 10 stars? There really should have been a better, more melodic song for the ending scene. Even though the main characters are in their mid-twenties, the fact that there is a narrator, combined with the way the ending is filmed, gives me a bit of a \"late 90s / early 00s teenage movie vibe\" - which I loooove. But you know what those movies always had? A banging ending song (I'm thinking \"10 things I hate about you\"). That really would have been the cherry on top.<br><br>\"High Society\" is way underrated and has stolen its way into my all-time-favorite list.","user":"belindaamrein","rank":[0,0]}]
