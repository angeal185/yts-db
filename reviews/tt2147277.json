[{"title":"Not What I Expected, but...","rating":6,"date":"11 October 2012","review":"I watched this movie, streaming, on Netflix. I had searched for independent films, and the synopsis looked interesting. Overall, I was not disappointed, but it was not exactly what I expected. The lead male roles of Paul (C. Thomas Howell, The Amazing Spiderman) and Malcolm (John-Rhys Davies, Raider of the Lost Ark) were played convincingly by both actors, but the acting of Anory Lyn as Paul's wife, Joanne, was wooden and weak. The story tells of two men from very different walks of life, who are kidnapped by human traffickers in Thailand. Paul is a doctor, who, along with his wife, has come to Thailand after the loss of their daughter. Malcolm is a wealthy, retired executive, remarried after a failed first marriage. The music is superb, as is the cinematography and direction. But, this is not your usual kidnapping movie. What it is is a religious vehicle for Christianity, which turns out to be the focal point of the story. Despite the thinly-veiled proselytizing, Escape is still an enjoyable film with a message. But, it's probably more on the level of a made-for- TV movie, than a major box office production. Rainy day? Nothing else to do? Open your mind and your soul and enjoy it.","user":"catsklgd1","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"Acting skills needed for playing Kim Jordan","rating":6,"date":"11 September 2012","review":"Anora Lyn playing Kim Jordan was not impressive. She did not convey the sense of passion and intimacy required in this role. As a doctor interacting with patients, a wife concerned about her husband and as a mother of a dead child, I did not feel the connections. There were many opportunities to immerse the viewer into the plot. The result was to defocus the viewer on the subplots of the religious elements and struggles of the captain as the main theme. This role requires the talent of a seasoned actress such as Meryl Streep. The complexity of the role was very challenging and perhaps better directing would have made a difference.","user":"artsarno","rank":[14,25]},{"title":"interesting movie","rating":7,"date":"26 April 2014","review":"This movie held my attention. I was browsing netflix looking for a decent movie for a quiet afternoon. It seems as if not too many people have seen this movie and it is worth watching. Anora Lyn was a bit lifeless at times and she could have shown some emotion as a woman just losing her child. C Thomas Howel as Paul was much better. The move opens with John Rhys Davis as Malcom being kidnapped. I thought he did a nice job of bringing out the character.<br><br>The religious aspect took me by surprise but it was not overdone. There was a nice bit of action that added to the total effect of the movie. All in all a good movie. In spite of the bland acting of Anora Lyn as Joanne.","user":"jksouth","rank":[5,7]}]
