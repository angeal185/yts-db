Spectacular achievement to have got hold of such raw footage. Recommend to all. Harrowing and compelling","user":"charlesfamleigh","rank":[8,8]},{"title":"HUMANISING ANIMALS","rating":9,"date":"26 November 2018","review":"I Really enjoyed this documentary! It started off like the spoof film \"Four Lions\". The terrorist doing his video before his \"mission\" was laughing and joking! Saying he needed to start again as people were making him laugh. It was more like a blooper reel of outtakes than a menancing message of fear! We only ever see pictures and short videos of terrorists where they look scary with their machetes and their guns! This documentary shows them in their own safe spaces messing and joking around with each other before the suicide missions. It's quite strange to see this side of it! It somewhat humanises them! They're just young guys who are very misguided! The playfulness of the documentary doesn't last too long though and before you know it you're not laughing anymore. There's some pretty grim footage of deaths but also some great footage of shootouts, a lot more up close and personal than you seem to see on the news! It's quite a simple documentary in regards to what it's about, it doesn't go too much into politics or surprisingly religion for that matter, it's more just a timeline of events. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would Definitely recommend it to fellow Docu lovers!","user":"PaulPogues","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Tense, gripping - a must-see.","rating":9,"date":"19 July 2018","review":"This is not an easygoing film, as you might imagine. Taken from archival footage from Al Qaeda we get a deep look into terrorist organisation operations in the early to mid 90s. Fascinating stuff.","user":"nicole-healing","rank":[5,5]}]
