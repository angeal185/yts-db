[{"title":"I had to watch it twice","rating":9,"date":"18 October 2008","review":"Of the hundreds of movies I've seen, quite many I watched more than once. But only a handful were so unbelievable that I had to watch them twice in a row. This is one of them.<br><br>Yes, it's a silly action comedy, with lots of plot holes and implausibilities. Yes, it's pretty childish. But I have been a child several decades ago, and still I like to watch a children's movie now and then. And I really loved this one. Not to repeat what others wrote: the scene that touched me most was the battle of the robots, where the pet from the metal box was afraid, fought, exploded.. and from its wreck emerged the little samurai army, and ultimately saved the day. A child's dream come true (as true as movies go), with toy-like actors. In a similar vein, the toy motorbikes used to escape from the \"racing tank\".. or the r/c toy cars in the predecessor.<br><br>I hereby suspend my disbelief. These films are just a jolly good show, and make this aged, aged man relive big, joyful boyish fun for some 90 minutes. On some days, this makes my day :D","user":"suchenwi","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Lots of fun!","rating":8,"date":"6 July 2000","review":"King Kong and Albert \"Baldie\" Au gets in trouble again, this time the mafia wants to avenge the death of White Glove. To do so they hire an assassin who has seen a couple of Clint Eastwood movies to many.<br><br>The movie is filled with great action sequences and lots and lots of humor. As usual in the aces series there are plenty of crazy stunts and weird stuff.<br><br>Much better than the first one.","user":"Mercur","rank":[7,11]},{"title":"The ace is gone, but still some wild fun.","rating":6,"date":"23 December 2014","review":"The first sequel to Hong Kong's Aces Go Places, it is a story about European assassin Black Gloves (Joe Dimmick), who is seeking to avenge his brother White Gloves' death against reformed criminal King Kong (Samuel Hui) and Detective Albert \"Baldy\" Au (Karl Maka). While trying to evade Black Gloves, the duo are framed for robberies by the Hong Kong Mafia, who have their own plans against King Kong and Baldy.<br><br>Like the previous movie, the plot is fast-paced and full of adventure. However, the story has more corny jokes and silly action in it, from King Kong suffering the consequences from inadvertently crashing Baldy and Supt. Ho's (Sylvia Chang) wedding to the random appearances of the mental impatient who thinks he is an FBI agent (Hark Tsui). The romantic subplot between King Kong and Juju (Ting-Huan Wang) was also silly; there is virtually no chemistry between the two.<br><br>Though the silly and wild action is in abundance, the highlight of the movie is probably the duel of the robots (between the bad guy's towering machine hunk and King Kong's group of miniature flying toy robots). They make you feel you are watching a Transformer's movie, but the special effects were actually pretty good as they used real machinery versus CGI and, while the action is over-the-top, the robot sequences are pretty fun to watch.<br><br>Sam Hui and Karl Maka (in his thick Taishan-ese accent) continue to make a hilarious duo and had great on-screen chemistry. And, Sylvia Chang continues to add on the humor with her fiery portrayal of Supt. Ho.<br><br>Overall, the movie does not surpass the original but it's worth a watch at least once.<br><br>Grade C+","user":"OllieSuave-007","rank":[2,3]}]
