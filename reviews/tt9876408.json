[{"title":"One of the best Hallmark movies!","rating":8,"date":"14 April 2019","review":"I really enjoyed this movie! I'm a fan of Andrew Walker. I think he has some of the best acting chops of the Hallmark leading men.\nGreat chemistry in the leads also made this worth watching. I could watch this again!","user":"halesdi","rank":[21,24]},{"title":"Basically \"You've Got Mail\" meets Hallmark","rating":7,"date":"15 April 2019","review":"Not exactly original but we still liked it, mainly because of the leads.<br><br>Bethany wasn't so in your face \"happy and smiling\" all of the time. Good to see.","user":"Onetrack97","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Second Hallmark movie to get a 10 from me!","rating":10,"date":"25 April 2019","review":"It's no surprise that Andrew Walker is a favorite. He always delivers, he is charming, funny, and attractive. Bethany Joy Lenz is also a favorite, I always feel she gives 100 percent into these characters, she is funny as well. If you have seen their previous Lifetime movie, It really feels like they play the same characters. Their chemistry is AMAZING add an original (never-seen) script and you have magic.<br><br>I may be a littled biased by these two but this is definitely a new favorite.","user":"MIssM19","rank":[10,11]}]
