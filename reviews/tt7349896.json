[{"title":"Soap Opera with Opioids","rating":5,"date":"11 January 2020","review":"With America seeing an opioid epidemic, movies like this are becoming more commonplace, but in this movie which is largely well done, the opioid epidemic takes a back seat to what is instead a soap opera and not a very realistic one at that. The actors are all well cast and excellent in their roles, Margarita Levieva shines in the lead with Josh Hartnett ,who BTW has an excellent singing voice. Yet the movie kind of bored me. It's as if the production hit all the right notes in set, atmosphere and casting but forgot a compelling plot and script. I didn't really feel anything for the characters . The movie needed more grit, more drama, more action. If you are a fan of any of the stars it's worth watching but overall it failed to be interesting. I would never sit through it a second time.","user":"hampersnow-28905","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"All star cast works with what they are given","rating":2,"date":"17 January 2020","review":"I had to give it a try seeing who the leads were, terrible plot. Slow agonizing story comes to an un-climactic and unrealistic finish.","user":"Ganja-Ganja","rank":[7,10]},{"title":"Not so engaging","rating":14,"date":"14 January 2020","review":"The story doesn't develop the background of the three siblings much, so I don't really feel for them at all. The story isn't so engaging either. I felt rather bored by it.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[10,16]}]
