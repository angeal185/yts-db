[{"title":"A cult classic in every sense!","rating":9,"date":"7 June 2006","review":"When you consider all the elements that have gone into this movie, it's hard to deny that it really shouldn't have worked. Spanish director Álex de la Iglesia has put together a film that fuses ideas of the apocalypse and the antichrist with heavy metal and one of the blackest streaks of humour that I've ever seen. Day of the Beast starts off with a string of blackly comic happenings, which see such things as a man crushed by a cross and a priest pushing a performer off his perch. Amazingly, the director manages to keep the laughs coming throughout, while at the same time ensuring that the apocalyptic tones aren't lost to the comedy side of the film. Personally, I didn't think that much else could be done with the idea of the antichrist - but I've been well and truly proved wrong by this totally unique horror flick! The plot follows a priest who believes that he has found a secret code of some sort, and that he has to commit evil acts in order to get an audience with Satan himself, so that he can kill the Devil's child, which he believes will be born on Christmas Eve. Aiding him in this quest is a drug-taking heavy metal fan, and the host of a paranormal TV series...<br><br>I've got to say that I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Álex de la Iglesia's films, as this guy has an absolutely great sense of humour; and even though this movie is only half a comedy, it's far funnier than many films designed only to make its audience laugh. The laughs are very dry indeed, and are guaranteed to appeal to people who appreciate jokes that are aimed at offending people. Aside from a great sense of humour and an interesting storyline, Day of the Beast also benefits from a plethora of great performances from a talented cast of Spanish actors. Álex Angulo, Armando De Razza and Santiago Segura are brilliant as the central threesome, and offset each other nicely with their defined and very different characters. While the film definitely is a comedy, it's obvious that Álex de la Iglesia is a horror fan; as the atmosphere is morbid and suspenseful, and many scenes are extremely suspenseful and well laid out. The special effects are hokey in true demonic horror style, and the light use of them ensures that they work well when used. Overall, I don't hesitate to call this a masterpiece. Day of the Beast is everything you could want from a cult horror movie and more!","user":"The_Void","rank":[43,46]},{"title":"ONE OF THE COOLEST FILMS EVER","rating":24,"date":"24 September 1999","review":"Alex de la Iglesia has got to be one of the coolest directors ever.  I liked Accion Mutante but I LOVED Day of the beast.  It is a shame this movie has not been played in america because it's one of the best movies in a long time.  It's funny...very funny if you have a weird type of humor.  It's not really bloody and gory like people have stated but some scenes have a shock value to them.  Visually Day of the Beast is wonderful it's darkley filmed and has cool production designes.  The actors for the most part do a good job only sometimes they go a little over the top.  The only thing wrong is that this movie begins to run out of steam at the end and the ending is kinda confusing and when satan appears it's a let down.  But all in all a cool movie and a good time.......if only our awards were like spain's","user":"KrowbOy","rank":[48,56]},{"title":"This film is Dark, Horrific and Comedic. It is also very visual and in the tradition of Evil Dead 2 and Re-Animator!","rating":10,"date":"26 November 1998","review":"When you hear Spanish films, Aldomovar is always brought up.  Unfortunately, films like Dia De La Bestia suffer.  This film is a treat to people who like their comedy dark and have a weird sense of humour.  The Apocalypse never looked more interesting than in this film.  Visually the film is darkly lit and the appearance of Satan changes the whole mood of the film.  Next time you see this film in a film festival, DON'T MISS IT!!!","user":"mrot","rank":[22,25]}]
