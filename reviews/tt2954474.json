[{"title":"Will definitely hold ur attention. Avoid reading too much about this film.","rating":6,"date":"29 March 2018","review":"Saw this recently on a dvd which i own.\nThe plot is about a couple who decide to make a fresh start by moving away from the city but the countryside doesnt seem to help as the wife is tormented by terrible visions.\nKevin Greutert being an editor himself, he did a mighty fine job with the editing n direction department. The film moves at a decent pace n has some solid moments of tension. The suspense is maintained throughout n the ending is satisfying.\nThe countryside setting is beautiful. There is not much gore or killings nor it is scary but the film will definitely hold your attention.\nAvoid reading too much about this film as it can spoil the mystery element. I dont know y some fellas tried to compare this with another film, especially in the trivia section. Plz dont read the trivia section. Also, a Bollywood film Phobia has copied the idea from this film.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[33,36]},{"title":"Can't understand the bad reviews...This is a Solid Movie","rating":7,"date":"25 January 2016","review":"I'm really wondering what kind of people make the reviews at IMDb? Movie scholars? The Gods of Movie Reviews? Can't anyone enjoy a movie anymore?...Visions is not an Oscar contender for sure, but it is a solid entertaining movie. My girlfriend and I enjoy it from start to end, I was not looking for some deep existential film that makes me change the way I see the world, I was just looking a movie to have a good time, and I got it.<br><br>Visions has a well-developed story, decent visual effects, good acting (Isla Fisher won't be nominated to the Oscars), and some pretty good scary scenes that makes you jump out of your seat...everything you need from a low budget horror flick. Give this movie a chance you won't be disappointed.","user":"descobarledesma","rank":[50,61]},{"title":"Intriguing and satisfying! Perfectly paced.","rating":7,"date":"21 October 2015","review":"After watching a few disappointing horror films the past couple of weeks this came as a pleasant surprise. The horror element is there but really this is more of a psychological thriller. Special mention goes to the orchestral music score which works well to set the mood throughout.<br><br>Quite a short movie at around 75 minutes yet probably to the films advantage. Red herrings are thrown in here and there, the plot twists and turns and keeps you guessing. Some of you may figure out what is going on but the reveal is not entirely obvious.<br><br>I was never bored, not once. Is the house haunted? Is she going mad? Are the neighbours stalking her? Could the husband be up to something? As the intrigue builds you feel very included searching for the answer. The ending satisfied. No gore required. No silly ridiculous twists that make no sense, just a satisfying conclusion to a very enjoyable film.<br><br>As a cinematic release this may not do very well. As a film to watch cuddled up on the sofa at home it is a first class thriller that dare I say Hitchcock would approved of.","user":"kpentlanduk","rank":[35,50]}]
