[{"title":"Political thriller","rating":7,"date":"26 September 2019","review":"The Spanish title \"Animales Sin Collar\" means iterally animals without a collar or leash, which may mean stray animals and/or free animals.<br><br>The subject of this movie (which is very loosely based on, or rather related to Ibsen's A Doll's House) is an Andalusian politician about to enter the public arena with good progressive intentions but with a large skeleton in his closet. We are given a hint at the beginning and the pieces fall in place gradually, with enough left unexplained to stimulate the viewer's imagination. I was slightly disappointed with the way the ending is treated, but this is just a question of taste.<br><br>This is the first feature film by director and scriptwriter Jota Linares. His script is clever and taut and he puts it on screen with unflagging pace; not a scene is superfluous. Acting is excellent and cinematography by Junior DÃ­az captures the feeling of the arid summer landscapes of rural Andalusia. The Spanish spoken in this movie is the colorful and musical Andalusian version. A film to recommend.","user":"hof-4","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Puzzle(d)","rating":6,"date":"18 February 2020","review":"Why would certain individuals act in a certain way and why would they even do certain things? Revenge or other feelings against certain people. We get a beginning that lays quite a bit out for us. But it is step by step that other things get revealed.<br><br>It's a thriller drama that has a few things going for it. The acting is good and the movie is decent overall. There's better movies out there, but this isn't bad at all","user":"kosmasp","rank":[0,0]}]
