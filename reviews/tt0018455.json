[{"title":"Simply the best","rating":22,"date":"22 July 2003","review":"While some film critics disagreed in the late fifties, giving the nod to Murnau's equally brilliant \"Last Laugh,\" this in my view is the crowning achievement of the German genius.  Many polls rank it as the greatest silent film ever made and many rank it very high on the all time list of great movies.<br><br>The plot is melodramatic, the acting in places heavy handed, and the action seemingly non-existent, at least in the eyes of the \"Terminator 3\" generation,yet \"Sunrise\" is so captivating a film that it can be watched over and over again and deliver the same punch every time.  In fact, like the other greats,including \"Citizen Kane,\" you can probably get something new out of \"Sunrise\" every time you watch it, no matter how many times you watch.<br><br>Murnau takes barren sets and dark, hallow rooms and turns them into treasure troves of lighting and nuance. He creates something as simple as a railway depot or a big traffic intersection and makes it a story all by itself.<br><br>\"Sunrise\" stands today as one of the most visually fascinating films ever made.  Murnau's cinematographers, Charles Rosher and Karl Struss, got an Oscar for their work and surely deserved it.  Janet Gaynor won the Best Actress award for her body of work that also included \"Seventh Heaven\" and also richly deserved the prize.  Her face expresses her inner emotions so perfectly that some of her scenes are achingly beautiful.<br><br>And the film itself received an academy award for \"Most unique and artistic production,\" an award never given out again, maybe because no picture could live up to the standard set by \"Sunrise.\"<br><br>The new DVD version being marketed on the quiet by Fox is marvelous, with a wonderfully restored print that seems just as bright today as it must have in late 1927 when the film was released.  The DVD includes an interesting commentary option by cinematographer John Baily and no film is better suited for this, since it tells its story brilliantly with pictures alone, so the commentary option is not a distraction.<br><br>One of the great tragedies of the cinema in my view is that few people alive today have seen \"Sunrise.\"  They have no idea what they are missing. <br><br>\nThis one ranks among the five best films ever made.","user":"tprofumo","rank":[132,155]},{"title":"If you only see one film this century...","rating":10,"date":"14 July 2003","review":"I finally got a hold of the 'Sunrise' DVD, which is only available in English-speaking America (for free) by buying three titles of the excellent Fox Studio Classics line and sending in proofs of purchase. I urge everyone to get this DVD either by sending your three coupons to the promotion or by dealing with someone in the province of Québec since it appears to be the only place in North America where this contest is void and one can buy it directly off the shelf.<br><br>I have heard about 'Sunrise' all my life but the closest I ever got to see a part of it was, as a quote, in Martin Scorsese's 2-DVD made-for-the-BBC lecture with illustrations 'A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies' (1995). Nobody told me the following:<br><br>It is a pioneering, overwhelming piece of cinema that still manages to move me (ME!) after I thought I had seen everything. It is a profoundly human film which made me cry for 15 minutes solid in its first part (a reconciliation scene that has to be seen to be believed). This film has more special effects than Terminator 3, all in the service of a thoroughly poetic, bucolic, pastoral, personal, contemplative, idiosyncratic, lyrical, late romantic and expressionist vision of humanity. Its love story, poignant and comic elements have inspired, in no specific order, René Clair ('Le Million'), Jean Vigo ('L'Atalante', 'Zéro de conduite'), Charlie Chaplin (all his subsequent films), Fellini ('La Strada', 'Nights of Cabiria') and even James Cameron ('Titanic').<br><br>The camera is extremely mobile (more so than in most of today's films, except maybe The Matrix) and the acting is superb. I finally understand why Janet Gaynor was such a big star and a big deal in her time. Her co-star George O'Brien would be hunk-o-rama of the month at the box office today if he was still around. Margaret Livingston (who she?) is also quite realistic as a believably enticing city girl vamp (of modest means) who tries to lure the hero away from his deserving wife.<br><br>The DVD has more extras than a Criterion issue, including a tentative reconstruction of Murnau's missing American masterpiece 'The Four Devils' (a circus love story) and the entire shooting scripts of both 'Sunrise' and 'The Four Devils'.<br><br>'Sunrise' is presented with two soundtracks: the original (mono) Movietone (i.e. optical track) anonymous composite soundtrack cobbled together from several sources (think Wagner's Siegfried Idyll) and a newly written and recorded (stereo) score with all-original themes, that closely follows the original in spirit but not in melody.<br><br>Both soundtracks try to add an intimate, poetic dimension to the film, which is subtitled 'A Song of Two Humans'. The music is an integral part of the experience as the film is conceived as a tone poem and, as such (my theory) is a kind of transcription for the masses of Schoenberg's 1900 string ensemble tone poem 'Verklärte Nacht' (Transfigured Night), a late-Romantic/early expressionist attempt to describe musically the 'truly profound and authentic' relationship between a man and a woman who have problems (the music follows a poem of the era).<br><br>Both soundtracks succeed admirably, my preference going to the new one, despite the original's polish, historical value and magnificent preservation. And that would be because, although in the silent era there was no stigma attached to accompanying silent movies with a score made up of public domain and rather recognizable pieces, as long as they fit the mood, times have changed ('2001, A Space Odyssey' notwithstanding) and this practice is more distracting than anything for a contemporary, moderately educated spectator.<br><br>Murnau had very highbrow ambitions but his film is totally clear and populist and made to reach the widest popular audience thanks to the incredible sums of money and artistry that Fox poured in the project. 20th Century Fox basically imported a genius from Germany, gave him a ton of money and told him: 'Make us a movie that will be the most prestigious ever made in this town and that will win us the first Oscar'. And that's just what he did!<br><br>Needless to say, that was a long time before Rupert Murdoch took over the Fox Corporation...","user":"benoit-3","rank":[132,159]},{"title":"The Greatest Of The Silent Films","rating":21,"date":"21 July 2004","review":"I am a big fan of the silent era, especially the German expressionist films, and I would have to say that although there are many great silent films-- Metropolis, Pandora's Box, The Wind, etc.-- this film is my favorite.  I feel that it is Murnau's greatest film.  While it does not have the social implications of his films such as \"Nosferatu\" or \"Faust,\" the cinematography, acting, and Murnau's unabashed belief in the power of love helps this film to rise above the rest.<br><br>The acting is sterling, with a 21-year-old Janet Gaynor looking incredibly similar to Drew Barrymore, and delivering a layered performance that reveals her character's strong but tenuous emotional state.  I suspect that George O'Brien wasn't exactly what Murnau wanted for his lead actor, due to the lengths that Murnau went to to extract O'Brien's performance, but credit is due the actor for a performance which was brave at times and never ego-centric.  <br><br>Murnau's use of symbolism and metaphor are suppressed compared to the standards of his other films.  In this film their use is more to augment the story rather than actually being the story under the narrative.  One example is the fish nets waving the wind as O'Brien returns home from his tryst with the dark seductress, a terrific metaphor for his entrapment and helplessness.<br><br>The story itself is one that can appeal to many audiences, as it has its fair share of melodrama, comedy, sap, and suspense.  I saw this film with my 17-year-old nephew, who is your typical disaffected digital generation teenager, and he was awful quiet during the dramatic sequences and awful loud during the comic portions.  It is amazing how I my own emotions were manipulated by the film without Murnau ever being manipulative or obvious.<br><br>The true star of this film, of course, is the cinematography.  It is simply awesome.  I have done a lot of work with old film cameras, and I have no clue how Strauss managed some of the shots he did.  Murnau was one of the first directors, if not the first, to use camera motion during a film.  This was no small feat in the days where the camera was not motorized and had to be hand-cranked.  The camera movement is amazing.  There is a shot where O'Brien moves through the swamp, with wet, muddy, and uneven ground, to meet the woman from the city, and the camera tracks along with him.  It looks like a steadicam shot!  No track could have performed this shot as it exists, and I have no explanation on how he did this other than that he must have suspended the camera from the ceiling of the studio.  Shooting a swamp scene with fog and a full moon in a studio is a feat in itself.  There are also other feats of cinematography.  There are several shots where the city is the typical cardboard cutout, there are people milling around in the street, yet the trains and trolleys are obviously models.  HOW?????  If you are able to get the DVD with the cinematography commentary, it is well worth the investment.<br><br>To the king of the silents... 10/10","user":"FlickeringLight","rank":[81,98]}]
