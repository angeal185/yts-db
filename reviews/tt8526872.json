[{"title":"Eddie Murphy is mesmerising in one of the best movies of the year.","rating":10,"date":"25 October 2019","review":"\"Dolemite is my name\" is one of my favourite movies of the year so far along with Joker and Parasite. It's largely down to the career best performance by Eddie Murphy, who is simply mesmerising as Rudy Ray Moore. He brings so much energy to this role, along with his charm and humour. Eddie has never been this funny. Most of the jokes are raunchy so it might not be for everyone but it's impossible not to fall in love with Eddie in this film. I hope he is nominated in the best actor category at Oscars. He could even win it because he is that good.<br><br>Apart from Eddie, the film is full of brilliant performances, in particularly by Wesley Snipes who matches and sometimes steals the show from Eddie. It's a true ensemble. It's a shame that this movie is not getting a wide theatrical release because let me tell you if there is one film this year which needed to be seen on the big screen it's 'Dolemite Is My Name\". A hilarious, heartfelt film which gives a really positive message to everyone who has a dream. A must-see crowd pleaser.","user":"khan6666","rank":[224,253]},{"title":"Beautifully portrayed story of grit","rating":8,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"The movie is a beautifully portrayed story of grit and having the support of a few good people around you.<br><br>The writers and Murphy showed Rudy Ray Moore as a real entertainer in that he did not care about displaying his ego to the audience - he just wanted to deliver what he knew the people enjoyed.<br><br>His friends did not always share his vision but they supported him until the end anyways. Their roles were played by actors who can project soul into the screen and were shot to make the most out of that soul.<br><br>Even the sound track was great and made watching the movie more entertaining and inspiring!","user":"sarinamanina","rank":[88,99]},{"title":"Solid 10","rating":10,"date":"26 October 2019","review":"Best Netflix original ever made.
