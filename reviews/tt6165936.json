Many people don't know how hard it is to pull off an indie film like this with only limited resources and time. Yet, even for a big budget film, it was truly very enjoyable! It is definitely worth the time and money!","user":"giamosafid","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Haunting","rating":9,"date":"24 February 2020","review":"A solid story line, splendid realistic acting by every actor in this movie, in particular by Will Brittain, who in my opinion will be a star! And great direction. In particular, the cinematography was excellent. I love the work of Magela Crosignani. The end was surprising, in the manner in which violence was portrayed. It is almost imagined and implied, but never really shown. Watched this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Well worth it. We need more movies like this.","user":"cfp-35246","rank":[2,2]}]
