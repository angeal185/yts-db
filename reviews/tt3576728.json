[{"title":"BILAL, Haven't seen anything quite like this","rating":10,"date":"14 September 2016","review":"A solid 1st attempt from a region not known for animation. Bilal gave me a tour of their history and culture without going in too deep or getting preachy. It is emotional to witness Bilal's growth and evolution as a character living in a world torn by violence and inequality. The camera work, the music and sound design were all top notch. I loved the battle! Ian Mcshane was very believable and menacing as Umayya and Adewale did a great job bringing legitimacy to Bilal's character. The rest of the acting was also very good! The imaginative take on the cities and characters worked really well with the style of the animation.<br><br>I really haven't seen anything quite like this movie. I want to watch it again!","user":"jonathan_anderson-05181","rank":[724,756]},{"title":"imaginative visual treat!","rating":10,"date":"14 September 2016","review":"Bilal is the biggest first ever animated movie created in middle east till date.Spectacular visuals and strong characterization are some of the key factors of this movie. its production of established animation studio in UAE.The efforts and top notch work standard can be easily seen on the screen.Every character in film is crafted very well.
