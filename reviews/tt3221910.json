[{"title":"Modern take on family life, debt and love","rating":9,"date":"15 February 2019","review":"As a fan of real issues portrayed in movies, where families experience the highs and lows of modern life and its challenges, I found Love &amp; Debt very engaging.<br><br>The script is well written and the actors do a fine job of drawing you into their world and their emotional journey. It is indeed true that we all now live far beyond our means, swimming in debt, and ready to dismiss or abuse those trying to collect. The most important things in life are family and happiness. Be satisfied with where you are and what you have, but keep working at it because every day presents a new possibility to ruin or success... this story shows it well.<br><br>If you are a fan of The Story of Us, Parenthood and other similar takes on the struggles of raising a family, then you should enjoy this film. Not sure why the low rating. I couldn't fault the movie (and I watch hundreds each year)!\nSit back with your partner, after the kids are asleep and enjoy the emotional rollercoaster of Love &amp; Debt.","user":"Zelnak","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"Family Love Triumphs Over Loss","rating":8,"date":"4 March 2020","review":"I was moved by this indie about a family fighting to find their way back to one another when debt splits them apart. You'll likely find the humanity reflected between the people who owe money and those going after them as interesting as I did. I found the mother daughter relationship especially touching and was particularly impressed by the teen daughter's acting skills. A good watch, I recommend it.","user":"AnikeTourse","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"So so so bad","rating":1,"date":"19 November 2019","review":"This is a terrible movie. I cant for the life of me understand why it has any positive reviews. The wife was just generally a terrible human being, she run away from her family and knocked down her husband with a car. Another thing how is spousal abuse supposed to be funny?i dont get it","user":"tawriqua","rank":[0,0]}]
