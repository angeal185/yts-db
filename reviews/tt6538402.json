[{"title":"Good Enough","rating":6,"date":"27 October 2018","review":"It's not that this movie isn't enjoyable. However, it isn't something you haven't watched before. And because of the lack of originality, I don't believe I will be able to remember this one. The concept of the two boys who meet the shy, outcast girl, was nice. The friendship bonds that were created were sweet and adorable. So, frienship vice, this movie had it right. Romance vice, however, that didn't work out well for them. The couple didn't have many moments together so that the love story be properly developed. So, weak romance, okay story and good performances : 5 out of 10.","user":"pennyelenabooks","rank":[2,2]}]
