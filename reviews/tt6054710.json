[{"title":"dull and boring","rating":3,"date":"28 May 2019","review":"Nothing much at all happens in this movie. as for his premonitions there are only about 3 in the whole film. it's not really about that. it's more about his boring day to day life. i really can't say much in favour of this movie but the acting was good. story line pathetic.","user":"incredingo-37769","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Wonderfully told coming of age film","rating":10,"date":"20 February 2019","review":"This film takes you through the journey of characters as they discover their relevance in their world, their vulnerability, humanity and sexuality. The characters in the film are vulnerable, grounded and all play an important role in bringing the story come to life. I especially loved the relationship Luke had with his mother \"Juliette Lewis\" The chemistry between Cameron and Peyton also felt very honest and the storyline left you with the feeling that all the events could actually happen. Really liked the storyline between the two friends Cameron and Grayson and the ending really gave you a feeling that something good can still come out of the most difficult of circumstances. Also loved the 90's theme as I grew up in this era and the music, scenery, wardrobe etc gave an authentic feeling of that time period.","user":"cfalcon-66048","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"Tennage drama, good acting but a bad storyline","rating":5,"date":"13 January 2019","review":"When the overall story is weak, actors could only do so much. I liked the message in the end hence 5 stars out of 10.","user":"MveBff","rank":[7,13]}]
