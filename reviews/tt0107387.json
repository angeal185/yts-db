[{"title":"funny","rating":7,"date":"13 June 2005","review":"this is one of those movies that is meant to be scary, but really is not. i just happen to love that kind of movie. it's great for sitting down and watching with a group of friends for a good laugh. they figured this out later when making more leprechaun movies and not even trying to make them scary. i love the leprechaun series. warwick davis is my hero. if you're up for a good laugh, i suggest getting a group of your friends together and watching this. you must have a good sense of humor and an open mind. if you enjoy this, watch the rest of them. they get more outrageous as they go. i don't recommend this to people who do not find joy in watching silly movies.","user":"pirateonweekends","rank":[46,53]},{"title":"Horror movie, not short on laughs!","rating":7,"date":"29 September 2006","review":"Other members of the IMDb may have rated this \"1\", and that's up to them, but I thought Leprechaun was a real fun horror movie.<br><br>I have seen the other films in this series but the first was entertaining.<br><br>Low on budget yes, but never boring and always whimsical. Warwick Davis, the small actor who plays the leprechaun, is very good in this role, as he is in all his movies. <br><br>He may be lacking in height but not talent.<br><br>A brilliant performance by him, and even Jennifer Aniston isn't that bad, and I usually find her a turn off in movies.<br><br>Humour, horror, and lots of pace. I gave it 7 out of 10.","user":"eye-sea","rank":[28,32]},{"title":"Forget about Willow!","rating":29,"date":"29 August 2005","review":"One of the most popular Horror flicks from the 90's. It's as bad as you have heard but accomplishes on the entertaining factor for B-movie lovers. If you're a Horror fan you might have not seen this one, but for sure you have at least heard of it. It's cheesy, yes but it's entertaining. At least there's some gore, and a likable villain in the style of Freedy Krueger. The plot is cheesy but easy to follow. You have the ingredients to spend 90 minutes of popcorn fun.<br><br>Now, this one could work as an actual regular PG-13 low budget Horror movie. The Slasher genre was dead by then but Leprechan remains as one of the efforts to generate life to the genre. <br><br>Watch out for a young and very, very cute Jenifer Aniston and a devilish performance by Warwick Davies.","user":"insomniac_rod","rank":[33,41]}]
