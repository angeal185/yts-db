[{"title":"Repeat viewer is captivated.","rating":8,"date":"4 November 1999","review":"I don't know why I can't stop watching this film. It certainly has its moments of high \"corn,\" although the British have never been as dedicated to the requisite happy ending as American filmmakers, which is again the case with this one. I think it's the peek into life at an English aerodrome during World War Two that keeps me coming back again and again to view this picture. In my opinion ANGELS ONE FIVE is a kind of mini war classic.","user":"FlossieD","rank":[28,34]},{"title":"Sadly no memorable quotes section.","rating":9,"date":"4 June 2005","review":"Just watched this film again, really good fun. I've recently bought a WW2 computer Flight Simulator called IL-2 and afterwards I just had to go flying and shoot down some bally Huns, Tally Ho!<br><br>Shame there are no memorable quotes listed as this film has lots. My favourite is just after the Ops bunker takes a direct hit, the roof has fallen in and there is concrete dust everywhere. People slowly start dusting themselves off, one of the WAAF's (Foster) timidly comes up to SqLdr Clinton and offers him a cup of tea.<br><br>Foster: Tea sir ? It's a bit gritty, sir... <br><br>SqLdr Clinton: (looks at the tea in amazement for 5 seconds) Foster, that's an inspiration ! Remind me to have you promoted.<br><br>Classic.","user":"chelmsfordstag","rank":[25,32]},{"title":"Bandits at twelve o'clock!","rating":9,"date":"19 February 1999","review":"Typical fare for post-war British cinema-goers - stiff upper lips versus the might of the Nazi war machine.<br><br>\nTold over a few short weeks in 1940, the plot follows Pilot Officer 'Septic' Baird (John Gregson) as a fledgling Hurricane pilot posted to an operational squadron during the Battle of Britain. 'Septic' struggles stoically in the face of his boisterous comrades, an earnest would-be girlfriend and impossible numbers of enemy raiders. The Station Commander (Jack Hawkins) puts a human face on the RAF hierarchy, burdened by the knowledge that the fate of the nation really does depend on the skill of his young pilots. 'The few' eventually grasp victory but it doesn't come cheap.<br><br>Admittedly wooden by today's standards but, through films like this, a whole generation built up their Saturday afternoon understanding of the RAF's 'finest hour'.","user":"Rob Fox","rank":[18,23]}]
