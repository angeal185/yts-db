[{"title":"Honest review from European Woman with Netflix subscription","rating":7,"date":"5 January 2019","review":"I couldn't understand the low rating and the very high reviews some people stated where unrealistic or even paid to write. Since the movie popped up on my Netflix home screen I decided to give it a go and write an honest unpaid review.\nAnd this is just my opinion. I am a woman from Europe, an entirely different culture than the African one, but since this is a movie, and I watched it, I am entitled to my opinion!\nAt first I was skeptical and I couldn't figure out what to think of it the first 30 minutes. But the acting was fine, I totally and absolutely loved the chemistry between the strong female lead and her uncle. What a character!\nThis wasn't a heavy, dramatic movie, more a light hearted fast paced flick with a lot of elements that are almost comical. Hallmark like camera and music and I liked the directing and camera. The only thing I wasn't really happy about was that the movie quite suddenly was over. It could have used like ten minutes more of even a bit longer to work things out with the possible love interest.\nConclusion: I liked it, I enjoyed myself, it was not a master piece, but a nice watch. Well done.","user":"boself","rank":[20,26]},{"title":"Outstanding quality and acting.","rating":10,"date":"30 December 2018","review":"For a first time director and two times producer of films ,nnaji is heading for greatness.
