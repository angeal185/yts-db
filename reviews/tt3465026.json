[{"title":"Plot is like a bad porno","rating":1,"date":"5 June 2018","review":"So I'm five minutes into this movie and it's like the plot line from a really bad porno. A couple moves into a new neighborhood and their new neighbors immediately come over and flirt with them. Later the woman sneaks into her neighbors backyard and sees the woman with two men and she takes pictures of them. Creepy. It gets more cliche from there on.","user":"dancing_ostrich","rank":[17,21]},{"title":"Swing right pass this one","rating":6,"date":"13 October 2017","review":"Director Sean Hoessli (primarily known for his work in Visual Effects) does a decent job bringing first time writer Amanda Lockhart's film about \"swinging\" couples in Palm Springs to life. While the story of \"should we, shouldn't we and what happens if we do\" makes sense, dialogue and delivery is weak, many scenes are overly staged, sound and lighting is unequal, the film appears more concerned with PS wardrobe and atmosphere, and female breasts and full-frontal nudity are used to make the film appealing. Tia Carrere (Wayne's World) gives a limited and basic cameo as Ms. Cherry Bomb - the Swing Party Hostess. Jason Lewis (Model, \"Sex and the City\") is rock star Lance, and is unfortunately miss-cast. Of the numerous actors who are featured here (all performing to varying believable degree), Jackson Davis (as newlywed Mark Hughes) gives the most honest of performances. Another highlight of the production is the films sexy and rhythmic music by Alf Alpha. The film is being released on Itunes and other digital formats, with little chance of making it to mainstream theaters.","user":"ccorral419","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Utter garbage","rating":1,"date":"26 April 2018","review":"I'd rather smear excrement in my eyes than watch this film again. Enough said. Utter rubbish.","user":"tonystephenson65","rank":[16,26]}]
