[{"title":"Cinderella tale with believable characters","rating":8,"date":"16 June 2019","review":"I'm not sure why the movie industry likes to adapt the Cinderella tale to music-oriented storylines, but this is probably my favorite movie of this trend.<br><br>While some characters could've been casted better, i found reactions to be pretty genuine. Additionally, this movie didnt have me facepalming over how the \"prince\" couldn't tell it was her. He was an intelligent character who could be 100% forgiven for not figuring it out sooner.<br><br>This movie also explores more than just cinderella's love and believing in her musically-inclined abilities, but also the nature of valuing relationships and of self-love with other characters.","user":"aquawave-84891","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Dubbed voices are terrible","rating":3,"date":"17 June 2019","review":"The English voice actors they used to dub this are terrible. The kind of dubbing that gives dubbing its bad reputation.<br><br>The only reason I didn't give this one star was that my 9 year old daughter enjoyed watching it.","user":"stannius-420-80208","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"It's pretty good","rating":8,"date":"26 June 2019","review":"Before you watch the movie, use the subtitles because the dubbed English is horrible. This movie is a great take on the story of Cinderella. It's has it's moments for sure -yes some of the acting is a little over the top at times- but it has good morals about not compromising who you are or your dreams for a man. Plus the soundtrack is banging too.","user":"oliviashearer","rank":[3,4]}]
