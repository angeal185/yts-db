[{"title":"Terrible, waste of time","rating":2,"date":"12 May 2013","review":"The two stars are for the slight twist (although this is revealed in the synopsis, so hardly a real shocker) to the plot. All the characters were strange and really unlikeable. I never understood why they were all still sticking around. Ridiculous and unbelievable and pointless. The reality TV jumpiness of the filming is distracting and annoying and is about as interesting and worthwhile as reality TV (i.e., not at all). I want those two interminable hours of my life back. I nearly gave up a couple times, but watched on, hoping it might redeem itself somewhere. The whole thing was cringe-worthily awkward, but I suppose that was the point. Trouble is it was also laughably implausible and boring at the same time. Could have been done so much better than it was, with some actual plotting and a different director. I felt the actors were probably quite good, but there wasn't much for them to work with. Definitely would not recommend.","user":"genevievecseh","rank":[13,23]},{"title":"Great.","rating":6,"date":"25 May 2013","review":"An interesting indie film about relationships and mental illness.<br><br>It's not a movie that really opens up in the 1st few minutes, or even the 1st hour, you really do have to stick with it to get an idea of what's going on. In the beginning it almost feels like soap story where a evil character comes in starts spreading lies about somebody and ends up having that person ostracized, and as it progress you feel somewhat more confused about what's going on, but the end puts everything into perspective. A lot of what didn't make sense early on, starts to make sense now and you have that moment of connecting the dots and seeing the full picture. <br><br>The acting is brilliant, often in movies like this the acting is mediocre or even bad, but everybody here is just great. The writing and directing too is great, all the scenes have a natural feel to them that really pulls you in. It's obvious that this was done on a really low budget and so it's really interesting to see what can be managed with so little.<br><br>The mental illness side of this was great and what really interested me in this movie, I hate movies where mental illness are wrongly represented (*cough* Silver Linings Playbook *cough*) and so it's really refreshing to see a proper portrait of personality disorders. <br><br>In short, a great indie film, but probably not something mainstream audiences will enjoy.","user":"zombiebird","rank":[6,10]},{"title":"waste of time","rating":1,"date":"21 May 2013","review":"i thought this movie would be a good one. but man, was i disappointed after watching it. actually the movie started out well. but after a while it got terrible. i almost stopped watching but continued anyway hoping something interesting might happen. but again, i was wrong. after i was done watching it, i still didn't get what this movie was about. what was it that it's trying to depict? bond between sisters? mental health? anorexia? it seems as if every character are a bunch of crazy lunatics. some are crazier that others. which is which i can't seem to tell. this movie could've gone better. as i said it started well. but there were too many twists and turns. it certainly didn't deserve the 6.5 rating.","user":"mariasquare","rank":[5,10]}]
