[{"title":"slow","rating":5,"date":"23 June 2019","review":"This film takes on some very serious issues in our sosciety, bullying, violence and focus on youth mental health issues. its a very direct and not always so good acted flick, but the principles are there, and i ended up with a large portion of empathy towards the aspergic girl.<br><br>just beware that this flick demands that you are either interested in the team, or youll need at least to be in the mood for some sad sad realities to enjoy this. the grumpy old man recommends","user":"ops-52535","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Thought provoking & moving.","rating":8,"date":"12 August 2019","review":"I am still thinking about the screening of Acceptable Damage by Fiona Whitelaw. A moving, thoughtful, challenging study on invisible disability. Authentic, inclusive storytelling which is representative of the society we live in. It effectively 'holds up a mirror' to reflect where we are failing people. Food for thought.","user":"shenagh-govan","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Excellent","rating":8,"date":"30 September 2019","review":"What a powerful film! Acceptable Damage deals with big questions about society and isn't afraid to show the complexity of a situation, particularly when looking at the background of the character Rabbit. Very moving and very funny at times too - I went through a full range of emotions while watching this.","user":"critview","rank":[2,2]}]
