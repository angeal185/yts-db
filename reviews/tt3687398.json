[{"title":"It's not that bad","rating":6,"date":"9 August 2015","review":"the problem with this picture in my opinion is Nicolas Cage ! <br><br>don't get me wrong , I don't mean his performance but the audience has a problem with him , it's like : oh this movie starring Cage , just give it 1 star !<br><br>this movie is about characters and I always liked this kind of movies , the movie takes place in 2010 , first scenes shows the aftermath of BP oil spill accident... Cage is an idealistic congress man from Louisiana called Colin Price who aspires to be nominated for the senate , he was defending the rights of fishers whose works were damaged because of the accident , and suddenly his reputation was ruined by sexual scandal with a fisherman's wife ! His wife left him , he resigned from the congress but continued his charity works to support the fishermen... Cage was not bad , he delivers a good performance for his role..<br><br>Peter Fonda as Colin Price's father , he was very good written character and his performance was very good...<br><br>Connie Nielsen as Deborah Price was not special and not bad in the same time..<br><br>Sarah Paulson as Kate Haber , I liked her role in the second half of the movie <br><br>the problem with this picture is that when you have these elements and these characters you could have done much better scenario..<br><br>sorry for my bad English..","user":"mohamadnhd","rank":[35,39]},{"title":"Thought provoking, well acted character study","rating":9,"date":"18 August 2015","review":"I don't know what the problem is with movies these days other than it seems that only fast paced, herky jerky camera work and shock value entertainment draws the masses in..... but this movie was very, very good and sadly, terribly overlooked. Maybe it was overlooked because Nic Cage isn't on the flavor of the month list anymore but it's a shame that it was totally ignored by the critics and audience both. <br><br>Cage did a wonderful job of playing a conflicted, somewhat tortured train wreck waiting to happen but good hearted politician who truly cares about the people he represents during the BP oil spill in the gulf. He delivers a truly human and well measured performance and you couldn't see the \"acting\" in his performance one iota. To me, that's a very good, if not great performance. <br><br>On a side note, I loved the music in the movie. Especially the Tom Waits song \"Picture in a Frame\".<br><br>Well done, Nicolas!","user":"LucylovesDesi","rank":[35,43]},{"title":"Important story, excellent cast","rating":9,"date":"7 August 2015","review":"I always appreciate films that juxtapose important issues with a fictional human element. The Runner successfully did that, mixing a documentary insight into the BP oil spill's effects while also remaining a character study of a corrupt politician. This film came at the right time – the spill happened 5 years ago, and people have forgotten about the trauma it caused. I hope this film reminds people of the spill's lasting effects. Nicolas Cage is a mesmerizing actor, who has done a ton of crap lately, but here he displayed that he can still act. Similar to Joe, Cage strayed away from his typical madman role, playing a vulnerable and human version of Frank Underwood (House of Cards). There are a few other good character actors in this, especially Peter Fonda. The movie runs on the short side – it's definitely worth a watch.","user":"hagurny","rank":[33,42]}]
