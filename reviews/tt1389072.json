[{"title":"Half a good movie","rating":5,"date":"10 October 2018","review":"Very much a movie of 2 halves. The first half is an interesting, funny and thoughtful look at what 'downsizing' is and its implications and seemed to set up what could have been an excellent movie. \nHowever, the second half goes off at a tangent and starts to explore something completely different - and not in a good way. The whole second half has little reference to the titular 'downsizing' concept and whole sections could have been cut out of it without affecting the movie.\nLeft me feeling disappointed as it could have been very good.","user":"Maluga20","rank":[263,306]},{"title":"Not like the trailer","rating":3,"date":"22 December 2017","review":"If you came to see this movie because of the trailer or because of curiosity of what a world would be like if you were 5 inches instead of 6 feet, then you paid for about 45 minutes. The other hour and a half is a completely different movie that has minimal to do with downsizing and is not what the trailer suggests.","user":"ParkingtonLane","rank":[717,902]},{"title":"The whole \"Down Sizing\" concept is irrelevant","rating":3,"date":"27 December 2017","review":"I just watched two bad movies seamed together at around the half hour mark. The \"Down Sizing\" movie we all saw in the trailers ended around 30 minutes into the film; it would have been nice to see where that story could have gone. I think Matt and Kristin could have made a funny film together if it stuck to what the trailers were eluding too. The second story-line, starting about half an hour in, had no relevance to the characters being small. Instead, it jumped from Matt's experimentation with drugs to Global Warming so fast that I found myself in shock that I'm suddenly watching a feature with absolutely no plot. When the end finally did come, the final scene was as empty as the entire movie.","user":"TimmyX1","rank":[384,502]}]
