[{"title":"very funny","rating":8,"date":"24 December 2013","review":"I don't understand the hate for this movie: is was just plain fun. I don't know how this movie is offensive, probably because I'm not American, so I can't comment on that. First off all: don't look for a message in this movie. I keep reading, people saying there is a message. There is NO MESSAGE here. It's just fun. It's so bad it's good. The plot didn't make any sense and that's what was funny about it.<br><br>I'm very relieved to finally see an animated movie made just for fun and without feeling the need to add an unnecessary message or plot or emotional attachment. There was only one instance where they tried to get you emotionally involved, it didn't work but it didn't disturb me either.<br><br>Very refreshing and highly recommended during the holiday season!","user":"born_naughty","rank":[30,35]},{"title":"Chicken run with Turkeys, only the Turkeys are better.","rating":8,"date":"24 January 2014","review":"Well it has been quite a while since I watched a movie that the whole family can watch, and enjoy. Most of the animated films of the last couple of years have been so totally dumbed down that they just don't have enough of that subtle stuff that keeps the adults amused as well. So this is a nice change, really. Woody Harrelson﻿ and Owen Wilson﻿ do a great job pulling off a Turkey buddy movie with Time travel. I don't know how terribly racist some people might take this movie, and I really don't care all that much. There were no Turkeys at the first Thanksgiving, but that doesn't matter either. The point of the movie is finding a place that you belong, and to never give up trying. Nothing really much else. There are some good solid chuckles in here, and the animation is really good. This one will be on repeat in your home for a while if you have the young'nses running around. So yeah I Enjoyed this one more than I had expected, and am glad I accidentally hit play. ;) I recommend this to anyone who wants a movie that they can watch with the whole family. I'd call for pizza first though cause your gonna want some.","user":"face-819-933726","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"Some folks who are either not getting this or are taking it way too seriously.","rating":7,"date":"3 November 2013","review":"\"We have a Turkey situation\"<br><br>\"How should we address it?\"<br><br>\"With cranberry sauce.\" (HA, HA, HA,HA)<br><br>This was just a fun, silly movie -- perfect for a family outing. It has no pretensions to be anything more than just a goofy, romp through \"history\". No, it doesn't contain any riotously funny scenes. No, it doesn't contain any hidden agenda. No it doesn't contain a subtext of humor aimed at the parents/adults in the audience. And no, it is not a thinly veiled attempt by Hollywood to promote a \"Vegan\" agenda. (Seriously?!?)<br><br>It's not great art. It doesn't even really try to manipulate the heart strings. <br><br>It reminded me a lot of \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" and even referenced it at one point.<br><br>It's just exactly that kind of a (again) fun, silly little movie.<br><br>Nothing more, nothing less.<br><br>Just take the kids and enjoy it.","user":"tavives","rank":[45,60]}]
