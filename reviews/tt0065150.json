[{"title":"Duke Yank and Rock Reb","rating":7,"date":"13 January 2006","review":"The Civil War is over and it's been pretty costly to both sides. John Wayne has lost nearly every man who volunteered to serve with him and is broke. Rock Hudson who was also a Colonel on the other side went broke financing a regiment of his own and the Yankee carpetbaggers are ready to take over his plantation.<br><br>Wayne leads the remainder of his men to capture and tame wild horses to sell. Hudson gets an offer from Emperor Maximilian of Mexico to bring his people and resettle there. He needs all the help he can get to prop up his unpopular government. Hudson is certainly bringing a better quality of Anglo than Burt Lancaster did in Vera Cruz.<br><br>When Wayne feels a rip off coming from some middlemen horsetraders, he settles it in the usual Duke fashion and heads to Mexico himself. There the parties of Wayne and Hudson meet and their stories are entwined from then on.<br><br>With Wayne and Hudson co-starring, The Undefeated was led by two men who between them were number one at the box office for about a dozen years combined. Wayne was coming off his Oscar winning performance in True Grit. This film was definitely guaranteed an audience.<br><br>The story is both men are decent fellows and born leaders. Each is trying to pick up the pieces of civilian life and each is the leader of a party looking to them for leadership. A healthy and mutual respect develops between them despite previous political differences.<br><br>Wayne gets a whole load of players who worked with him before for this part. As he grew older he liked to have familiar faces around him. He had the star clout to insure it as well. Ben Johnson, Bruce Cabot, Edward Faulkner, Harry Carey, Jr., are some of the Wayne film veterans here. <br><br>Dub Taylor in his only film with the Duke does a very entertaining job as McCartney the cook. Dub did so many westerns when he wasn't doing hillbillies it's amazing that his and Wayne's path crossed only once.<br><br>This was also an early film for Jan Michael Vincent who went on to a star career of his own. Two members of the Los Angeles Rams, Roman Gabriel and Merlin Olsen were in this as well. Gabriel played a surrogate son to Wayne and rival for the hand of Melissa Newman to Vincent. Merlin Olsen is also here as a Confederate aide to Hudson. Gabriel decided movies wasn't his thing, but Olsen certainly had a substantial career after football.<br><br>The Undefeated has a nice, easy and charming flow to it, just like The Comancheros. Wayne and Hudson work well together in their only joint outing. Less action than you normally have in a Wayne film, but it's mixed in well with some good comic moments.<br><br>As Duke said parodying one of his one lines from a previous hit film of his, \"Let's Take 'Em to Mexico.\" You'll like the ride.","user":"bkoganbing","rank":[37,42]},{"title":"Good enough to be likeable, likeable enough to be good","rating":7,"date":"25 September 2003","review":"The Undefeated is a pretty good Western flick. It's light-hearted (for the most part), solid entertainment. John Wayne plays a Yankee soldier who forms an unlikely friendship with a Confederate, played by Rock Hudson, very shortly after the end of the Civil War. The two are both leading men south of the border for various reasons, and as the film progresses, the two help each other, rescue each other, and share a few drinks a number of times.<br><br>That's why it's light-hearted, there's a lot of smiles from both lead actors, all the supporting cast and, I dare say, the majority of the audience. There are very few unlikeable parts to this movie. That's not to say it's outrageously good; some of the supporting cast look amateurish at times, and the music occasionally stifles the action on screen, but aside from that, it's fine. John Wayne and Rock Hudson were two of those rare actor types who can't put in a bad performance if they try, but I don't think I need to tell you that.<br><br>It's a good package. Perfect for evening viewing, I'd recommend, as I just spent a very profitable evening in front of it. Some short but sweet action scenes, some just plain sweet romance subplots and a good and happy ending makes for one satisfied viewer. Far from perfect but great all the same. *** / *****","user":"Laitue_Gonflable","rank":[31,35]},{"title":"\"The conversation sorta dried up, ma'am.\"","rating":8,"date":"11 February 2006","review":"\"The Undefeated\" is one of the finest of John Wayne's later westerns, \"True Grit\" excepted and taking into consideration that \"Big Jake\" is nothing to slouch at.<br><br>\"The Undefeated\" is the Duke's biggest large-scale epic since \"The Alamo\" a decade earlier. The battle scenes and the shots of the horse drive are stirring and impressive.<br><br>Another thing that separates this film from other post-1965 Wayne westerns (except for \"The Cowboys\") is the dialog. It's sharp, crisp, witty and often fun. <br><br>Here's a good example of that sharp, witty &amp; pointed dialogue: Duke and co-star Rock Hudson had just returned to their camp after being forced to kill a Mexican bandit leader, who, with his gang wanted Rock &amp; Duke's valuables, their horses and their women. When one of the women asks the Duke why he had to kill him, he replied matter of factly, \"The conversation sorta dried up.\" Classic stuff! <br><br>And Hugo Montenegro's memorable score is terrific - the best work I personally have heard from him. It helps perpetuate the whole notion that this is indeed an epic western.<br><br>I'm amused at some of the wanna-be Rex Reed's here, the \"I am a critic so I can't really, actually, truthfully admit that I loved something like this\" with their \"ho hum, it's passable, I guess\"; and their \"it's an okay time killer if you've got nothing better to do.\" How too, too cool. Give me a break, you elitist wanna-be's! <br><br>\"The Undefeated\" is long on length and even longer on entertainment. This is a grand western.","user":"estabansmythe","rank":[46,54]}]
