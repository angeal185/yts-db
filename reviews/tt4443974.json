[{"title":"Aux: Concept saves it, to a degree","rating":4,"date":"4 April 2019","review":"Aux otherwise known as Soldier of War is an independent British horror movie, but one which badly suffers from mediocrity and incompetence.<br><br>You see Aux is really poorly made, awfully structured, dreadful sfx, naff creature effects and a mediocre cast. They swung above their weight on the budget they had, a point I'm often making that badly needs to stop.<br><br>To make up for the lack of budget they use a time tested method, namely not showing us what we want to see and hiding the antagonist away with selective camera angles. This makes the whole thing look cheap and nasty, because it simply is.<br><br>John Rhys-Davies looks out of place here, he's simply too good for this movie. He does however have a long history of acting in such roles which raises questions, is he \"Paying back to the industry that made him\"? alike people like Robert Englund? I mean this is the man who got fired from Sliders (1995) for criticizing the scripts, I highly doubt he's impressed with the writing in all these dreadful b-movies he pops up in.<br><br>What saves it to a degree is the concept. It tells the story of an undead soldier who has risen believing that the country is under attack by the Germans, thus a bloodbath ensues. Truth be told I liked this and the more that comes out about the soldier and the entire situation it gets better.<br><br>Great ideas, poor execution.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>John Rhys-Davies<br><br>Neat concept<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Stock scream<br><br>Poor cgi<br><br>Some ropey acting","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"AUXFUL","rating":1,"date":"7 April 2018","review":"Nothing to redeem this catastrophe. The reason why extremely-low-budget British films are generally avoided and laughed at.","user":"KenAdamFan","rank":[17,32]},{"title":"Can you dig it?","rating":5,"date":"15 March 2019","review":"This was clearly made with \"Jaws\" like cinematic suspense in mind, but it has a \"Sy Fy\" made for television movie feel. Maybe over there in the U,K, that's just a trend they're turning out. The story is interesting enough to keep you watching, and the acting is television soap opera quality which isn't necessarily lacking, in any department. Worth a watch for any reason as it is also a throw back to 70's slasher films, with a modern update.","user":"lorddrewsus","rank":[3,4]}]
