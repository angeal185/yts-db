[{"title":"A Bitter and Anguished Love Story","rating":8,"date":"3 December 2010","review":"After seven years at sea, Johannes Blom (Birger Malmsten) returns to his hometown seeking out Sally (Gertrud Fridh), who is depressed and isolated in her room. Johannes recalls his life seven years ago, when he lived with his despotic and brutal father Captain Alexander Blom (Holger Löwenadler) and his abused mother Alice Blom (Anna Lindahl) in an old vessel working in salvage services. The hunchback Johannes has been rejected by his father since he was born and has survived and grown full of anger. When Alexander discovers that he will be blind in less than one year, he brings his mistress Sally to live with him on board of his ship expecting to leave Alice and travel abroad with Sally. But Johannes and Sally fall in love with each other and the hatred of Alexander for Johannes leads to the family to a tragic end.<br><br>\"Skepp Till India Land\" is the third film of master Ingmar Bergman with the story of a triangle of love among an abusive father, his abused son and his mistress. Captain Alexander Blom is one of the most despicable characters I have ever seen with his tyrannical and indifferent behavior regarding his wife and his own son. Alice Blom is an abused wife that has the only motivation of having a cottage and a pension of Alexander's employers in an after-war period (this is a 1947 film). Johannes is man without self-esteem or self-respect, abused since he was a child that reacts to his father's brutality when he is infatuated on Sally, an anguished and disillusioned showgirl that has no hopes or expectations with men. The result is a bitter and anguished love story. My vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Um Barco para a Índia\" (\"A Boat to India\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[15,17]},{"title":"One of Bergman's first films is one of his most interesting","rating":7,"date":"13 August 2001","review":"But it's not one of his best. The characterizations of the film's protagonists are inconsistent from scene to scene and some of them leave a viewer with many unanswered questions (like the mother's motivations.) Beyond that, the cinematography is pretty dowdy, particularly the exterior footage.<br><br>Still, it has elements that Bergman fans will recognize from his more famous films, and it contains sequences of despair and anguish that can haunt a viewer days later. Birger Malmsten, who plays the lead character Johannes and who will be seen in several later Bergman films, is immensely likable and compelling as the hunchback son who finally stands up to his despotic father. While many of the early Bergman films are uninteresting at almost every level (\"Port of Call,\" for instance) this one is well worth a look for the hard core Bergmaniac, if you can find it.","user":"saltsan","rank":[17,20]},{"title":"Very good early Bergman","rating":8,"date":"10 February 2013","review":"Bergman's third film, and a very good one, indeed. It fits nicely in with his other early melodramas, and has some very recognizable themes, most notably the theme of humiliation which ran throughout his filmography. Birger Malmsten stars as a sailor returning home after seven years. He meets up with his former girlfriend, Gertrud Fridh, whom he promised to marry upon his return. She's a mess. Most of the film is comprised of a flashback to the sailor's earlier life on a salvage vessel captained by his father (Holger Lowenadler). Lowenadler is a cruel man who isn't respected by his crew or his son. After a bender on land, he returns to his ship with Fridh in tow. His wife (Anna Lindahl) works on the ship, too, and Lowenadler straight up tells her that he plans to run away with Fridh in the near future. The oppressed Malmsten, closer to Fridh's age, ends up stealing her and ruining his father's plans, which throws the whole family into a spiral of humiliation and anger. Lowenadler in particular is just fantastic. This is on Youtube, although the video quality is not great.","user":"zetes","rank":[6,6]}]
