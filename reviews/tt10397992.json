[{"title":"Sad, Melancholic and oddly gripping","rating":7,"date":"10 December 2019","review":"First of all the sand painting in the opening is super, please don't miss it.\nThe story of women in a Soviet Gulag. The balance of power shifts back and forth. Who is the leader and why ?\nThe misery of the gulag is tremendous, the abuse is constant.\nThe ending could very easily be interpreted in several ways and your interpretation will tell much about yourself.\nI enjoyed it, I had some doubts but it was a fast enough pace that the misery portrayed didn't overwhelm me","user":"stillphototheater","rank":[17,27]},{"title":"Not even close....","rating":3,"date":"16 January 2020","review":"Is about a criminal (she kill her husband, an abusive one ), so she was send in a camp for criminals, NOT in Gulag (that was for political \"offences\"), a huge, huge difference. Not so good script, directing, acting and camera work; feels like a stage play.","user":"BenmoDellaDetta","rank":[4,8]},{"title":"Well written film and excellent actors","rating":7,"date":"10 January 2020","review":"Well worth watching, yet the American accents and twisted ending let it drop from a 9 to a 6 for me.","user":"nedfox-974-15680","rank":[4,8]}]
