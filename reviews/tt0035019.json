[{"title":"Reviewing the review","rating":8,"date":"20 December 2009","review":"I wish I understood how reviews are selected to be displayed as the IMDb-approved review. The current one for \"The Major and the Minor\" is a major disgrace. The movie article the little girl picks up at Penn Station is NOT \"Why I Hit Women,\" by Charles Boyer, it is \"Why I Hate Women.\" It's a joke-- obviously too subtle for some-- because Charles Boyer is of course one of the great lovers of the screen, one everyone would have known when this film was released in 1941. It's similar to when Ginger Rogers' character as a girl on the train is asked to speak Swedish for the conductors, who question her veracity. She answers, \"I want to be alone.\" Again, this joke is something every movie viewer then would have known as an allusion to Swedish film star Greta Garbo. \"The Major and the Minor\" is a marvelous film and deserves better treatment on IMDb.","user":"tobermory2-1","rank":[28,31]},{"title":"Half fare please!","rating":10,"date":"28 November 2005","review":"Billy Wilder and his excellent collaborator, Charles Brackett, knew what the movie going public of the time wanted to see. So, it's not a surprise they achieved a great hit with \"The Major and the Minor\". One has to go back to the time this film was made to realize what the creators of this comedy accomplished. This marked the first Hollywood film Mr. Wilder directed and his touch is everywhere. The movie stands the passage of time.<br><br>\"The Major and the Minor\" works because of its two stars. Ginger Rogers and Ray Milland were versatile actors who showed perfect chemistry in the film. Both do excellent work guided by the masterful hand of Billy Wilder.<br><br>Ginger Rogers' take on the little girl is fine. Of course, we, the viewers, know what is going on, but to the rest of the people she is nothing but the innocent, and young SuSu Applegate. Ray Milland, on the other hand, is proper throughout the film until the end, when the mystery is solved. Mr. Milland's timing is impeccable and he makes his Maj. Kirby a sort of absent minded \"uncle\" to the young SuSu.<br><br>Billy Wilder showed a flair for this type of comedy. He got wonderful supporting performances from Rita Johnson and the disarming Diana Lynn, as the two sisters with different viewpoints on everything. Also, the opening sequence involving the incomparable Robert Benchley shows us a lecherous man who has hired the grown up Susan for a scalp treatment, that in his mind will lead into something else. Mr. Benchley and Ms. Rogers are hilarious.<br><br>This film established Billy Wilder as a director who went far and enjoyed a long career.","user":"jotix100","rank":[38,45]},{"title":"Wilder's debut","rating":10,"date":"10 September 2001","review":"Ginger Rogers plays Susan Applegate who wants to leave New York behind and go back home to Iowa.But she doesn't have the railway fare so she disguises herself as a 12 year old girl to ride half fare.At the train she meets Major Philip Kirby (Ray Milland) who takes \"the little girl\" with him to military school.There little Susu is surrounded by all the boys because she is a knock out for a 12 year old. The Major and the Minor from 1942 is a Billy Wilder comedy with some funny moments.It's not his best work but it is much better than many comedies nowadays.Ginger Rogers is brilliant in the lead.She makes a great kid even though she doesn't seem like a kid.In 1955 they made a remake for this called You're Never Too Young with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, which was also funny.This movie is a must see for every Billy Wilder fan because this was his American debut.","user":"Petey-10","rank":[13,14]}]
