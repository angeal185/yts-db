[{"title":"Very entertaining","rating":8,"date":"17 March 2019","review":"This movie starts off in my hometown, and ends where I live so it REALLY gave it a natural feel for me since I'm familiar with all the places. The cinematography isnt great (2nd one is way better), but the scare was all too real and leaves you reeling in the end. Must follow up immediately with THOB2","user":"ashleyryan-36896","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Not a Documentary","rating":7,"date":"1 October 2018","review":"This film sets itself up like a documentary, but veers very quickly from that point. If you don't know what you're watching, you'll be in for either a treat or a surprise. For a horror film, which is what this is, it can get pretty weird. Probably one of the weirder horror films that I've seen.<br><br>The film had a slow pace to begin with, but gets slower towards the end; and the ending is really strange. Best to watch when you're fully awake so you can figure out what's going on, and best to watch with someone if you scare easily.<br><br>I was surprised when a sequel was announced.","user":"Hollywood_Yoda","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"A great horror flick to watch around Hallowe'en time for the creepy factor","rating":8,"date":"12 January 2015","review":"I scored this high because it isn't like any movie I've seen before. Its not as much as scary as it is creepy, however. In my opinion, its a movie that plays more on an individuals phobias than anything else for that kind of fear factor. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it for anyone - but you have to be into hand held camera movies like 'The Blair Witch Project' to enjoy it.<br><br>I read through the negative 'don't waste your time' comments and came across a positive one which swayed it for me, I watched it and wasn't disappointed, so hopefully you won't be either. Its original, realistic, and if you get really into it, it will certainly creep you out.","user":"helenahartell","rank":[38,52]}]
