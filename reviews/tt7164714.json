[{"title":"Awful","rating":4,"date":"5 January 2019","review":"You'll understand the meaning of second hand embarrassment if you watch this.","user":"eymenkurdoglu","rank":[7,9]},{"title":"Maz's Best Ever!","rating":10,"date":"3 August 2017","review":"I was up last night looking at \"Recently Added\" on Netflix. I noticed that there was a new stand-up by Maz Jobrani. I have seen some of his earlier shows, and my husband has been to one of his live shows. Let me tell you I did expect to laugh but I didn't think I'd have tears in my eyes! I generally enjoy stand-up comedy but this show was a non-stop belly laugh ride... to the point that I could hardly breathe at times between the laughs...<br><br>Of course there was way more than just comedy to Maz's show. I truly enjoyed it and would watch it again and again. He talks about life in present-day America as a husband, a father and an immigrant.<br><br>I found truth in this show, as well as irony, hope and of course comedy! He brings everyone together in this show, including non-immigrants.<br><br>If you have Netflix, don't miss this!","user":"persian-belle","rank":[10,15]},{"title":"unbelievably bad","rating":1,"date":"11 October 2019","review":"The show consists of 1 joke (?) trump. What we have is an Iranian immigrant who complains about the president of USA for 1 hour and 20 minutes. This immigrant, like most of the audience, live good life in USA, and yet, sit and enjoy this clown making a joke of the president of the country that gave them the possibility to sit and enjoy such shows.\nNot funny, tastless, and if this is the best that immigrant humor has to offer, no wonder that these people are here, they were probably booed out of their countries.\nI've seen stand up comedies by other foreign artists, most do comedy, not yelling and crying.\nI really think that IMDB should start from no stars at all.","user":"alon-dar1","rank":[1,1]}]
