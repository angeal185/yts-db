[{"title":"If you enjoyed the prevous two then you should dig this.","rating":7,"date":"17 February 2006","review":"Poor Death. The guy can't seem to catch a break. He's got a job to do, and now for a third time he's being kept from doing it. What's worse is he's being foiled by a bunch of high school kids! That can't be good for the ego. Within that context you can't really blame the guy for trying to finish the job. Heck, if I were Death I'd totally relish taking some of these brats out. Particularly the guy who calls himself Frankie Cheeks. Sheesh, if that guy were any more annoying then his name would most likely be Chris Kattan.<br><br>Anyway, this is a movie that's very easy to review. Did you like the first two entries in the \"Final Destination\" franchise? Do you like to watch irritating characters meet unseemly demises? If so then you'll love it. If not then save your money. I don't want to hear any complaining.<br><br>Personally, I morbidly enjoyed it. The movie starts off with a cringe-inducing roller coaster disaster, one that will likely make you think twice about setting foot in an amusement park again, and it rarely slows down for a breather. The filmmakers set out to ensure that the viewer, like a child at Neverland Ranch, is never at ease, and that goal is accomplished as each scene leaves the viewer nervously anticipating who is going to die next.<br><br>Yeah, yeah, Wendy and Kevin are desperately trying to save their peers from Death's cruel hand, but come on. We all know somebody's head is about to be turned into ground beef or somebody will be on the receiving end of a dismemberment soon. We wait ... wait ... wait ... and then BAM! Gory kill. I should probably feel guilty for laughing out loud at some of these fatalities, but since these are silly little characters that didn't die in real life I've decided not to let it weigh on my conscience.<br><br>A new element to the franchise is that clues are being left as to how the characters will die. Using her nifty digital camera, Wendy was busy taking pictures for the yearbook on that fateful night. After the accident, she begins examining the pictures and realizes that she has taken at least one picture of each survivor. A little more studying reveals that she might be able to use the photos to help the characters escape Death. Is this a case of Death playing a sadistic game with Wendy and Kevin, or is there some sort of benevolent life force that's trying to help them save their friends? The filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to decide.<br><br>This is a nice touch that keeps the viewer actively involved in the cinematic proceedings. It gives us the chance to try to interpret the clues and guess who might be Death's next victim and how they'll be violently killed. Perhaps that's not exactly an activity you want to participate in so keep it in mind before laying your money down.<br><br>One thing that really gauges whether a movie connects with its target audience is the crowd's reaction, and I have to say that \"Final Destination 3\" got the loudest, most involved reaction I've witnessed in quite a while. While the deaths were being thrown at us fast and hard, the audience was oohing and ahhing with every single one. During one particularly brutal scene a girl behind me let out a high-pitched shriek so loud that I had to turn around and make sure Chris Tucker hadn't wandered into the theater.<br><br>No one goes to see a \"Final Destination\" movie with the expectation of great acting and high brow art. They just want to be scared or freaked out. Love it or hate it, there's no denying that \"Final Destination 3\" at least forces you to have an opinion about it. It'll make you cringe, it'll make you turn your head in disgust, but at least it's original and creative enough to make you feel something other than absolute boredom like some other so-called horror movies out there COUGHwhenastrangercallsHACK.<br><br>If just one person decides not to ride a roller coaster the next time they're at an amusement park then the filmmakers have done their job.","user":"TheMovieMark","rank":[67,74]},{"title":"I thought i was in for a disappointment. I was wrong .........","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2006","review":"I'm not gonna lie to ya, i wasn't looking forward to final destination 3.Just seeing a roller coaster full of screaming people on the poster made me roll my eyes and assume that this franchise has run out of steam .<br><br>So you can imagine my surprise to find that final destination 3 is a entertaining , funny and shocking thriller that proves that horror sequels can be pretty darn good if handled properly .<br><br>Directed by james wong with style and a pace that hits the ground running ,the film is very much like a roller coaster in its self - fast,packed full of laughs and most importantly full of frights .<br><br>The film is essentially a remake of the first film only with a different cast, gorier deaths and a higher level of self awareness.But this is a rare case in which copying the original isn't a bad thing- it keeps that sense of inventiveness and wit that made the first one great. It may be a clone , but its a very good one !<br><br>Final destination 3 is gory ,homourous and clever fun that will make me think twice about my horror sequel prejudice....","user":"Merklin","rank":[160,205]},{"title":"A short review of Final Destinaiton 3!","rating":10,"date":"21 February 2006","review":"This movie is mainly about a senior named Wendy, which is played by Mary Winstead, who so happens to have a premonition that dealt with death while on the roller coaster. Through her premonition she managed to get some of the people off the roller coaster ride, but not her close friend and boyfriend. Kevin, played by the versatile actor Ryan Merriman, also a senior got off the roller coaster with Wendy and evaded their death. And so, death is such a cry baby and went off to get the people that were suppose to die in the order they sat on the roller coaster. Wendy and Kevin then set off to help and intervene with the lives of their fellow classmates and such so to prevent death from happening. Out of all the people that went off the roller coaster only three of them survived Wendy, Kevin, and Julie. Five months later they all met on a train ride and unfortunately, Wendy had another vision or premonition that they were going to well....you have just got to watch Final Destination 3 instead.&lt;3______;)","user":"dictator_ship_degree","rank":[7,7]}]
