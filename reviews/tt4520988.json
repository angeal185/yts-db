[{"title":"A big disappointment","rating":1,"date":"1 December 2019","review":"I'm 34 years old. I loved the first one. Saw it three times in theaters. Immediately bought the soundtrack afterward.<br><br>The first one had me on my toes the whole time. The story progressed smoothly. The songs had purpose. The theme of \"let it go\" was relatable.<br><br>This sequel had none of that. They stuff a contrived story down your throat - having to explain everything at each step because nothing made sense. The songs are totally forgettable and filler. There is no meaningful conflict and the climax is non-existent.<br><br>A real shame.","user":"ssmoler2","rank":[274,397]},{"title":"A Glorified, Animated Outline","rating":3,"date":"8 December 2019","review":"Your kids will love it, there's no doubt about that. There is serious talent behind the song writers and performers and animation team. The plotline itself is very well done, the issue was it's execution. For a film almost two hours long, everything was rushed. The film can only be described as an outline on paper that was made into film without the flesh between. Frozen 2 hardly gave the audience time to process one scene before we were thrown into another. Character motivations and emotions were traded for comedy relief in the form of Olaf, the sentient equivalent of \"exposition\".<br><br>This film fails to narrate how a character got to a certain point, why this and that transpired, and the motivations behind each party, however overly narrates the message of the film quite literally through Olaf exposition as mentioned above.<br><br>After being such a strong character in the first installment, Anna fell short and her emotions were conflicting (and not in the good way). Kristoff's only purpose in the film was to find a way to ask Anna a very serious question, Olaf had no other purpose or journey and while Elsa's journey was the saving grace, the film portrayed itself as if it had cut out 30 minutes of important back story and character decision making. This film lacked the emotion of the first, a sense of thrill, dread, traded in for series of beautiful visuals and fluid animation.<br><br>The score was good but not memorable. The animation was absolutely stunning. From a child's perspective, the film would be given a 10/10, but from a film review standpoint, Frozen 2 failed to deliver.","user":"phoenixnslick","rank":[158,228]},{"title":"Great animations, poor story","rating":2,"date":"22 December 2019","review":"The animations where great, the story very poor.\nIt is better to have a great story and poor animations than the other way around. The story was needlessly complicated for children and not able to catch the audience.","user":"lodewijkmdv","rank":[123,176]}]
