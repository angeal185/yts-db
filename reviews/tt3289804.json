[{"title":"Misconceived, misperceived.","rating":3,"date":"2 November 2018","review":"This movie gives me painful memories of the plethora of \"beatnick\" movies made in the '60s, which had absolutely nothing to do with reality and everything to do with Hollywood's misperception of what society was like.<br><br>The screenplay seems like it was hastily scribbled onto the back of a napkin during a lunch break. The directing makes the actors look like fourteen-year-olds trying to act \"tough.\" To paraphrase an old fiction warning, \"any similarity between this movie and reality is entirely coincidental and unintentional.\"<br><br>Eric Roberts provides the only performance worth noting in this poor excuse for entertainment, but if you look closely into his eyes, you'll notice that he seems to be thinking to himself \"WTF am I doing in this steaming pile?\"<br><br>I give it three stars because it'd look OK playing in the background on a bunch of TVs in a retail showroom, but definitely not worth viewing.","user":"Angry_Santa","rank":[4,5]}]
