[{"title":"And the award for...","rating":3,"date":"17 January 2020","review":"..the most fake reviews goes to: Epiphany<br><br>Of the current 16 reviews, 100% are first time fake reviews smh. It's pretty sad the producers didn't even have faith in their own film to resort to these phony tactics. How is this film anything close to 9's and 10's? It's not. Acting stale, the drama as cheesy as it gets, cinematography was ok, and the directing and writing was very amateurish with a story that really went no where. Sound was also off and editing needed work. The 85 min run-time felt like 3 hours with the slow pacing and dragged out story. Don't get fooled by the fake reviews like I did, this film is a generous 3/10 from me","user":"TheTopDawgCritic","rank":[41,68]},{"title":"Beautifully made small film","rating":9,"date":"20 January 2020","review":"The sisters fought to get this story made for twenty years. It's about a small fishing town in Florida steeped in Greek-lore about sponge-diving, but it's really about family and secrets and it's made with such honesty and love. Watch it. It's worth it.","user":"sninojai","rank":[12,23]},{"title":"Great Indie Film","rating":10,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"Saw this last night at a festival. What a nice movie about the beautiful town of Tarpon Springs, Florida. A family feature about what can happen when you tragically lose a member and then dealing with it for many years. The actors did a very good job showing the emotions everyone connected will go through when unforeseen events change their lives.","user":"kmanning-41194","rank":[19,46]}]
