[{"title":"Going to the dogs","rating":6,"date":"13 September 2017","review":"I liked Bitch because the story unfolds from such a simple premise: When it all gets too much for a mother of four, she takes herself out of the equation. We don't know whether she is making a conscious choice or suffering from a rare disease of the mind. All we know is that her workaholic husband now has to do without her. It doesn't go well, at least not initially. Bitch is not the world's deepest movie, but it's an entertaining lesson about the effort it takes to keep a family together.","user":"richard_sleboe","rank":[23,32]},{"title":"Strange choices","rating":6,"date":"22 May 2017","review":"For a low budget indie film, it's not terrible.<br><br>It looks nice, considering its budget.<br><br>What is readily apparent, is that it's trying to be different just to be different.<br><br>It is bizarre, but not in an interesting way.<br><br>The pacing is not exactly great, and the writing seems random.","user":"themoovees","rank":[20,29]},{"title":"Dogs Doo Of A Movie","rating":3,"date":"27 December 2017","review":"Written , directed and produced by Palka and starring her boyfriend Jason Ritter and I think she over-reached herself.<br><br>Could have been interesting but was just one long borefest.\nSure we can all appreciate the theme but it wasnt enough to carry a movie - Maybe a 15 minute short but not a movie.<br><br>Music was awful.\nDialogue pitiful.\nActing was ok!\nFull of feminist tropes and cliches.\nI did like the Video / poster but that is about it!\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!!<br><br>There are worse films like \"THE BAD BATCH\" with Keanu Reeves so it hasnt attained the unholy p1sspot of god awful movie making that that disaster has!","user":"omendata","rank":[13,19]}]
