Actually ended up really enjoying it, it was cheesy fun, with some good action and fights, and some enjoyable characters. Worth a few hours of your time for some evening entertainment!","user":"DennyCFC","rank":[26,29]},{"title":"Great watch","rating":10,"date":"21 December 2018","review":"Watched this film with my partner last night, we both really enjoyed it, so different to anything we have seen before!
