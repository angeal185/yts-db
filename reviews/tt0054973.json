[{"title":"Terry-Thomas' Bedouin lifestyle doesn't please wife Janette Scott","rating":5,"date":"19 August 2014","review":"Terry-Thomas plays a writer whose editor sends him off on adventures to inspire his books. An effort about his experience of being lost in the desert and adopted by a Bedouin tribe is rejected, however, but not before he's adopted the lifestyle - and the dress - of the tribe; much to the distaste of his wife (Janette Scott). The couple end up splitting their home and their responsibilities in halves which leads to comic situations that, despite an excellent supporting cast that includes several 'Carry On' regulars, never quite manages to achieve the levels one might hope for. Not at all bad, but leaves a distinct feeling that it should have been better.","user":"michaelt-culligan","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Goes off the Rails","rating":4,"date":"3 March 2019","review":"This starts off well and is reasonably amusing,however after about 30 minutes it seems to literally loose the plot and spiral off into sub plots.To add to this there is an extremely irritating young boy who is clearly reacting to directions given live off camera,plus a rather inept and unintelligible French actress who appeared in a couple of films in the UK for some unknown reason.Disappointing.","user":"malcolmgsw","rank":[1,4]}]
