[{"title":"About the music","rating":9,"date":"5 December 2007","review":"As far as I can recall, Balanchine's alterations to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows:<br><br>1) The final section of the Grossvatertanz (a traditional tune played at the end of a party) is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is over.<br><br>2) A violin solo, written for but eliminated from Tchaikovsky's score for The Sleeping Beauty, is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing Christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafter.<br><br>3) The solo for the Sugar Plum Fairy's cavalier is eliminated.<br><br>It seems to me the accusation that Balanchine has somehow desecrated Tchaikovsky's great score is misplaced.","user":"The_Naked_Librarian","rank":[10,12]},{"title":"Beautiful....","rating":22,"date":"22 May 2004","review":"This was so beautiful. I am a ballerina and I have played both the Sugar Plum Fairy and Marie in numerous productions of this, but I have to admit that this is IT. This is the ultimate #1 version of this classical ballet. It was so beautiful. The music is absolutely marvelous and the scenery is gorgeous. The woman who plays the Sugar Plum Fairy is absolutely beautiful and does a fabulous job! I saw the Broadway version of this on a visit to NYC and I have to admit that this version was better than the one I saw there. George Balachine does amazing ballet, I wish I could study with him at his School of Ballet. And the composer(I know who it is, but I cant spell his name) is a musical genius. I give it 10/10.","user":"musicgirl12587","rank":[22,32]},{"title":"A Huge Disappointment","rating":5,"date":"29 October 2017","review":"BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS &amp; REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 400 Christmas MOVIES. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM FARE.<br><br>The director of \"Dirty Dancing\" could have done a better job in filming this production. The is not the first feature film to showcase the world's most beloved ballet.<br><br>This is a huge chore to watch this interpretation of the holiday classic ballet! The Nutcracker tells the story of a young girl whose love for a toy turns it into the handsome prince Macaulay Culkin (\"Richie Rich,\" \"Home Alone\"), and together they are brought to the Land of Sweets, where an enchanting spectacle awaits them. Directed by Academy Award-winner Emile Ardolino (\"Sister Act,\" \"Dirty Dancing\") and narrated by Academy Award-winner Kevin Kline (\"Dave,\" \"A Fish Called Wanda\"). <br><br>The lack of closeups and static shots hinder the viewer from fulling embracing it. The 1986 Nutcracker: The Motion Picture is a better viewing experience!","user":"Christmas-Reviewer","rank":[22,35]}]
