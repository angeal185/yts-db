[{"title":"Bad movie, good topic. Makes us more aware of cops criminals and injustice.","rating":3,"date":"28 April 2019","review":"This movie looks like it was made by force, without any will. There is some action, emotions, girls, but it is all looking tired, not interested, and lasts so short without any details. Because of lack of these details everything looks amateur and fake. You won't see gore, tears, sounds like in cool rare movies. Only reason I did not rate it worst is because it at least has some lessons and emotions and is similar to real life, that's my 3 stars. Not worth watching, will not make you excited. I liked that this movie makes us more aware what is happening around us, especially about justice, law, and police.","user":"asocialis","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"A Must See","rating":10,"date":"4 October 2018","review":"This is an excellent and is a must see!

The tone from the beginning gets you hooked on to what happens next. The music is beautiful and well placed throughout the film and feels brand new and refreshing.<br><br>The length is ok, some acting is not the best, but overall this film is a breath of fresh air.","user":"Jamesboys","rank":[2,8]}]
