[{"title":"Fast & Furious 6 is The best film in the franchise that I love to Death!","rating":10,"date":"17 October 2015","review":"Fast &amp; Furious 6 (2013) is the best of the best Action film in the series franchise! It's Justin Lin's Masterpiece and I love it to death. Sorry but is not Fast Five and Furious 7 the best, but is Fast &amp; Furious 6 the best one in the franchise! This my favorite best film of the franchise that I just love to death! The film has great cast and great action, great dialogue! It is the last time that Paul Walker starts in this film. In Furious 7 was his brother who was portraying Brian O'Conner with a fake CGI. In here Paul Walker is real, Justin Lin started a great franchise which ended in this film.<br><br>Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson reunite for this sixth installment in the 'Fast and Furious' action thriller franchise, directed by Justin Lin. After their lucrative Rio heist, and unable to return home, Dom (Vin Diesel) and the rest of his compatriots are forced to kill time lying low in different locations around the world. When DSS agent Hobbs offers Dom and his crew full pardons in return for taking down Owen Shaw (Luke Evans)'s gang of mercenary drivers, the offer seems too good to pass. But as the rivals head for a showdown on the streets of London, Dom learns that Shaw's second-in-command is none other than his presumed dead former lover, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez).<br><br>I love This film to death! This film is about rescuing Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and stopping a brilliant mastermind terrorist hijacker Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and his team of hijackers.<br><br>Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez lead a cast of returning all-stars as the global blockbuster franchise built on speed delivers the biggest adrenaline rush yet in this explosive Action Film. Hobbs (Johnson) has been tracking an organization of lethally skilled drivers, whose mastermind (Luke Evans) is aided by the love Dom (Diesel) thought was dead, Letty (Rodriguez). The only way to stop the criminal mercenaries from stealing a top secret weapon is to outmatch them at street level, so Hobbs asks for the help of Dom and his elite team. Payment for the ultimate chase? Full pardons for all of them and a chance to make their families whole again.<br><br>The \"Fast &amp; Furious\" franchise has always been a personal favorite of mine. Sure, as a whole, they're fairly easy to pass off as mindless action films for film goers who want a good rush of big-budget Hollywood action, but I've mostly seen them as more of a chugging train of car movies that simply get better with each new installment, and that's no exception with \"Fast &amp; Furious 6,\" which I'd probably say is the best addition to the series so far. I don't think I've been this thoroughly entertained by an action sequel in a while. The car chases and stunts are bigger, wilder, and more over-the-top than ever before, the characters' previously limited personalities continue to grow quite impressively, and the story manages to be both awesomely ridiculous and surprisingly engaging from start to finish (even though we all know which side is gonna come out victorious in the end). <br><br>The action is glorious while it lasts, but then the film goes back to figuring out how to keep its over sized vessel from taking on water. And that's more hard work than it's worth.<br><br>Still, the best thing about this flick is the character interaction, even with actors whose roles are this limited. Letty's amnesia adds an interesting soapy twist to the plot that forces Dom to constantly try to remind her why she loves him. Brian's fatherhood also lets Paul Walker do a bit of enjoyably self-serious acting of his own. Otherwise, Tyrese Gibson and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges are left with the snappy comedic relief, while Gina Carano, Gal Gadot, and Elas Pataky merely get to look feisty and hot in their action scenes (but at least they do a great job at it). As for Dwayne Johnson, he gives an unusually deadpan performance this time around, with only just a few outrageous outbursts of manly banter here and there. Nonetheless, the cast here is consistently entertaining, with the screenplay letting everyone get a chance to shine, even if some of them aren't quite as memorable as others. The script delivered an action moments with high explosions on an airplane that are not forgettable. I love that fight between Gina Carano &amp; Michelle Rodriguez which it was tremendous. <br><br>I love this film to death! I love this film to death, Fast &amp; Furious 6 is the best! The battles on airplane are Epic! I consider it as Justin Lin's Masterpiece.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[93,105]},{"title":"One of my favourite Fast and Furious movies","rating":8,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"Another awesome installment to the franchise! Fast &amp; Furious 6 is actually better than its predecessor! It has great characters, humor, action and of course sexy cars/women!","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[39,49]},{"title":"\"This is vehicular warfare.\"","rating":8,"date":"24 May 2013","review":"I don't think many other franchises has been as turbulent and uneven as The Fast and the Furious films. Things started off pretty earnestly with Rob Cohen's first film, but quickly careened into odd directions, with the ever-cheesy 2 Fast 2 Furious taking off and running with one main character while leaving the other in the dust, and with Tokyo Drift drifting away with totally different characters altogether. Thankfully, Fast &amp; Furious realigned the series with its roots. But it wasn't until Fast Five when I really began to give a darn about this series. Granted that all films have had their fun moments, the fifth film magically tied in every single strand from every single film, and made every single character relevant. Best of all, it did so with a great sense of fun: it had great pacing, amusing comedy, great action, and it made the characters stand out as a collectively outstanding cast.<br><br>So now Fast &amp; Furious 6 has come out, reuniting the entire gang once more to take on bigger stakes. The spectacle in this film tries its best to be even bigger, more absurd, and more awesome than before: the film is effectively book-ended with two massive action setpieces. The first involves a decently destructive car chase in London, where the villain effectively uses his custom-built ride to launch other cars all over the place. The film's final act features a really crazy sequence in which a tank roars across a highway, crushing other cars and blowing up bridges. This all culminates with all the muscle cars banding together to bring down a massive cargo plane in a fiery blaze of glory. In between, the film slows down a bit, but there's frequent fist-fights and pursuits, a few scenes of witty comedy, and there's one decent car-racing scene.<br><br>Whether or not you really dig this film may depend on how well you dig the characters and all their dynamics. It definitely helps to watch and understand the events of the first five films, because at this point, they've all been through so much and changed so much; for a late-comer like me, who never was invested in the characters until the last film, it can be confusing to remember who was who and what their history was. Fortunately, the film does insert some flashbacks and reminders for the audience's benefit. If you are keeping up with things, then the film will reward you with a cast of endearing and heartfelt characters, and the film's plot generally revolves around their continuing struggles. As far as the actual plot goes, it's pretty brainless and absurd action-movie fodder, and there are plot holes to be found. However, the film does have the merit of presenting a cast of villains to directly oppose the cast of heroes, and the story pulls out a few surprising twists.<br><br>The film generally looks good, but many of the action scenes are hectically shot and edited, and it can be hard to tell what's going on in certain scenes. What you can see is awesome, but sometimes, it's just aggravating. Acting is generally fun and enjoyable from the whole cast. Writing gets the job done well enough. This production uses a plethora of quality sets, props, and costumes, with loads of flashy cars at its disposal, and some okay-looking special effects. This film uses some cool hip rap and techno music, while the music score is pretty cool (sounds a lot like Brian Tyler's work from Tokyo Drift, which was one of my favorite soundtracks).<br><br>Best recommended to fans of the series, especially if you've been following the last few movies.<br><br>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)","user":"Al_The_Strange","rank":[17,23]}]
