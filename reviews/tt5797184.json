[{"title":"Escape from Pretoria","rating":8,"date":"21 March 2020","review":"Basically, some of these critics haven't a clue. This movie is a must-see; it dramatically illustrates the physical and psychological cruelty orchestrated by the Apartheid regime. Some aspects are subtle and horrifying. My only complaint is we didn't get the backgrounds of several fascinating characters. Of course, in many movies there's simply not enough time. And finally, Daniel Radcliffe and Mark Leonard Winter were mesmerizing expressing the horror of being incarcerated. Go see the film.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[44,62]},{"title":"Brilliantly jail break thriller!","rating":9,"date":"2 April 2020","review":"Outstanding performance by Our boy Daniel Radcliff.
