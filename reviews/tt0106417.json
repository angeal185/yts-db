[{"title":"The best SM movie ever.","rating":24,"date":"24 August 2000","review":"Sailor Moon R: The Movie is really really good.  Even if you are not a big fan of the show, you will enjoy this film.  The animation is terrific and the story is great.  This film has something for everyone, romance, drama, action, suspense, and comedy.  This is also a great family film, (at least the American version is) and teaches a lot of important values, such as friendship and love.  No matter what age you are, you will surely enjoy this Japanese treat.","user":"angles924","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"A really great movie!","rating":10,"date":"2 January 2005","review":"I love all of the Sailor Moon movies but this one is by far the best! I wish Sailor Moon was still on TV..... Anyway, this movie is emotional and the animation was excellent. I don't want to spoil it, but I will with a brief description O_o. If you haven't seen this movie, don't read the rest of this review. There's this evil being know as the Kiseanean Blossom that wants to suck all the energy out of every star and planet! She took control of this alien guy named Fiore who was Darien's childhood friend. They send this flower monster thingie to Earth where it sucked many people dry of their energy. Soon the Sailor Scouts defeat it (in like, fifteen minutes O_o!) Then Fiore appears and trashes them. When he's just about to kill Sailor Moon, Darien jumps in the way!! He just barely survived. You'd think Fiore would stop after he sees how close Serena and Darien are to each other, but NOOOOO! He takes Darien away with him, leaving Serena crying. It's up to the Sailor Scouts to save Darien, the Earth, and Fiore from Kiseanean Blossom. Hey! A little later on, (like 5 or 6 minutes later!)Fiore says to Darien \"Now only I can give you flowers!\" What a stupid yet funny thing to say! :D This movie easily deserves 10 stars. The American version, anyway, and yes the voices were weird, but I like the movie all the same. I REALLY LOVE THE \"POWER OF LOVE\" SONG AT THE END, IT'S SUCH A GREAT SONG!","user":"Wmill22069","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"A must-see, brilliant","rating":19,"date":"19 December 2002","review":"Sailormoon was created for kids, but adults can enjoy it too. The plot is unique, and all over the characters interesting and complex for a cartoon. The movie is definitely worth watching if your in the mood for a very good amine. Sure there are  some lines that are a bit cheesy, but things are lost in translations. 4 1/2 out of 5 stars if you rate it by itself, and 4 out of 5 if you compare it to some of the other stuff that's out there.","user":"moon_angel2002","rank":[7,8]}]
