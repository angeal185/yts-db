[{"title":"Very well played","rating":9,"date":"8 December 2018","review":"The film is solid. You can totally connect with it if you have ever been in a sesh or parties in Dublin. It might be a little dull for someone who hasn't though.\nAs I did, I enjoyed it a lot.\nWell done.","user":"aldooliveira-55131","rank":[10,19]},{"title":"Alien territory if you never lived this kind of life!","rating":10,"date":"12 June 2019","review":"This is a movie for people who understand this way of life. Incredibly relative and relatable.\nIt's also an insight into the other side of the party seen. The down side. The side that keeps you living that life because you think that is the solution but it's actually the problem.\nGood times though.<br><br>Great movie with some very good performances.\nWell done to all involved.\nAbsolute quality.","user":"decko-76666","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"Terrible and disjointed","rating":1,"date":"16 December 2018","review":"A very similar film to Human Traffic without the humour or the talent.","user":"brucemcv","rank":[11,25]}]
