[{"title":"Highly inaccurate film","rating":1,"date":"24 August 2009","review":"This film is not without its merits. The second unit shot some really quite beautiful location footage in the Arctic, and the cinematography throughout is impressive. Anthony Quinn brings tremendous verve to the role, and there are several memorable turns by the supporting cast, particularly Peter O'Toole.<br><br>But it's depressing to see how many people regard this as an accurate portrayal of Inuit culture. One hardly knows where to begin! The Inuit customs regarding \"wife-sharing\" are distorted (the idea that it would be a terrible insult not to accept such an offer is groundless), and the use of \"laughter\" as a euphemism for sex is merely an old Hollywood notion. Inuit mothers are not left until their mother's death to be told of common matters such as the importance of cutting a child's umbilical cord, and a grandmother, however infirm, would never be left out in the open to be eaten by a polar bear (a special igloo would instead be prepared, with important personal items, and then sealed up, after which the village would be moved). Most insulting of all is the notion that somehow Inuit would be unaware that babies are born without visible teeth!<br><br>The inaccuracies are not merely cultural, but historical as well. There is simply no period of time when the Inuit (or other Arctic groups such as the Inighuit, Inupiat, or Yupik) would have been unfamiliar with firearms and yet exposed to 1960s-style rock music -- these events are anywhere from 75 to 100 years apart, depending on the region. Inuit who went to trading posts would never be mocked by other Inuit, or by traders, at a trading post -- trading was serious business -- and would never be sold a gun with zero ammunition. This is not to say that traders were always totally fair; the guns were often of inferior quality, and the addiction to a source of powder and shot, along with the switch to fur-bearing animals as a sort of cash crop, were indeed problems.<br><br>The saddest thing of all is that, 27 years before \"Savage Innocents,\" a far more accurate account of the disparities, tensions, and injustices between Inuit and traders and police was released by a major Hollywood studio -- this was 1933's \"Eskimo,\" starring Ray Mala, a half- Inupiat Alaskan actor.<br><br>Having nearly no Inuit in the cast at all is, despite comments to the contrary, a problem as well. Hollywood had cast Inuit as Inuit as early as 1911, and \"Eskimo\" enjoyed an almost all- Inuit cast. The fact that all of the principal photography was done on a sound stage decorated by people with no knowledge whatever of either Inuit or northern homes is a further issue.<br><br>There's no question that \"Savage Innocents\" works hard to elicit sympathy with an \"alien\" culture -- the only problem is that this culture is almost entirely a fantasy.","user":"drrap","rank":[26,33]},{"title":"Memorable","rating":7,"date":"14 February 2002","review":"This is a memorable film in many regards.  Quinn plays an Inuit who inadvertently kills a priest who declines his offer of sexual hospitality with his wife. O'Toole, in his first film, plays a policeman who captures Quinn who later saves his life.  O'Toole eventually lets Quinn go because he realizes that he will likely be convicted of murder because a Western jury won't understand he accidently killed the priest because he wouldn't sleep with his wife.  There are some wonderful scenes of Inuit igloo life, including the daughter (Quinn's wife, Yoko Tani) chewing food for her mother (Marie Yang) because the mother's teeth are worn out from chewing skins. The film is full of surprises with little moments that delight an anthropologist familiar with Inuit traditions and lifestyles.  No video, no DVD listed, so watch for it on the late show and enjoy seeing the exciting young Peter O'Toole in days before the good life got to him.","user":"artzau","rank":[17,22]},{"title":"An excellent movie","rating":10,"date":"26 December 2002","review":"In the late sixties, bob dylan was asked how he came to write the song \"Quinn the Eskimo\". He replied that he'd seen this movie in which Tony Quinn played an Eskimo. The Savage Innocents is that movie. (In a much later book about his lyrics, Dylan says he doesn't remember how the song came about- like many of us, ol' bob's memory ain't what it used to be.)<br><br>This is the most accurate portrayal of Eskimo customs ever to come out of Hollywierd. It contrasts the cultural practices of Inuit and North American societies at a time when many Inuit people had not yet encountered the white man and his ways. The movie asks the question \"who is savage and who is innocent?\" The movie is full of memorable performances and  \"sound bites\". You'll come away with a new appreciation for traditional Eskimo culture and more than a few new quotable quotes.<br><br>When Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy!","user":"wild-plum","rank":[18,24]}]
