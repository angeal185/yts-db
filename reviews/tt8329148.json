[{"title":"My daughters review","rating":10,"date":"25 August 2019","review":"My little girl loved this movie. She especially liked flash and where Astrokid risked his life to help his friends. She greatly enjoyed the entire film and asked me to highlight the wood shelled guy, all the plants and the hailstorm as some of her favorite scenes. She also asked that I rate this as 600 million thousand. As a parent I would rate this a 7. Good messages in it and some touching relationships between characters.","user":"dwarish","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"Pretty Good Movie","rating":10,"date":"29 August 2019","review":"Amazing graphics: very colorful once the Astro Kid begins exploring the planet with his robot. I enjoy a good story in any genre and this one is not bad at all.","user":"samnlm","rank":[15,15]},{"title":"Nice Animation aims for children, but I completely enjoyed it...","rating":7,"date":"16 September 2019","review":"Just enjoyed the film.
