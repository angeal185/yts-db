[{"title":"Nothing very special..... but watchable","rating":4,"date":"19 October 2013","review":"Well honestly there is nothing very special in Embrace of the Vampire and it wont make a difference if you skip it....<br><br>The movie is not scary or thrilling and the climax is quit predictable as well. If you are expecting a little bit of action then you are in for a disappointment. As far as the acting is concerned, its not bad at all..... Sharon Hinnendael who plays the lead as Charlotte has done a fine job (though sometimes she does try to act like Kristen Stewart in Twilight...lolz), the other cast has done a good job as well, I wont say great but good.... The girls in the movie including Sharon show quite a bit of skin so that keeps it a bit interesting ha ha. <br><br>The plot is simple, an Orphan girl goes to a top grade University for higher studies on scholarship, conveniently the university campus is in a beautiful hilly location, where an innocent Vampire just happens to be waiting for her for past 500 years or so...gah... <br><br>If you are watching this movie for the story, thrill, suspense or horror element then you will be disappointed. However, if you feel like killing your time or like me you are a fan of vampire movies you might find it watchable.<br><br>Overall nothing very special..... but I don't think anyone would get bored while watching it, for me this movie is a 4 out of 10.","user":"bunty18","rank":[27,34]},{"title":"Lame Story","rating":4,"date":"24 May 2015","review":"The virgin and repressed Charlotte Hawthorn (Sharon Hinnendael) joins the university from a Catholic school with a scholarship for participating in the fencing team. She shares the room with Nicole (Kaniehtiio Horn) and tells that her mother died and she is alone. Charlotte has thalassemia and is forced to use medicine. She gets a job working as waitress in a coffee shop managed by Chris (Ryan Kennedy). Soon she meets the fencing coach, who is also responsible for the literature classes, Professor Cole (Victor Webster), and her mate Eliza (C.C. Sheffield) becomes jealous with his treatment toward Charlotte. Soon she has daydreams and the mystic Daciana (Keegan Connor Tracy) that is the owner of a store explains her fate in world as a vampire hunter, but Charlotte does not believe in her until her friends die. <br><br>\"Embrace of the Vampire\" is a movie with a lame story. It is watchable mainly because of the scenes with the naked girls. But the acting is terrible and the conclusion is weak. My vote is four.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Sedução do Mal\" (\"Seduction from Evil\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Worthy remake","rating":8,"date":"6 April 2014","review":"In the 1700s in Eastern Europe a woman arrives at a house where a screaming girl is being held on a table. The woman cuts the girl's arm, pronounces some spell and drips some blood from a vial in the girl's wound. She then places a necklace on her in time when a female vampire attacks and bites a man who's also in the house to protect the girl.<br><br>In the present, Charlotte arrives at college. She's very shy, reserved, downright repressed. She's there on a fencing scholarship and has to perform or else she's out. Her parents are dead. She inherited a blood disorder that killed her mom and also has creepy visions. Her roommate is nice to her, but her friend hates Charlotte, who starts working at a coffee shop where the owner develops feelings for her. Some type of psychic also notices Charlotte. And a creepy administrator also takes an interest in her.<br><br>Charlotte is taking a literature class that is dealing with mythology-- monsters and the like. The male professor for some reason is also the coach for the female fencing team. While Charlotte tries to stay out of trouble one night she's taken out for the fencing team rookie hazing, where she's made to drink. She's never had alcohol before. That night she also sleeps with another girl. Now her life goes into chaos. She can't fence right, her visions intensify and become more terrifying, she rejects the help from her friends. When she finally visits the psychic lady, things are revealed to her. She's from a line of vampire hunters, as was the girl on the table in the intro. The lady on the other hand is a descendant from the woman who was treating the girl. Charlotte even inherited the necklace from the intro. And it's burning into her skin which means a vampire is near. Charlotte will have to accept her destiny and face the vampire, a vampire who seeks to become human if he only can get ahold of a virgin--like Charlotte.<br><br>Embrace of the Vampire has an attractive cast that shows plenty of skin. The location of the college is stunning. The direction is excellent. The story perhaps could have used some work. But at the same time it's not predictable. It's not the usual simplistic evil vampire against some innocent victims story until some hero appears. For a while the story just focuses on on Charlotte and sets the vampire aspect aside, so we could have used some more vampire action. The ending is sudden and strange. But it sets up things for a sequel which I'm looking forward to.","user":"TdSmth5","rank":[7,10]}]
