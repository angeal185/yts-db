[{"title":"My Sword is my God.","rating":1,"date":"14 March 2019","review":"960 AD Denmark. A mercenary profiteer known as \"the stranger\" makes money in the struggle of Odin vs Jesus as Christians attempt to survive in a Viking village.<br><br>Lousy script. The dialogue was bland. The action was boring. Had to fast forward about the last 20 minutes it was that boring.","user":"nogodnomasters","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"Amateur flick, only to watch if you are a hardcore viking fan.","rating":2,"date":"3 July 2019","review":"If you are up for an amateurish Viking flick with decent norse theme, this is the movie for you. When the lone hero does his thing some other dudes tries to do theirs. Costumes is decent (armour not so much though It would work in a reenactment society wich it probably origins from).\nThe story is slow, built by a slow storyteller and he has a hard time convincing me to listen. The actors are quite good but the obviously lack directions. Music and sound is decent, but the dubbing has its flaws.\nI would only recomend this movie to someone who are binging Viking movies. Otherwise, walk away!","user":"franqieboy","rank":[1,1]},{"title":"Viking blood","rating":2,"date":"29 March 2019","review":"Acting.. 3 stars\nCast.. 2 stars\nDirecting 3 stars\nStory line 2 stars","user":"nightsky-24849","rank":[3,6]}]
