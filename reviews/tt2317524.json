[{"title":"Not bad for a WWE straight to DVD production","rating":6,"date":"6 June 2013","review":"I didn't much care for the first \"12 Rounds\" movie, finding it flat and not very exciting. So when I sat down to watch this next entry, I was expecting it to be even worse than the original movie. But I have to admit that I was surprised. Yes, this sequel does have some problems, not just with the awkward title imposed on the front of the Blu-ray box (\"12 Rounds 2\"????) The main problem with this movie is that a lot of key linking footage, as well as entire scenes, seem to be missing here and there. Also, the ending is kind of abrupt. Still, there's a lot to enjoy here. The production values are generally pretty good for a movie that bypassed theaters. Randy Orton, though not a great actor, does seem to be trying, and he makes his character sympathetic enough. The main selling point of the movie is its relentlessness - once the crisis starts, there's barely a lull in the action and intensity. I'm not saying that this movie is a GREAT movie, but you'll likely find it better than you might be expecting, and it passes its 94 minutes with a certain briskness.","user":"Wizard-8","rank":[25,34]},{"title":"A very good WWE production movie","rating":9,"date":"2 August 2013","review":"This movie was really more than what I expected, a lot more. I watched previous WWE production movies and to me this one is the best. Yes, even better than John Cena starred 'Legendary'.<br><br>12 Rounds:Reloaded was a really great thriller, action movie. Randy Orton is great as the hero, has the charisma and can really make u sink in his acting. The direction was very well done. The action scenes are also very well co-ordinated &amp; the suspense of the story manages to keep you on the edge of you're seat. You'll always keep wondering \"Why did this happen? What's going to happen next?\"<br><br>The best part of the movie is that it always has some fresh revelation or twists turning up every few minutes, to help keep you engaged in the films story. Arguably the films is better than the first. It has more action, better acting &amp; direction. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because of its actions and, more importantly, suspense.<br><br>12 Rounds:Reloaded is definitely worth the watch!","user":"j-asohel333","rank":[12,21]},{"title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078","rating":7,"date":"6 May 2014","review":"WWE Films continue to surprise, giving us a string of terrific action thrillers from an unlikely source. Their latest straight to video release is a sequel to 2009s, 12 Rounds. While Randy Orton wasn't nearly as good as John Cena was in the first film, he gives a more than adequate performance as Nick Molloy, a paramedic who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. After failing to save a rich mans wife at the scene of a drunk driving accident, the man decides to punish all those involved, including the paramedic who failed to save her. The story here is pretty solid, especially for an action film, but what bothers me is that this sequel was in no way connected to the first film. Reloaded is a different story in a different city, with an entirely different cast, so how did the bad guy manage to come up with the same game, from four years earlier? As for that game, the rounds weren't as long or as complicated, but what really makes this better than your average action movie is the compelling back story and the depth of the characters involved. Randy Orton, while having very limited film experience was pretty good and that will come as a surprise to many. It's hard to think of WWE Superstars as actors, but that is exactly what they are. Aside from wrestling in their underwear every week, they have to play a charterer and follow a script 52 weeks a year, so is this really such a stretch? For the most part the WWE Superstars have made for some pretty exciting action stars. The supporting cast of this film was also very good, in particular Tom Stevens, formerly of the Diary of A Wimpy Kid series. Stevens plays Tommy, another person caught up in this madman's game, and he is not only thrilling and charismatic, but he's pretty funny too. 12 Rounds 2 won't win any awards, but it is 90 minutes of non-stop action, packaged in a compelling story, which I found to be extremely entertaining.","user":"Tss5078","rank":[8,13]}]
