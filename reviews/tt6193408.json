[{"title":"A brilliant film","rating":9,"date":"14 February 2020","review":"A film that can be enjoyed by children &amp; adults. Loads of things to spot during the film that link to other sci-fi films. We've watched it three times now and discover things still.","user":"johnwtunnicliffe","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Shaun the Sheep does ET ... and it's brilliant fun","rating":9,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"This is basically a Shun the Sheep version of ET. Fun for all the family, and plenty of movie references for sci-fi fans.<br><br>It knows it's silly, and goes out of its way to enjoy itself.<br><br>Easily one of the best animated movies of 2019.","user":"Paradroid78","rank":[37,46]},{"title":"Beautiful film with acres of heart","rating":10,"date":"16 October 2019","review":"I loved the forst Shaun film, and particularly enjoy the craft that goes into making Aardman as great as they are.<br><br>This film felt expertly crafted to cater for younger audiences, which is perfect and as it should be. It's nice to see Aardman putting so much warmth into their story - which almost certainly borrows heavily from your fave scifi film - and the animation is some of the most vibrant and colourful stop frame I've ever seen. A true feast for the eyes and comfort for the heart.<br><br>A beautiful triumph, congratulations to all involved in its production, the hard work shows and pays off in spades.","user":"shaunalappin","rank":[37,49]}]
