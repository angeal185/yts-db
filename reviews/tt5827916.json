[{"title":"Transcendent. A truly spiritual film","rating":10,"date":"11 November 2019","review":"\"Better to suffer injustice than to do it...\"<br><br>I don't have many words tonight. A lot of thoughts and emotions. I didn't expect a perfect score from me this year, but I am just floored and overwhelmed by the visual poetry and spiritual magnitude of it all. It feels transcendent. With a beauty that permeates all the way to one's own relationship with God.<br><br>Based on true events, A Hidden Life is Malick's most direct exploration of faith since To the Wonder, and perhaps his most fully realized work yet. It is an allegorical story about a man of extraordinary faith. A real-life parable of perseverance and free will. A spiritual journey centered in not just our humanity, but on what it means to truly walk the steps of Christ. And on what it means to choose what we believe is right and just, when we are given every reason not to.<br><br>Malick doesn't glorify the central character's ideals or deeds. Rather we focus on the humble threads of love and the storm they weather--and the romantic chemistry is perfect. August Diehl &amp; Valerie Pachner are both exceptional and so incredibly in love. Seconds into the film and you already know it. Pachner gives a particularly moving performance deserving of an Oscar nomination (she is in SF this week doing Q&amp;A's!). Every touch, glance, or embrace between these two is personal, powerful, believable. You can see the stress leave their shoulders each time they first see each other. Sincerity fills the screen as their thoughts, worries, desires, and personal bond resurface in the context of God.<br><br>The cinematography is superb, with DP notably credited to JÃ¶rg Widmer and not Emmanuel Lubezki. There is a rare seamless quality achieved blending in old footage as well as in choosing to entirely forgo subtitles in a film spoken in equal parts English and German. The music is the best I've heard all year. A beautiful traditional theme by James Newton Howard (Blood Diamond, TDK) with Handel, Dvorak, and other great classical works mixed in.<br><br>A Hidden Life is a film that may stay with you for some time. This is quintessential Malick, joining the ranks of The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life. Go in with an open mind and heart, ready for a spiritual experience.","user":"DjMethod","rank":[99,131]},{"title":"Impeccable","rating":10,"date":"20 September 2019","review":"Saw this in Toronto and felt privileged to be in a world where a movie like this is made and a story like this is told. Based on letters written between a husband and wife while he is in jail for being a conscientious objector in Hitler's Austria. So heartbreaking to see how the village where he lived, all friends and neighbours for decades - all become his enemies as he is the only one willing to say No. And yet he is strong in his convictions and sustained by love.","user":"caughlan_anne","rank":[85,122]},{"title":"Unlike anything I've ever seen.","rating":9,"date":"16 December 2019","review":"I have never seen a film like A Hidden Life. Terrence Malick is known for his unique style, but this is something else. It is one of the most grim, harrowing, mournful films I have ever seen (it should be rated R)-and it is absolutely masterful.\nI can't even find words to properly describe it. This is a film that you enter, that you experience, you almost feel like you're watching a documentary. Malick's direction is absolutely one of a kind, brilliant, almost spiritual. The acting is phenomenal-August Diehl is terrific, and Valerie Pachner is spectacular, along with excellent supporting performances from all. The cinematography is astounding; jaw-droppingly gorgeous (either this or 1917 for best cinematography of the year), and James Newton Howard's score is beautiful. But what sets this film apart is its emotional brutality- it is heartbreaking, grim, and absolutely brutal. And yet, throughout all of this, the courage, faith and bravery of Franz and his wife, not to mention their three little girls and Franz's mother-is incredibly overwhelming. The film is not without flaws-it's needlessly too long, with some repetitive shots-but that does not take away from the fact that it is fantastic. An incredible film.","user":"jacobsperling","rank":[50,73]}]
