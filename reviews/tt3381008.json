[{"title":"Puerile comedy slapstick - I loved it!","rating":9,"date":"26 May 2016","review":"I don't think I have ever written a review on IMDb before, but on this occasion, I feel I must.<br><br>Thank you, Mr Cohen for giving me the biggest belly laughs I've had from any film in years.<br><br>This film is comedy gold. Sure, the story-line is wafer-thin, but who cares? Although on this turn-out, this film is a bit of departure from Cohen's previous outings - less mockumentary and more narrative, but it is gag after gag - non-stop. My sides were hurting before the end of the first act.<br><br>Some of the other sourpuss reviews here miss the point. If I go to see a comedy, I'm not expecting an Oscar winning, thought-provoking drama. I want escapism. I'm willing to suspend my disbelief completely in exchange for a few good laughs.<br><br>This film delivers that in spades - and more.<br><br>For when a film causes you to bury your mouth in your elbow in fear of disturbing your fellow film-goers with your laughter, you know you're having a good time.<br><br>And that's all I want from a movie.<br><br>Thanks again, Mr. Cohen!","user":"iannicholson","rank":[158,205]},{"title":"Either Raises Or Lowers The Bar On Filth","rating":10,"date":"10 August 2016","review":"Good Lord this is filthy, and I laughed right through it, sometimes crying tears. I can totally see why some people would hate it, many scenes are hard to watch. The \"plot\" cracks along and the jokes are pretty much continuous, and filthy. Mark Strong not only makes a convincing James Bond type secret agent but is as equally committed to embracing the film's sense of humour, following Cohen into new filthy territory. Cohen, as usual, has no internal breaks and doesn't seem to be even trying to figure out where he should stop, he just keeps piling on the filth to levels hitherto undreamed of. The elephant bukake scene nearly broke me.<br><br>Being drunk will help, but you have to be able to enjoy filthy humour. Did I mention it's filthy?","user":"Lugodoc","rank":[55,81]},{"title":"Not laughed so much at the cinema since the parole officer","rating":9,"date":"25 February 2016","review":"Went to watch Grimsby last night on a whim and ended up having a great time. Not everyone's cup of tea I'm sure, but surely anyone going to see this new Sacha Baron Cohen film knows exactly what they are going to get.<br><br>To be honest I was amazed how good the action scenes where played out, they could rival any serious action movie, however I was there for the comedy and that's what I got, I don't want to spoil this movie but I can't remember the last time I cried with laughter or cringed at the same time I was laughing, everyone in the cinema was in hysterics at some of the parts, an overly long scene featuring Elephants (I'll say no more) made my face and stomach hurt i was laughing that hard.<br><br>Rebel Wilson was great I love her in everything I watch her in, her Aussie accent did come out a few times which I forgive her for, but the line she delivered \"am not pregnant am just fu*kin fat\" was as Northern as they come.<br><br>Go see this movie, you'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll feel ashamed of yourself for laughing at some parts but you'll be entertained, I promise.<br><br>I do think Sacha Baron Cohen needs to go see a doctor, maybe a psychiatrist as no one should be thinking up stuff like this, it's wrong.<br><br>As for people getting upset about the movie making fun of Grimsby, come on it's a joke, I haven't been their but I'm intelligent enough to know its completely exaggerated for comic effect, I'm from the North, Lancashire, actually and the funniest thing is how many people I meet in London through work who think I come from a similar place...","user":"paul-2369","rank":[155,258]}]
