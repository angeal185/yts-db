[{"title":"Cabin fever movie","rating":5,"date":"12 April 2019","review":"Basically that's it - it's a movie about a classic case of cabin fever when two people turn on each other due to isolation and stress, based on real events, but an otherwise unremarkable flick.","user":"ivan_dmitriev","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Deep and dark","rating":8,"date":"26 March 2019","review":"Great reflection of a true story of two lighthouse keepers coping when a terrible storm struck. Well presented with a magical relationship between them albeit belligerent at times. It shows how difficult the life of a lighthouse keeper was and the good work they did to save lives of passing boats and ships.","user":"debbiecargill","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"I watched the wrong movie","rating":1,"date":"12 August 2019","review":"I thought I was watching the other Lighthouse movie with Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe until I got to the end of this boring ass movie and realized that this ain't it lol. Terrible and boring movie.","user":"wizecrakz","rank":[35,70]}]
