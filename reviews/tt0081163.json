[{"title":"See it for Angela","rating":7,"date":"12 October 2009","review":"I liked this version of The Mirror Crack'd, and I am fond of the Joan Hickson version too. The Hickson version, it is true, is more faithful to the book, despite its liberties, but on its own merits this film is pretty good. The main merit is the performance of underrated character actress Angela Lansbury; she is terrific as Miss Marple, and Edward Fox does a great job as Inspector Craddock. The supporting cast are fine in their roles, Elizabeth Taylor overdoes Marina Gregg slightly but she plays with gusto, Rock Hudson is suitably subdued as Jason Rudd, and Kim Novak is delightful as Lola. The dialogues between Taylor and Novak are wonderfully witty, and often verging on hysterically funny. The film is beautifully shot, and the locations and costumes are lovely. The music is stunning too. However, the character of Heather Badcock is changed quite considerably here, and why she was changed to a naive village girl I still find perplexing. The film is overlong and has pacing problems, and the final solution was weak compared to how it could have been. On the whole, it is a movie worth seeing, and as I've said, see it for Angela. 7/10 Bethany Cox","user":"TheLittleSongbird","rank":[18,21]},{"title":"In its own way, a camp classic","rating":8,"date":"31 July 2005","review":"The Mirror Crack'd is one of the many Agatha Christie stories made into an all-star film. This one is more campy and less opulent than \"Murder on the Orient Express,\" for instance, but for what it is, it's pretty good. Set in the '50s in Miss Marple's village of St. Mary Mead, the film stars lots of big names from that era: Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis, Kim Novak - a veritable who's who of '50s megastars. Angela Lansbury plays Miss Marple, and she's perfect in the role. The film also has an appearance by Pierce Brosnan in a small, uncredited part.<br><br>The script has the Taylor and Novak characters camping it up with bitchy insults which I don't quite remember from the book. The story concerns a movie star, her husband, her co-star nemesis, etc., coming to St. Mary Mead to make a movie. During a party, a local resident is murdered, but the intended victim is assumed to be Taylor. It's up to Miss Marple to unravel the mystery as more murders occur.<br><br>The scene between Taylor and Edward Fox is especially good, and I've never been sure if Taylor falling on top of Hudson on the bed was supposed to be funny or not - in the movie theater, it got a laugh.<br><br>It's great to see all these old stars in the same film. By the way, perhaps this was mentioned by one of the posters - this story is based on a real-life incident that happened to Gene Tierney.","user":"blanche-2","rank":[26,32]},{"title":"Taylor's Last Great Film To Date!","rating":10,"date":"27 April 2004","review":"The Mirror Cracked (1980) Elizabeth Taylor's last good movie to date. Though the production values are more in line with a well done \"made-for-TV\" production, I enjoyed this film a lot. Co-starring with a couple of by-gone Hollywood legends, Rock Hudson and Kim Novak (and an uncredited cameo by a young Pearce Brosnan), The Mirror Cracked tells the tale of a famous actress temporarily residing in the English countryside while on location for a film she's starring in.<br><br>Early on in the film, a welcome to the countryside party is thrown by the local townsfolk and at the party, one of the guests drops dead. Soon we learn she was poisoned. Then we learn the poison was intended for Miss Taylor. The rest is all suspicion and old rivalries with Taylor at the center of every drama.<br><br>Two scenes stand out : one comedic, one dramatic. A bit of fun occurs when Taylor, observing the ravaging of time on her face in a mirror, utters, \"Wrinkles, wrinkles, go away, come back on Doris Day!\" Too funny.<br><br>The other moment comes when audience's focus in on Taylor's great eyes for probably the last time in cinematic history. It happens at a pivotal moment early on in the plot, just before the first victim drops dead of poisoning, and Taylor, at the top of a stairway, dressed in purple to match her eyes, appears startled. She freezes, the guests stop what they're doing and wonder what's happening. Then the director pulls in tight on Miss Taylor's famous eyes and for one short moment in time, we experience once again, all the magnetism and power of that wonderful actress that has captivated viewers for oh these many years.","user":"mrcaw1","rank":[39,52]}]
