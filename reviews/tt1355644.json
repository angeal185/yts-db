[{"title":"Haunting and beautiful","rating":8,"date":"16 May 2017","review":"I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future.","user":"dakjets","rank":[190,231]},{"title":"Eminent Science Fiction","rating":9,"date":"23 December 2016","review":"Professional film critics are stupid. That is the conclusion you must reach after watching this movie. I was not expecting much after reading the uniformly negative critical reviews. But I was surprised. The movie is plausible. It is more than plausible, it is realistic. And the acting is so eminent that you are there yourself trying to decide what you would do if you awoke on a fully autonomous spaceship trying to figure out what is going on.<br><br>Granted, there are no alien horror creatures, no protracted fast-action sequences, no superficial technical nonsense to cover a thin plot. Maybe this is what the critics were missing.<br><br>There is only beautiful scenes, eminent acting, a plausible plot and a surprising ending. But that was enough for me.<br><br>So go watch this movie and decide for yourself how implausibly stupid the film critics are.","user":"steen-mpi","rank":[758,1]},{"title":"Ignore the critics- a great movie with lots of suspense","rating":10,"date":"22 December 2016","review":"I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the \"critically acclaimed\" films I've watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine.<br><br>Overall would really recommend watching over the holidays. Really enjoyed it.","user":"elementxo","rank":[784,1]}]
