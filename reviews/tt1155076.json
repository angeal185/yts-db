[{"title":"Master Miyagi would not be proud ...","rating":1,"date":"27 May 2011","review":"I thought it was horrible. I will never watch this movie again. I think that it is a blasphemous insult to the original, which really should be watched again. There are notable life-lessons in the original, and they are paraphrased in the remake. The quote of \"wax on, wax off\" had meaning, and became embedded into pop-culture. As did the crane stance. This movie can be easily forgotten. Daniel learning the basic forms for blocking by washing cars, painting fences and sanding the floor makes a LOT more sense than Dre learning anything by taking his jacket off and picking it up off the floor any number of times. A constant repetitive motion done for hours is a lot more relevant than the infinite variations of the way one puts on and takes off a jacket.<br><br>The idea that any new practitioner of kung-fu could defeat a black sash like that is ridiculous. Period. It takes years to earn a black sash, and that sifu (the bad instructor) did not seem the type to give sashes away unwarranted.<br><br>Why use the name Karate Kid if the only reference to karate is that \"it's not karate.\"? All in all, I thought it was a bad, over-promoted movie with a legendary name. I wonder how many people started karate lessons after they saw the original. Did you even consider studying kung-fu after seeing this?","user":"Rat_27","rank":[70,101]},{"title":"It should be: Kung Fu Kid","rating":4,"date":"19 June 2010","review":"From the previews I knew this movie wasn't going to do justice to the original. I mean, can anything? I wasn't planning on watching it, but my best friend wanted to see it and I gave in. Bad idea. It was a waste of my money. <br><br>First and foremost, let us point out what a lot of people have already mentioned. Jayden Smith cannot act. Like, at all. I don't care if he's Will Smith's son, it's not like acting is genetic. He was just trying too hard to be funny, and too hard to be serious. It didn't seem natural, like he was in the moment. Just him... acting. Of course, I can't say the same for Jackie Chan. He didn't do much, and that was good! Not that I don't like Jackie Chan, it's just it's good to see him as a trainer for once. I wish he would have fought more, though.<br><br>Secondly, the plot sucked. I mean, it was a bunch of middle-schoolers flying. Like, I get China is a little crazy on the Kung Fu, but come on! The fighting scene where \"Dre\" is running from the Chinese kids is not that bad of a scene, I'll admit, but it kept occurring to me that these kids are like 10 and 12. Then there's the whole Dre and Chinese girl romance thing. I was falling asleep every time they were together. I mean, you're 12! As someone else on IMDb said, there is no sexual tension! Sure it's family-orientated, but it's uninteresting to the rest.<br><br>Then the predictability. The friend who dragged me there told me half of the whole movie, and she's never watched it before. It's so boring sitting there knowing what's going to happen. Of course, he was going to win, of course he was going to run faster. Of course Jackie Chan would save him, like, I didn't even have to watch the whole thing to know what was going to happen. <br><br>Also, a lot of the scenes were pointless. I can see why the movie was so long. I can only imagine if they have an extended version! Dre drinking from the Dragon water or whatever, what did that do? I also didn't understand why Jackie was so reluctant to teach Dre at first. I imagined it had something to do with the crazy trainer, but with all the time they had, never developed a true story. Okay, so he got into an accident and killed his wife and kid... I'm sorry? Like, what does that have to really do with anything? <br><br>Overall, it wasn't worth watching. Or maybe it's not a movie you'd watch twice, because I sure as hell won't. God forbid they make a sequel.","user":"Mr-Gabriel35","rank":[97,146]},{"title":"I want to ask to be totally refunded for the movie ticket","rating":1,"date":"26 July 2010","review":"Last Saturday, I went to watch this movie with a friend of mine and his children. Actually his children wanted to watch the movie. But after 40 minutes the children couldn't stand anymore so we left. <br><br>In this remake of Karate Kid starred Jaden Smith the son of a very important American actor (that's how he got the part) and Jackie Chan. The remake is roughly two and half hour and his definitely not comparable even for just a sec with the original one. <br><br>In the original Karate kid starred Ralph Macchio and the late Pat Morita. The original was a good movie. With a lots of action, drama and love. <br><br>By the way, although the movie-maker have tried to cover up Jaden Smith poor acting, everybody can understand that he can't act.<br><br>Save your money and watch the original or watch something else. <br><br>Hopefully they don't do a sequel for Karate Kid 2","user":"alexkirei","rank":[86,136]}]
