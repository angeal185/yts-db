[{"title":"Sit back, relax, and enjoy","rating":6,"date":"1 February 2004","review":"If you are in for some entertainment, if you like rap music, and/or martial arts films  you will enjoy the music. If you prefer good art cinema, or you really look for logic even in the fun films, this one is not for you. I enjoyed it, but I am not sure that my other, more serious ego would have liked the film in any other situation. This film (can somebody explain me the title) is just entertainment, but what are the James Bond films?  6 out of 10 on my personal scale.","user":"dromasca","rank":[14,15]},{"title":"Somewhere Between the Cradle and the Grave...","rating":3,"date":"3 March 2003","review":"Not a bad movie but nothing spectacular in terms of originality...<br><br>DMX beats up some people. Jet Li beats up some people. Gabrielle Union takes (most of) her clothes off (with her fine self). Lots of stuff breaks and blows up.<br><br>6 out of 10; I'd wait for the DVD...","user":"blackwarrior400","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Good for what you would expect.","rating":8,"date":"27 August 2003","review":"Ive seen a lot of bad reviews for this film and i am sick of these dorks that only give monsters ball and other films of the genre high ratings because of nudity and \"good scripts\". This is an action movie wit jet Li and it delivers what you would expect. Hell DMX even attempts to use martial arts and his acting is certainly improving as is Jet Li's. Combine Romeo Must Die and Exit Wounds and this is what you get. The fights are great (Jet vs the champions of UFC), the comedy is there (Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson) and the film is certainly entertaining so if you want a mindless film with lots of action this is it. Damn Monsters ball. I give this movie a 8!","user":"Darkness876","rank":[41,54]}]
