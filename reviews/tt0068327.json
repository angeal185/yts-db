[{"title":"Divine decadence","rating":10,"date":"15 February 2006","review":"Director Bob Fosse hasn't achieved an immense degree of recognition, but his movies have a distinctive flavour. He seems to have an obsession with the world of music-hall, which is felt in other movies like \"Sweet Charity\" and \"All that Jazz\". In his other movies though, musical performances tend to steal the show almost entirely. \"Cabaret\" is an exception because it has an interesting background and storyline, and the music-hall performances are cleverly used here to illustrate and emphasize the plot. They play about the same role as the Chorus in ancient Greek play.<br><br>Of course, the depiction of Cabaret's \"Kit Kat Club\" deserves attention all by itself. It is not surprising that a cabaret buff such as Bob Fosse took interest in the Weimar Republic period in Germany, when \"divine decadence \" was the name of the game. Only Bob Fosse could recreate with such consumed application the grotesque sleaze of Berlin's lowlife during the rise of Nazism, a context which served as inspiration for expressionist painters, and for Brecht's \"Threepenny Opera\". During the credits, check out a woman in the public with short hair and glasses smoking a cigarette (something quite dodgy in 1931!). It is the exact reproduction of a famous painting by Otto Dix.<br><br>An outrageously grinning clown (Joel Grey) introduces every cabaret number. The girls appear in all possible contorted postures keeping deadpan faces. The Kit Kat club reminds of a roman arena, where the public is out for anything insane (even women fights in the mud...). To give an idea of what sort of den the club is, Michael York finds himself at one point standing next to a transvestite in a men's urinal...The cabaret performances get all the more provocative as the plot gets tense. The club is an essentially immoral place where anything is for sale, and it adapts shamelessly to the radical political changes coming up.<br><br>Liza Minelli's character is totally at home in such surroundings. Her persona is perfectly sketched in her song \"Bye Bye Mein Herr\". She is the incarnation of the vamp, both heartless and ingenuous, the sort of lethal woman who drives men crazy and then gives them up like toys. Indeed, a very typical stereotype of the interwar period, think of Marlene Dietrich in \"the Blue Angel\"...Minelli's performance onstage with garter belts and a bowler hat still looks elegantly naughty today.<br><br>Though, the real nature of her character is well studied as soon as she gets offstage. While Minelli can't help being extravagant all the time, she turns out to be a fragile woman neglected by her father, and in demand of constant and renewed attention. As predicted in her song, she proves basically unable to engage in any serious relationship, despite her involvement with Michael York ( \"And though I used to care, I need the open air, you'd every cause to doubt me Mein Herr\").<br><br>The script was based a story by British writer Christopher Isherwood, called \"A Goodbye to Berlin\", based on his own personal memories. He is allegedly the character played by Michael York. A serious upper class young man, he meets Liza Minelli out of blind chance, while looking for an apartment to share. She introduces him to all sorts of people, from riff-raff to aristocracy, including a gigolo, a Jewish heiress, and an ambiguous baron who dismisses them both after having \"played\" with the two of them. <br><br>Michael York's sober performance looks a bit pale as opposed to histrionic Liza Minelli, but of course, that was necessary in order to stress the essential difference between those two strangers. The movie ends as they part on a railway platform, but one can guess their experience together will have changed them both, as as far as he is concerned, was a definite coming of age.<br><br>One of the scenes, in the middle of the movie, is quite disturbing. At a countryside inn, a young S.A man sings a song called \"Tomorrow belongs to me\", which starts out nostalgic but gradually turns into an infectious Nazi march as the whole crowd joins him. This unexpected number seems to have embarrassed many viewers. If Nazism had presented itself as pure evil, would it have met any success? This daring scene makes evident that it was for many Germans of the time the symbol of positive values : beauty, tradition, order, pride, future. If you didn't know how things turned out, would you not have been tempted to sing along this powerful hymn to the fatherland as you watch this? Good question to ask oneself even, or especially, nowadays...","user":"francheval","rank":[179,210]},{"title":"Joel Grey's MC bespeaks uncomfortable truths through risqué entertainment","rating":9,"date":"8 August 2013","review":"Joel Grey's MC, the iconic centerpiece of \"Cabaret,\" is a fool in the Shakespearean sense: his outrageous makeup and clownish demeanor give him license to speak the most embarrassing truths and to broach the strictest taboos. We never see him out of his MC persona, but we do see two layers to his performances. As the host of an interwar Berlin burlesque, he is on one level—and perhaps for him it is the only level—an entertainer for Nazi fatcats and wealthy Yanks and Brits on continental vacations. But art imitates life, and we can also see, perhaps all too plainly, how the songs that the MC presents mirror events in the world outside the club. The Nazi party's growing boldness is displayed through rapid cuts between mob violence in the streets and the MC's cartoonish goosestepping on stage. The unusual love triangle between Liza Minelli's hopeful actress and her British and German paramours has its telling parallel in the song \"Two Girls.\" Most shockingly and ambiguously, the MC lampoons anti-Jewish miscegenation laws by romancing a person in a gorilla suit and asking why society should stand in the way of their love. Would the Nazi party view this routine as an endorsement of their policies, since the idea of a human and a gorilla in love is patently foolish, or would they understand that the MC's question had truly moved the audience in spite of the veneer of absurdist comedy? The music of \"Cabaret\" underlines the plot points in very bold strokes, but it works because everything is so unabashedly theatrical. Matching Joel Grey's achievement and far outshining a weak turn from Michael York, Liza Minnelli gives an all-time great performance, particularly in the songs \"Mein Herr\" and the title tune.","user":"antagonist117","rank":[12,13]},{"title":"Perfect On All Levels","rating":10,"date":"20 November 1999","review":"On a historical level, a personal-story level, and as pure entertainment \"Cabaret\" works perfectly.                                       The scene is Berlin, Germany, only two years before Hitler would come to total power. It is the Berlin that Christopher Isherwood lived in and wrote about: poverty, drug and alcohol escapism, criminals, sleazebags, fighting in the streets,  venereal disease, the prostitution of both sexes, the desperation to escape through the film industry, the temporary escape from the harshness of life in \"naughty\" nightclubs like The Kit Kat Club, which encapsulates it all. It's a bad scene, and a good example of, perhaps, why so many Germans felt in need of a Hitler. There's not a single verbal reference to Hitler, and yet the presence of the growing Nazi movement all around these decadent misfits is ever present in this film. But you can't blame any of these apolitical people for that. Liza Minelli and Michael York's characters are so needy, so desperate just to find some personal happiness in life. They can't be bothered with what's going on in the bigger picture.      Except for the Master Of Ceremonies at the Club: Joel Grey's character is a semi-supernatural all-seeing character, mocking, seeming to somehow know EXACTLY the further destruction Germany's headed for. His scary all-knowing grinning face pops in regularly to remind us. The musical number \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\" is so effective an illustration of the appeal this new Nazi hope held for impoverished suffering Germans, and yet we have The Master Of Ceremonies' evil nodding grin to remind us, in retrospect, what it really led to.Just as every musical number (aside from being so beautifully choreographed and presented) reminds us of the desperation in Sally Bowles' life and in most of Germany. \"Money Makes The World Go Around\" is a perfect musical number, and so illustrative of the horrendous financial state of Germany at the time. Joel Grey's raunchy \"Two Ladies\" on the Kit Kat stage to the hysterical delight of the decadent crowd reminds us that all sexual propriety has broken down (including in the lives of the main characters, now involved in a threeway with one of the few Germans who still has some wealth intact).                       Everyone who wants an example of the artistic heights that film can reach should see \"Cabaret\".","user":"joe7","rank":[97,131]}]
