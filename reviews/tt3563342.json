[{"title":"Worth the watch for GenXers! (A fair review)","rating":7,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"\"The Middle of X\" is a good watch for GenX-ers and maybe even their children / aging parents. It is a dialogue heavy light-drama. The story aims at a very specific audience but if you look past the type of characters there are life messages for people of all walks of life.<br><br>The production has an indie look which is basic in some places but holds well overall. The writing shows flashes of an authentic voice but sometimes gets weighed down with too much tell don't show.<br><br>There are a lot of characters/actors, but somehow they all fit in. Colin Egglesfield and Nicky Whelan were OK as the leads but there are some strong supporting performances by Ronnie Blevins and Jason Grey stanford.<br><br>I don't usually spend time reviewing anything online but a couple of the reviews here felt like Trolls an haters so I thought a fair write up was needed.<br><br>Overall it's a good movie, not great, but the ending stuck with me.","user":"StephenHinks24","rank":[28,30]},{"title":"Simplicity Among Disstraction","rating":8,"date":"24 September 2018","review":"My title sums up my review. Its quiet, like a stage play. The actors give their performances in long, un edited scenes that might be boring for most over stimulated viewers but there was something refreshing about it for me.","user":"PaulOrbeck","rank":[20,21]},{"title":"Loved it!","rating":9,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"A real story for once. No contrived characters serving up politically correct dialogue about the most absurd and sensational situations. Finally someone made a movie for people and situations that I can relate to - thank you!","user":"cynthiabagett","rank":[12,14]}]
