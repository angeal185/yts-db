[{"title":"Disappointed in the lead character","rating":2,"date":"5 September 2018","review":"This movie portrays a girl with strong Christian values who apparently only lives for the potential of getting married. They show a girl who portrays zero independence or strength Outside of men. I was very disappointed.","user":"mjoymarie","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Wtf is this cheesy garbage!","rating":1,"date":"16 September 2018","review":"Horrible.
