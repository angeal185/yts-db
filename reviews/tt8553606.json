[{"title":"Helping someone else to bury your own issues","rating":7,"date":"30 June 2019","review":"This movie focuses on a young girl trying to help an asylum seeker find a way of getting permanent residency in her country, the question is why does she decide to help? With troubles of her own, she may be able to hide them while she tries to help someone else. Until she slips up. We feel the emotion and suffocation the man must feel as he is running out of options to look after himself and his daughter. Great performances from the two main leads and I look forward to their future work. Give this is a watch if you enjoy a tale of struggle and belief of coming out to a better situation on the other side.","user":"lewisblackhall-17157","rank":[6,12]},{"title":"Have you ever see any romantic comedy? Yes? Then you have seen this movie!","rating":5,"date":"17 March 2020","review":"Positives\n+ lead actress does a great job, though at times one note.\n+ cinematography\n+ great cast, bj√∂rkman is always a pleasure.<br><br>Negatives\n<ul><li>really predictable. Follows the basic structure of every romantic comedy ever.</li><li>the jokes for the most part dont land</li><li>this movie has a really big case of \"Finnish movie syndrome\". Meaning this movie doesnt really have any real subtance expect to pander towards people from Finland . It only has to offer a generic movie plot with timely themes (like refugee problem) and finnish cultural elements like saunas and heavy use of alcohol.</li><li>there was this one great character completely wasted. He was a sceptical person that the film makers could have taken in a different and intereresting direction, but they chose to put him in the finnish angle trap, where the character only became a catalyst of finnish culture.</li></ul><br><br>TL;DR<br><br>Enjoyable movie that offers nothing new to the genre, and which does or says nothing that has not been done in superior movies.","user":"matias-herajarvi","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"OPPOSITES ATTRACT SIMPLE LOVE-STORY with stand-out lead performance","rating":7,"date":"1 December 2019","review":"Still attempting to obtain some semblance of insight into the Finnish nation through its film presentations, recently threw up this delight of which must be highly recommended as a simple, but, yes, just delightful, love-story of opposites attract, if only for being led by a superb affecting tour de force performance by the blonded* beautiful newcomer** Mimosa Wilmona (*previously was brunette! **Up and coming won own country's Oscar (the 'Jussi') in debut performance in 2015, supporting role in 'Headfirst (Pain Seinaa' ..) in the titular role.<br><br>Following the seeming standard Finnish storyline of late trope, of refugee / immigrant / outsider (foreigner!) meets Finnish dreariness (e.g. see 'East of Sweden') but enlivened with cut dry humour (e.g. see Kaurismaki: 'The Other Side of Hope') but with the redeeming renowned independent spirit of the Finn femme***, the tale unfolds in more or less standard 'will they or won't they' telling, but paced on its way to its predictable outcome with such affection, and even if still being predicated on the apparently de rigeuer Finnish plot-driving device of problem boozing (as always!)****, to still leave you unmistakably uplifted.<br><br>*** in this one's Finn femme respect, along the way you also get some associated Finnish female characterisations (young AND old!) along with requisite feminism takes, e.g. soon in with advice from heroine Aurora (Mimosa), which if not because apparently still needs so stating, as still not obvious, on how ALL women should - and should not be - treated, would otherwise be patronising to its menfolk audience.\nBut presumably that's Finland with its potential boorish male mores needing reminding for them all there, I suppose.\n**** Although, now if the beau's from Iran, doesn't that mean he's likely - culturally, automatically - Muslim, by which means he's also likely, mandatorily, teetotal .. or am I just being 'religioustist'?!<br><br>This is a heartwarming simple love story of opposites attract with its painful sides leavened with some top laugh out loud moments in its telling - (check out the Mummi-mug 'mummo' fan scene; hilarious = thus, all kudos to (female!) Miia Tervo for her scripting, as well as directing, it, too.)","user":"Bofsensai","rank":[1,2]}]
