[{"title":"A Beautiful Film","rating":10,"date":"22 November 2019","review":"I'm going to be honest, I was skeptical of this movie from the start, but boy am I glad I was wrong. I have adored Mister Rogers since I was a young girl &amp; I didn't like the idea of someone else playing him. But Tom Hanks truly embodied Fred's spirit &amp; presence to the point where I almost forgot it wasn't Mister Rogers!<br><br>This movie used so many small moments in big ways that were gut-wrenching &amp; raw. It makes you feel seen &amp; exposed in a way that is humbling. Mr. Rogers has always inspired me to grow &amp; become the best version of myself possible &amp; I'm ecstatic that A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood does his name justice. Truly a joy to behold.","user":"bellasings-47917","rank":[250,279]},{"title":"You'll Know It When It Happens","rating":9,"date":"24 November 2019","review":"The most powerful 60 seconds in cinematic history.\nThe deafening roar of silence.","user":"Jakarejo","rank":[364,415]},{"title":"The movie that makes you want to be a better person","rating":10,"date":"19 November 2019","review":"This is the exact movie we all need to watch right now about forgiveness and compassion. I absolutely loved it. It was just so so good. Both Mathew and Tom both deserve Oscar recognition for their phenomenal performance. I truly recommend this movie for everyone. It makes you think about yourself.","user":"pawarankita","rank":[225,256]}]
