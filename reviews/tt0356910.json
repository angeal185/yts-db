[{"title":"Good","rating":7,"date":"23 February 2020","review":"It may be unfair to say, but its easily admitted that the most interesting ploy this film can rely on was the media storm surrounding \"THE affair\" that led to \"THE Hollywood couple to be\" Brangelina. As a matter of fact, the film is actually rather good and the playful yet genuine chemistry berween Pitt and Jolie excuses the ludicrous plot and reliance on marketing gimmicks. The film really isn't a serious one, but it is a sexy one.","user":"MR_Heraclius","rank":[39,40]},{"title":"Entertaining as Hell!","rating":9,"date":"6 September 2010","review":"This is a daaaamn fun movie! Heh. To all the critics, yes, there are a lot of explosions, gunfire, unrealistic battles, plenty of times where you think \"they MUST have been hit by a bullet by now..there is noo effin way...\", and over-dramatized violence, but there's plenty of good stuff too that should not be ignored.<br><br>Probably the best part about this movie is the couple. I know it's been said before, but it's so true that I'm gonna repeat: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have incredible chemistry. It's no wonder they're still together today. Even when the movie couple, John and Jane Smith, where in their \"off period\" of marriage, you could feel something between the two. They are an amazing screen couple, they work incredibly well together. Their dialogue is just right...when one says something to the other, it's smooth and real. And of course, Pitt and Jolie are both extremely attractive, so they're fun to watch. Haha.<br><br>The plot is all right..nothing extraordinary. It's a typical action movie plot, simple enough to leave plenty of room for the battle shots and violence. Nothing special. The dialogue wasn't bad, it wasn't lame action movie words. No stupid puns or anything. There was really nice cinematography, some shots that really were stunning. Usually the emotional aspect of action movies is dense and easy, clich√© and boring, but I liked it in this movie. You could tell that they really loved each other, yet at the same time were committed to their jobs. You could feel the conflict.<br><br>I own this movie and I'm glad I do. It's a good time. I recommend it.","user":"carljessieson","rank":[84,116]},{"title":"Energetic action flick, somewhat wonky near the end","rating":7,"date":"21 September 2009","review":"Since going through most recent action movies is like chewing through cardboard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is pleasantly energetic for an action flick. Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith is good fun, and does a decent job of satisfying the occasional need for summer-movies.<br><br>The effectiveness of the film lies in the exploration of what happens to a failing marriage when the couple are at their wits end ... and ... for the first time, come to realize that the other is a professional assassin ... and ... subsequently push the ceiling on what is termed 'spousal abuse' ... and ... of course, get to play with guns.<br><br>The success of the film, however, lies in how Jolie and Pitt actually bother to exercise some of their acting talent. They look like they are having fun, and genuinely enjoy the other (surprise! surprise!). The chemistry is good, and the actors are super sexy, which is always a plus for any film.<br><br>The movie fails, naturally, when the ending summarily degenerates into what is expected of action-fare, the shootouts, gun battles, and kisses. Enjoyable, nonetheless, even on its final wonky legs.<br><br>(Note: it is also a shame that in a film with so much shooting that no one gets to shoot Mr. Vince Vaughn. My, is that guy a terrible actor who can't resist hiding himself.)","user":"Sparrowhisperer","rank":[33,44]}]
