[{"title":"A Second-Hand, Second-Rate Copy of the English Version","rating":22,"date":"22 March 2006","review":"This perfunctory German version of MURDER, filmed at the same time on the same sets but with a mostly different cast, is 28 minutes shorter than the English version! It leaves out all of the touches that make the English version enjoyable, and also leaves out some of the clues that lead to the murderer. Some of the things left out are: the jury member who hasn't a clue; the jury foreman having difficulty getting the ballots in the right piles; the jury filing out from the jury room into the court and Sir John waiting before getting up and joining them; the servant bringing the radio into the bathroom, and the colloquy with the servant at that point; the interior monologue is much shorter; dialogue in the scene immediately after is shorter (also, the bathroom and subsequent scene are sequenced wrong so that it seems he's shaving again after he finished); the landlady isn't present when the couple get the call from Sir John, and so the byplay about them owing the rent is not there; their frantic dressing and spiffing up for the Sir John visit; the shot of the stage manager's feet in a super-soft carpet, showing what it feels like to him; the scene where they look at the parlor with landlady is much shorter (and comes after scene where they look at her bedroom); tricking the landlady by using a high-pitched voice; Hitchcock's appearance in the street; tipping the theatre manager after they inspect the theatre; the scene with all the kids is much shorter, with the cat under the covers eliminated (same kids, though); the kids don't sit on the trunk, so the dialogue about the policeman's uniform in the trunk must not be there; the striking overhead shot of Mary in her cell, and the shadow of the noose; Sir John's scene with Mary is shorter, colder, and they don't talk about the theatre at the end; the scene of Sir John and the stage manager in the circus audience, where they talk about trapping the murderer with a Hamlet-like play is much shorter; when the murderer hangs himself, there's a somewhat more dramatic sound editing, perhaps to cover up the fact that he doesn't make a very good noose; the murderer carried out on a stretcher; the sequence of Sir John and Mary in the train is shorter; and the shot of the characters on stage at the end. Some of the jokes are still there but presented in so rudimentary a fashion that one would hardly notice. For example, when Sir John notices that his guest is using a small spoon for the soup, he does the same, and when he puts his martini olive on the tray, the guests don't know what to do with theirs; both these incidents still occur but with no reactions from the actors to point up the gags. Abel looks a lot like Marshall, which is very disconcerting because that British upper-class attitude that informs every aspect of the English version is completely lacking. The stage manager is an expressionless nonentity in this version. It's a second-hand, second-rate copy all through. One can hardly believe Hitchcock himself directed this totally lacking, colorless run-through of his delightful MURDER. You may never get a chance to see this one, which may frustrate Hitchcock completists, but, really, there's absolutely no reason to see it, even if you only understand German! See MURDER a second time instead.","user":"bensonj","rank":[25,27]},{"title":"Historic exhibit","rating":6,"date":"3 September 2007","review":"I agree that \"Mary\" is weaker in several aspects that \"Murder!\", although they were produced in parallel on the same sets, just with different actors.<br><br>But from the cinematic history point of view, to have both versions (such parallel movies were made only in a short time frame c. 1930-33, between introduction of sound, and the availability of post-production dubbing) allows some insight in the cultural differences.<br><br>I read somewhere that the German actors wanted more changes made, but Hitchcock refused. One was obvious for me: the dark secret of the lover was not that he was \"half-caste\" (Murder!), but \"an escaped convict\" (Mary). And there may be more subtle ones.<br><br>For entertainment, just watch \"Murder!\" (which also has a German dub by now). For earnest study of the parallel producing of movies, watch \"Murder!\" and then \"Mary\" as double-feature ...","user":"suchenwi","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"To drink or not to drink","rating":7,"date":"20 May 2009","review":"The Hitchcock/Truffaut book,which is actually a very long interview ,something like \"the Beatles anthology\" in pop music ,gives us many interesting informations about \"Mary\" ,a movie the master liked.Although he told Truffaut he detested the whodunits ,those riddles a la Agatha Christie,\"Mary\" featured \"things we did for the first time\":stream of consciousness,play in the play a la \"Hamlet\" references to transvestism and even hints at (veiled) homosexuality,which was a \"crime\" in Great Britain as it was in Germany at the time....<br><br>That said,the story drags on a bit and the running time could have been boiled down to one hour,which would have enhanced the really good scenes: IT was Herbert Marshall's first talkie and the scene when he's shaving and thinking for a clue renews the way the detective investigates.The unfinished manuscript is also a very good idea.But the bravura passage remains the final circus.One can also note the scene of the verdict we hear from the empty juror's room.<br><br>There are elements which would appear later in Hitchcock's work: the theater (\"Stage fright\",also a whodunit,btw),of course \"Psycho\" (a man in drag) and \"vertigo\" (the finale which makes you feel dizzy).<br><br>This is another early Hitchcock which is not only for completists.","user":"dbdumonteil","rank":[10,13]}]
