I was pleasantly surprised by the high-quality, of not only the film but of the actors/actresses themselves. The chemistry is beautiful, and I felt as if I was watching a real family experiencing real situations. I look forward to seeing more from this creative group!","user":"trent-26676","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Fun movie to watch!","rating":10,"date":"22 July 2019","review":"It's remarkable how a quality movie can still be made with a small budget.
