[{"title":"Excellent and a unique documentary film","rating":10,"date":"25 May 2014","review":"That was a fascinating movie on which you can easily feel the background outstanding effort to make it happen. It includes great messages regarding \"living all together peacefully with every different person/people/group, etc\" which we all need indeed. Having chance to see people living with the idea of \"Love is a verb\" from different part of the world and getting know them closely, I can say, was a wonderful opportunity for me. There are some people in the world, and they are working really hard without avoiding sacrifices from themselves to make other's life happier. To live for the others...That is awesome! <br><br>I have enjoyed a lot with my wife to the extent I felt like it was really short when we reach to the end. I'm very grateful each and every person making any effort in any part of the production.","user":"mustafatosur","rank":[62,89]},{"title":"Living for other what ever religion they are","rating":10,"date":"25 November 2014","review":"This is the best documentary i have watched not only because of the director but also the main character Fethullah Gulen is one of the 21st centuries idol.This documentary really explains the Hizmet movement and their ideology.I suggest this to everyone.<br><br>Please watch and suggest this to your friends.Especially the best main part is you can live for others and if you wonder how this movement shows good example.<br><br>Thank you to the director Terry Spencer Hesser for the amazing production.<br><br>She is the best!","user":"fidan255","rank":[33,68]},{"title":"Love is a verb!","rating":10,"date":"8 February 2015","review":"One of the most open minded movement and a movement that has tolerance against everyone no matter who you are, what you do! full of sincere and mutual respect and far far away from political affairs. An a movement that has diagnosed that the cure for a peace world is dialog and tolerance against each other and a movement who has millions of supporters around the world and dedicated to education and democrat life! Long live democracy every where and long live dialog and tolerance around the world and hope a peaceful world for all humanity! I alway think that our world needs dialog and interfaith gatherings to solve the problems no matter who is who, its important to know each other and break the prejudices that is the main cause of clashes in the world we live and our children will live!","user":"fahihim","rank":[31,64]}]
