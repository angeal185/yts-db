[{"title":"Fast paced John Hughes Style romp","rating":7,"date":"6 May 1999","review":"A fun little film in the mould of the great 1980's teen comedies which used to star the likes of Rob Lowe, John Cusack and Ally Sheedy!! This film is enjoyable from the off,  although the subject may be a little touchy as it centres on a High School youth (Will Friedle) who desperately fancies the school beauty (Marley Shelton)and somehow manages to arrange a study date with her at her house. After a while things progress well enough until he finds himself without a condom!. Where can he get one from at this time?, can he get back while she is still interested?, his journey takes him all over the city and gets him in to some side-splittingly funny situations and scenarios along the way. Stand out is Jennifer Love Hewitt as Friedles best friend who is madly in love with him without him realising!","user":"rob-236","rank":[13,14]},{"title":"Cute little JLH vehicle","rating":9,"date":"17 June 1999","review":"This cute little film had one primary purpose: provide more exposure for Jennifer Love Hewitt, and encourage folks to watch her disappointing \"Last Summer\" flicks at the multiplex.<br><br>Well, something went terribly wrong with that simple plan, because along the way an amazingly enjoyable film got made. Will Friedle (of TV's \"Boy Meets World, and at the time JLH's real-life boyfriend) plays a likable high school student who lucks out when the adorable little blonde he's tutoring (the sadly underexposed Marley Shelton) decides to give him a break.<br><br>As he frantically takes Los Angeles apart searching for a condom (yes, that's what \"Trojan\" in the title refers to) his best bud JLH is realizing she wants to be more than just friends. Aside from the horrible case of envy I developed (Will Friedle got to kiss JLH both on and off-screen!) I had a lot of fun watching the result.<br><br>If you're a parent, the additional good news is that this is one of the few flicks out there (surprisingly) in which the characters don't jump into bed without practising safe sex. That shows that at least there's SOME hope for Hollywood.","user":"Criz","rank":[10,11]},{"title":"Better than I expected.","rating":15,"date":"15 October 1999","review":"What could be more entertaining than watching a teenage boy running around looking for a condom. I quite enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. Maybe it's because I expected it to be crap. Even though there were parts of this movie that were somewhat cheesy, I never for a second wanted to end the experience.","user":"Kektokio","rank":[14,18]}]
