[{"title":"Get out of my Dreams, Get Into My Car! Oh yeah! 80's bliss...","rating":7,"date":"8 November 2006","review":"License To Drive was one of those 80's flicks that I had always wanted to see, and yet, never could find a copy. Till now! It was playing on TV recently and I have not only watched it, but am waiting to see if I am fortunate to find the DVD so I can buy it.<br><br>Quite simply, if you are a fan of the 80's and/or love your nostalgia then this film is for you! Typical 80's groove, lingo, starring leads (introducing a young and very attractive Heather Graham in her screen debut as the delicious Mercedes Lane) and, something that definitely deserves a mention is the soundtrack! Great tunes that suit the mood perfectly. Billy Ocean's \"Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car\" was a highlight and with the title \"License to Drive\" was the ultimate song. There are others by Belinda Carlise and the Breakfast Club that will have you not only reminiscing, but toe tapping and humming as well.<br><br>Also, look out for James Avery as Les' DMV Instructor. What a champion! Anyway everyone, Get Outta Your Seats... Get it into your DVD player...<br><br>Have fun, Cheers!","user":"indescreetman","rank":[15,16]},{"title":"An innocent girl. A harmless drive. What could possibly go wrong?","rating":6,"date":"9 April 2004","review":"Feast your eyes one of the last films that both Corey's will appear in that are of any merit for the rest of their brief careers. And this can be considered something of merit, despite the nature of the film, since they were only teen stars. <br><br>License to Drive is a movie about taking chances, though you can probably figure out from beginning to end how the movie is going to go. No less, it's good 80s fun. Les Anderson (Haim) has turned 16 and is desperate to get his driver's license. Over-confident, it is no surprise that he flunks the exam. But he figures no one would notice. So, he lies to his folks and friends about the whole thing, expecting everything will be smooth sailing until he can retake the exam. <br><br>But Les is wrong once again when his parents learned that he lied, serving up a harsh two week grounded term. But Les doens't know when to quit while he's ahead, and decides he's not going to let this little matter inconvenience him. After all, he has a Friday night date with his dream girl Mercedes Lane (Heather Graham). Hence the line, \"an innocent girl, a harmless drive, what could possibly go wrong?\" Everything. It all has to do with Les borrowing his grandfather's antique (and very off limits) Caddillac, a drunk date, and two friends looking for their newly licensed friend to show them a wild night. Sure it's predictable, but it's just a simple 80s comedy.","user":"vertigo_14","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Still Very Funny","rating":7,"date":"27 October 2015","review":"The sixteen year-old Les Anderson (Corey Haim) has a crush on his schoolmate Mercedes Lane (Heather Graham), but he is shy and she has a boyfriend, Paolo (M.A. Nickles), who has a fancy car. Les and his twin sister Natalie Anderson (Nina Siemaszko) are preparing to the driving test and while Natalie studies the questions, he does not pay attention to them. Les fails the test but is not brave enough to tell neither to his father Mr. Anderson (Richard Masur) nor to his pregnant mother Mrs. Anderson (Carol Kane) and his best friends Dean (Corey Feldman) and the clumsy Charles (Michael Manasseri). When Mercedes has an argument with Paolo, she invites Les to date her to make Paolo jealous. Meanwhile Les' parents discover that he has flunked his driver's test and they ground him. However, when Mercedes calls him asking if they are not going to date, Les sneaks away from his house and drives his grandfather's Cadillac that is parked in the garage to date Mercedes in the beginning of a nightmarish night of adventures.<br><br>\"License to Drive\" is a comedy from the 80's still very funny after almost thirty years. This is one of the best roles of Corey Haim in the top of his career immediately after the cult \"Lost Boys\" and \"Lucas\" and the debut of Heather Graham. The plot would be considered \"politically incorrect\" in the present days but fortunately it was not a problem in 1988. My vote is seven.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Sem Licen√ßa para Dirigir\" (\"Without License to Drive\")<br><br>Note: On 12 October 2018 I saw this film again.","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[7,7]}]
