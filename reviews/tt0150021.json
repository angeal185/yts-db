[{"title":"Camouflaaaa.....","rating":13,"date":"13 January 2009","review":"'Camouflage' fails to deliver the goods. It pretty much has the required ingredients but the treatment is a let down. Not that I was expecting much other than a few laughters since it has Leslie Nielsen and Lochlyn Munro but the jokes fall flat and nothing the actors do can save that. The film sticks to the main plot most of the time but there are a few scattered plot holes and it is lacking in style and energy. The flat cinematography and poor soundtrack do nothing in its favour. It tends to drag most of the time. Of the cast, Lochlyn Munro stands out as he is the only one who breathes some life into the movie. Leslie Nielsen is let down by an underwritten role and appears more a caricature. Ditto with Vanessa Angel who isn't given much to do in the first place. Thus, there is no surprise in 'Camouflage'. It is just another half-baked wannabe comedy thriller.","user":"Chrysanthepop","rank":[9,10]},{"title":"Entertaining and funny movie with the great Leslie Nielsen","rating":5,"date":"10 July 2005","review":"The picture deals with a unsuccessful actor called Marty Mackenzie (Lochlyn Munro) who takes a work along with a botcher as well as crusty private detective named Jack Porter (Leslie Nielsen). They both take on an assignment and go to a seedy small town ,¨Beaver Ridge¨(in rural Oregon), where a killer is attempting to murder a rich owner who is cared by a beautiful girl (Vanessa Angel) . Mackenzie and P.I. Porter realize that investigating is not as it seemed to be , as they discovers a dark side . While a rugged sheriff (William Forsythe) meddles in their investigations . <br><br>It's an agreeable movie but uneven comedy . The film blends humor, suspense , giggles , tongue-in-cheek and is quite amusing . However , there're lots of gaps in the storyline and results to be badly narrated . The movie is a spoof but is different to previous Nielsen films . Thus , the humor is moderated , the characters aren't as excessive or lunatic as ¨Naked gun¨ , ¨Wrongfully accused¨, ¨Spy hard¨ or ¨Mr.Magoo¨ . The picture obtained limited success , it attained a few money at the box office and in a lot of countries was direct to video . The screenwriter was Billy Bob Thornton who is much better like actor because the plot is average . The film was regularly directed by James Keach (he is also better actor than director) . The motion picture will appeal to comedy enthusiasts and Leslie Nielsen fans .","user":"ma-cortes","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"The worst movie I have without a doubt ever seen! An insult to Leslie Neilson's Filmography","rating":31,"date":"31 December 2006","review":"What starts out as a promising film quickly turns into a winding nightmare of a motion picture. The main character Marty (Lochlyn Munro) is a failed playwright who is the main star in all of his productions. I couldn't have said it better than one of the characters in the movie; \"It sucked!\". Marty meets up with Detective Jack Potter (Leslie Neilson) and from there it goes downhill. It starts off slow, little or no comedy, and then the only \"comedy\" it does show happens to be a crazy woman, whom, in her rant, speaks of Elvis and Bigfoot and George Washington being a convicted felon (?). All in all, skip this movie. If you're a Leslie Neilson fan, its disappointing. Heck, if you're even a MOVIE fan, this is disappointing.","user":"Ryaniskool","rank":[13,20]}]
