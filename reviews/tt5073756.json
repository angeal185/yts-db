[{"title":"Excellent Dialogue and Acting","rating":8,"date":"3 September 2018","review":"If you go into this movie expecting some kind of crazy plot twist or need to be entertained by a lot of action and simple dialogue you'll be disappointed. <br><br>This movie is well written with a good plot and excellent acting. The movie is filled with meaningful and seemingly organic conversation. <br><br>It is somewhat rare to see a movie with a single father and it was refreshing. <br><br>Highly recommend.","user":"alexbyers","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"This is an awesome movie.","rating":10,"date":"12 September 2018","review":"This film brilliantly captures real human emotion, through a broad range of interesting characters. The acting is excellent and it reminds us of all the mistakes we make - children and parents alike - especially when emotions run high. Best of all, it reminds us how unwavering love can help overcome almost anything. Based on this, I will happily watch any movie that John Abrahams makes.","user":"jackplym-30944","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Phenomenal Film","rating":10,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"No idea why the critics gave it a 5/10 stars! It's not what I expected and a great film with drama, comedy, and a whole lot of heart. At a distance, some of my male friends deemed it a \"chic lick\", but after watching it, they stood corrected and thought it was an excellent movie. The people in this film, both behind the scenes and in front of the camera, convey how the tragedy of 9/11 can affect a person and their loved ones. Furthermore, it shows that life doesn't turn out the way you expect it to, how humans persevere, and embrace the silver lining during hard times.","user":"ria282003","rank":[3,6]}]
