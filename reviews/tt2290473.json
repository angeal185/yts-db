[{"title":"Has the basis of a clear classic horror story but lacks innovation and the production to create an enjoyable watch.","rating":2,"date":"20 March 2017","review":"The movie promises a natural horror classic and seems to deliver very little. There is limited soundtracks and suspense building effects throughout which appear needed due to lack of action. The characters do have basic relationships yet the production does not enable you to get attached to any character who encounters perils. <br><br>Themes which run through the movie are typical of horror films but resemble a stew with all the ingredients, lacking the quality and kick needed for enjoyment. The title whilst clear, does not leave much room for thought which is always nice to challenge the viewer and maintain their interest. For a film in one setting there is very limited storyline so perhaps the movie would benefit from more plot and scenery progression throughout. <br><br>Overall there are too many areas, if not all, which need considerable development in order to make the film a success. The basic story does however possess part of the bones of a sturdy classic horror but lacks USP and the production to drive the movie to an exciting watch. The ending is better than the beginning while quality and plot throughout remains consistently monotonous.","user":"bhattrell","rank":[2,2]},{"title":"Time Consumption","rating":4,"date":"1 October 2016","review":"A low budget horror where a few friends get together at a cottage for a relaxing weekend. Everyone coming on the trip has a lot more baggage then they came with which takes its toll. An unseen force starts to prey on their weaknesses.<br><br>Right near the beginning there is a scene where one of the friends is burying his mom who happens to be in several pieces wrapped in plastic. When he gets back to the cabin his mom is there with his friends talking to them so you get a feel that this place isn't normal.<br><br>The special effects are cheap but still look decent. There is a lot going on at times with all the different characters issues being addressed which may be confusing at times. I thought this was a mediocre outing. You won't miss much if you don't see it.","user":"shawnblackman","rank":[4,6]},{"title":"What the...........","rating":1,"date":"8 April 2019","review":"Late at night... the movie said the Utah mountains... I grew up in Utah so I thought, what the heck, I would give it a try. Halfway through I turned it off, thinking what the heck was that all about. I then saw somebody gave it 7 stars with spoilers. Perfect, I thought. Maybe a clue as to what it's about. The reviewer had over 500 reviews. After troweling through 300 without finding the one I wanted, I gave up looking. Thought to myself, this poor soul needs to find a life.<br><br>So, my view of the movie. To begin with I doubt the two lead males could have possibly hooked up with the female leads. The girls were attractive and... well I'll leave it at that. Second, the IMDb review said the movie had a budget of 3 million dollars. Come on. Maybe $600.00 dollars to rent the mountain condo. Another $300.00 for a rental car and a hundred bucks for gas. Miscellaneous costs couldn't have been but a few thousand at most. So if this thing cost 3 million, and I was an investor, I would definitely want to see all the receipts.<br><br>In all honesty... the movie was horrible.","user":"pahvou","rank":[0,0]}]
