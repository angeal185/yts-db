[{"title":"I kinda love this movie","rating":10,"date":"10 March 2020","review":"Yes it's an indie and a good one, good little story, really nice production values, good shooting and editing, ok some of the side plots were meh and it could have lost 10mins but all the performance's were very good and lets talk about the lead \"Garland Scott\" wow good job. Nice flix.","user":"reinaproductions","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Pleasantly surprised. Gritty, low-key small film with strong, realistic feeling performances...Felt similar to Ghost Dog Way Of The Samurai in many ways...","rating":7,"date":"26 December 2019","review":"Never heard of this film and it seems few others have as well given the lack of reviews here on imdb. Which is a shame because this little film about redemption after a lifetime of crime is worth a viewing. Populated with actors I have never seen before, everyone comes through with taut, genuine feeling performances, backed up by dialog that feels real as well.<br><br>This is no over the top cartoon movie about dangerous people doing dangerous things with cheesy dialog and Fast &amp; Furious fantasy stunts.<br><br>Garland Scott turns in a very strong performance as a recently released felon who makes a deal with the authorities, snitching on his former criminal associates in return for early release and a new identity. But Scott's character has a deep sense of devotion to the wife and child he left behind and he risks it all to go back to his old neighborhood to reunite with his family, all the while being hunted by those whom he betrayed. Scott plays the strong, silent type throughout, capable of instant violence yet tempered by a still decent heart.<br><br>As I mentioned in the title, this film to me does have some similarities with the excellent Ghost Dog Way Of The Samurai which featured the breakout performance by the great Forrest Whitaker. Both films are quiet films, avoiding excessive music and score accompaniment which actually lets the actors and movie breathe a bit.<br><br>Technically, the film is similarly low key, shot with competence instead of cinematic trickery.<br><br>The film is far from perfect. But what is there is an old story competently executed and definitely worthy of a viewing.<br><br>I give it strong 7.","user":"mariusar","rank":[10,13]},{"title":"Great Story Filmed in STL","rating":10,"date":"7 March 2020","review":"Overall a solid story with a lot of grit, depth, and emotion, definitely worth watching. Also, it was filmed in St. Louis, something any STL local will appreciate and enjoy seeing.","user":"elzberra","rank":[6,7]}]
