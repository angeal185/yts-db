[{"title":"So slow for a two hours thriller ...","rating":5,"date":"19 April 2019","review":"The idea of the movie is original and has potentials but the script and the directing didn't quite help .. it was a bit slow especially for the first half , then events picked up and you could feel some action going on ,, but still you can also sense some drag ,, though the ending was unexpected ,, so i gotta give them that at least.<br><br>The cast was mediocre,, the two leads , Antonio J Bell and Chinaza Uche did well but they didn't have enough chemistry to make this work .. the other characters were just okay ,,<br><br>final judgment, really good concept with below average effort by Faraday Okoro... could've done more.","user":"Aktham_Tashtush","rank":[3,4]},{"title":"Good film","rating":10,"date":"19 April 2019","review":"I don't always give Nigerian movies a try, but this won my heart from the beginning. I enjoyed the manner the plot develops, the acting was genuine and serious.\nThe subtle sound tracks gives the film an endearing score. I know it's not 100% giving it's an African movie rocking an African budget but the directing was really fine and intentional, the editing was professional cut. Overall I advise potential viewers to give it a chance:","user":"rossking-89344","rank":[4,8]}]
