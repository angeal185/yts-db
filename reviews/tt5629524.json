[{"title":"What?????","rating":1,"date":"24 March 2019","review":"The dubbing was absolutely the worst I've ever seen, I don't know if the lead was good or not because the voice over was the worst thing I've ever heard, couldn't get thru it!! This is the lowest rating I've ever given and for people to give this a 10 should be banned from this website unless they're kin to someone that had something to do with this movie, then you would be forgiven and just put on probation. I'm turning the channel as we speak, so I'm sorry is I offended anyone but a rating of 8 or more WHAT THE....??????","user":"martyverhagen-38195","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Who funded this??","rating":2,"date":"15 April 2018","review":"Some of the worst acting i have ever seen. Someone did fund this movie, but all the money was put in to special effects. So a guy owe some bad people some money and he gets his hands on someone who can plant ideas in other peoples mind, and wants to use him for a con ?? The other one can change the physical state of objects and wants to help him with the con why ? This movie is just a huge disaster, actor wise and storywise. +1 for some ok effects.","user":"strand-3","rank":[39,54]},{"title":"What a mess","rating":2,"date":"14 May 2018","review":"This movie is all over the place. The storyline is really bad, makes no sense,and you can clearly see that the script wasnt written right. You can clearly see that it was inspired by Ocean's eleven, Inception,and Marvel and DC movies all at the same time, and the result of that is complete chaos. Many dialogs don't make sense at all.","user":"i-radakovic992","rank":[26,36]}]
