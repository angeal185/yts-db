[{"title":"I don't hate it....","rating":8,"date":"7 April 2020","review":"I hate Christmas Romance movies of all strips. I'm only 20 minutes in to this one...and is i kinda okay. Noticeable good writing...acting...pacing. I actually want to know how this all wraps up. The characters are believable and interesting...the dialogue is snappy and fun and kinda realistic. I'm shocked. Maybe I am in the early stages of a stroke, but I really really don't hate it.","user":"LeatherCajun","rank":[0,0]},{"title":"Non PG13 Hallmark movie.","rating":5,"date":"17 March 2020","review":"I've read every book in the Heartbreaker Bay series. I love the characters. Every single character. Jill Shalvis' books are my comfort books. So, I finally came around and decided to watch this. It was kind of disappointing.\nOne is not supposed to compare the movie to the book. The book will always be better, and you cannot certainly fit a 300 hundred page book or so into a one hour and a half movie.<br><br>Generally speaking it was okay, they included all the important events. (at least the ones I remember, I read this book like three years ago). I liked Willa's character, I think it was very well casted. It was Keane's character that disappointed me. I didn't like him. I'm sorry.<br><br>My major disapointment was the lack of Elle and Archer. I love Elle and all friends. I KNOW it was not their story to tell. But I would have love to see more of Elle, Rory, Archer and Spence. (Who in the books are mostly inseparable)<br><br>Basically this was a Hallmark movie with a hot makeout and sex scenes.","user":"MIssM19","rank":[0,1]}]
