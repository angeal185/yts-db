[{"title":"Powerful and Provocative, Brilliantly Acted","rating":10,"date":"20 June 2013","review":"Let's be clear: This is not an easy movie to watch. Like Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? or (more recently) Carnage, Between Us almost seems to revel in exposing the nastier side of human nature. We're given a ringside seat at an emotional slugfest as a pair of (nominally friendly) couples eviscerate themselves and each other at a series of ill-advised dinner parties. Once the wine starts to loosen tongues and inhibitions, verbal sparring quickly escalates into full-on psychological warfare -- the 'take no prisoners' kind. And trust me: There's more genuine violence in this movie than the entire third act of Man of Steel -- it's just that here the characters are clobbered with words, not skyscrapers.<br><br>In short: If you like Who's Afraid...? and Carnage, then Between Us is a must-see.","user":"Spats007","rank":[19,25]},{"title":"Between Us Worth Seeing","rating":8,"date":"6 June 2013","review":"BETWEEN US is about two sets of grad school friends, now married for years and living in different regions of the country, reunited for a weekend. &nbsp;Sharyl and Joel, the Midwesterners, had \"made it\" financially. &nbsp;They showed off their wealth and what it bought, but Carlo and Grace quickly learned that money didn't buy them everything...happiness was most definitely missing. &nbsp;The wine was endlessly poured and the acerbic words spilled effortlessly from Joel and Sharyl's mouths. The anger, frustration, resentment, jealousy and even hatred were evident. &nbsp;As the evening progressed, Sharyl and Joel revealed secrets about each other in hateful, spiteful ways. &nbsp;Secrets that should have remained just between the two of them came charging to the uncomfortable forefront. We jump forward in time to two years after this negative night to see how Grace and Carlo's relationship has evolved. Through the use of flashing back to various interactions between the couple over that fateful night, we learn more about what actually occurred. &nbsp; <br><br>\"Between Us\" reminded me in many ways of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf\" &nbsp;with its sarcasm and verbal punches one after another directed to a \"loved one.\" It &nbsp;was a tense and powerful film portraying many marriages and relationships. &nbsp;The reactions and emotions each actor demonstrated were riveting and ultimately believable. &nbsp;The fast paced, overlapping conversational style was realistic as were the topics. The reality of this film, the skilled performances, and the tight script and dialogue made this film gripping. <br><br>Marriage can be a rough road full of pot holes, loose edges, and an occasional boulder placed in the middle. It's how you work together to find a smoother path that determines the success of your marriage. \"Between Us\" showed us the road these two couples traveled.","user":"pampowell5","rank":[13,17]},{"title":"Not to be shared.","rating":1,"date":"24 November 2012","review":"What tries to be an intense, cerebral drama turns out to be anything but in director Dan Mirvish's astonishingly terrible Between Us. If first impressions truly are everything, it appears someone forgot to give the memo to the director and cast, as the film opens with one of the most inexplicably irritating and unnatural dialogue sequences in contemporary film history. For those holding out hopewellthings don't get much better. <br><br>The story centres on two couples; once friends, but now heading in different directions- the offbeat artistic pairing of Carlo (Taye Diggs) and Grace (Julia Stiles) and the wealthy but unhappy Joel (David Harbour) and Sharyl (Melissa George). <br><br>No further synopsis can be provided, though, as the film proves to be utterly plot less right from the outset. The story intermittently jumps between key moments in these characters' lives, providing no valid linkages along the way, instead assuming that audiences will graciously accept multiple sudden breaks in an already disjointed film. <br><br>Each scene feels atrociously recycled, simply putting a different couple in the same troublesome situation. Naturally, this highly predictable fare becomes tired very quickly, as the film persistently fails to demand even the slightest sliver of viewer attention.<br><br>Writers Mirvish and Joe Hortua grossly mishandle any opportunities to develop their characters. All four individuals regularly flip-flop on decisions and established motives, giving a laughably embarrassing air to a film that takes itself far too seriously.<br><br>And yet, none of its aforementioned flaws can trump the disastrous overacting indulged in by each cast member. Harbour leads the pack, coming off as some sort of cringe worthy aberration of Modern Family's Phil Dunphy, with all of the social awkwardness and none of the charm, but make no mistake- the honour of 'worst actor' remains very much a four horse race, culminating in a soppy, borderline intelligence-insulting ending. Avoid with extreme prejudice.<br><br>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.
