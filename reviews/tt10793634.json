[{"title":"Not worth watching","rating":3,"date":"13 November 2019","review":"This movie is a Friday The 13th wanna-be. God knows how many times I rolled my eyes at hearing how many try-hard references there was to the name Cunningham in this. However, being a Jason fan, and tolerating quite a lot of wanna-be and intentionally a tribute to F13th films, this one fails on many levels.<br><br>For starters, the cast is not believable, and I couldn't care less about them. One lead looks like Katherine Tate trying to pull off being a high school student again. Maybe if she was cast in Grease she could get away with it, but her age is as obvious to the veiwer as her non-existent acting skills. Then they have thrown in two guys who look like a cross between Artie Lang and John Belushi, without the charisma, and we're expected to beleive they're sexy leading men that all women can't get enough of. Then there is Poindexter and Mr Sweetchucks son who the plot tried to make you care and feel sorry for, but fails miserably at how forced and lame it was done.<br><br>Despite terrible actors and poor dialog, the cutting of the film seems rushed or unfinished. It cuts between one shot, to a shot that should have had a bit more in between to make it a smooth transition. But no, we get someone trying to drive away from the killer, to the killer hanging on the side of the van like he teleported there. It's just bad, and not even laugh out loud bad.<br><br>The gore effects are really amateurish. Apparently anyone who gets killed in this movie spits blood out their mouth and let's it flow down their chin. Even amatuers know to mix things up, not have everyone's death scene do the same spitting blood out routine.<br><br>With too many rushed cuts and bad edits, probably missing scenes needed, or ran out of money to shoot, mixed with the poor visual effects and pathetic acting, writing, directing, sound department, I can't really say anyone did a good job at anything on this film... Maybe just the cameraman/men. That's about it.<br><br>Even if you don't mind a F13th try-hard rip-off, don't bother with this one. It's not worth your time.","user":"MikeHunt1075","rank":[8,12]},{"title":"My Review Of \"Pickaxe\"","rating":6,"date":"28 December 2019","review":"The story keeps with a classic theme of a supernatural slasher. It is straightforward, methodic and light-hearted. Jeremy Sumrall celebrates those VHS horror tropes from 80's horror with fun enthusiasm. Although the film does have flaws, it is still a commendable ode. It keeps with a simple slice-n-dice format, there is a formidable killer, and plenty of flesh and blood.<br><br>With a couple recognizable indie names attached, \"Pickaxe\" receives some cred. Tiffany Shepis is a indie horror staple. Baldwin does a great job as the sheriff. The rest of the cast don't quite equal these two's performances, but they do well enough to move the story. There is some dialog issues and a few moments that feel contrived. I also found a few of the asthenic scenes tacky, set in a way that takes away from the moment than the intended effect.<br><br>The horror elements of the film are really notable, commendable aspects of the film. It is low budget affair, but the practice choices seemed to be approached with care. Reminiscent of 80's slasher gore films like \"The Burning\" and \"Madman\". I really enjoyed the kill scenes in \"Pickaxe\". Some of the setups to the kill sequences seemed a bit hokey, missing to create an added anticipation, and did more to lower the energy of otherwise cool kills.<br><br>Overall \"Pickaxe\" is a straightforward low budget slasher that only works in the indie horror community. It probably will disappoint mainstream movie goers with its low scale production, indie acting and 'on a dime' practical effects. Still there is some fun gore elements, a strong slasher and cool, creepy atmosphere. Check it out if you dig low budget movie making.","user":"ASouthernHorrorFan","rank":[5,7]},{"title":"Dreadful dull movie","rating":1,"date":"15 December 2019","review":"The first 5 minutes offer potential .The rest is just awful\nAvoid","user":"ewgers","rank":[2,3]}]
