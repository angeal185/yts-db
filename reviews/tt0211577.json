[{"title":"not 'the innocents' but a good one","rating":6,"date":"17 January 2003","review":"This movie is a good adaptation of the novel by henry james 'turn of the screw', thought it is not as scary and intense as the best adaptation of this novel 'the innocents'. First of all, it is quite surprising that this film is the first work of the director antoni aloy, and he managed to cast lauren bacall, harvey keitel and sadie frost, who all develope a correct performance. but ironically all these great actors can't fight with the kids, who act in a perfect way. the direction is quite correct and the cinematography and music are great. unfortunately due to economic problems this film hasn't been released in almost any country, just in spain in a few screens and it hasn't get the recognition it deserves.","user":"javik70","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"Acceptable and luxurious Spanish renditíon based on the vintage novel The turn of the Screw by Henry James","rating":7,"date":"21 September 2019","review":"This known story deals with a governess played by Sadie Frost, who is assigned to care at a far mansion two children named Miles : Nilo Mur or Nilo Zimmerman , and his younger sister Flora : Ella Jones .

It is a visually stunning film that draws you in from the very beginning. This first-time director from Mallorca, Spain, was fortunate to have two powerful actors in his film - Harvey Keitel and Lauren Bacall - and used them both superbly. Bacall's performance was the most impressive as well as the rich costumes and set designs. Nilo Mur, in the role of Miles, was the surprise enchantment of the film. Don't miss it!","user":"panchita_jones","rank":[14,23]}]
