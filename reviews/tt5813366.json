[{"title":"Jackie Chan can't even take a break huh ?","rating":8,"date":"17 February 2018","review":"Keep slamming Bleeding Steel with low score and bad reviews for all I care cause I believe even in the worst movie ever made if it starring Jackie Chan somehow he will make the best out of it and Bleeding Steel is an example .Yeah the movie plot make no sense at all and I couldn't care less about any of the characters but the fact that Jackie Chan still doing his own stunt in his 60s alone is wonderful enough for me not regret buying the ticket","user":"phanthinga","rank":[90,120]},{"title":"Not a 1/10 but not a 10/10","rating":6,"date":"18 October 2018","review":"Over the top critic's need to settle down with the 1/10 rating.\nIts not that bad, but not a box office hit either.\nJackie just keeps the FUN in movies &amp; the dudes in his 60's. \nThis movie being down under has the same feel as one of his 1st hollywood flicks in the 90' which was in australia. I think it was called \"first strike\".","user":"workit_oz","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"The guy is in his 60s, how is he still doing what he's doing?","rating":9,"date":"27 December 2017","review":"REVIEW - BLEEDING STEEL <br><br>The guy is in his 60s, how is he still doing what he's doing? <br><br>Another outing for Jackie Chan and another action film to enjoy without too much thought but enjoyable none the less. <br><br>Interesting story but of course marvellous action and fighting which is what Jackie Chan does so well. <br><br>If your a Chan Fan then watch, nowhere near as great as The Foreigner but a good film in its own right (The Foreigner broke the mould when it came to Chan films and can't be beaten).<br><br>Rating 9 out of 10","user":"markthomassintek","rank":[59,89]}]
