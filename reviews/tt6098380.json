[{"title":"Awful","rating":1,"date":"22 August 2019","review":"This movie got everything wrong. The plot is lazy and unoriginal, the characters are horribly written and horribly acted and the \"special effects\" are incredibly cheap (am I supposed to take those red eyes seriously? I have seen better effects in Goosebumps). Plus the ending makes no sense and the direction is non-existent. I'm baffled that such garbage found its way in the theatres.","user":"lagrecasimone","rank":[12,14]},{"title":"Completely idiotic","rating":1,"date":"10 October 2019","review":"Wow! Where does one start on this stupidity? Beginning had promise but ventured into impossible possession. Don't waste your time","user":"africe","rank":[6,8]},{"title":"Were They Even Trying?","rating":1,"date":"9 September 2019","review":"It always depresses me when I see a movie and recognize that no one involved in making it cared about the movie at all. Normally you'll see it in live-action pet movies or Christian movies but in horror there is normally a producer, or writer or director or heck even a special effects person that gave a damn. Not the case here. It was a waste of time and its very existence is cluttering up the world.","user":"hindy-25645","rank":[5,7]}]
