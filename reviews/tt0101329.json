[{"title":"A worthy sequel to a great classic","rating":19,"date":"19 July 2004","review":"Fievel, the cute little mouse from An American Tail, is going west for Fievel Goes West. This is one of very few sequels that really deserve the title of the original classics. Fievel Goes West may not have as many touching moments as the original, but that's because it's more of a fast-paced western comedy rather than a heartwarming, sometimes tragic tale (tail?) as An American Tail was. <br><br>A by-product of the comedic approach is the look of the movie. Instead of the dark, dull, forbidding color scheme of the first movie, the sequel is supposed to be bright, funny, and altogether welcoming. Thus, you get bright sunshine (sometimes a bit too bright from the characters' point of view) and varied color. The animation hasn't changed all too much, unlike The Land Before Time's sequels for video. The animation retains a bit of Don Bluth's touch, though still a bit different. Altogether, the animation is just about as good as it could be in 1991. <br><br>The film as a whole is a gem, but the one thing truly, wonderfully beautiful thing about Fievel Goes West is James Horner's immortal soundtrack. The songs are just as good as An American Tail, which is saying a lot; besides, you have a brutally edited reprise of \"Somewhere Out There\" from the first film, sung by Tanya. Speaking of Tanya, she's voiced by someone different, presumably to allow for her great singing. For proof, all you need to do is listen to \"Dreams To Dream\". Great though the aspiring singer is, the end credits rendition of the song by the crazy Lindstradt lady is beautiful.<br><br>\nIn Fievel Goes West, our title protagonist is lost on the way to Green River, where he will supposedly find a new lease on life with his family and lots of other hopeful mice. But the dream is shattered when Fievel explores the train, and finds a bunch of cats and a huge spider, led by the smooth talking Cat R. Waul, plotting to befriend the mice before turning them into mouse-burgers by means of a mysterious \"better mousetrap\"! But Fievel is found out, and the spider knocks him off the train, leaving him hopelessly lost in the desert. I thought they might have made up something different, not the whole mouse-gets-lost-must-return-to-family routine. I couldn't help feeling they'd done that before. However, Dom DeLuise returns for a bigger part alongside the legendary canine sheriff Wylie Burp.<br><br>\nSo, overall, what of this sequel? Well, it certainly does the original justice. Yes, it does lack the heart of the original, but having less heart than An American Tail does in no way mean being heartless. Don Bluth might not have had a hand in this, but Fievel Goes West lives up to Bluth's classic story of a little mouse called Fievel.<br><br>Animation-9/10; Story-7/10; Plot-7/10; Comedy-8.5/10 = Overall-8/10","user":"rapt0r_claw-1","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"my favorite movie ever","rating":8,"date":"8 June 2002","review":"This is my absolutely most favorite cartoon movie ever. it has action, romance, adventure, and gun slinging.

Bluth might not be involved in this, but this is one of those rare sequels that manage to be slightly better than the original. It rightfully deserved it's release in theaters, along with Beauty and the Beast. It's got many good things from the original, like the return of the oh-so-adorable Phil Glasser returns as Fievel! And we got new things in store. Like John Marwood Cleese, Monty Pythoneer, and voice of Cat R. Waul. And James Stewart, famous actor of the 1960's. Not to mention that they've upgraded Tanya Mousekewitz to... *cue Wanna B Ur Lovr by Weird Al* *Record scratch, music cuts off* D-d-d... Sorry. Where did I leave off? Oh. Tanya's upgrade. Right. Ahem. She had got herself a little plastic surgery? 'Cause she looks gorgeous in this look! Absolutely beautiful! I mean, she ought to go find a beauty competition, because it's marvelous! Even her makeover doesn't change her! And she's really got her voice! I mean... who voiced her? Jodi Benson? (Cathy Cavadini is the right answer.) If you've seen Disney's 1989 film The Little Mermaid, you can see that Tanya and Ariel have quite a bit in common. The film paved the way for DreamWorks Animation, and films like Shrek, The Prince of Egypt - one of my all-time favorite animated movies - , The Road to El Dorado, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. These films owe it to this fantastic sequel to an already fantastic film. I have seen it on Netflix, but I would want to buy it, and take it with me anywhere I go! It is that good! Adorable, beautiful, well-voice-acted, nicely drawn, well done, Spielberg!","user":"hilemandavid","rank":[3,3]}]
