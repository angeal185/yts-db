[{"title":"The lowest expectations are still too high ...","rating":26,"date":"26 August 2001","review":"If the writers of a movie don't care about the characters inhabiting the world they create, nor the actors portraying them, or the director ostensibly creating a dynamic, well it doesn't seem realistic the audience will care either.  <br><br>To call this movie slapdash is an undeserved compliment--it's likely they figured it was a lost cause and that no amount of work would improve it. That's probably true.  <br><br>Omar Epps isn't a very good actor to begin with, but here he's even worse than usual, mumbling his lines without a clue as to what is going on in the movie.  Giovanni Rabisi seems to have fun with his role, but playing one imbecile after another, one gets the feeling he may not be so much acting as giving a glimmer as to his real personality.  Claire Danes obviously can act, as she showed in \"Little Women\", but here she's dreadful.  Dennis Farina is good in just about anything, but here he's given absolutely no help by the director or the other actors.<br><br>The movie quickly devolves into a series of music videos with bad seventies music intermixed with more modern stuff.  And this squad is not very mod--the opening sequence notes that mod means fashionably dressed, and these guys look like they've been shopping by picking up things strewn on the side of an interstate.  Go elsewhere for entertainment.","user":"sychonic","rank":[32,38]},{"title":"Broken Hip","rating":3,"date":"30 October 2008","review":"The DVD sleeve explains the premise: \"Three problem teens are headed for jail,\" and are \"set to do time until Captain Greer offers them a deal to work for him - undercover.\" The film opens with definitions of the words \"Mod\" and \"Squad\", so you won't have to look them up in the dictionary. For a visual definition of \"Cool\", search for photographs of the original threesome: Michael Cole (as Pete Cochran), Clarence Williams III (as Linc Hayes), and Peggy Lipton (as Julie Barnes). <br><br>One black. One white. One blonde. Once they defined cool.<br><br>The three who make up Scott Silver's version of Aaron Spelling's \"The Mod Squad\" are twentysomethings: Claire Danes (as Julie Barnes), Giovanni Ribisi (as Pete Cochran), and Omar Epps (as Linc Hayes). They aren't able to do much with the material given. Mr. Ribisi's portrayal is the most \"far out\", meaning he digresses most from the original characterization. Ms. Danes romances Josh Brolin (as Billy Waites), who looks like he could be in a re-make of \"Marcus Welby, MD\". You won't believe hefty Michael Lerner dancing with Mr. Epps' \"Linc\". He explains, \"I'm not a fairy, I just like to dance!\" and requests, \"Spin me!\" <br><br>*** The Mod Squad (1999) Scott Silver ~ Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, Omar Epps","user":"wes-connors","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Bad plot, uninteresting movie.","rating":1,"date":"1 February 2000","review":"The mod squad gets started 'after' the formation of the 'Mod Squad' without even bothering to develop any of the characters or show us why anyone is doing what they are doing.<br><br>Moreover, most of the events in the movie seem ancillary to the plot.
