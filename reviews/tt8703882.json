[{"title":"A wonderful indie surprise","rating":10,"date":"11 November 2019","review":"I caught this gem at Other Worlds Austin Film Festival and it was the most charming, most enjoyable film of the fest. This movie was directed by a former editor for Family Guy and you could tell from minute one that the film had a confident, firm grasp on its humor and style. It was funny and sweet and had a wonderful energy. The film delicately balances its tone and humor. Endearing performances abound.<br><br>I don't want to delve into spoiler, it's best discovered. But the plot essentially boils down to a regular guy named Todd who comes face-to-face with himself from another dimension one morning. The other dimension Todd wants his life.<br><br>What transpires from there is gold. Terrific supporting performances. A great story that, while funny, doesn't ever feel glib about its stakes. A terrific ending.<br><br>This is really what you hope to find in an indie.","user":"daco-cinema","rank":[5,9]},{"title":"Not profound but definitely cute","rating":9,"date":"4 April 2020","review":"I really like this kind of movie and this was easy to follow and cute.","user":"qoh-05997","rank":[0,0]}]
