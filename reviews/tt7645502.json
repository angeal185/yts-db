[{"title":"Under rated","rating":8,"date":"28 May 2019","review":"I thought it was a really well put together movie. For not a word of English, I was gripped from beginning to end. Have no idea about the negative reviews. Good story and well done.","user":"fredhoedt","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Brilliant","rating":10,"date":"6 June 2019","review":"As is accustomed with Mr. Chan simply amazingly brilliant...!!","user":"carmena-37500","rank":[4,4]},{"title":"Loved it","rating":10,"date":"4 August 2019","review":"This is more proof that some of the best story telling isn't happening in Hollywood. The entire movie is totally different than anything from 'mainstream' studios. I loved that Jackie Chan played a completely different kind of character than most would expect. The three young central actors were great. Some people might have a problem with subtitled movies but not me. I want to hear the language the movie was written for.","user":"jimvandemoter-50236","rank":[3,3]}]
