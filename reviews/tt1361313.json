[{"title":"A Kline Gem","rating":7,"date":"11 August 2010","review":"Kevin Kline creates the sort of character we haven't seen in a long time, not since Clifton Webb, Noel Coward or even George Sanders, an actor dares to step into the uncomfortable zone with so much wit and panache. He is the reason to see the film and in my book, that's reason enough. Paul Dano is wonderful but he projects a strange feeling. As if he has been removed from the pot a bit too quickly. He doesn't look quite done yet. Thoroughly undercooked. One has the overwhelming feeling, he won't be able to survive in this world. The film, as film, doesn't have the aspirations of Paul Schrader's \"The Walker\" nor its darkness but if you're not put off by a slightly tentative direction, you're in for a treat.","user":"littlemartinarocena","rank":[42,54]},{"title":"Kevin Kline in a witty role again","rating":8,"date":"31 August 2012","review":"Great to see Kevin Kline in a witty role again. Cleverly written lines give some snickers, excellent techniques at times transported me. The physical slapstick was a little off, but the gags made up for it. If you like Kevin Kline, you'll like this movie. Give it a try. It will appeal to the astute mind. The rich old women are entertaining and the glimpses of the other side of life are sensitively done, with tongue in cheek. The metaphor of the pigeons is a clever one observed by Henry (Kevin Kline) himself, in this high-brow yet Oscar Wildeish thrust-and-parry into the world of the Henry and his protégé, the young gentleman. Ending on a feel-good note with the credits rolling to a zany variation of a Marc Bolan written T-Rex number 'Dandy in the Underworld'. 8/10.","user":"mart-burton","rank":[7,7]},{"title":"refreshing laugh","rating":9,"date":"26 November 2010","review":"i saw this movie because I am a John C Reilly fan, however, much to my chagrin, even with his minor role, this gave me many genuine deep \"what the f%$#\" laughs. I also like Paul Dano and think he really played this character well. His look of horror at his woman self was priceless, especially when he had to dodge flying Christmas ornaments from harry. <br><br>it was quirky yet boldly in-touch and the humor spoke to me. It was a movie that I watched by myself on a lonely night and it certainly took me out of my head.<br><br>this is the only movie I have ever watched that I was motivated to write the review for.","user":"imastringbean","rank":[14,16]}]
