[{"title":"Well it is not a bad movie ,, that's the best i can say.","rating":5,"date":"7 October 2018","review":"So the movie's genre supposed to be comedy/drama .. saw a lot of mediocre level of drama and not that funny of stressful comedy.<br><br>I actually expected a lot from Justin Bartha but he didn't really show up ,, i liked his engaging and his dull, i hate this new life face .. but that was it i kinda expected him to put more into the dark comedy .. Bruce Greenwood surprisingly did much better.<br><br>The plot was a bit distracting ,, not original at all watch Due Date (2010) for Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis ,, man that was a \"dad's ashes\" comedy .. now you can compare this to that ,, but still they could have been a bit more original and twist the story some how or spice it up with more comedy.<br><br>final thought .. I wouldn't think of watching if i'd known it would be like htis.","user":"Aktham_Tashtush","rank":[11,15]},{"title":"Unexpected","rating":4,"date":"13 February 2019","review":"Don't expect must. None of the characters are likeable. I really wanted to enjoy this movie. I was sadly disappointed. Watch if you have time to kill.","user":"moniquec823","rank":[3,6]},{"title":"Not so fun to watch","rating":23,"date":"23 January 2020","review":"The story sounds fun, but the film isn't that much fun to watch. The wife is irritating, there are little jokes, and the dialogues are cryptic at times. The emotional elements are inadequately developed, so basically it's not funny or touching.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[0,1]}]
