[{"title":"Average, but entertaining","rating":7,"date":"18 February 2013","review":"I took my 9yo and 7yo to see it while a friend of mine with a 5yo did not want to expose her child to a PG movie. Honestly, Tom &amp; Jerry, Road Runner, and Popeye cartoons are 10x more violent than this. It easily could have been G rated. The violence was very mild. The movie was pretty good with some funny parts but many references will go over most kids heads while parents will laugh (do any children under 10yo know what \"Area 51\" refers to??) I would recommend saving yourself money by staying away from the 3D version of this movie. The first comment from my 7yo after the movie was, \"there wasn't much 3D\" and she was absolutely right. There were some, but by the middle of the movie, you don't notice it. Movie has a pretty good story line. Not a great movie, but not bad either. Good movie to see on a rainy weekend or day off of school.","user":"bclaver1","rank":[37,49]},{"title":"Escape from Planet Earth â€” Colorful animation and aliens for kids or simple entertainment","rating":6,"date":"14 March 2013","review":"Escape from Planet Earth is a good movie for kids. It's funny, and colorful. However, do not think that it's bringing anything new to the table. It's nice entertainment, without any real disappointment, but it's a light meal.<br><br>It's real and only strength lies in the slick and extremely colorful graphics. they have their own style and there's not denying the appeal or the design of the alien home world.<br><br>The rest is merely acceptable. The story is linear, the scenario unimaginative, and the dialogs simple.<br><br>I liked it because it was fun, but don't expect much out of it and you won't be disappointed.","user":"AvidClimber","rank":[23,29]},{"title":"Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular","rating":5,"date":"22 June 2013","review":"Good story, if a little bit uninspired. Some good moral points and impressive twists. As far as animations go, quality is right up there and an interesting ideas on how extra terrestrials could look. great variety in shape and sizes as well as a believable planet network. enjoyable graphics and great voice acting with a few celebs Took me forever to figure out who one of the characters were! but got there in the end. Nothing extra ordinary about it, some good takes on human way of life for the adults to chuckle at. All in all an enjoyable movie, and while its not up with the best animations i've ever seen i certainly enjoyed it and will recommend it to any kid/kid at heart who likes scifi!","user":"Ghostninja","rank":[11,13]}]
