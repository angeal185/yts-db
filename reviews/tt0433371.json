[{"title":"A good flick from \"under the radar\"","rating":9,"date":"6 April 2007","review":"I'm a little surprised there are no comments for this film. Perhaps it hasn't been shown as much previously as would be assumed, although made three years ago.<br><br>It showed recently on a weekday, when I ordinarily would not have been watching TV, much less \"Lifetime.\" <br><br>But every so often, doing some business with European colleagues, I have to be on the phone dealing with some customer emergency from, say, back and forth between 7 and ll a.m. there - which is midnight to 4 a.m. my time. On some days following, I might \"veg out\" for a couple of hours when I ordinarily wouldn't, and just flip on the set. <br><br>That's what happened just as this film began, and I became interested as I got into it. I knew nothing of Peta Wilson, never having seen her \"... Nikita\" program, or any of the other thespians.<br><br>But for some reason, I found it far more engrossing and interesting than typical TV flicks. She presented an attractive, likable presence, and the other characters were more believable than you'd expect. Even the \"bad guys\" weren't the over-the-top type normally found.<br><br>Of course, it took a major!!! coincidence for the crux of the story to unfold, but it wasn't completely unbelievable. It occurs in Midland TX (I don't recall if the location from which she traveled to reach there - her original home city - was identified, or the distance implied). <br><br>Locations for this film aren't shown in this site, but I'd wager my net worth it's probably Vancouver, B.C. It seems all \"Lifetime\" flicks are now made there - and it would probably be wise to invest in stocks of firms with hotels and restaurants there, simply on the basis of \"Lifetime movie\" casts and crews which have to be visiting the area at any given time. <br><br>***Minor spoiler***<br><br>Peta's character leaves town, and her previously yuppie life after her husband commits suicide following being swindled by a slick con artist \"investment guru.\" Her auto breaks-down in Midland (again, only by pure chance) and she remains there in order to be able to get work to pay for car repairs - for which the shop owner trusts her. She cuts her flowing \"red tresses\" to a shorter, blonde style (meant as a symbol of her life's change, and now also Ms. Wilson's usual look). With her long fiery red hair now short and blonde, when she bumps into the con man, there is no disbelief when he doesn't recognize her. She had seen him just one time, briefly - but as the instrument of her beloved husband's demise, she recognizes him immediately. Obviously she cannot help but think of how she can use this chance occurrence to gain revenge and retribution. <br><br>This is a film where you have a pretty good sense of the direction it will take, and even possible twists which may evolve. But, again, unlike most of these films, you're not entirely certain, and there are still surprises along the way.<br><br>And best of all, the ending flows comfortably with the preceding events in the story - without unbelievable chases, knife wieldings, shootouts and the frequent, excessive histrionics films of this genre often present.<br><br>I'd even provide it a \"9,'\" considering the genre, the way the story was presented, and the engaging lead and good supporting cast.<br><br>A good film which seems to have slipped \"under the radar.\"<br><br><br><br>Caught this film again, by pure chance, a bit over a year after seeing first. Enjoyed it a second time, and find my opinion did not change at all from what I entered last year.","user":"caa821","rank":[15,22]},{"title":"Learn about white collar crime","rating":10,"date":"12 October 2008","review":"This movie should be shown to people on how scams work particularly the one that the movie is referring to. The movie does an excellent job of how the money is move from one phrase of the operation to another phrase in a well-thought, logical fashion that everyone can follow until it comes to the final end where the victims are finally jig out of their money.<br><br>The sad thing about this movie is where the local police told the ex-wife that they were not going to do a thing about it because it did not occurred in their area and they have too much crime in their own area to devote the manpower and resources. I guarantee you if someone pull a stunt like that on a law enforcement agency, the cops would spare no effort, time, and resources to bring the criminal to justice because cops do not like being made fools. Sometimes, it seems that the police need to become victims in order to get their butts moving because then they know what it is like to be a victim of white collar crime.","user":"SipteaHighTea","rank":[4,10]},{"title":"Not great -but nice to see Peta Wilson again","rating":3,"date":"23 October 2014","review":"I caught this on the W network the other night and stuck with it because I was such a huge fan of 'La Femme Nikita' back in the day and Peta Wilson plays the vengeful wife here. She spends the movie seeking revenge against a con artist who finagled her husband out of all of their money, an event that later prompts him to commit suicide.<br><br>I'll be honest, this is not a great movie even for Lifetime. The acting is okay but it feels kinda choppy and rushed (Wilson's character didn't appear to mourn her husband at all before she hit the road to revenge) and there's also some with super boring parts involving the \"Ponzi scheme\". There were a couple twists I didn't see coming towards the end but still a very forgettable movie. 02.14.14","user":"juneebuggy","rank":[2,4]}]
