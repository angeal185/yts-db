[{"title":"Terrible Casting","rating":3,"date":"21 August 2019","review":"The whole film is undermined by the casting of Actors who have never played golf before playing college level/ professional golf... that is before the predictable storyline; other than this its quite an easy watch as you are never drawn in enough to really care","user":"mjrees-37261","rank":[6,9]},{"title":"The only reason I didn't turn it off was because I couldn't be bothered to reach for the remote.","rating":3,"date":"5 August 2019","review":"Some really wooden acting unfortunately makes this movie difficult to watch. All the characters are typical white middle American with a token black guy, the coach. Every line has been heard in another movie. The storyline is one we've all heard before - parent is dying, I have to win this event for him / her. Child prodigy overcomes guilt, wins tournament (is that really a spoiler?) and everyone can get on with their lives.<br><br>They do a lot of praying which unsurprisingly has no effect. They keep mentioning this guy called God but he's not in the credits.<br><br>It's the sort of film you'd play in an old folks home during a coffee morning because if you missed a bit it doesn't matter and there's no plot that needs explaining anyway.","user":"cj-smedley","rank":[9,18]},{"title":"If You Like Faith-Based Films","rating":5,"date":"25 February 2020","review":"This faith-based film can be uplifting with some humor mixed in amidst tragedy. But it is filled with stilted dialogue, platitudes, and a very formulaic and predictable storyline.<br><br>So if you like faith-based films--enjoy. But it's not my cup of tea.","user":"larrys3","rank":[1,1]}]
