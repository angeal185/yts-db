[{"title":"You'll fall in love with this film...","rating":10,"date":"30 March 2000","review":"One of the best suspense films of the 1940s, \"Laura\" is loaded with elegant sophistication, witty dialogue, unscrupulous characters, and romantic obsession, all wrapped in hauntingly beautiful music.<br><br>Lovely Gene Tierney is Laura; the young advertising executive allegedly murdered at the front door of her apartment. Dana Andrews is well cast as Mark MacPherson, the handsome, no nonsense detective assigned to unravel the case.<br><br>Clifton Webb is superb as Waldo Lydecker, Laura's mentor and an egocentric, effeminate newspaper columnist who has made a career of eliminating Laura's prospective suitors. Lydecker detests Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), a southern playboy to whom Laura is engaged. Anne Treadwell (Judith Anderson) is Laura's aunt who, incidentally, is in love with Carpenter herself.<br><br>As MacPherson sorts through the motives and alibis, he finds Laura too bewitches him. In one of the most memorable movie scenes of all time, Dana Andrews gives an intense performance of a man driven to distraction by the story of Laura, her letters, private diary, perfume, and hauntingly lovely portrait above the fireplace. Clearly agitated, he takes a drink as he sits in a chair beneath Laura's portrait. He falls asleep, and the audience is left wondering if his dreams of Laura are coming true, as she appears through the doorway. He awakens and rises from the chair, his soul shaken by the sight of Laura alive.<br><br>This intriguing story, combined with Clifton Webb's biting quips, Gene Tierney's beauty and elegance, Dana Andrews' intensity and dark good looks, and Vincent Price's sense of humor, makes this film immensely watchable again and again.","user":"Elizabeth-40","rank":[85,98]},{"title":"Classic Film Noir with Perfect Cast","rating":15,"date":"15 June 2000","review":"Laura is a wonderful example of film noir.  The cast is perfect.  Dana Andrews is the detective assigned to investigate the murder of Laura (played by Gene Tierney).  As he interviews her associates and becomes mesmerized by her portrait, he begins to fall for Laura posthumously.  Clifton Webb plays her mentor perfectly and Vincent Price is classic as Laura's pretty boy fiance.  Although the movie begins with Laura's murder, it still has incredible surprises and an awesome denouement.  Andrews hard boiled detective and the dark, raining sets illustrate the meaning of film noir.  I highly recommend it.","user":"jbritton","rank":[58,67]},{"title":"A perfect Noir film","rating":9,"date":"14 July 2004","review":"The first time I saw this film, about eight years ago I ended up almost losing a friend because I was hoarding the VHS copy he had lent me for about two months.  After seeing it, I quite simply didn't want to give up the tape because in doing so, I wouldn't be able to watch it anytime I wanted to; and I did watch it anytime I wanted to, and often, until he threatened to call a Noir Intervention.  I may have loved this film from the first viewing, but I wasn't prepared to deal with something like that, as entertaining as it may have been.<br><br>I fell in love with `Laura' because it is biting and evil, intelligent and surprising.  The unfathomably gorgeous Gene Tierney plays the title character, an advertising executive whose best friend Waldo Lydecker (played by the always wonderful Clifton Webb) and fianc√©e Shelby, (a really young Vincent Price) are some of the prime suspects in her murder.  The gruff detective leading the case (Dana Andrews) is Det. McPherson, and he quickly essentially falls in love with a ghost while he is trying to solve her murder.<br><br>`Laura' has one of the great Noir scripts in that just as the audience thinks they have the case solved, another curve ball is thrown at them which blows that theory out of the water.  The acting is pure delightful melodrama, but Clifton Webb's performance is simply show-stopping.  His character is a vicious snit of a writer who uses his column as a weapon against anyone he doesn't like or even tolerate.    Even upon multiple viewings I can't help but howl at some of his lines and mannerisms. <br><br>\nIf anyone was to request suggestions for good Film Noir movies, I would prescribe a heavy dose of `Laura' because it has something for everyone in that it is romantic, thrilling, mysterious, wickedly funny and above all, thoroughly entertaining.  <br><br>--Shelly","user":"FilmOtaku","rank":[104,129]}]
