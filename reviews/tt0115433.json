[{"title":"Get yer spots on!","rating":8,"date":"29 December 2001","review":"I've noticed something about John Hughes' movies: he started out writing about adults with child-like tendencies (\"Mr. Mom\", \"National Lampoon's Vacation\"), went on to actual teenagers (\"Sixteen Candles\", The Breakfast Club\"), devolved down to pre-teens (\"Home Alone\", \"Dennis the Menace\") and then babies (\"Baby's Day Out\") and now that he's exhausted all the ages of man (except the elderly - don't give him any ideas) he's moved on to the animal kingdom with \"101 Dalmatians\".<br><br>You know the basic storyline if you've seen the 1961 Disney animated original - Roger and Anita (Daniels and Richardson) meet and marry then their respective dalmatians Pongo and Perdita have 15 puppies which are coveted by the despicable Cruella DeVil (played con brio by Close) who will have them at any cost to make a puppy fur coat.<br><br>What's new this time around?  The fact that it's all live action, for one, and the formidable assistance of computers helps create the illusion of dogs and other creatures acting with almost human precision, plus the fact that instead of precocious voices for all the animals they act out voiceless against the human baddies, especially Horace and Jasper (Williams and Laurie), as if the animal kingdom were all channeling Macaulay Culkin.<br><br>And, of course, since Hughes wrote the script, you know this won't be Shakespeare - slapstick malice is at the forefront with cute but noble good guys, ugly and dumb bad guys and lots of adorable animals. <br><br>\nBut not just dalmatians, mind you: there are all manner of dogs - sheepdogs, bulldogs, terriers, etc.  Not to mention horses, sheep, raccoons, rabbits, chickens, pigs, cows, birds and even a mouse in one instance.  All of them banding together to bring the dalmatians, all 101 of them, together safely.<br><br>Director Herek brings everything together with assurance and all the actors make sure you know that this is a story that is first and foremost for the kiddies.  Especially Close - complete with claws on her gloves and a different wardrobe for every scene, she not only chews the scenery but nibbles on it with every tooth in her head and savors the taste like a connoisseur.  Bless her.<br><br>This isn't the kind of movie that can be successfully analyzed.  You either like it or not, depending on what kind of tolerance you have for kiddie slapstick.  I like that, so I liked \"101 Dalmatians\".<br><br>Seven stars, plus half a star for Close's diabolical work...and a half star more for the donations from the animal world.","user":"Mister-6","rank":[20,23]},{"title":"Disney does it again","rating":4,"date":"4 May 2000","review":"As an animation student, I frequently cringe when they make a live action version of an animated film, as they rarely live up to their cartoon counterparts. This is not one of those films. I loved it, the Dogs, pongo and Perdy, were outstanding, and even with computer stand ins, and Hensons creature shop, you'd be hard pushed to see the joins, the exceptions being the Wood pecker at the door and the two Racoons giving each other a high five. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson were great, Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams were brilliant as the bumbling lackeys, but the star of the show had to be Glenn Close as Cruella DeVille. I never knew animated characters could have real life twins, but Glenn Close was Cruella's, delightfully over the top, with more ham than a bacon butty. If you liked the cartoon you'll love this version as well. The only thing I wondered about in the whole film was how many takes it took them to get some of the animal shots,  this certainly contradicts the old adage of not working with animals and kids.","user":"dillon09","rank":[19,22]},{"title":"Fine, fine film. As good as the animated version, but different!","rating":9,"date":"1 September 1999","review":"Incredible as it may seem, this film is every bit the equal of the Disney animated version of the same title. And it is DIFFERENT from the Disney version. This is a rare accomplishment, in a medium where remakes and sequels are so often weak.<br><br>The film is made by Glen Close, whose appearance as Cruella DeVil is fascinating! She is even more evil than her animated namesake. But the rest of the casting of the film is also incredibly strong. No problems with anyone.<br><br>The dalmations are most excellently employed. Virtually seamless integration of live action and computer animation. And also, the hosts of animals (live and animated) in the film do NOT talk (a cloying and sentimental habit too often indulged in by Disney Studios et al).<br><br>The film is an adult's movie that children should also enjoy! The VHS version was good, the DVD version even better.","user":"mallard-6","rank":[18,21]}]
