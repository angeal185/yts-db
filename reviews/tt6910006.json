Delinquent son reconciles with estranged father during an eventful and sacred return to picturesque Ireland. Lots of Nordic type names in the closing credits ... an overwhelming reason why this is such a lovely movie ...","user":"stevojaxon","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Glad didn't miss this","rating":7,"date":"9 April 2020","review":"The beauty of this movie touches my hearts deep down. Family theme not my first priority always but this one nail it. It's not making any big speech on family values but just warming to watch and feels that family always the most important in life, for most people.","user":"ks-60500","rank":[1,1]}]
