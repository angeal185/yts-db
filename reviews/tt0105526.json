[{"title":"very much like die-hard, but in the streets of BH","rating":7,"date":"6 December 2001","review":"Ok, is this movie cheesy?  well, yeah.  But it's one of those films I rented when it first came out and I kind of enjoyed it (come on, the cop is the same guy who played max headroom).  It has it's cheesy moments, not to mention parts that aren't believable (would the whole town really be ok with just staying up playing cards in some hotel lobby?), not to mention how they somehow had such an accurate tracking system they knew down to the penny how much loot they stole?  Nothing ground breaking here, but still a good film.","user":"toyotaboy","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"What a Great Movie!","rating":8,"date":"12 August 2003","review":"I had originally seen the preview for this movie within another nameless early 90s stinker, back in the day.  I hadn't given this movie another thought until I was at a truck stop in Morrilton, Arkansas, and saw it sitting there, collecting dust next to a bunch of other stinkers (like Tremors 3). I immediately remembered the preview: a bunch of cars blowing up, lots of shooting, plenty of \"tag lines;\" you know, the usual action movie cliches.  Realizing that I'd never see this movie again, I bought it. During the drive home, I kept building it up to my girlfriend as being the stupidest looking movie on earth, based on the preview that I had seen over a decade ago.  Once we got home, we popped it in the VCR, prepared to laugh ourselves silly.  Not so. It is one of the most underrated movies of all time.  It is fantastic!!!  Great (if not a little cheap looking) action sequences!!  Great plot!  Decent acting!  Superb plot twists and turns! Unformulaic ending!  I was quite surprised.  I think the previews made it look far worse than it actually is.  The scene where the hero is blowing stuff up to  \"Epic\" by Faith No More almost causes goosebumps.  The catch is: You MUST be a fan of the genre.  If you are, this movie will NOT let you down. I promise!  See it!  It's available somewhere out there from MGM. 7/10","user":"actionpro","rank":[19,23]},{"title":"how can you hate this film?....","rating":8,"date":"27 November 2011","review":"A chemical spill has caused the occupants of Beverly Hills to be forcibly evacuated.<br><br>A retiring football player left behind, finds that the toxic gas emulating from the spill is a bogus front for a heist set up by fired police officers out to plunder the city of all its valuables.<br><br>Finding himself siding with a corrupt cop who was once apart of the plan until he discovered the city's mayor had just been blown away, by one of the chief crooks in charge.<br><br>Now both on the run with no help in sight...both must do whatever they can to stop these murderous looters....<br><br>Yes the film is crazy stupid, yes Ken Wahl is a really unconvincing hero, but he has 1991s best mullet and runs in a straight line when being chased by a SWAT vehicle.<br><br>There are so many unintentional funny moments in this film, that it begs for repeat viewings.
