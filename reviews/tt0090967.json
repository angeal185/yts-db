[{"title":"No action, all mood â€“ but it goes down like a cool beer on a hot summer evening","rating":9,"date":"17 July 2014","review":"A cult classic - and yet still relatively little known. Jim Jarmusch is a master when it comes to creating atmosphere (and nobody uses stretches of silence to better comedic effect than he does). Shot in beautiful black and white, this tale of three prisoners who make for very unlikely companions is all mood, deadpan humour and practically no action.<br><br>Don't expect a story - just enjoy the ride, the dialogues (consisting mainly of the word 'F***' - unless it's Benigni talking: his chaotic, broken English lines are another highlight of the film) and the fantastic soundtrack by John Lurie and Tom Waits. Perhaps the epitome of a cult movie, this one goes down like a cool beer on a hot summer evening (and as with all cult movies, it is best seen with an audience that already knows and loves the film). A minimalistic comedy masterpiece. 9 stars out of 10.<br><br>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/<br><br>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br><br>Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br><br>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","user":"gogoschka-1","rank":[76,84]},{"title":"A Pure Joy","rating":8,"date":"16 January 2014","review":"The story of three different men (Tom Waits, John Lurie, and Roberto Benigni) in a Louisiana prison and their eventual journey.<br><br>This film is a natural progression from \"Stranger Than Paradise\". Lurie returns as a lead, and the music of Screamin' Jay Hawkins is replaced with Tom Waits. If Hawkins and Waits know each other, I have no idea, but their music styles are not far removed.<br><br>Although Waits is among my favorite actors (he excels at playing villains), the standout performance here is Benigni. How much English he knew at the time I am not sure, but he brings a comic mischief to the film, and is the most light-hearted despite being potentially the most dangerous.","user":"gavin6942","rank":[23,25]},{"title":"\"Yeah, it's a sad and beautiful world, pal.\"","rating":8,"date":"3 July 2018","review":"Action/adventure fans won't have the patience for this film. There are long, extended scenes in which the principal characters wait each other out before speaking, and even then, they don't have much to say. The introduction of Roberto Benigni's character into the jail cell at the Orleans Parish Prison changes the dynamic of the story, but at first you don't know which way it will go. Zack (Tom Waits) and Jack (John Lurie) could just as easily have beat the hell out of Roberto in any other film, but here, they take to the idiosyncratic jailbird when they learn he's in for murder by eight-ball. Consistently referring to his pocket note pad for illuminating American phrases, Roberto is at his charming nuttiest leading his cellmate hoods in a rousing rendition of 'We all scream for ice cream'.<br><br>I'm not big on stories that go nowhere but this one went nowhere in a decidedly unique and captivating way. The jail break by the unlikely trio is as improbable as the camaraderie that develops among them, which quite honestly is probably the reason the mechanics of it wasn't actually shown. You have to take it on faith that Roberto actually did find some weakness in the security of the prison yard in order for them to escape. Even more improbable is the romance that develops between Roberto and his new found love Nicoletta (Nicoletta Braschi), but then again, who can say? I was waiting any minute for Zack or Jack to take advantage of the young lady, but apparently their regard for Roberto was one of earned respect.<br><br>I can't say this would be on my recommended list for most viewers, but if you can slow down and savor the plight of three disparate jailbirds looking for a break, this may appeal to your better instincts. And if I can relate the picture to another Benigni film for which he won a Best Actor Oscar, the story in it's own distinctive manner has a way of showing it's characters that \"Life is Beautiful\".","user":"classicsoncall","rank":[7,7]}]
