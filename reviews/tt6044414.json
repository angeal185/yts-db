[{"title":"Incredible","rating":10,"date":"12 October 2019","review":"Imagine the most bizarre film you can possibly imagine. Now imagine if it was made in a Ugandan slum with no budget. Yes, that is this movie.<br><br>\"If it's so low quality, why did you give it 10 stars???\"<br><br>Because this film had my eyes glued to the screen the whole time. Not even the highest budget, best-shot film of all time can claim the ability to keep my 7-second attention span off my phone, but this strange-as-heck film kept my eyes wide and my lungs ready for laughter.<br><br>The plot is bizarrely nonlinear, the characters are great, the cinematography is surprisingly okay for it being handheld the whole time, there are more twists than a pretzel, and I would recommend this film to anybody. Plus, my laptop is now adorned with a Wakaliwood sticker, which came with the film.","user":"calebrosenberg","rank":[17,17]},{"title":"Funny, nonsensical, random, but entertaining at every second!","rating":7,"date":"29 June 2019","review":"If you've seen Who Killed Captain Alex, you will not be dissatisfied. You will enjoy it for what it's worth. Bad Black is the next film in Wakaliwood's library and it delivers. Like Captain Alex, it's funny, nonsensical, has nonstop action, and the one and only, VJ Emmie. You may notice reoccurring actors from Captain alex, as well as new ones. The plot is hard to follow for me and can sometimes not make sense, but that's the beauty of it. Seeing every weird plot twist, and seeing random directions of the story makes the movie that more enjoyable. It's a little worse than Captain Alex, but it is very enjoyable. I recommend watching it! There is a blu-ray you can buy that contains Bad Black and Captain Alex as well as a bunch of bonus features. You can find it on Amazon and support the creators. Overall, a 7/10.","user":"josephellis","rank":[11,12]},{"title":"Pretty good!","rating":8,"date":"25 December 2019","review":"The story of Wakaliwood is so wholesome. This is a pretty well made and entertaining movie. Has more cohesive story than several blockbuster Hollywood movies. Not to mention the Twitch meta that these movies ended up creating.","user":"nishanthbmme","rank":[4,4]}]
