It's more – surprisingly, much more! First of all, the film is based on the series of children's novels written and illustrated by Dav Pilkey. The main series of 12 books (not counting three spin-offs) were published 1997-2015 and received a 2006 Disney Adventures Kids' Choice Award. The books have been translated into 20 languages and sold over 70 million copies worldwide. So, that means that the books were successful enough to make the leap to the big screen, but the question here is whether the movie is any good as a standalone piece of entertainment. Well, if you're anything like me, being only vaguely aware of the titular character's existence (if at all) and skeptical of the film's title, you might need some convincing regarding whether Captain Underpants is worthy of your entertainment dollars – or your time – or that of any tykes in your life. For now, I'll just say that watching the movie convinced me that the answer to all those questions is a resounding \"yes\"! The movie takes characters and plot points from each of the first four books (especially the fourth one) – and some of the others – while mixing in some new stuff and functioning as both origin story and fun animated action/adventure. The story follows two 4th grade boys who are best friends and next-door neighbors, George Beard (voiced by Kevin Hart) and Harold Hutchins (Thomas Middleditch, from TV's \"Silicon Valley\"). Mainly because of their mean, child-hating principal, Mr. Krupp (Ed Helms), George and Kevin don't like being students at Jerome Horowitz Elementary (a fictional Ohio school using the birth name of Curly Howard, of \"Three Stooges\" fame). The boys funnel their frustrations, mischievous natures, natural creativity and 4th grade sense of humor into a series of pranks which puts them even deeper in Principal Krupp's dog house. With George as the writer and Harold as the illustrator, they also produce a series of comic books which depict the adventures of a dimwitted but enthusiastic superhero whom they call Captain Underpants (because most superhero costumes look like underwear anyway).<br><br>With the help of their humorless and nerdy classmate, Melvin Sneedly (Jordan Peele), Principal Krupp gets some evidence of the wily George and Harold pulling one of their pranks and decides to place them in separate classes. The boys worry that this will result in the end of their friendship, so they take action. George hypnotizes Principal Krupp with a cereal box prize (a \"3D Hypno Ring\") and commands him to become Captain Underpants. Krupp embodies all of the hilarious positive and negative traits of the boys' comic creation, which forces them to stick with him to keep him from getting into trouble or getting hurt. Then they discover that Captain Underpants reverts to Principal Krupp when he gets wet, but becomes Captain Underpants again when George snaps his finger. The movie plays that back-and-forth for lots of laughs – and gives this superhero a villain to fight when a new science teacher who calls himself Professor P (Nick Kroll) turns out to be an evil genius who is trying to rid the world of laughter.<br><br>\"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie\" delivers all the charm of the books – and then some. The type of animation (similar to 2015's \"The Peanuts Movie\") is perfect for this one and the voice work couldn't be better. Sure, potty humor is this film's stock-in-trade, but it's so innocently and humorously presented, that it's hard not to smile (or laugh – repeatedly). But the beating heart of this script by Nicholas Stoller (\"Storks\", the \"Neighbors\" movies, 2011's and 2014's \"Muppets\" movies) is the friendship of the Captain Underpants creators, which is enhanced by a subtle anti-bullying message. Director David Soren (\"Turbo\") gives us jokes, comic timing and sight gags that are funnier and more enjoyable than most live action comedies – and includes a great balance of laughs and lessons. You could think of it as an Adam Sandler comedy appropriate for kids – and just as enjoyable by adults who will appreciate the relative innocence of George and Harold, while relating to their mischievousness.<br><br>This movie takes common foibles, flaws and fantasies of elementary school students and turns them into a creative, clever and comedic animated adventure. But don't just take my word for it. I submit the following reactions for your consideration: During the preview screening I attended, both adults and children frequently laughed out loud, the audience applauded as the credits rolled and I even saw a teenage girl literally dancing out of the theater as the theme song by Weird Al Yankovic played. It's hard to believe that so much enjoyment can be packed into one little movie. Let's just hope it lives up to its title – namely, that it is indeed only the first epic Captain Underpants movie. Whether you're a fan of the books or not, give this one a chance. You'll never look at tighty whities the same way again. \"A+\"","user":"dave-mcclain","rank":[73,116]},{"title":"Nostalgic, Fully Of Potty Talk, And Incredibly Hilarious, \"Captain Underpants\" Is Major Loads Of Fun","rating":9,"date":"2 June 2017","review":"\"Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie\" is a movie that is finally released that is based off the book series of the same name by Dav Pilkey and is about two fourth graders named George and Harold who are troublemakers in their school and are often ridiculed by their mean principal Mr. Krupp. When they decide to hypnotize Mr. Krupp into thinking he is the superhero Captain Underpants, a superhero the boys created in their homemade comic books, chaos and mayhem then ensues. <br><br>I remember reading these books in elementary school. They were always sold at our seasonal book fairs, and because it was a Catholic elementary school, they eventually got banned and were deemed inappropriate. Captain Underpants was a big part of my childhood, and though I never finished reading the series as I got too old to continue with the series, I have always been fond of the series and one day want to go back and re-read the books. The movie certainly helped with this. This is a movie that could've been either really good or really bad. Luckily, it was really good.<br><br>This movie, like the books, is very self-aware. It knows it's a movie. The characters know that, and break the fourth wall constantly. This worked because by doing so it stuck to the source material. The books constantly broke the fourth wall and were very self-aware that they were books as well. If the movie didn't have that element, then this movie would not have worked as well as it did. That is a key component from the books that I think has to be in the movie, especially to play up the laughs. <br><br>The animation is very smooth as well. No technical problems with the animation in this movie as far as I am concerned. It is a very beautiful, colorful looking movie. <br><br>This movie isn't a straight adaptation of the first book. The villain in this movie is Professor Poopypants, probably the most iconic Captain Underpants villain in the books, and that's what I liked. You give the most iconic villain from the book series a plot to work with that is similar to his own book that it felt so nostalgic that it was great. It was full of potty talk which was great. I know that is a complaint for many people with these types of movie, but listen, you have to stick to the source material, and the source material had a lot of \"potty\" talk. It had to be in here. There is a sequence from the books called \"Flip-O-Rama\" that is a prominent staple in the books and it somehow made its way into the movie and was awesome!<br><br>This is nostalgic fun, full of potty talk, with smooth animation that has laughs for kids and adults alike. I am going to give Captain Underpants an A.","user":"TheJediWay9","rank":[60,100]}]
