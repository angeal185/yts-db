[{"title":"Lives in London","rating":25,"date":"25 November 2016","review":"This film tells the story of several residents in inner London. They are from different social classes, ranging from a sport superstar living in fancy mansions, to young man who struggles to break free from being a small time criminal.<br><br>I can't even remember why I wanted to watch it in the first place. Perhaps it was because of the two notable stars, Idris and Gemma. They portray a couple who are going through relationship issues, but unfortunately their story is not very engaging. The ending of their story is simply unrealistic and over-dramatised. For the subplot of the young man who wants to embark on the right path, it is the more engaging story. It is sad that his mentor died, but unfortunately the story telling just is not very captivating. This subplot should evoke sympathy and emotions, but it does nothing to me. Maybe it is because the characters in the film have little emotional displays, they just get on with their lives in an ordinary manner. The resultant film is not as touching or affecting as one could have hoped.","user":"Gordon-11","rank":[23,32]},{"title":"Raw, intense and very watchable","rating":9,"date":"1 August 2018","review":"Netflix suggested I watch this after seeing 'Brighton Rock' and I can see why. The intensity of the characters' demise and their struggle to make sense of what happens makes for compelling viewing.The setting is everything, from the local football club to Battersea Bridge and all streets in between. While the characters don't cross over too much (which might make it a bit of a soap opera) they make subtle references which keeps the viewer guessing. I guess the theme is around disintegration and how we all cope when things seem to deteriorate. A really absorbing film, well worth a watch.","user":"nickwhite-19645","rank":[6,7]},{"title":"Don't watch this film. It's just not good. Only one minor spoiler","rating":3,"date":"5 February 2017","review":"I read some bad reviews for this film but as a fan of Elba I just covered my eyes and ears and said \"nananana.\" I was wrong.<br><br>This film is just not good. If you've seen the trailer, that's about it. The whole film is in there.<br><br>The production qualities are high, the acting is mostly good, but the film is less than the sum of its parts. They should've focused on one story and expanded on it, instead of getting hints, glimpses and slices of different, completely-unrelated lives.<br><br>SPOILER I thought the stories would be intertwined, a sort of cause-and-effect type thing like many films do, but no. The stories happen in parallel. They don't really affect one another. This film could've been presented as a bunch of short films about people in London and they would've been rated poorly. END SPOILER<br><br>There simply isn't enough time to deal with all these stories. If you think that 90 minutes is enough time to deal with a failing marriage and affairs, a death, a misfit in a lethal street gang and a few subplots (if you can call them that) then this film is for you.<br><br>The trailer made it look to be all about Elba and probably revealed most of the Elba stuff. The rest is just inconsequential. The film consists of several subplots and has no major plot or overarching narrative.<br><br>It's sad to waste all the talent that went into this film - actors, director, crew, etc. when the script is so horrendously poor.","user":"MaesterFilm","rank":[14,20]}]
