[{"title":"Brutal creative deaths n plenty of laughs. Fans of the series will love this.","rating":8,"date":"4 March 2018","review":"Saw this on a rented dvd. Waiting to buy a copy of it. Have all the 3 parts in my dvd collection. Fans of the series will definitely enjoy this but those who havnt seen the series will also enjoy this as it has plenty of laughs, brutal n bloody deaths n claustrophobic atmosphere. Adam Green shud be applauded for making such an entertaining brutal slasher n considering its low budget, he did a mighty fine job.\nThere is something sinister about horror films set in the bayou, especially Louisiana n Green made full use of the settings. I had complained in my review of the first part about the no usage of crocodiles in such settings. If only there was some short crocodile terror in this installment, i wud have loved it even more.\nWatch out for Dave Sheridan. His comic timing is very good n his character was a perfect sigh of relief in a very tensed n gory slasher.","user":"Fella_shibby","rank":[23,31]},{"title":"Exactly what you come to a Hatchet film for","rating":7,"date":"26 January 2018","review":"I dont write long reviews. \nIts simply put a good comedy horror film. Campy and stupid when it should be, gorey when it should be. A very fun film\nDont go in with high expectations and youll get everything you want from it.\nAdam green should be given more money to make some high budget comedy horrors. He has a real knack for it","user":"MoistMovies","rank":[20,28]},{"title":"A Horror Fan's Delight","rating":10,"date":"11 October 2017","review":"Adam Green is quite possibly the most talented director working in the horror field today. His films are always loads of fun, with subtle touches of humor like the hillbilly in Hatchet 1 drinking from a plastic urinal bottle, offhanded details that are easily missed if you don't pay attention. Of course there's plenty of not so subtle humor as well, especially in the Hatchet films which are Grand Guignol at its most extreme.<br><br>Those little touches are just part of the tapestry Green weaves, using every weapon in a film maker's arsenal. VICTOR CROWLEY could serve as a film school model of how to use sound and how to frame a shot for maximum effect.<br><br>There isn't a weak role in the script and every actor hits just the right tone. The acting is dead on perfect all around and the casting is sublime. Laura Ortiz is adorable as a feisty little sexpot, Dave Sheridan nails the hungry actor wannabe, Parry Shen shows great range. Too many to name them all, the entire cast is excellent.<br><br>Green's directorial skills are matched by his writing. Humor in horror is tricky. If you're making a horror film with humor, as opposed to a horror-themed comedy, it's easy to lose your balance, and too many directors cheapen their films with sophomoric one liners. Victor Crowley is loaded with very smart humor, some of it dark, some character-based.<br><br>The cinematography and sets are topnotch. The special efx are fantastic. One in particular is worth the price of admission... I'll say no more than that.<br><br>If you can't stomach gory efx, this film is definitely not for you. For fans, it's a gourmet feast.","user":"mojoguzzi-879-68498","rank":[32,52]}]
