[{"title":"...The movie could have been...","rating":16,"date":"16 May 2002","review":"The previous comment sounded to me like they weren't criticizing the movie. Sounded more like they were bashing the Country and the author...I found it was a good movie. I've seen better, but it's not at the bottom of my list, and neither is The House Of The Spirits.  Of Love and Shadows is a book that explains in the background what was going on politically in Chile and it was a way to kind of get it out in the open - I don't know...create an awareness.  I admit, it must be difficult to translate an amazing novel into a movie and have it come out the same.  I find that Isabel Allende's books are absolutely fabulous!! She is a great story teller. And for this particular one, I also think you may need to have a bit more knowledge of what had happened in Chile to have a better understanding of what the story is about. The Movie - I enjoyed it...it deserves to be seen at least once, but...maybe..to get a better sense of what it's all about, it's best to read the book first!  Maybe if this film was shot in Chile it would have been different using Chilean Actors that do an amazing job anyway.  The movie may have been better.  But I am glad that Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Connelly decided to be a part of this movie.  Both are great actors that tried to give the movie feeling...","user":"Candyrica","rank":[16,18]},{"title":"Great political movie..not so great love story","rating":7,"date":"23 May 2006","review":"If you don't go by the poster of the movie(which portrayed it to be a passionate love story), you'd enjoy the movie.<br><br>I haven't read the novel and I was engrossed very quickly with what was shown in the movie. The year is 1973 and Chile has been taken over by military coup. An woman talks to Francesco(a phychiatrist) about the nightmares she is having after military has tortured her and her husband. Her voice breaks as she says \"one after another..again and again\" Irene (Connelly) belongs to the upper class, she is innocent, engaged to her cousin, a military captain since childhood. She also publishes a magazine. She employed Francesco(Banderas) who is now out of job as the photographer. Francesco and his family are totally against the human rights violation that occurs. His brother is a priest in church who tries to prevent things.<br><br>When the magazine crew went to interview Evangelina, a magical woman, military comes and interferes. Evangelina with superhuman strength picks up military commander Ramirez and throws him away. They left. Shortly after, Evangelina is taken by military and she has disappeared.<br><br>Irene and Francesco tried to find out where Evangelina is. In the process, their lives and others take a complete turn-oil. And expectedly they fall in love.<br><br>The scenes of military regime is very well depicted. The arrogance of their police, the fear among civilians are very real and touching. Of memorable scenes are Evangelina's friend in military who is torn between his job needs and the human ways.","user":"roysid","rank":[6,6]},{"title":"Dark tale of 1970's Chile","rating":13,"date":"13 August 2003","review":"Irene (Jennifer Connelly) is a daughter of privilege in 1970's Chile. It is a time of government repression and citizens of Chile are turning up missing, never to be found.  Working as a magazine writer, Irene meets photographer Francisco (Antonio Banderas).  Francisco is a passionate young man with a dangerous secret: he is working for an underground movement investigating the government's actions.  Although Irene is engaged to a man in the military, she falls in love with Francisco and joins him in his underground activities.  Will they be able to expose the misdeeds of the government and remain alive?<br><br>This movie is based on a novel by Chilean-born author Isabel Allende. Her political views are to the left; yet, this film is not totally biased. Real events occured under Chilean leader Pinochet, who eventually was deposed.  This movie, therefore, offers a glimpse into the horrific tortures and deaths at the hands of the Chilean government in the seventies.  Not as exciting as it could be, the film nevertheless provides enough drama and pathos to touch the hearts of its viewers.  Connelly and Banderas give fine performances that resonate.  Recommended for fans of the two leads as well as those who admire films with a political agenda.","user":"inkblot11","rank":[13,17]}]
