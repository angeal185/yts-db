[{"title":"A horror action classic remake of the 80's - I love this flick!","rating":10,"date":"2 May 2016","review":"The Blob (1988) is an 80's action horror classic remake from Steve McQueen version 1958 film. I love this film to death. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. I was 10 years old and a kid when I saw the first time this film and I absolutely loved it. I saw some owner of the video store that was selling movies on VHS one of those films was this film from the 80's The Blob, I wish I could get this film on VHS before it was soled out, but my parents didn't give me the money, than the film disappeared of the air and I have never saw it or watch it. It was never on TV it took me 20 years to watch this movie, recently I found some guys who love this film and I order it on Blu-ray disc and I got it. I absolutely love movie's from the 80's and I love this flick to death it Is my favorite monster movie. I am, putting this flick right between Aliens and Deep Rising right between them as a monster movies. <br><br>This is my second favorite Chuck Russell film the first one will be A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) that I absolutely love to death, this is the second film I love to death. I definitely appreciate what the original did but, yeah, the '88 Blob is certainly a feast for the eyes. I have always enjoyed this movie and I had such a fun watching it. It is fun, exciting and pure entertaining. Simon West want's to direct the remake of the Blob that is coming out I think this year which is a stupid dumb idea! I don't want to see another remake of this film so no!<br><br>I love Shawnee Smith as a bad ass - tough cheerleader, she is so beautiful, gorgeous and sexy, I am completely in Love with her! I love her to death in this film. Shawnee Smith will always be Meg Penny for me, not Amanda Young from Saw! I don't care about Saw or the franchise none of those horror films are my favorite! I rather watch films from the 80's and the Blob is one of my favorite monster creature movies! I saw this flick as a kid. Shawnee Smith is gorgeous in this film she saved her younger brother, she tried to save a younger kid Eddie as well and when The Blob eats and swallows a younger kid in the sever she jumps in the water trying to saves him and she couldn't. She fires a machine gun on the Blob and say's \"come on, you can do better than that!\". <br><br>I love the music score from Michael Hoenig and I love the song on the end of the title Brave New Love by Alien. You also have Paul McCrane in from RoboCop (1987) after seeing him in this film, I recognized him right away, it is Emil M. Antonowsky from RoboCop! <br><br>The movie has likable characters, fast paced, a lot's of action, fun bits of humor, Paul Flagg (Kevin Dillon) escapes from those government guys, jumps over this little bridge and gives the middle finger when he jumps over the bridge on his motorcycle. I love this scene it was memorable scene I remember it. In the opening scene he crashed down the bridge but now he jumped over which was excellent. Fun bits of dialogue, the budget was used very well against great special effects, I have no problems with them, it is one of my favorites of all time.<br><br>This film is only shot an hour and thirty-five minutes which is not that long, it is like is said pure entertainment, I grow up with this flick and I love it. <br><br>I disagree with the reviewers who say the original is much better than this version. I think quite the opposite is true. The 80's \"The Blob\" along with the 80's \"The Fly\" are two of the few remakes that I think far surpass the originals. Sure, it's a schlocky 80's horror movie, but taken in that context, it's damn good!<br><br>A great script, an excellent combination of FX to achieve the look of the Blob, and absolute horror and carnage... I love it! This is a horror movie with BALLS. Within the first half hour, (spoiler alert) they kill off the guy we're expecting to be the star! They kill little kids! They kill off innocents, characters we like and want to live!<br><br>This movie takes no prisoners and pulls no punches. It takes the idea of the original, puts an interesting twist into the plot, injects it with good FX, good acting and a decent budget, and you have something far superior to the original. Just like \"Little Shop of Horrors\" -- The cheap and dated original can never hold up to the musical remake.<br><br>This flick get's a 10 out of 10 by me for been my favorite sci-fi horror flick of all time.","user":"ivo-cobra8","rank":[96,100]},{"title":"Fun, if imperfect, monster horror","rating":7,"date":"27 June 2006","review":"One night, just outside of a quiet and small town, a bizarre meteor crashes. A man who goes to investigate finds a weird glop that jumps on his arm and puts him into a state of frenzy. Some young people take him to the hospital and we soon see that the weird substance has eaten most of him and it is still hungry...<br><br>The result is a very entertaining monster flick with a very unusual monster - an amorphous blob. After films like Alien, Predator, The Thing, and others thinking of a good monster idea can be tough. Even John Carpenter's well crafted The Thing is a remake, but that didn't stop the film from becoming one of his best due to a good visceral interpretation of the story. The same goes for this film - a remake of an old movie with a very visceral and gory style. Featuring top-notch aesthetic and even some obviously aged, but nonetheless fun, old computer effects it is more of a thorough re-imagination like The Thing was.<br><br>However, the film falls a bit on its face when it comes to creating suspense. Many scenes with the title monster are tense and the action good and the gore first-rate, but the connective scenes between them surprisingly lack in tension. With material ripe for an eerie atmosphere it is a shame to see this horror element not fully developed in the film. The result is a fun movie, but it could have been much better. Also the mad scientist/cold war element is a bit stale by today's standards.<br><br>But, overall it is a fun little flick featuring a truly merciless monster that gobbles up just about anyone (even kids!). Horror/sci-fi fans will definitely want to check this flick out. 7/10<br><br>Rated R: violence, horror images, and profanity","user":"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","rank":[42,46]},{"title":"Another great Horror/Sci-Fi Remake from the 80s","rating":8,"date":"19 July 2011","review":"In the 1980s there were 3 remakes of Popular 1950s Horror films, first there was THE THING (1982) then THE FLY (1986) And in (1988) We got THE BLOB, which is often overlooked and considered to be the lesser of the 3 remakes, and to me that's really sad because THE BLOB is in my opinion is Just as good as the other two remakes from the 80s, The 1950s version of The Blob is a classic B-Movie worth watching for a good laugh, as for the Remake it is a truly scary film, the suspense is there, the special effects are incredible to this day, the only effects that are dated are the green screen effects which don't show up until the latter of the film and there's only a few of them.<br><br>The Plot is the same as the original but with a slight twist, Like in the original, A meteorite hits earth and a strange blob creature oozes out of it and starts to devour anything and anyone in its path, the film has 2 heroes played by (Kevin Dillon and Shawnee Smith) who both do a good job with their roles, and the supporting cast is good also.<br><br>The film succeeds as being a good remake because it gives you something old and something new, it pays homage to the original without completely ripping off the original, In fact there are only 2 major scenes that are lifted from the original, but they are Done in good taste, unlike many remakes today where they just add an overabundance of scenes from the original making feel like a total repeat of the original and not add anything new, But the real show stealer is the Blob itself, the biggest improvement being the special effects, the blob has never looked more threatening or scarier.<br><br>Overall: The 1988 remake of THE BLOB is a classic but sadly overlooked Horror/Sci-Fi film, The Only problem with it is some cheesy dialog and maybe the new twist on the plot is not the best, but the biggest problem is, WHEN WILL WE GET A SPECIAL EDITION DVD/BLU RAY? It would be good to see some bonus features as well as some remastering, they could surely Polish up some of the bad green screen moments. But overall the film is a lot of fun, Highly recommended for Horror/Sci-Fi Buffs.<br><br>8/10 4/5","user":"emran222","rank":[32,35]}]
