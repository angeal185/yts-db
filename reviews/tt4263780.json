[{"title":"The Snarling: I'm as shocked as you are","rating":9,"date":"17 April 2019","review":"Okay so look at that cover, look at that title! I went in with zero expectations, I believed I was likely in for another low budget werewolf mess and when I realized it was British my hopes flatlined.<br><br>It's been a longtime since I've been this wrong, this is one of the biggest surprises I've come across in years.<br><br>A British independent horror comedy with a werewolf theme that tells that story of a small village as a movie production crew begins filming a zombie movie locally. When the bodies start to pile up it falls on the incompetent police force and local bar buddies to save the day.<br><br>It looks as cheap as you'd expect and sadly when anything even remotely werewolf happens the lack of budget shows and hurts the film.<br><br>But that's literally all I have to say in criticism of The Snarling. Well cast with a host of vaguely familiar faces from various UK soaps and sitcoms and with some of the best writing I've come across in years! I chuckled, I laughed and I split my sides......this is a genuinely hilarious movie.<br><br>Absolutely beats the pants off of most werewolf films and for that matter films in general lately. Really oddly enjoyable.<br><br>The Good:<br><br>Some good laughs<br><br>Great transitions<br><br>Oddly good writing<br><br>The Bad:<br><br>Lack of budget hurt the film","user":"Platypuschow","rank":[16,17]},{"title":"Great fun","rating":9,"date":"13 January 2019","review":"A really good independent UK horror film, filled with some good laugh moments as well as the humour that is quintessentially British. The work on the production value of this film is clear, despite the low budget that would have been associated with it - and certainly worth a watch.","user":"imdb-13887","rank":[18,26]},{"title":"They're like catnip to those dogs","rating":8,"date":"27 February 2019","review":"This is a simple werewolf comedy horror. The camera work and special effects are all low budget. The main plot of the production is a zombie film is being made. A local man looks like the star of the film (Laurence Saunders). He is asked to sub.<br><br>What made the film fun was the idiotic \"Who's on first?\" type of dialogue.<br><br>\"Which is?\"<br><br>\"Not witches. Werewolves.\"<br><br>In addition to our star being an idiot, we have a bumbling police department with an ongoing joke about their lab. I had a few laughs.<br><br>Guide: F-word.
