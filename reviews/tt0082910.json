[{"title":"\"Guess who's coming to dinner?\"","rating":10,"date":"10 October 2005","review":"If you guessed Sidney Poitier you'd be wrong. So begins James Cameron's fascination with water. And what humble beginnings they are. Cameron would probably like to forget this one, because it is sadly less perfect than Dante's original. In Piranha II: The Spawning you're no longer safe outside the water. This time they can fly. Now, with a premise like that you expect certain things. Evil, flying, man-eating fish just begs for comedy. But I assure you, this film is never played for laughs; and that's its downfall. Dante's Piranha had elements of comedy in it and this one should have followed suit (especially with flying fish!!!). Make-up legend Giannetto De Rossi did the effects for the film, however, the picture quality on the VHS I was watching was so muddled I couldn't appreciate them. The fish themselves are still accompanied by that menacing sound effect, so they still have that going for them. Unless you're a hardcore Lance Henriksen/James Cameron fan, I'd say you can miss this one.","user":"Backlash007","rank":[14,16]},{"title":"Beaches, bikinis, babes and flying killer piranha - what more can you ask for?","rating":6,"date":"6 November 2000","review":"This really isn't too bad a film, and is certainly a worthy sequel to the original. 'Piranha' worked because it was tongue-in-cheek, making fun of the films it was parodying. 'Piranha II' tries to be more serious, but is so cheesy that it manages, by default, to be just as effective.<br><br>This time round the Piranha have moved from the river and are in the sea, able to fly as a result of scientists crossing genes to make the ultimate killing machine. After the opening scene which is similar to the one in Jaws 2, (except here the two divers are lovers trying for some underwater coupling), the film introduces a variety of characters, most of which are surprisingly endearing in a 'B' movie kind of way; particularly two topless good-time girls who get provisions from a stuttering chef with the promise of a threesome.<br><br>Lance Henriksen, who continued a lucrative association with Cameron, plays the police chief, who is a hybrid of Brody from 'Jaws' and Colonel Kilgore from 'Apocalypse Now'. He valiantly plays a straight role as all around him descends into chaotic fun. The flying piranha attack like vampire bats, going for the throats of their luckless victims; whilst they also have Alien-like trends, one bursting out of a dead body to attack a nurse.<br><br>As can be gathered, I found this film great fun - most production values are of a reasonable standard, particularly the underwater photography. The piranha themselves are a disappointment, but they play second fiddle to the characters and storyline. <br><br>People who slate the film need to watch the likes of 'Barracuda' or 'Evil in the Deep', both of which are fathoms below 'Piranha II'. Any film with dialogue like \"Do you dive on your first date?\" gets the thumbs up from me.","user":"Wilbur-10","rank":[25,35]},{"title":"come on guys!!!","rating":10,"date":"6 December 2005","review":"sure it's not the best movie ever made,,but they don't do this kind of movies any more. it has a bit of that early 80's charm over it. And Lance Henriksen is never bad in a movie. sure the script blows but what a hell it's entertaining as hell. And the effects looks very cheesy at some times. mostly on the flying piranha effects they looks darn ugly. it had been better if the fishes stayed in the sea:-) those effects worked better. the music sounded like some Italian giallo film. maybe the reason for that was that the producer was Italian. iv'e got the DVD version of the film and it looks pretty good in widescreen. some scenes i wished they would have cut out, like some of the more comic characters,in a movie like this that aims for a serious story don't need unrealistic comic reliefs. like the scene when they chant *we want fish* what did the script makers think. if this was a comedy it would have been a blast,,but not when it's gonna be a horror movie. but if you ignore all the flaws in this movie and just see it for what is it's pretty OK. a forgotten little horror flick from the early 80's","user":"johanwictorsson","rank":[30,48]}]
