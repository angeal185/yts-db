[{"title":"Brilliant!!","rating":9,"date":"7 August 2015","review":"Through the last 5 years, KITES has been slammed for lots of reason,which are baseless to me, because once you see the film, you will love it..<br><br>A story of love, tragedy, excitement, sorrow, it had all.. Why still people can't get it, is not understandable.<br><br>Okay I am not blaming them, to me a film which have good story, good acting and x-factor are good film. <br><br>KITES had it all. It is simply awesome.<br><br>I will not mention the story here,as either you all know it, or you are not interested. <br><br>Hrithik was superb. Strong performance from him. Barbara was equally impressive. Rest casts did justice to their role. Good location and good music.<br><br>A must-watch.","user":"mridulm84","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"Tranquily Frenetic?","rating":10,"date":"8 September 2010","review":"Boy; after so many disheartening feedbacks from my friends; I actually enjoyed the movie. Hrithik; truly is the most charismatic actor of India. Barbara Mori's acting; her expressions; her smiles all are fabulous. She was great in the movie. I like the background scores and songs are also good. The best segment of the movie was about the dilemma of the protagonists and their snapping out of it. How two people could be entwined; purely due to feelings; traversing region, language; be it their destiny; is beautifully portrayed. Although; I didn't like the ending, but it is believable; as it is not necessary that things ought to end happily. Also, Hrithik's dance, at the movie's preamble is great; as all of us are aware of this talent of his. Surely, the movie doesn't tell a completely unique or 'not seen/heard before' kind of love story; but the direction, great acting and the composing elements like scenes, landscapes, cinematography and music does make it worth watching for a great experience, when you are completely free and in a blue/romantic mood. Great Movie; 10/10.","user":"iimraann","rank":[30,37]},{"title":"Kites, fantastic","rating":10,"date":"31 May 2010","review":"It's a Hollywood bollywood combo, but great! Main Indian audience won't like it because 90% is English and Spanish. Hrithik was SuperB in the movie and Barbara 2. It's a movie that wont gain great box-office achievement in India, but will be appreciated by many Hollywood critics. Rakesh Roshan was great as a producer and Anurag is one of the best in Bollywood. Thumbs up to them! Also, the screenplay is wonderful... Never seen such a screenplay in a Bollywoodmovie besides Black. Kites is one of a cult movie among movies as Black, MariGold etc. Just go and watch! If you don't want a ordinary Bollywood movie. It's pasta not biryani.","user":"e-mailloos","rank":[57,82]}]
