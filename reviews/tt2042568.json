[{"title":"An under the radar, anti-Hollywood masterpiece","rating":10,"date":"1 October 2016","review":"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review for on IMDb. There are only a few movies in history that have impacted me as much.<br><br>The first time I saw Inside Llewyn Davis, it left me feeling empty and confused. While I appreciated the music, the acting, and the cinematography, I couldn't understand why anyone would love this movie (and I am a huge Coen fan). After all, it's just scene after scene of a jerk getting beaten up by life with no real plot progression and no real reason to care about any of the characters.<br><br>I then came across the movie again on TV and decided to give it another chance.<br><br>After this second viewing, the movie's themes connected with me in a big way. After my third and fourth viewing, it shook me to my core.<br><br>This movie is almost too realistic. It follows none of the conventional \"rules\" and there is no winner or hero. There's no real drama. There's no \"silver lining\". There's only struggle. And then acceptance.<br><br>For every one Bob Dylan there are myriad Llewyn Davis'. Really talented musicians and artists that work really hard and simply don't catch the lucky break. People go under the radar, under-appreciated and overlooked. People that never make it big and therefore question whether they should be doing it at all.<br><br>This is a film for the everyday folk; a beautiful empathetic look at art, music, and everyday struggle.","user":"ShimmyKR","rank":[76,82]},{"title":"Fare Thee Well","rating":8,"date":"15 December 2013","review":"Greetings again from the darkness. If you are a follower of the  filmmaking Coen Brothers, then you are quite aware of their complete  lack of artistic interest in any traditionally successful character.  Their work is inspired by life's obstacles and tough luck, even if  brought on by a character's own poor judgment. Coen Brother stories  revolve around those who carry on and have (blind?) faith that their  approach, no matter how ill conceived, is the only option ... the only  path worth taking. Their main character this time out seems to think  life is filled with only careerists (sell-outs) or losers (those who  can't get a break).  The titular Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) is introduced to us  onstage at the Gaslight singing a beautiful folk song. Moments later he  is lying in the back alley after taking a whipping from a mysterious  stranger. It's not until this scene is repeated again at the film's end  do we understand the cause of this effect. See, Llewyn is not a very  likable guy. We learn he is still grieving from the suicide of his  musical partner (as sung by Marcus Mumford), and that he bounces from  sofa to sofa amongst acquaintances and family members. Llewyn has no  friends, only acquaintances too kind to throw him out ... even if he  might be the father of an unwanted baby, or if he accidentally allows a  beloved pet cat to escape.  The story is based in the folk music scene of 1961 Greenwich Village in  the pre-Bob Dylan days. The Coen's were inspired by the memoirs of Dave  Van Ronk entitled \"The Mayor of MacDougal Street\". So while the songs  are real and the characters are often inspired or based upon real  artists of the time, Llewyn's story is pure Coen fiction. That means  cringing, levels of discomfort, uneasy chuckling and moments of rapture  ... such as John Goodman evoking a drugged out Doc Promus spewing harsh  poetic diatribes.  We never really know if the Coens are making a statement or tossing it  out for us to debate. Are they saying that even the ugliness of  Llewyn's personality can produce something as beautiful as music, or  are they saying that we get tricked by beautiful music into thinking  that the artist must also be pure? Carey Mulligan (as Jean) has one of  the film's best and most insightful lines when she tells Llewyn he is  \"King Midas' idiot brother\". Her pure disgust (and expert rendering of  the F-word) and anger contrasts with her angelic onstage persona with  husband Jim (Justin Timberlake).  As always, the Coens provide us a constant flow of interesting and  oddball characters. In addition to Goodman's jazz hipster, we get  Garrett Hedlund as an ultra cool (til he's not) valet, Adam Driver as a  cowboy folk singer, Troy Nelson as a virtuous Army folk singer (based  on Tom Paxton), and Llewyn's Upper East side cat owners, his spunky  sister, and best of all F Murray Abraham as Bud Grossman, the owner of  Chicago's Gate of Horn club. Based on the real Albert Grossman who  discovered Peter, Paul and Mary, and managed Bob Dylan, Grossman is the  lone witness to Llewyn's audition. This may be the most touching  musical moment of the movie (\"The Death of Queen Jane\"), but it's  clearly the wrong song for the moment.  Oscar Isaac is exceptional as Llewyn Davis. He captures that crisis of  self that's necessary for an artist whose talent and passion is just  out of step with societal changes. We feel his pain, but fail to  understand the lack of caring he often displays towards others. We get  how his need for money overrides his artistic integrity as he  participates in the novelty song \"Please Mr Kennedy\". Why Isaac's  performance is not garnering more Oscar chat is beyond my  understanding. It's possibly due to the fact that the movie and his  character are not readily accessible to the average movie goer. Some  thought and consideration is required.  If you are expecting a feel good nostalgic trip down the folk singer  era of Greenwich Village, you will be shocked and disappointed.  Instead, brace yourself for the trials of a talented musician who  believes the music should be enough. Speaking of music, the immensely  talented T Bone Burnett is the man behind the music and it's  fascinating to note how he allows the songs to guide us through the  story and keep us ever hopeful of better days. This is the Coen  Brothers at their most refined and expert.","user":"ferguson-6","rank":[113,140]},{"title":"Once you let this film sink in, it turns out to be very rewarding","rating":8,"date":"31 January 2014","review":"\"If it was never new, and it never gets old, then it's a folk song.\"<br><br>The Coen brothers have worked together over the past couple of decades delivering some inspiring work. Their films are extremely varied (ranging from dark comedies to westerns or thrillers) and that is why people rank their films so differently according to their own genre preferences. What these films tend to have in common is that they focus on an unfortunate main character (the Coen brothers don't seem to be too interested in successful characters) and they also include a lot of quirky characters. The Coens are also great at writing interesting characters that despite being unpleasant at times still capture our attention, and they also include a lot of dark and sharp humor. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those films where we are forced to follow an unpleasant guy in the course of a week and somehow hope he recovers and achieves his goal. This is a film that you probably enjoy more when you think about it once it's over or on a rewatch because it's philosophical and sad, but rewarding none the less if you stick through it. It is also open to many readings and interpretations. You can think of this as being an honest film about someone who doesn't achieve his dreams. We've been saturated with so many films that focus on following our dreams and never giving up on them, but it is rare to see a film focusing on someone who doesn't achieve them. Like Llewyn, we sometimes throw away other possibilities for success because we are too blinded on pursuing our own thing. That is exactly what happens here (and in this way it differs from A Serious Man where the main character suffers misfortune from things that he can't control). Llewyn could've listened and taken good advice, but he's so narcissistic and blinded by his own ambition that he misses several good opportunities. Another way you can read this film, and this is the one that worked best for me, is that Llewyn is learning to cope with the loss of his partner. He was a better singer when he wasn't on his own and now that he has lost his partner he doesn't seem to know what to do next. He is a tortured artist struggling to cope with grief. It's as if the Coens were admitting that they wouldn't know how to make films without each other. They inspire one another and that is where their success relies. Perhaps if something would happen to one of them they would feel like Llewyn, lost and unable to move on. This is just brilliant filmmaking and the Coens prove once again that they are on top of their game.<br><br>The film takes place in the course of one week as we follow a struggling folk singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaacs) across Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. He has recently released a solo album that isn't selling. With no money and no apartment, Llewyn spends his days jumping from couch to couch at friends houses while performing small gigs at local Cafes. One of the places he crashes in is at fellow musicians, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean's (Carey Mulligan) apartment. Llewyn isn't really a guy anyone wants to be around much, but he continues to pursue his dream of becoming a solo artist. In a way he's his own worst enemy as many of the obstacles he faces are his own doing. <br><br>I'm not a fan of depressing films, but somehow the Coens captured my attention through their smart script and beautifully constructed film. The gray cinematography is gorgeous and really sets the melancholic tone of the film. Somehow despite not liking Llewyn, Isaacs manages to portray his character so well that we do root for him and want him to succeed. It's an impressive film that succeeds thanks to Isaacs heartfelt performance. We also get to meet some of the quirky characters that the Coens always include in their films. John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund were the chosen ones this time around and they both added the dark humor in this otherwise sad and melancholic film. The soundtrack is also a lot of fun to listen too and Isaacs has a great voice.","user":"estebangonzalez10","rank":[58,72]}]
