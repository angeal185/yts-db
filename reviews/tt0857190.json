[{"title":"What a joke compared to the 70s show","rating":1,"date":"15 April 2015","review":"This is a lazy pathetic remake of a classic 70s cop show the only reason it gets 1 out of 10 from is cause of Ray Winston he is credible as jack Reagan although not as good as the original Played by the outstanding John thaw he least brings him to life with his own interpretation of the character . As for the rest of the cast are weak and wooden especially the actor who played carter maybe needed a few lessons at acting school before making at an actor his wooden as a plank of wood but that can be said of the over actors who frankly don't even try and bring some life into this tepid material that would frankly suit an Steven sea-gal action flick . Overall if you like Ray win-stone then i guess check it out but if not and liked the original 70s series stick to that .","user":"jamesFilmfan99","rank":[17,18]},{"title":"Ten good reasons to see this film","rating":1,"date":"27 January 2013","review":"Here I have ten good reasons why you might want to see this movie.<br><br>1) If you want to see members of the police break the law, assault suspects and any one else they feel like just to get answers to questions and get away with it.<br><br>2) If you want to see someone who looks and talks like a fifteen year old kid taking out a room full of 15 stone 6ft 4in Serbian gangsters on his own without getting a scratch.<br><br>3) If you want to see a fat, bald, middle aged policeman having sex with a girl his daughters age.<br><br>4) If you want to see a policeman almost kill a superior officer and nothing is done about it.<br><br>5) If you want to see talent like Damien Lewis wasting his time in this role.<br><br>6} If you want to see total disregard for authority and the law that they carry on pursuing and killing the villains even after they have orders from the top to cease all operations.<br><br>7) If you want to see the direct ripped off cut and pasted version of the bank heist shoot out from Michael Mann's Heat transposed to Trafalgar Square.<br><br>8) If you want to see police officers living in places merchant bankers would struggle to pay for.<br><br>9) If you want to finally appreciate how good John Thaw and Dennis waterman were as Regan and Carter.<br><br>10) If you want to hear the line \"I want your gun and your badge\". Nick Love was obviously watching Dirty Harry on video when he wrote this line into the script.<br><br>Those are the ten reasons someone might possibly want to watch this excuse for a movie but only if you are male, over 40, still living with your parents, on benefits, have no girlfriend, no job and collect DVD box sets for a hobby. I am none of those things but I didn't have the benefit of reading this review before I watched it. So if you still want to watch it after reading this then you maybe need to evaluate your life.<br><br>One reason why you certainly wont want to see this movie<br><br>1) All 10 reasons above (bar no 9) and a dozen more besides but I don't have the time or the word limit).<br><br>Don't waste your money or your time on this like I did, you will walk away feeling very empty inside.","user":"bernielane","rank":[64,77]},{"title":"Jack Reagon / John Thaw would turn in his grave","rating":1,"date":"18 January 2015","review":"I just saw this on UK TV. without doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is largely terrible, particularly Ray Winston and plan b. How he ever got the part? Was he cheap?<br><br>In particular the rip off scene from heat re done in Trafalgar Square made me cringe. <br><br>I believe the budget was Â£3m, what was it spent on? The car chases were pathetic, as was the story line.<br><br>Anyone who ever watched the original series would feel the same I am sure. This is an insult to a cult classic<br><br>I'm not sure if any film could do the original,series justice, so maybe it was best left alone...<br><br>Don't watch it, life is too short","user":"rob_todd1","rank":[14,15]}]
