[{"title":"A must watch if you appreciate slow burn thrillers...","rating":10,"date":"1 October 2018","review":"The sinuous camerawork coupled with expert stage direction and overall mise en sc√®ne subtly and not so subtly at the perfect moments by Chad Dossett coaxing a riveting and titular performance by a blossoming Julianna Robinson, and supporting cast summoning a taught brooding psychological thrilling narrative that portents a Gestalt ending- which ends with one exclaiming, \" ... whoa, hold the phone \".\nNUN catapults one into a world where where seeing is only half of abstract believing ;wherein lies a rich and complex piece of filmmaking. NUN delivers with a lingering evil that rushes in threads of Antonioni's BLOW UP and Hitchcock's REBECCA.","user":"swartham","rank":[45,58]},{"title":"Worst movie ive EVER SEEN !","rating":5,"date":"5 October 2018","review":"Hello.?..Is anybody out there?
