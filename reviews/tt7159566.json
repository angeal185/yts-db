[{"title":"Low Budget Genre","rating":6,"date":"10 March 2020","review":"I'm a big fan of genre films and was waiting to see this one ever since I saw it advertised at Boston SciFi Film Fest. The trailer made it seem like a horror...other than the opening scene with the priest its not really much of a horror. The acting is really good especially the girl playing the lead. The fight scenes are really cool to see but whats with the eyes wide shut masks? Movie feels like a cheaper Chronicle. Other review mentioned the twist. I didn't see it as a twist...i figuted it out before it happened. Final shot was my favorite part. 6/10","user":"ramillsam","rank":[5,8]},{"title":"Bad topsy-turvy music-clip/TV series","rating":1,"date":"12 March 2020","review":"...montage movie.<br><br>Hint for the director - think about storytelling next time you're making a movie. If the first 30 seconds of the movie are already giving the audience a headache, re-cut it.<br><br>Sans queue ni tÃªte.","user":"ivan_dmitriev","rank":[7,13]},{"title":"I Great Independent Film!","rating":8,"date":"26 March 2020","review":"I'm a big fan of independent filmmakers pushing the limits.
