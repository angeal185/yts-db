[{"title":"Decent","rating":6,"date":"30 August 2009","review":"I have never heard of this case, read the novel, watched the Sundance film that I understand, and believe to be, far superior to this, nor did I know of the existence of any of the aforementioned until earlier today, when I spotted this in the listings. Phew. Did you catch all that? I figured I'd give this a chance, and when the first few minutes of it revealed Treat Williams in the lead, I certainly felt confident that it would be worth the time. This deals with the case of a man who may or may not have pushed his wife down the stairs. The plot isn't bad, and it definitely develops plenty throughout. Pacing is reasonable. The mystery is genuinely interesting, and the many twists and turns kept me guessing from first to last frame. Acting varies, but I didn't find any performances to be downright poor. Cinematography and editing were surprisingly great, for a made-for-TV flick. I kind of agree with those that express the opinion that this sensationalizes something that really happened, and that that's not in good taste. There is blood, violence, disturbing content and, in the dialog, sexual material, in this. I recommend this to those that find themselves attracted to it. 6/10","user":"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","rank":[5,5]},{"title":"Watch the documentary instead","rating":4,"date":"4 April 2010","review":"This film is a run of the mill, made for TV drama, which I happened to catch in the middle of the night on a cable channel.<br><br>There's nothing exactly wrong with this movie, but the documentary \"The Staircase\" (Soup√ßons) by Jean Xavier Lestrade is far superior. It's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.<br><br>The documentary is extremely suspenseful with unbelievable twists and turns. <br><br>Why settle for this fictionalized version?<br><br>Maybe I'm biased. If I perhaps hadn't seen the documentary I would have enjoyed this movie more. There's certainly nothing wrong with the acting or the suspense of the subject matter.","user":"shanayneigh","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Documentary is a must see!","rating":7,"date":"8 October 2010","review":"I watched the documentary on t.v some years ago, and was just not shocked about the raw brutality of this story, but the whole circus of having a camera crew involved in a part of this families life. How can you open you life up to a circus show when you just lost a loved one? The t.v film tells the story to great detail, but having seen the documentary before hand I advice to find a copy of it, although none have been found as a torrent as yet. When I hear or see any story about a crime I tend to have an open mind if some one is guilty or not, as that is part of the justice system, but the rule that goes hand in hand for me is, where there is smoke there is fire! and this case has lost and lots of smoke around it for me to have made up my own mind about what happened. If you watch this film I urge you to try and get your hands on the documentary, it is still by far the most bone chilling story I have ever seen, not just due to the nature of the crime, but the whole camera in your face allowing circus that goes with this story,I gave the film a 7, but a 10 out of 10 for the must see documentary.","user":"DoNotTrustImdb","rank":[3,3]}]
