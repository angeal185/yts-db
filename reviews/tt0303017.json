[{"title":"Straight to video rubbish","rating":28,"date":"28 April 2003","review":"Well, This film is lucky (for now) that the voting section is out of action otherwises I would be giving out a 3/10 for this utter nonsense.<br><br>The film's basic premise is sound enough. Underground Nuke testing has caused a disturbance in the movements of the continental plates thereby triggering a natural disaster. The Americans (fair enough, there are some major plate boundaries in the states) have to halt this movement before the world burns up with lava flowing from the earth's inner layers.<br><br>But the whole thing is so poorly thought out. The acting from the principles is so rubbish (some notable exceptions in the higher quality cast members who are just working on what they have been given). Wooden delivery of corny lines.<br><br>Also there seemed to be pointless plot additions to raise the \"action\" part including an utterly pointless and under-developed love/hate relationship between a father and daughter scientist team. Also - Hollywood - there is absolutely no need to include a romantic attachment between a male and female lead if the whole film is meant to only take place over a couple of days. It is stupid and unnecessary.<br><br>There seemed to be some other (again underdeveloped) subplot where another goverment agent (CIA ?? - can't remember - bored by then) hated the hero character - and hated him sooooo much that he was willing to try and kill him and prevent the entire mission from succeeding. Utter tripe. Another pointless plotline with the hero's daughter being lsot in the city and needing rescuing (virtually the only person lost in the city happened to be the hero's daughter). No element of the film left the audience in suspense (the pointless trip near the beginning into the underground system to \"check out\" a deep ventilation hole, was surprise surprise was needed to save the day in the end.<br><br>Also - another thing (starting to rant now). Why on a mission of such importance were only a handful of people sent in to carry (a seemingly very light - he was running with it in a bag under one arm at one point) nuclear weapon into the hot zone, with NO backup, allowing the team to be effectively mugged by some local gang.<br><br>Do not see this on video - do not stay up late to watch this on tv. Just avoid - sleeping is a better use of your time.","user":"Seamus-25","rank":[20,24]},{"title":"There's bad, and then there's BAD.","rating":1,"date":"19 January 2006","review":"Wow, is this bad.<br><br>The problem with this movie--besides a budget of $11--is that the premise contains no real conflict for the hero to overcome--it just wouldn't be that hard for the US military to detonate a bomb in an evacuated Los Angeles. So the makers start pulling obstacles and conflict out of thin air about halfway through--none of which make a lick of sense. <br><br>Characters inexplicably turn bad or suddenly start behaving contrary to everyone's interest, including their own; boogie men pop up out of nowhere for no discernible reason; and of course the hero's daughter improbably needs to be rescued from conveniently nearby. She, by the way, survives a car fire by hiding--get this--in the trunk. Yeah, that would work. <br><br>About three-quarters of the way in you realize that the reason the bomb has to be detonated in Los Angeles is that the director needed to shoot this movie across the street from his brother's dry cleaning shop so he wouldn't be late for his shift.<br><br>I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \"A-hah! This guy doesn't recognize a spoof when he sees one! Clearly this movie is tongue-in-cheek!\" <br><br>Wrong--it isn't. It's just really, really bad.","user":"imdb-2078","rank":[18,22]},{"title":"A CUT ABOVE B","rating":8,"date":"21 November 2002","review":"Sure, this zero budget Armaggeddon wannabe isn't breaking the slightest bit of new ground, but they sure do make every buck count.  Funny part is, it actually WORKS!  in large part to the acting and directing.  And thats ONLY if you forget the over the top disaster plot (the Earth's plates are moving and can only be stopped by setting off a nuke in LA)  Still, there was an honest attempt at making us care for the people in this story by way of two father/daughter plotlines and the movie has some really exciting action sequences to boot.  it was nice to see Mark Dacascos doing something other than kicking ass and actually getting to act.  Rutger Hauer adds his usual presence and John Rhys Davies was fun to watch as the scientist with a plan. this is one of those movies where you either go with the plot or don't. Despite the obvious low budget, there were some great visuals and the pacing was well done.  Music was also great (very Hans Zimmer-like).<br><br>\nin all, you could do a lot worse from the action aisle of Blockbuster.<br><br>\nRecommend only for those who love B movies that truly aspire to more.","user":"flikmaster","rank":[11,15]}]
