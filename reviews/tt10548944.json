Filled with comedy and humour , it made me laugh a lot and also has its fair share of action scenes! I dont understand why its so underrated :/ A 10/10 movie for me :D","user":"abrar-haq26","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Keep It Up","rating":10,"date":"25 September 2019","review":"When many of us wanted a revival of Teen Titans, I doubt a crossover movie with Teen Titans Go was something we wanted. Just like with Teen Titans Go To The Movies, expectations can be turned on our heads. This movie is very funny, with a nice amount of action and both teams portrayed respectfully. A nice solid message on teamwork helps make the movie great.","user":"blytheandferb","rank":[20,27]}]
