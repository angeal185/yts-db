[{"title":"Pretty good","rating":7,"date":"17 December 2018","review":"Entertaining and fun. Worth a watch.<br><br>You are expecting trouble and violence as the tagline suggests but you start off not really sure where its going to come from. Takes some character development and backstory which leads to a character driven plot. Nice film.","user":"Zsteve33","rank":[10,10]},{"title":"This film has every emotion","rating":8,"date":"17 December 2018","review":"Saw this on Prime and decided to give it a shot - glad I did.<br><br>I was expecting it to be a modern slasher/thriller, but it plays more as a modern noir. The character development is very good with each having their own distinct personality and you can't quite figure it out. They leave you with different emotions as their motivations and true colors come out.<br><br>The most enjoyable part of the film was as it intensifies it throws in humor, which is a nice overlay.<br><br>Acting was particularly good and the dialogue, score and violence give it a Tarantino like feel, but a bit more dialed down.<br><br>Overall 8/10.","user":"Sjac516","rank":[9,9]},{"title":"I liked it!","rating":8,"date":"20 December 2018","review":"I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but immediately was intrigued after the quirky start and the \"rewind\" of the Sheriff.<br><br>The movie has some great dialogue. Dialogue that isn't incredibly exciting for a movie, but dialogue that sounds like real conversation. Within the dialogue are quirks and jokes as well which are nice.<br><br>Once the action starts, it starts, and maintains its style.. The story isn't mind blowing by any means - its quite simple, but I think thats the point. Its about the people and the way it plays out that makes it fun.","user":"jswpsu","rank":[7,7]}]
