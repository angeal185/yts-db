[{"title":"\"I've killed more people than cancer!\"","rating":7,"date":"5 April 2014","review":"Whenever a belated sequel to a \"so bad it's good\"-classic gets released, I start fearing what I call the \"Birdemic\"-effect. Directors who have accidentally obtained a cult status by being really terrible often start being really terrible on purpose, completely ruining their magic. I'm glad to say David A. Prior isn't one of those directors. \"Deadliest Prey\" is 100% serious, 100% genuine and 100% laughable. In many ways it's actually even more entertaining than its original. It definitely looks better, the special effects are upped a notch (not a fan of CGI, but the first one was almost completely bloodless), the dialogues are...slightly better and the fights are...slightly more realistic. Apart from that, this is pretty much the same movie as \"Deadly Prey\". The plot (so to speak) develops exactly like in the first one, right down to the smallest details. Five minutes in you think oh, almost the same opening scene as the first. That's kinda lazy, bring on the new stuff! Then Danton gets kidnapped while taking out the garbage, and then they tell him to \"RUN!\", and then he leaves someone alive if he tells him what's going on and then just kills him anyway. Oh what's next, they're going to kidnap his wife and he'll find the female henchman (henchwoman?)in his house? Thornton is ready to kill him but Hogan wants him alive because otherwise the movie's over too soon? Oh, both these things also happen? Well, I'm sure they're not cutting someone's arm off ag...this is a remake, pure and simple. But a nice remake, with a heart and a better pace than the original. It adds nothing, but it's still worth seeing.","user":"Sandcooler","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"True that","rating":16,"date":"16 July 2015","review":"I only saw the original Deadly Prey a few weeks ago and I enjoyed it so much I went out of my way to get this follow up. The original is really a great Gem of a cheapy, David Prior was well aware of the production limitations and just has an absolute Ball with the hokey material, in some ways it is even more funny than Rambo First Blood Part 2! The Deadliest Prey is more of a rehash than a true sequel, sort of like how Terminator 2 lifts many scenes from the original with slight context alterations, but TDP is a more extreme case. The new slant added to the story is the human hunting is caught on camera and broadcast over the net. Many of the original actors have come back to reprise their roles which bolsters the authenticity of the proceeding for fans, you will be surprised to hear their acting prowess hasn't changed one iota, and we wouldn't have it any other way! In all honesty, TDP isn't quite as entertaining as the original, but with that said there are still some great gags like when Danton is 'recruited' again, and if the Hackers don't at least make you smile, there is something seriously wrong. For all lovers of B films, Deadly Prey &amp; The Deadliest Prey makes a great double- bill...True that!","user":"MeanYOB64","rank":[4,7]},{"title":"Wow,This is what a sequel is supposed to be,You hear us Stallone !","rating":17,"date":"17 September 2013","review":"Stars: Ted Prior,David Campbell,Fritz Matthews. What would you do if the director of a film offered a pre-release showing of his long awaited sequel ? WATCH IT !!! Do not wanna give away any spoilers at all,But David Campbell,The Villain,Has some catch phrases and a half to enjoy. Ted Prior revisits one of his favorite roles,Danton from Deadly Prey,Ted as we interviewed recently wasn't sure he could still be 'The Prey',But letting his fans make their own opins about results, You Go Dude ! Bringing Fritz Matthews back was a screenwriters nightmare ( NO SPOILERS,REMEMBER) and a gift to David Prior fans. Did we mention David Campbell steals the film scene after scene, And Ted Prior seems to be okay with considering their last filmic dance. Lots of knife work,bullets shot and traps galore. There is ironic comedy too. Would wish DEADLY PREY was promoted as 25th anniversary edition sometime.","user":"guestar57","rank":[8,18]}]
