[{"title":"Barbie to the galaxy's rescue","rating":7,"date":"18 October 2016","review":"\"Might contain spoilers\"<br><br>Okay, so as an avid watcher - not exactly a fan, but I have watched around 95% of the Mattel Barbie movies - I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be different and innovative.<br><br>The concept and idea was good. The animation, voice acting, lighting, and color was vibrant and lovely. They've really upper their game over the past few years. I did miss the inclusion of Kelly Sheridan as Barbie since I've grown accustomed to her wonderful voice. But Erica was a stunning replacement.<br><br>The animation itself screamed sophistication. Yes, a few animals lacked pizazz and creativity, but nobody's perfect. The animal preserve scenes were gorgeous. The city too.<br><br>My qualms stem from the obvious - Barbie must always save the day, Barbie must always be a goody-two-shoes, Barbie somehow always ends up shrouded in magical sparkles. Yes, it's kinda glorious and sparkly and pretty, but it gets repetitive. I was pleasantly surprised by her lack of outfit change in the climax. I was silently hoping she stayed in her practical gear. And she did. The movie sent forth a vibe that was a cross between Star Trek and Stars Wars. I know, I know. Shame on me for comparing a piece of trash, kid's movie to STAR WARS, right? But the controls, the ship, the aliens on the planet . . . Well, they looked eerily familiar. Not to mention Barbie's resemblance to a certain female called Rey. Just saying.<br><br>There was also something a little off in the third act. I somehow felt as though something was missing - some huge chunk of the end. I guess I was expecting a villain trying to steal the stars or enslave the galaxy, or maybe even the king turning out to be the bad guy. Hints were dropped throughout the movie only to leave me dissatisfied with a lackluster conclusion to a promising tale.<br><br>Overall, if a little more planning had gone into the plot, the movie would have been a solid addition to the Barbie franchise. I do love the science fiction aspect, really. But the plot holes seemed to be akin to black holes.","user":"KiffyCub","rank":[5,6]},{"title":"Brilliant","rating":10,"date":"14 September 2016","review":"Brilliant Barbie Movie as always.<br><br>Good plot (obviously for adults can guess the plot). Good message about following your heart and you don't need to be perfect but apologise if done something wrong even if for the right reasons. <br><br>Keep going. <br><br>The good thing about barbie movies is the strong female roles. Which is great for my girls.<br><br>Also good to see Barbie have a parent when she is playing \"herself\".<br><br>I like the Barbie movies as shows there is more to being a princess. You don't need a prince to save you and to remember to be yourself. Even when it is difficult and everyone is telling you not to.","user":"aavon-75356","rank":[8,11]},{"title":"Love this movie","rating":10,"date":"3 October 2016","review":"Glad to see such an innovative new addition to the Barbie films. I am an adult that appreciates the positivity and good production value of these films. My kids love each installment with rare exception. There's always quality in voice acting, CGI and some funny small details signaling that they do intact \"try\" and succeed. They definitely aren't just for children and a child's attention deficits shouldn't correlate with the quality of the movie per a previous reviewer. I think that this film definitely deserves a ten out of ten and I look forward to seeing future innovative Barbie installments. They can't make enough Barbie movies! (: In fact, if Mattel is reading this please make more.","user":"owlmoonsun","rank":[4,9]}]
