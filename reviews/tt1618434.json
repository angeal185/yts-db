[{"title":"Old fashioned murder mystery on a ship.","rating":8,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"A nice easy breezy murder mystery. Full of fun. Don't count on anything serious or deep here just sit back with your popcorn and a soda and enjoy the movie. Nothing offencive here. Just an adult murder mystery romp. We don't get many like these anymore. Ignore the people who like to criticize everything because they think they are actual critics. Chemistry between Aniston and Sadler is awesome. I hope they make more movies together.","user":"dogma-53668","rank":[462,605]},{"title":"Good movie","rating":8,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"I found this movie very enjoyable it has an Agatha Christie vibe to it Adam sandler and Jennifer aniston have great chemistry it's worth a watch","user":"barngoddess4","rank":[298,418]},{"title":"Consistently Entertaining","rating":7,"date":"14 June 2019","review":"It may not be an oscar contender but it's certainly a fun time.
