[{"title":"There are no political borders when you see the earth from space.","rating":8,"date":"27 January 2019","review":"You don't necessarily have to be a space dork to appreciate a documentary like this one even though it helps. I'm always amazed by those documentaries, to see how science progressed in such a little time, and to think in what we could accomplish in the next decades. It's going to be necessary anyways when you see how we slowly destroy anything on our lovely planet. The shots of our mother earth are beautiful and like Scott Kelly said very wisely \"there are no political borders when you see the earth from space\". The documentary is about the first humans living for one entire year in space, doing some research and tests, and discovering how such a long time in space could effect the human body. The fraternity between an American and Russian astronaut should be an exemple for everybody, just to show that all terrestrial borders should be abolished. We are all earthlings and our only concern should be to conserve our planet instead of destroying it slowly. A Year In Space is a well done and very interesting documentary, even for the ordinary people.","user":"deloudelouvain","rank":[3,5]},{"title":"Stop with the overly dramatic music.","rating":6,"date":"24 October 2019","review":"Bad choice with the music and scoring. Very stale, tacky and it nearly destroyed my experience with the film.","user":"weaveofkev-119-712475","rank":[1,2]}]
