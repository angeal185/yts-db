[{"title":"The slapstick over the top Dad!ðŸ˜ ","rating":2,"date":"1 December 2018","review":"I have a perpetual look of disgust in any scene he is in. He is absolutely cringeworthy. So much so that I'm not sure what else is going on in the movie as I'm only 10 minutes in but I'm ready to call it a wrap. To switch an actor for a cartoonish nut is unforgivable.\nOh! We've hit the wedding planner sceneðŸ™„. That's two cartoonish nuts.","user":"vjenee","rank":[50,56]},{"title":"Terrible","rating":2,"date":"1 December 2018","review":"2 stars for Rose McIver, that's it as she was the only good thing about this dumpster fire.<br><br>OK The first one was not that great, but well.. It was a typical been done 20 times better already unoriginal type fair, but it was still OK I guess. This garbage takes a dump all over it.<br><br>They took Amber's father from the first movie who was a good kind smart strong guy and replaced him with an unfunny disgraceful bozo JarJar Binks type fool and don't even get be started on the designer clown. They were so bad and so over the top it was painfully unbearable to suffer through.<br><br>Not sure what the director was thinking but he should find a new line of work.","user":"ShadowTek","rank":[50,56]},{"title":"Dad Recast?!?","rating":3,"date":"6 December 2018","review":"I hate the new dad they recasted. He's too stereotypical, \"New York New York\" kind of attitude and doesnt carry the calm, grounded acting father from the first one. He simply ANNOYS me and really makes me not want to watch it. Or skip all the parts he's in. I dont need his comedic attitude. I love the cheesy, loving, collected father which is what I related to with the first one. Not this all out-there kind of guy. Whatever I'm 15 mins into and already hate the dude.","user":"annbiagi","rank":[27,30]}]
