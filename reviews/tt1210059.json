[{"title":"A Complex Interplay of Damaged Characters","rating":10,"date":"4 July 2013","review":"It is not evident why this film, released in 2010, did not attract more attention. In many ways it is a tough little story that takes audience concentration throughout to make it all fit together, but the impact of the messages it delivers make it one of the more impressive films of the decade!<br><br>The film opens with down on her luck Sophie Conway (Maggie Grace) stumbling through a drug and alcohol addled existence in Los Angeles, her life in shambles as she has sex on a bus with stranger Benji (Rick Gonzalez). With her life at a crossroads, the 25 year old Sophie returns home to the small town of Lompoc (a little town in Santa Barbara County) she always wanted to forget. Once home, she is faced with the friends - Mila (Nikki Deloach) - and lovers - Billy (Jonathan Tucker) - she left behind, a tangled relationship with her Mother (Christine Lahti) and her married paramour Steven (Cary Elwes), and Harry Pleasant (Hal Holbrook), an Alzheimer's Disease patient who, in an opposing way, shares Sophie's struggle to remember. Each of the characters in the story is trying to mentally escape a past that is painful and their interaction slowly reveals the truths of their past experiences, why they have grown apart, and how facing cloudy memories and struggling to make them clear can actually change their lives.<br><br>Hal Holbrook gives an incredibly thoughtful and eloquent portrayal of the cruelties of Alzheimer's Disease, Christine Lahti returns to the screen in a potent portrayal of a woman who attempts to disguise her life disappointments with alcohol, Maggie Grace completely inhabits the tough role of Sophie whose inability to remember the details of her father's suicide influences all of the characters' lives, and Jonathan Tucker is the epitome of a lad unable to forgive the past and move forward out of the small town into the world of adulthood. Derek Magyar directs Thomas Kuehl impeccable script with a natural ease -a factor that allows the story to unfold slowly like entering a strange other place for the first time. This is a very fine film that deserves a wide audience. <br><br>Grady Harp","user":"gradyharp","rank":[13,15]},{"title":"Great heart felt movie. Deserved an Oscar nod.","rating":9,"date":"19 July 2013","review":"My honey rented this movie and I had very low expectations. The movie started off with me expecting a story about a spoiled rich kid. It quickly transformed into a story about the struggles of young lost girl who returned home to a drunken mother. Still I thought, what a rich spoiled brat, but then she took a job caring for a retired sheriff with Alzheimer's. Her transformation and the story of a man trying to remember his past sucked you in! <br><br>Maggie Grace does a phenomenal job in her role. It's quite a true performance and shows her true abilities! Above and beyond Taken. Hal Holbrok at 85 years old put's in a great performance. His skill sucks you in and you really feel his plight! <br><br>The final message at the end, was trans-formative and compelling! I give this movie 9 out of 10 stars!","user":"shallquist-960-986313","rank":[4,5]},{"title":"A quality indie drama.","rating":7,"date":"13 February 2013","review":"I believe Hal Holbrook is genuinely a fantastic actor that should have won an Oscar by now, and the older he gets - the better he is, just like a glass of fine wine. Here you have intriguing drama with a delicate portrait of a person suffering from Alzheimer's disease, but that's just the underlying theme of how fractioned our lives are when relying only on our memories. But no - it's not another of those movies dealing with 'terminal illness', it's much more than that. <br><br>The main story revolves around Sophie Conway as played by Maggie Grace who is really a capable actress which most of you will remember from now cult TV show 'Lost'. And no - she's definitively not just a pretty face on the screen but does a great job portraying a torn, broken girl haunted by her past and yet emanating a sort of hidden, quiet strength at the same time. All of the supporting cast is excellent, notably Jonathan Tucker and Christine Lahti and I'd hate to spoil details of plot for you. If there is any issues, I'd have to mention that pace of the movie suffers a bit in some parts but then again the director Derek Magyar is taking his time developing the characters to the fullest and resolving the story in, albeit expected, satisfying manner. <br><br>With accompanying melancholic and absorbing soundtrack, this might not be a perfect movie or breaking any new grounds - but I'd recommend this to anyone that has a small degree of patience and likes slow-burning character driven dramas. Especially when you have such fine actors in leading roles like Hal Holbrook and Maggie Grace.","user":"amplifiedheart-2","rank":[2,2]}]
