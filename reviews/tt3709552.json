[{"title":"For all discerning film viewers this is a film well worth seeing","rating":8,"date":"13 May 2018","review":"Being an Englishman who has been living in Poland for the last 16 years I was interested to see this joint Polish-Anglo production and it is definitely worth it for those viewers who are interested in this period of history just after the end of World War II.<br><br>The film, based on a true story, covers the British and American cover up of the Katyn massacre in 1940 by the Russian NKVD of around 22,000 Poles from the intelligentsia, military, church i.e. the country's elite. The victims were shot in the back of the head and buried in mass graves in the Katyn Forest, to be discovered a year later by German forces who were building a road thru the forest. In efforts to maintain the Russian commitment to defeating the Nazis, the massacre was blamed on the Germans.<br><br>Alex Pettyfer is very convincing in the role of Stephen Underwood, the young journalist who sets out to discover the mystery of why so many Polish soldiers are committing suicide in his area of Bristol. This is a mission that is of no interest to his editor (Michael Gambon) and he meets several obstacles along the way in his quest to find out the truth.<br><br>He is assisted in his quest by his lover, Jeanette Mitchell (Talulah Riley) who gives a good (but a times a little stilted ) performance and his efforts are being monitored by the British, headed by Mason Mitchell (Jeanette's homosexual husband played by Henry Lloyd-Hughes, who also puts in a convincing performance). The witness is played by the well-known actor, Robert Wieckiewicz, and his role is at the crux of the film's plot.<br><br>So, all in all a definite recommendation to see this film. Piotr Szkopiak (born to Polish parents in London - they were deported from Poland in 1939), who is both the film's director and co-writer, looks like a promising young director to watch out for.","user":"kinsmanivan","rank":[79,95]},{"title":"Whoever gave this 1 is crazy!","rating":8,"date":"31 May 2018","review":"The Katyn massacre by the Soviets in 1940 remained officially undisclosed until 1990 when Gorbachev admitted it. The unofficial truth was known by the British and American governments during World War II and by the public since the late 1940s. This film follows a journalist's fight to tell the truth to the public and the repercussions of his actions.<br><br>Whoever gave this film a 1 must be crazy. Extremely well shot and acted, this is a good film especially if you are interested in the Katyn massacre. An Anglo- Polish production, it is not a Hollywood blockbuster but a very poignant tale told in a non-Hollywood way..I enjoyed it.","user":"roguegrafix","rank":[36,45]},{"title":"Worthy!
