[{"title":"The Japanese family concept manifested in a fun and clever film","rating":9,"date":"3 August 2018","review":"A few short days after watching Ambiguous Places and feeling that I don't get Japanese humor, I got a chance to mend things between me and the Japanese sense of humor. This is a very Japanese family story, that manages to be universal at the same time. <br><br>Charming witty and fun, all the way through. Superb animation of nature, nature's phenomanons (think of the falling snow) and city surroundings. The people as always with Japanese anima, are secondery. but it doesn't hurt the overall result. One of the best real life fantasies I've seen from Japan or anywhere else in a very long while. Kids will love it and will identify with the four years old hero and his lovely family. Adults will love its wit and wisdom.","user":"ayoreinf","rank":[33,44]},{"title":"Wonderfully enjoyable, but stutters in its early stages","rating":7,"date":"4 November 2018","review":"Director Mamoru Hosoda is up there as one of the brightest talents in modern anime, having brought us gems like Summer Wars, Wolf Children and The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. For me, Mirai unfortunately isn't his greatest work, largely due to poor pacing throughout the first two acts, as well as the seeming lack of depth and introspection compared with his other films, which proves extremely frustrating up until the excellent final act, which eventually helps Mirai come good.<br><br>Before we get into that, however, I will say that Mirai is a fairly enjoyable film right the way through. Far more family-friendly than Hosoda's previous works, it has the quirky charm of some of the lightest Ghibli movies, and with that effortlessly beautiful animation throughout, it's hard not to find yourself smiling from time to time.<br><br>With a young boy as the film's main character, I'm sure that younger viewers will have a wonderful time with Mirai, as a lot of its central themes focus on those that those even as young as four or five years old can relate to, as we see Kun, the young boy, find himself frustrated and jealous as his parents turn their attention to his newborn baby sister.<br><br>It's a pleasant story throughout, and unless you're averse to hearing children screaming (because there is quite a lot of that here), it keeps you engaged and entertained right the way through. However, in comparison to Hosoda's previous works, there's nowhere near as much depth of emotion in Mirai, and its central themes come off as a little simplistic, which can be disappointing if you're expecting something a little bit more captivating.<br><br>Certainly, we've all been through that feeling of jealousy much like young Kun, but for older viewers, it's a theme that's a little too far back and simplistic to really provide a deep emotional impact. Of course, it's an enjoyable story nonetheless, but over the course of the film's first two acts, I found myself rather underwhelmed that the plot wasn't going anywhere beyond that simple line of focus.<br><br>What's more is that those first two acts move at a painfully jittery pace, as we flip between the present, and Kun's various adventures to eras past and future as he visits his relatives through time. In all truth, Mirai doesn't do a good enough job at tying those two parts of the story together, and although there are clear emotional parallels between the past, present and future, the way that the film transitions between those two main parts of the story is rather jagged and abrupt, which proves hugely frustrating as you look for some sort of flow in the film.<br><br>Fortunately, while I can't say I was all too impressed by the first two acts, the film's final vignette proves a stunning conclusion, finally bringing about the depth of emotion and sense of wonderment that everything before was so disappointingly lacking in.<br><br>For one, seeing a young boy effectively travelling through time should inspire an incredible sense of wonderment and awe, yet the first two acts seem strangely normal in their presentation of this. However, in that final act, we see Kun transported to a world filled with bizarre and dazzling things, and as he becomes more and more aware of his situation, the gravity and emotion of what he's going through finally hits home for you too.<br><br>As I said earlier, the film's central theme is a little simplistic compared to what Hosoda has brought in the past, however, come the finale, he finally crafts a scenario that allows the raw emotion and drama of what the story is about, and with an equal improvement in the screenplay's depth, Mirai comes to a stunning and moving conclusion.<br><br>Overall, then, I found Mirai a little bit of a mixed bag. Starting off in rather underwhelming fashion with a jittery and underwhelming first two acts, it does eventually come good with an exceptional finale that finally brings about some strong emotion and drama. It is still a pleasant and enjoyable film throughout, and it's undoubtedly more family-friendly than any of Hosoda's other films, so while it's not perfect, it's definitely still worth the watch.","user":"themadmovieman","rank":[22,30]},{"title":"Patience and perspective","rating":7,"date":"8 January 2019","review":"Kon Ichikawa's 1962 film \"Watashi wa nisai\" was translated to \"Being Two Isn't Easy\" for English-speaking audiences. Without seeing it, you get a fair idea of what the film is about from the title alone. Mamoru Hosoda's \"Mirai\" (or \"future\") isn't quite such an obvious title, though naming it \"Being Four and Becoming a Big Brother Isn't Easy\" wouldn't quite give the game away either.<br><br>A semi-autobiographical work, Mamoru Hosoda's film tells of learning patience and perspective in a film that is both close to reality and fantastical. These switches can perhaps annoy, but anyone living with a toddler will be able to sympathise to some extent, but your overall reaction to \"Mirai\" might be dependent on your life situation, and indeed, like a two year-old, your current mood.<br><br>Four year-old Kun's parents have just had a second baby: daughter Mirai. This new addition angers Kun, no longer the sweet little one of the household, able to walk and talk, he is not given the attention he is used to. Fighting his parents, he also tries to fight his little sister.<br><br>Frequently left frustrated, whenever passing the oak tree in his architect father's quirkily-designed house, in true \"Christmas Carol\" tradition, he meets a spirit that gives him a life lesson. Their pet dog as a prince, felt abandoned since Kun was born; a teenage Mirai letting him know her feelings as to his behaviour towards her; his mother at his age - not the strict disciplinarian she has become; and his great grandfather who teaches him to be brave.<br><br>Switching between the household base and the various scenarios in time, Kun is not quick to learn from his family members' teachings. But, as for any toddler, it takes time and reinforcement for him to finally realise Mirai as his little sister and see himself as the big brother he is needed to be.<br><br>As the film's opening shows, this is a film of exquisite detail and has been carefully considered. The detail in the animation is rich, giving \"Mirai\" an almost 3D feel. The character movements and mannerisms are well thought-out and realistic and recall the opening moments of a Studio Ghibli film.<br><br>To some extent, the reality of the scenario also has this same level of due care and attention, reflecting Hosoda's own life experience as a father to an older son and younger daughter. One cannot help but relate to the mother and father's predicament: the father taking on the parenting while working from home while the mother goes back to work. This is designed so that each character can see the world from the perspective of the others. The father is now a \"better dad\" compared to his involvement in raising Kun, being at home all day and having to take on more responsibility. Kun is not the only one who has to see things from the viewpoint of another. And a few parents in the audience might agree.<br><br>However, as the parents do not get as much airtime as Kun, their scenario isn't fully developed enough to make this a film aimed at adults struggling to raise young children. While one can relate to the struggles, the realism is more in Kun's mannerisms and behaviour, rather than the film's story and conclusions. The parents' dialogue can perhaps be a little too open, direct and articulate to accurately reflect the struggle. And for some, the revelations may seem obvious for the amount of struggle to get there, but so much in life is, until taking a step back.<br><br>Like a toddler's mood and behaviour, the film switches continuously. The changes to the future and past selves can make this more a collection of life lessons for Kun, rather than a complete whole. But each day comes with its own challenges and having to start again from scratch. As such, \"Mirai\" doesn't drag on or bore.<br><br>The more fantastical elements might be a little difficult for some to take, myself included (and why I do not watch as much anime as I could - in fact, this is a film I might normally avoid). These can somewhat detract from the realism approach in the present day scenario, though his meeting with his younger mother leads to some of the strongest visual elements of the film.<br><br>The ending, however, feels a little too far into the fantastical. With the film's strengths more in the subtle nuances of Kun's behaviour, the ending feels a bit more blatant in its delivery of fear factor and can feel a little disappointing, and more in-line with more young adult-aimed anime. Having a hint of \"Spirited Away\" in its conclusion, the ending could have perhaps been more refined.<br><br>But with both good and bad elements, \"Mirai\" is very much like a child. Parents will be able to relate to Kun's difficult behaviour and frustration, and this may give it enough to overlook the weaker points, as they would their own children. Without this standpoint however, \"Mirai\" might not have the same effect and feel like a lot of bumpy emotion rather avoided.<br><br>Essentially, being four and becoming a big brother isn't easy, and watching it isn't either, and your response might be down to your level of patience and perspective.","user":"politic1983","rank":[17,26]}]
