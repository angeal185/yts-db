[{"title":"Not a great one ,, but not as bad as the other reviews describe it to be ..","rating":5,"date":"9 September 2018","review":"So the story is not an original one ,, watched a couple of movies about that that \"ghoul\" or \"djin\" that comes to you while you're paralyzed in sleep .. but to be fair ,, there was actually more than a couple of creepy seat jumping moments ... I mean it wasn't all bad ,, even the ending was just a bit improbable if i might say.<br><br>The cast were all good ,, Olga Kurylenko did a good job ,, such a talented beauty ,, I loved her back in 2007 Hitman ,, and to be honest haven't seen her much since ... That Dougie character \"Craig Conway\" was also really good.<br><br>Overall ,, Not the scariest movie in history ,, but it's not bad at all ... watch it at 2:00 am and you'll know what i mean :D","user":"Aktham_Tashtush","rank":[58,69]},{"title":"Great Acting By Olga Kurylenko & Boring Storyline","rating":4,"date":"23 September 2018","review":"Rating 4.9/10\nFirst of all, i want to give credit to Olga Kurylenko because have done a good job in this movie as criminal psychologist Kate Fuller, who investigates the murder of a man and is haunted by demon who kills people in their sleep. Unfortunately, the storyline in this movie is too slow and boring. This film can make you fall asleep in the cinema. So Disappointed .","user":"ymyuseda","rank":[131,163]},{"title":"Flawed but Creepy","rating":6,"date":"28 September 2018","review":"When a man is apparently murdered by his wife Helena (Rosie Fellner) during the night, the rookie criminal psychologist Dr. Kate Fuller (Olga Kurylenko) is assigned to investigate whether she should go to prison or to an institution. She promises to HelenaÂ´s little daughter Sophie that her mother would stay with her. But when the woman claims that a demon killed her husband during a sleep paralysis, Dr. Fuller sends her to an institution. However she decides to investigate the case further and discovers a creepy truth about an ancient demon that attacks people with sleep paralysis.<br><br>\"Mara\" is a flawed but creepy horror film, with a demon that attacks during the sleep and slightly recalls Freddy Krueger. The viewer startles many times and the greatest flaw is how easy and quickly Kate discovers the truth about the demon checking the documents Dougie had gathered and studied for a long time. The ambiguous conclusion is also great. My vote is six.<br><br>Title (Brazil): Not Available","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[32,39]}]
