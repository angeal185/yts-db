[{"title":"Not worth the time","rating":2,"date":"18 June 2019","review":"I'm a big horror fan and thought I'd give this one a go. Absolute waste of time. The acting was pretty bad and overall just hard to get through this one. Should have followed my gut and stayed away.","user":"jkep10","rank":[15,20]},{"title":"Really Bad","rating":1,"date":"20 October 2019","review":"This movie is not worth the time it took to make it. The actors and actresses are terrible.","user":"ginajaylan","rank":[3,3]},{"title":"Gave it a go...","rating":1,"date":"23 June 2019","review":"And it was a pure waste of time. From the beginning until the end. Made no sense. I mean the guy making people kill others by a pill. It states in the title explaination that he brainwashed, HOW? He had no communication until end. Also why would anyone on earth a drink that a stranger gave them.","user":"dbarksda","rank":[8,12]}]
