[{"title":"For all us guys.","rating":7,"date":"17 April 2002","review":"A man suddenly finds himself able to read women's minds and actually know what women want from men.Now,what guy doesn't want to be in that position? This was a terrific idea for a film and it was executed to perfection.Who better than Mel Gibson to represent us in this situation? He's the one man women probably wish understood them.At any rate,Gibson really turns on the Gibson charm here and there's not a better film in which to do that.Helen Hunt makes a great leading lady and is her usual charming self.Also,from the supporting cast,it's always great to see Alan Alda,one of the most underrated actors of our time.This film starts with a very unique,funny idea,and it does not disappoint in terms of how good it can be executed.Well casted,well directed and very funny film.","user":"SmileysWorld","rank":[83,103]},{"title":"A romantic comedy that a guy can see too","rating":7,"date":"1 February 2004","review":"This is pretty much the typical romantic comedy, but with an interesting twist; the main character has the ability to hear womens thoughts. The important thing was that for it to work, the character would be placed in a lot of interesting comical situations, where you could laugh at it, without it being too mocking of womens thoughts, or too far-out to enjoy. It succeeds pretty well, however the way the character gains and loses the ability were handled somewhat poorly. The humor is good, and there is plenty of it, throughout the entire runtime. The characters were believable, and the main character eventually grew to be likable. The plot was good, and the acting likewise. The only thing that brings the movie down, is the poor execution of the gain/loss of the ability to hear womens thoughts, and the sugar-sweet ending, that was too predictable and plain boring, as anyone who's seen one of the hundreds(possibly thousands) of romantic comedies out there. No actual new stuff brought to the table, apart from the interesting and original concept of a man being able to hear what women are thinking. OK for a romantic comedy. 7/10","user":"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","rank":[64,79]},{"title":"Hilarious! A laugh a minute!","rating":8,"date":"28 May 2001","review":"Mel Gibson is known as sort of a macho action hero, and stereotyped into his Mad Max/Martin Riggs persona.  But I've noticed (except for \"Braveheart\" and \"The Patriot\") he injects comic relief into almost anything he does.  So doing a straight comedy doesn't seem like much of a stretch, and as you watch in a movie like this Gibson's timing and delivery is impeccable.  On and off the camera, he has an incredible sense of humor, and he probably improvised some featured gags.<br><br>The premise is very original and interesting.  A guy who can hear a woman's every thought?  That's pretty much every man's fantasy.  And the premise is used wisely.  I laughed the whole way through!  It's hilarious to watch Gibson emasculating himself by the minute, and the joke never runs dry. <br><br>\nI was laughing so much that I was able to tolerate the film's corny ending. I mean, when is a romantic comedy going to come along that doesn't feature a formulaic ending that is supposed to make people leave the theater and go \"Awwww\"?<br><br>The supporting cast is full of big stars.  Bette Midler has an amusing cameo as a chain-smoking shrink.  I only wish she could've had some additional scenes.  <br><br>\"What Women Want\" is an original, feel-good comedy that will have you on the floor!  This not a \"chick flick.\"  If you want to laugh--this is the movie to see!  No questions asked!<br><br>My score:  8 (out of 10)","user":"mattymatt4ever","rank":[66,83]}]
