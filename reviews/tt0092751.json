[{"title":"Abel Ferrara's most conventional and commercial movie. A solid drama about inter-racial romance, cultural differences and gang rivalry.","rating":1,"date":"1 January 2003","review":"'China Girl' is easily Abel Ferrara's most conventional and commercial movie to date. Thankfully it improves on his previous movie 'Fear City', which was too compromised and \"Hollywood\" to succeed. The story is a basic updating of Romeo And Juliet set against the background of Chinese and Italian gang rivalry. Newcomers Richard Panebianco and Sari Chang play Tony and Tye the ill fated lovers who continue their forbidden romance against pressure from their family and friends. Neither actor has went on to all that much but they are both more than adequate and make a sweet couple. The real action comes from solid performances by James Russo ('Donnie Brasco'), David Caruso ('Kiss Of Death'), Russell Wong ('The Prophecy 2'), Paul Hipp ('Teenage Caveman') and Joey Chin ('Year Of The Dragon'), many of whom went on to work with Ferrara on later projects. It was also good to see Judith Malina ('Dog Day Afternoon') and veteran character actor James Hong ('Big Trouble in Little China') in supporting roles. While by no means as flamboyant and confrontational as Ferrara's best known work, this is a surprisingly entertaining story which should appeal to a much wider audience than his \"difficult\" but rewarding movies such as the stunning 'Bad Lieutenant' or the fascinating 'The Addiction'. This movie doesn't deserve its obscurity and is well worth a rental.","user":"Infofreak","rank":[12,12]},{"title":"Good, updated version of Romeo and Juliet","rating":8,"date":"30 January 2005","review":"\"China Girl\" is a good, updated version of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet.\" The film, which centers on the forbidden romance between Italian-American Tony (Tony Panebianco) and Chinese-American Tye (Sari Chang), is not great, but brings this ancient story of \"star-cross'd lovers\" to new generations. Shakespeare's language is beautiful, but in this day of short attention spans among our young people he can come across as old and stodgy. Showing this film (along with \"Brooklyn Babylon,\" \"West Side Story,\" \"Rocky Road,\" \"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,\" \"Pretty in Pink,\" \"Romeo Must Die!\" and of course, the 1968 classic adaptation, \"Romeo and Juliet\" by Franco Zeferrelli) can introduce young people to Shakespeare in school, since \"Romeo and Juliet\" is one of his most famous stories. Young people can realize how timeless Shakespeare's story is, and how it can apply to today's world.<br><br>The movie: Tony and Tye meet at a nightclub and fall in love, despite the fact that their ethnic factions are fighting against each other for turf through gang warfare. I agree with previous reviews that the supporting actors are much better than the leads, even though Panebianco and Chang are attractive and impressive in their first roles. The movie is action-packed, containing several fight scenes and one particular scene of graphic violence at the end. There is also a lot of profanity, so viewers should be forewarned. I felt it was strange, however, that for a movie with a supposedly passionate love story, the sex scene was pretty disappointing and actually unsexy! Despite these caveats, though, I think \"China Girl\" is a good movie and I wish it had done better at the box office. Maybe some cable movie channel can show this film back-to-back with other \"Romeo and Juliet\"-inspired films for one day, so viewers can see the similarities and differences among the various films. Now that's something that I would like to see! I give this movie an 8 out of 10.","user":"valeriempeterson","rank":[8,9]},{"title":"Love and Ethnic Prejudice in New York City","rating":8,"date":"17 May 2017","review":"In the 80's, in New York City, the teenager Anthony \"Tony\" (Richard Panebianco) lives in Little Italy and works making pizza dough in a pizzeria. He goes to a nightclub, where he meets the gorgeous Chinese teenager Tye (Sari Chang) and they dance together. However the Chinese street gang led by Tsu Shin (Joey Chin) chases him, but he is saved by the Italian gang led by his older brother Alberto \"Alby\" (James Russo). Meanwhile Tsu Shin decides to blow-up a Chinese restaurant in Little Italy with two other gang members against the will of Yung Gan (Russell Wong), who is Tye's brother and real leader of the gang. His action provokes the wrath of Mr. Gung Tu (James Hong), who is the lord of the Chinese mafia. On the other side, Alby, his right arm and friend Mercury (David Caruso) and their gang decide to go to Chinatown in reprisal to the Chinese attack and the Italian mobster Enrico Perito (Robert Miano) warns them to respect the boundary of their neighborhood since there is a mafia agreement of the leaders. However Tony and Tye fall in love with each other and keep secretly seeing each other in the middles of the conflict between gangs with tragic consequences.<br><br>\"China Girl\" is probably one of the most commercial work of Abel Ferrara. Nevertheless it is a great film supported by magnificent direction and top-notch performances. The story of love and ethnic prejudice in tow close communities in New York City, Little Italy and Chinatown, slightly recalls the storyline of \"Romeo and Juliet\" and is closer indeed to the \"West Side Story\". Richard Panebianco and the gorgeous Sari Chang stopped their careers in the middle 90's despite their great performances. Last but not the least, thirty years after its release, \"China Girl\" has not aged and is still worthwhile watching. My vote is eight.<br><br>Title (Brazil): \"Inimigos Pelo Destino\" (\"Enemies by Destiny\")","user":"claudio_carvalho","rank":[7,8]}]
