They even have some kind of Ryan Gosling lookalike in the poster. Awful stuff. Do yourself a favour and watch Irreversible if you want an excellent French movie.","user":"Jeff_Saps","rank":[9,13]},{"title":"Its rating was 2.8 and went up to 3.4 !!!","rating":1,"date":"15 October 2019","review":"I think that says it all ....\nI'm actually here, writing this , because i was intrigued to see what kind of film would get such a low rating like this I've does ?\nHmm....And ....
